winter fodder for he goat clear the ground digging a field shift stone make a wall of stone by the autumn he have build a house for himself a hut of turf sound and strong and warm storm could not shake it and nothing could burn it down here be a home he could go inside and shut the door and stay there could stand outside on the door-slab the owner of that house if any should pass by there be two room in the hut for himself at the one end and for he beast at the other farthest in against the wall of rock be the hayloft everything be there two more lapp come by father and son they stand rest with both hand on they long stave take stock of the hut and the clearing note the sound of the goat-bell up on the hillside _ goddag _ say the lapp and here 's fine folk come to live lapp talk that way with flattering word you do not know of any woman hereabouts to help say isak think always of but one thing woman to help no but we 'll say a word of it ay if you would be so good that i have a house and a bit of ground here and goat but no woman to help say that oh he have seek about for a woman to help each time he have be down to the village with he load of bark but there be none to be find they would look at he a widow or a old unmarried one or so but all afraid to offer whatever might be in they mind isak could not tell why could not tell why who would go as help to live with a man in the wild ever so many mile away -- a whole day 's journey to the nearest neighbor and the man himself be no way charming or pleasant by he look far from it and when he speak it be no tenor with eye to heaven but a coarse voice something like a beast 's well he would have to manage alone in winter he make great wooden trough and sell they in the village carry sack of food and tool back through the snow hard day when he be tie to a load there be the goat and none to look to they he could not be away for long and what do he do need make he wise he brain be strong and little used he train it up to ever more and more he first way be to let the goat loose before start off himself so that they could get a full feed among the undergrowth in the wood but he find another plan he take a bucket a great vessel and hang it up by the river so that a single drop fall in at a time take fourteen hour to fill it when it be full to the brim the weight be right the bucket sink and in do so pull a line connect with the hayloft a trap-door open and three bundle of fodder come through -- the goat be feed that be he way a bright idea a inspiration maybe send from god the man have none to help he but himself it serve he need until late in the autumn then come the first snow then rain then snow again snow all the time and he machine go wrong the bucket be fill from above open the trap too soon he fix a cover over and all go well again for a time then come winter the drop of water freeze to a icicle and stop the machine for good the goat must do as they master -- learn to do without hard time -- the man have need of help and there be none yet still he find a way he work and work at he home he make a window in the hut with two pane of real glass and that be a bright and wonderful day in he life no need of lighting fire to see he could sit indoors and work at he wooden trough by daylight better day brighter day eyah he read no book but he thought be often with god it be natural come of simplicity and awe the star in the sky the wind in the tree the solitude and the wide-spreading snow the might of earth and over earth fill he many time a day with a deep earnestness he be a sinner and fear god on sunday he wash himself out of reverence for the holy day but work none the less as through the week spring come he work on he patch of ground and plant potato he livestock multiply the two she-goat have each have twin make seven in all about the place he make a bigger shed for they ready for further increase and put a couple of glass pane in there too ay 'twa lighter and brighter now in every way and then at last come help the woman he need she tack about for a long time this way and that across the hillside before venture near it be evening before she could bring herself to come down and then she come -- a big brown-eyed girl full-built and coarse with good heavy hand and rough hide brogue on she foot as if she have be a lapp and a calfskin bag sling from she shoulder not altogether young speak politely somewhere near thirty there be nothing to fear but she give he greet and say hastily : i be go cross the hill and take this way that be all ho say the man he could barely take she meaning for she speak in a slovenly way also she keep she face turn aside ay say she ` tis a long way to come ay it be that say the man cross the hill you say yes and what for i have my people there eh so you have you people there and what be you name inger and what be yours isak isak h be d'you live here yourself maybe ay here such as it be why ` tis none so bad say she to please he now he have grow something clever to think out the way of thing and it strike he then she would come for that very business and no other have start out two day back just to come here maybe she have hear of he want a woman to help go inside a bit and rest you foot say he they go into the hut and take a bit of the food she have bring and some of he goat ' milk to drink then they make coffee that she have bring with she in a bladder settle down comfortably over they coffee until bedtime and in the night he lay want she and she be willing she do not go away next morning all that day she do not go but help about the place milk the goat and scour pot and thing with fine sand and get they clean she do not go away at all inger be she name and isak be he name and now it be another life for the solitary man true this wife of he have a curious slovenly way of speech and always turn she face aside by reason of a hare-lip that she have but that be no matter save that she mouth be disfigure she would hardly have come to he at all he might well be grateful for that she be mark with a hare-lip and as to that he himself be no beauty isak with the iron beard and rugged body a grim and surly figure of a man ay as a man see through a flaw in the window-pane he look be not a gentle one as if barabba might break loose at any minute it be a wonder inger herself do not run away she do not run away when he have be out and come home again there be inger at the hut the two be one the woman and the hut it be another mouth for he to feed but no loss in that he have more freedom now and could go and stay as he need and there be matter to be look to away from home there be the river pleasant to look at and deep and swift besides a river not to be despise it must come from some big water up in the hill he get himself some fishing gear and go explore in the evening he come back with a basket of trout and char this be a great thing to inger and a marvel she be overwhelm be no way use to fine dish she clap she hand and cry out : why wherever and she be not slow to see how he be please at she surprise and proud of it for she say more in the same strain -- oh she have never see the like and how have he ever manage to find such thing inger be a blessing too in other way no clever head nor great in wit maybe -- but she have two lambing ewe with some of she kinsfolk and bring they down it be the best they could have wish for at the hut sheep with wool and lamb four new head to they stock about the place it be grow get bigger a wonder and a marvel how they stock be grow and inger bring more clothes and little trifle of she own a looking-glass and a string of pretty glass bead a spinning-wheel and carding-comb why if she go on that gait the hut would soon be fill from floor to roof and no room for more isak be astonish in he turn at all this wealth of goods but be a silent man and slow to speak he say nothing only shamble out to the door-slab and look at the weather and shamble in again ay he have be lucky indeed he feel himself more and more in love or draw towards she or whatever it might be you have no call to fetch along all such stuff say he ti more than 's need i have more if i like to fetch it and there be uncle sivert besides -- you have hear of he no why he be a rich man and district treasurer besides love make a fool of the wise isak feel he must do something grand himself and overdo it what i be go to say you have no need to bother with hoe potato i 'll do it myself the evening when i come home and he take he ax and go off to the wood she hear he fell in the wood not so far off she could hear from the crash that he be fell big timber she listen for a while and then go out to the potato field and set to work hoe love make fool wise isak come home in the evening haul a huge trunk by a rope oh that simple and innocent isak he make all the noise he could with he tree-trunk and cough and hem all for she to come out and wonder at he and sure enough : why you be out of you sens say inger when she come out be that work for a man single-handed he make no answer would not have say a word for anything to do a little more than be work for a man single-handed be nothing to speak of -- nothing at all a stick of timber -- huh and what be you go to do with it she ask oh we 'll see he answer carelessly as if scarcely heed she be there but when he see that she have hoe the potato after all he be not pleased it be as if she have do almost as much as he and that be not to he liking he slip the rope from the tree-trunk and go off with it once more what have not you do yet no say he gruffly and he come back with another stick like the last only with no noise nor sign of be out of breath haul it up to the hut like a ox and leave it there that summer he fell a mass of timber and bring it to the hut chapter ii inger pack up some food one day in she calfskin bag i would think of go across to see my people just how they be fare ay say isak i must have a bit of talk with they about thing isak do not go out at once to see she off but wait quite a while and when at last he shamble out look never the least bit anxious never the least bit miserable and full of fear inger be all but vanish already through the fringe of the forest hem he clear he throat and call will you be come back maybe he have not mean to ask she that but come back why what be in you mind of course i 'll be come back h be so he be leave alone again -- eyah well with he strength and the love of work that be in he he could not idle in and out about the hut do nothing he set to clear timber felling straight good stick and cut they flat on two side he work at this all through the day then he milk the goat and go to bed sadly bare and empty now in the hut a heavy silence cling about the peat wall and the earthen floor a deep and solemn loneliness spinning-wheel and carding-comb be in they place the bead too be safe as they have be stow away in a bag under the roof inger have take nothing of she belongings but isak unthinkably simple as he be grow afraid of the dark in the light summer night and see shape and thing steal past the window he get up before dawn about two o'clock by the light and eat he breakfast a mighty dish of porridge to last the day and save the waste of time in cooking more in the evening he turn up new ground to make a bigger field for the potato three day he work with spade and ax by turn inger should be come on the next ` twould be but reasonable to have a platter of fish for she when she come -- but the straight road to the water lay by the way she would come and it might seem so he go a longer way a new way over the hill where he have never be before gray rock and brown and strewed about with bit of heavy stone heavy as copper or lead there might be many thing in those heavy stone gold or silver like as not -- he have no knowledge of such thing and do not care he come to the water the fly be up and the fish be bite well that night he bring home a basket of fish that inger would open she eye to see go back in the morning by the way he have come he pick up a couple of the heavy little stone among the hill they be brown with speck of dark blue here and there and wondrous heavy in the hand inger have not come and do not come this be the fourth day he milk the goat as he have use to do when he live alone with they and have no other to help then he go up to a quarry near by and carry down stone great pile of carefully choose block and flake to build a wall he be busy with no end of thing on the fifth evening he turn in to rest with a little fear at he heart -- but there be the carding-comb and spinning-wheel and the string of bead sadly empty and bare in the hut and never a sound the hour be long and when at last he do hear something like a sound of footstep outside he tell himself that it be fancy nothing more eyah _ herregud _ -lrb- footnote : literally lord god the word be frequently use as here in a sense of resignation as it be a sigh -rrb- he murmur desolate in spirit and isak be not one to use word lightly there be the tramp of foot again outside and a moment after something glide past the window something with horn something alive he spring up over to the door and lo a vision god or the devil mutter isak who do not use word lightly he see a cow inger and a cow vanish into the shed if he have not stand there himself and hear it -- inger talk softly to the cow in the shed -- he would not have believe but there he stand and all at once a black misgiving come into he mind : a clever wife ay a manager of wonder -- but after all no it be too much and that be the only word for it a spinning-wheel and carding-comb at a pinch even the bead perhaps though they be over fine to be come by in any way proper and natural but a cow pick up stray on the road maybe or in a field -- it would be miss in no time and have to be find inger step out of the shed and say with a proud little laugh : it be only I i have bring my cow along h be say isak it be that make I so long -- i could not go but softly with she over the hill and so you have bring a cow say he yes say she all ready to burst with greatness and riches on earth do not you believe I perhaps isak fear the worst but make no sign and only say : come inside and get something to eat do you see she be not she a pretty cow ay a fine cow say isak and speaking as carelessly as he could he ask where d'you get she she name 's goldenhorn what be that wall to be for you have be build up here you 'll work yourself to death you will oh come and look at the cow now will not you they go out to look and isak be in he underclothes but that be no matter they look and look the cow all over carefully in every part and note all the marking head and shoulder buttock and thigh where it be red and white and how it stand how old d'you think she might be ask isak cautiously think why she be just exactly a tiny way on in she fourth year i bring she up myself and they all say it be the sweetest calf they would ever see but will there be feed enough here d'you think isak begin to believe as he be only too willing to do that all be well as for the feed why there 'll be feed enough never fear then they go indoors to eat and drink and make a evening together they lay awake talk of cow of the great event and be not she a dear cow too she second 's on the way and she name 's goldenhorn be you asleep isak no and what do you think she know I again know I at once and follow I like a lamb we lay up in the hill a bit last night ho but she 'll have to be tie up through the summer all the same or she 'll be run off a cow 's a cow where 's she be before ask isak at last why with my people where she belong and they be quite sorry to lose she i can tell you and the little one cry when i take she away could she be make it all up and come out with it so pat no it be not thinkable it must be true the cow be hers ho they be get well-to-do with this hut of theirs this farm of theirs why 'twa good enough for any one ay they would as good as all they could wish for already oh that inger he love she and she love he again they be frugal folk they live in primitive wise and lack for nothing let 's go to sleep and they go to sleep and waken in the morning to another day with thing to look at matter to see to once again ay toil and pleasure up and downs the way of life as for instance with those timber baulk -- should he try to fit they up together isak have keep he eye about he down in the village with that very thing in mind and see how it be do he could build with timber himself why not moreover it be a call upon he it must be do have not they a farm with sheep a farm with a cow already goat that be many already and would be more -- they live stock alone be crowd they out of the turf hut something must be do and best get on with it at once while the potato be still in flower and before the haytime begin inger would have to lend a hand here and there isak wake in the night and get up inger sleep fine and sound after she long tramp and out he go to the cowsh now it must not be think that he talk to cow in any obsequious and disgustful flattery no he pat she decently and look she over once more in every part to see if there should by chance be any sign any mark of she belong to strange owner no mark no sign and isak steal away relieve there lie the timber he fall to roll the baulk then lift they set they up against the wall in a framework one big frame for a parlor and a smaller one -- there must be a room to sleep in it be heavy work hard-breathing work and he mind be set on it he forget the time there come a smoke from the roof-hole of the hut and inger step out and call to breakfast and what be you busy with now ask inger you be early about say isak and that be all ho that isak with he secret and he lordly way but it please he maybe to have she asking and wonder and curious about he doings he eat a bit and sit for a while in the hut before go out again what could he be wait for h be say he at last get up this will not do can not sit here idle today work to be do seem like you be build say inger what and he answer condescendingly this great man who go about build with timber all by himself he answer : why you can see as much i take it yes yes of course building -- why there be no help for it as i can see here 's you come bring a whole cow to the farm -- that mean a cowshed i suppose poor inger not so eternally wise as he as isak that lord of creation and this be before she learn to know he and reckon with he way of put thing say inger : why it be never a cowsh you be build surely ho say he but you do not mean it i -- i think you would be build a house first think so say isak put up a face as if he would never in life have think of that himself why yes and put the beast in the hut isak think for a bit ay maybe ` twould be best so there say inger all glad and triumphant you see i be some good after all ay that be true and what would you say to a house with two room in _ two _ room oh why ` twould be just like other folk do you think we could they do isak he go about build notch he baulk and fitting up he framework also he manage a hearth and fireplace of pick stone though this last be troublesome and isak himself be not always please with he work haytime come and he be force to climb down from he building and go about the hillside far and near cut grass and bear home the hay in mighty load then one rainy day he must go down to the village what you want in the village well i can not say exactly as yet he set off and stay away two day and come back with a cooking-stove -- a barge of a man surge up through the forest with a whole iron stove on he back ` tis more than a man can do say inger you 'll kill yourself that gait but isak pull down the stone hearth that do not look so well in the new house and set up the cooking-stove in its place ` tis not every one have a cooking-stove say inger of all the wonder how we be get on haymaking still isak bring in load and mass of hay for woodland grass be not the same as meadow grass more 's the pity but poorer by far it be only on rainy day now that he could spare time for he building 'twa a lengthy business and even by August when all the hay be in safely store under the shelter of the rock the new house be still but half-way do then by September : this will not do say isak you would better run down to the village and get a man to help inger have be something poorly of late and do not run much now but all the same she get herself ready to go but isak have change he mind again have put on he lordly manner again and say he would manage by himself no call to bother with other folk say he i can manage it alone ` tis more than one man 's work say inger you 'll wear yourself out just help I to hoist these up say isak and that be all October come and inger have to give up this be a hard blow for the roof-beam must be get up at any cost and the place cover in before the autumn rain there be not a day to be lose what could be wrong with inger not go to be ill she would make cheese now and then from the goat ' milk but beyond that she do little save shift goldenhorn a dozen time a day where she graze bring up a good-sized basket or a box she have say next time you be down to the village what d'you want that for ask isak i 'll just be want it say inger isak haul up the roof-beam on a rope inger guide they with one hand it seem a help just to have she about bit by bit the work go on there be no great height to the roof but the timber be huge and heavy for a little house the weather keep fine more or less inger get the potato in by herself and isak have the roofing do before the rain come on in earnest the goat be bring in of a night into the hut and all sleep there together they manage somehow they manage everyway and do not grumble isak be get ready for another journey down to the village say inger very humbly : do you think perhaps you could bring up a good-sized basket or a box i have order some glass window say isak and a couple of paint door i 'll have to fetch they up say he in he lordly way ay well then it be no great matter about the basket what do you want with a basket what be it for what be it for oh have not you eye in you head isak go off deep in think two day later he come back with a window and a door for the parlor and a door for the bedroom also he have hang round he neck in front a good-sized packing-case and full of provision to boot you 'll carry yourself to death one day say inger ho indeed isak be very far indeed from be dead he take out a bottle of medicine from he pocket -- naphtha it be -- and give it to inger with order to take it regularly and get well again and there be the window and the paint door that he could fairly boast of he set to work at once fitting they in oh such little door and secondhand at that but paint up all neat and fine again in red and white 'twas almost as good as have picture on the wall and now they move into the new building and the animal have the turf hut to themselves only a lambing ewe be leave with cow lest she should feel lonely they have do well these builder in the waste : ay 'twa a wonder and a marvel to themselves chapter ii isak work on the land until the frost act in there be stone and root to be dig up and clear away and the meadow to be level ready for next year when the ground harden he leave he field work and become a woodman felling and cut up great quantity of log what do you want with all these log inger would say oh they 'll be useful some way say isak off-handedly as though he have no plan but isak have a plan never fear here be virgin forest a dense growth right close up to the house a barrier hedging in he field where he want room moreover there must be some way of get the log down to the village that winter there be folk enough would be glad of wood for firing it be sound enough and isak be in no doubt he stick to he work in the forest felling tree and cut they up into log inger come out often to watch he at work he take no notice but make as if she coming be no matter and not at all a thing he wish for she to do but she understand all the same that it please he to have she there they have a strange way too of speak to each other at time could not you find thing to do but come out here and get stark frozen say isak i be well enough for I say inger but i can not see there be any live sense in you work yourself to death like you do ho you just pick up that coat of mine there and put it on you put on you coat likely indeed i have no time to sit here now with goldenhorn ready to calve and all h be calve you say as if you do not know but what do you think now about that same calf let it stay and be wean maybe do as you think ` tis none of my business with calf and thing well ` twould be a pity to eat up calf seem to I and leave we with but one cow on the place do not seem to I like you would do that anyway say isak that be they way lonely folk ugly to look at and overfull of growth but a blessing for each other for the beast and for the earth and goldenhorn calve a great day in the wilderness a joy and a delight they give she flour-wash and isak himself see to it there be no stint of flour though he have carry it all the way himself on he back and there lay a pretty calf a beauty red-flanked like she mother and comically bewildered at the miracle of come into the world in a couple of year she would be have calf of she own ` twill be a grand fine cow when she grow up say inger and what be we to call she now i can not think inger be childish in she way and no clever wit for anything call she say isak why silverhorn of course what else the first snow come as soon as there be a passable road isak set out for the village full of concealment and mystery as ever when inger ask he errand and sure enough he come back this time with a new and unthinkable surprise a horse and sledge nothing less here 's foolishness say inger and you have not steal it i suppose steal it well find it then now if only he could have say : ` tis my horse -- we horse but to tell the truth he have only hire it after all hire horse and sledge to cart he log isak drive down with he load of firewood and bring back food herring and flour and one day he come up with a young bull on the sledge buy it for next to nothing by reason they be get short of fodder down in the village shaggy and thin no way a beauty but decently build for all that and want no more than proper feed to set it right and with a cow they have already what 'll you be bring up next say inger isak bring up a host of thing bring up plank and a saw he have get in exchange for timber a grindstone a wafer iron tool -- all in exchange for he log inger be burst with riches and say each time : what more thing when we have cattle and all a body could think of they have enough to meet they need for no little time to come and be well-to-do folk what be isak to start on again next spring he have think it all out tramp down beside he load of wood that winter he would clear more ground over the hillside and level it off cut up more log to dry through the summer and take down double load when the snow come fit for sledge it work out beautifully but there be another matter isak have think of time out of number : that goldenhorn where have she come from whose have she be there be never a wife on earth like inger ho a wild thing she be that let he do as he please with she and be glad of it but -- suppose one day they be to come for the cow and take it away -- and worse maybe to come after what be it inger herself have say about the horse : you have not steal it i suppose or find it that be she first think yes that be what she have say who could say if she be to be trust -- what should he do he have think of it all many a time and here he have bring up a mate himself for the cow -- for a steal cow maybe and there be the horse he would have to return again a pity -- for 'twa a little friendly beast and grow fond of they already never mind say inger comfortingly why you have do wonder already ay but just now with the spring come on -- and i have need of a horse next morning he drive off quietly with the last load and be away two day come back on foot the third day he stop as he near the house and stand listen there be a curious noise inside a child cry -- eyah _ herregud _ well there it be but a terrible strange thing and inger have never say a word he step inside and there first thing of all be the packing-case -- the famous packing-case that he have carry home slung round he neck in front there it be hang up by a string at each end from the ceiling a cradle and a bedplace for the child inger be up potter about half-dressed -- she have milk the cow and the goat as it might have be just a ordinary day the child stop cry you be through with it already say isak ay i be through with it now h be it come the first evening you be go h be i would only to get my thing off and hang up the cradle there but it be too much for I like and i have to lie down why do not you tell I before why i could not say to a minute when it would be ` tis a boy ho a boy and i can not for the life of I think what we be to call he say inger isak peep at the little red face well shape it be and no hare-lip and a growth of hair all thick on the head a fine little fellow for he rank and

look at the beast and at the shed all fine as could be and clean as could not be cleaner trust inger for look after creature every way say oline isak put a question : goldenhorn be at you place before ay from a calf not my place though at my son 's but ` tis all the same and we have she mother still isak have not hear better news a long while it be a burden lighter goldenhorn be he and inger 's by honest right to tell the truth he have half thought of get rid of he trouble in a sorry way to kill off the cow that autumn scrape the hide bury the horn and thus make away with all trace of cow goldenhorn in this life no need for that now and he grow mightily proud of inger all at once ay inger say he she be one to manage thing that be true there be not she like nor equal to be find 'twas a poor place here till i get a woman of my own as you might say why ` tis but natural so say oline and so this woman from across the hill a soft-spoken creature with she wit about she and by name oline she stay with they a couple of day and have the little room to sleep in and when she set out for home she have a bundle of wool that inger have give she from the sheep there be no call to hide that bundle of wool but oline take care that isak should not see it then the child and isak and he wife again the same world again and the work of the day with many little joy and big goldenhorn be yield well the goat have drop they kid and be yield well inger have a row of red and white cheese already store away to get ripe it be she plan to save up cheese till there be enough to buy a loom oh that inger she know how to weave and isak build a shed -- he too have a plan of he own no doubt he set up a new wing build out from the side of the turf hut with double panelling board make a doorway in it and a neat little window with four pane lay on a roof of outer board and make do with that till the ground thaw and he could get turf all that be useful and necessary no flooring no smooth-planed wall but isak have fix up a box partition as for a horse and a manger it be near the end of may the sun have thaw the high ground isak roof in he shed with turf and it be finish then one morning he eat a meal to last for the day take some more food with he shoulder pick and spade and go down to the village bring up three yard of cotton print if you can inger call after he what do you want with that say isak isak be long away it almost seem as if he have go for good inger look at the weather every day note the way of the wind as if she be expect a sailing-ship she go out at nighttime to listen even think of take the child on she arm and go after he then at last he come back with a horse and cart _ piro _ shout isak as he draw up shout so as to be hear and the horse be well behave and stand as quiet as could be nod at the turf hut as if it know the place again nevertheless isak must call out hi come and hold the horse a bit can not you out go inger where be it now oh isak have you hire he again where have you be all this time ` tis six day go where d'you think i would be have to go all sort of way round to find a road for this cart of mine hold the horse a bit can not you cart of yours you do not mean to say you have buy that cart isak dumb isak swell with thing unspoken he lift out a plough and a harrow he have bring nail provision a grindstone a sack of corn and how 's the child he ask child 's all right have you buy that cart that be what i want to know for here have i be longing and longing for a loom say she jestingly in she gladness at have he back again isak dumb once more for a long space busy with he own affair ponder look round for a place to put all he goods and implement it be hard to find room for they all but when inger give up ask and begin talk to the horse instead he come out of he lofty silence at last ever see a farm _ without _ a horse and cart and plough and harrow and all the rest of it and since you want to know why i have buy that horse and cart and all that be in it say he and inger could only shake she head and murmur : well i never do see such a man isak be no longer littleness and humility he have pay as it be like a gentleman for goldenhorn here you be he could say i have bring along a horse we can call it quit he stand there upright and agile against he wont shift the plough once more pick it up and carry it with one hand and stand it up against the wall oh he could manage a estate he take up the other thing : the harrow the grindstone a new fork he have buy all the costly agricultural implement treasure of the new home a grand array all requisite appliance -- nothing be lack h be as for that loom why we 'll manage that too i dare say as long as i have my health and there be you cotton print they would none but blue so i take that there be no end to the thing he bring a bottomless well rich in all manner of thing like a city store say inger : i wish oline could have see all this when she be here just like a woman sheer senseless vanity -- as if that matter isak sniff contemptuously though perhaps he himself would not have be displeased if oline have be there to see the child be cry go in and look after the boy say isak i 'll look to the horse he take out the horse and lead it into the stable : ay here be isak put he horse into the stable feed it and stroke it and treat it tenderly and how much be owe now on that horse and cart -- everything the whole sum a mighty debt but it should all be pay that summer never fear he have stack of cordwood to pay with and some building bark from last year 's cut not to speak of heavy timber there be time enough but later on when the pride and glory have cool off a little there be bitter hour of fear and anxiety all depend on the summer and the crop how the year turn out the day now be occupy in field work and more field work he clear new bit of ground get out root and stone plough manure harrowing work with pick and spade break lump of soil and crumble they with hand and heel a tiller of the ground always lay out field like velvet carpet he wait a couple of day longer -- there be a look of rain about -- and then he sow he corn for generation back into forget time he father before he have sow corn solemnly on a still calm evening best with a gentle fall of warm and misty rain soon after the gray goose flight potato be a new thing nothing mystic nothing religious woman and child could plant they -- earth-apple that come from foreign part like coffee fine rich food but much like swede and mangold corn be nothing less than bread corn or no corn mean life or death isak walk barehead in jesu name a sower like a tree-stump with hand to look at but in he heart like a child every cast be make with care in a spirit of kindly resignation look the tiny grain that be to take life and grow shoot up into ear and give more corn again so it be throughout all the earth where corn be sown palestine america the valley of norway itself -- a great wide world and here be isak a tiny speck in the midst of it all a sower little shower of corn fling out fanwise from he hand a kindly clouded sky with a promise of the faintest little misty rain chapter iv it be the slack time between the season but the woman oline do not come isak be free of the soil now he have two scythe and two rake ready for the haymaking he make long bottom board for the cart for get in the hay and procure a couple of runner and some suitable wood to make a sledge for the winter many useful thing he do even to shelf he set up a pair of shelf inside the house as a excellent place to keep various thing such as a almanac -- he have buy one at last -- and ladle and vessel not in use inger think a deal of those two shelf inger be easily pleased she think a great deal of everything there be goldenhorn for instance no fear of she run away now with the calf and bull to play with she run about in the wood all day long the goat too be thrive they heavy udder almost drag on the ground inger make a long robe of blue cotton print and a little cap of the same stuff as pretty as could be -- and that be for the christen the boy himself watch she at work many a time a bless wonder of a boy he be and if she be so bent on call he eleseus why isak suppose she must have she way when the robe be finish it have a long train to it nigh on a yard and a half of cotton print and every inch of it money spend but what of that -- the child be they first-born what about those bead of yours say isak if as they be ever to be use at all oh but inger have think of they already those bead of hers trust a mother for that inger say nothing and be very proud the bead be none so many they would not make a necklace for the boy but they would look pretty stitch on the front of he cap and there they should be but oline do not come if it have not be for the cattle they could have go off all three of they and come back a few day later with the child properly christen and if it have not be for that matter of get wed inger might have go by herself if we put off the wedding business for a bit say isak but inger be loth to put it off it would be ten or twelve year at least before eleseus be old enough to stay behind and look to the milk while they go no isak must use he brain to find a way the whole thing have come about somehow without they know maybe the wedding business be just as important as the christen -- how should he know the weather look like drought -- a thoroughly wicked drought if the rain do not come before long they crop would be burn up but all be in the hand of god isak make ready to go down to the village and find some one to come up all those mile again and all that fuss just to be wed and christen ay outlying folk have many trouble great and small at last oline do come and now they be wed and christen everything decently in order they have remember to have the wedding first so the child could be christen as of a wed pair but the drought keep on and the tiny cornfield be parch those velvet carpet parch -- and why 'twa all in the hand of god isak mow he bit of meadow there be little grass on they for all he have manure they well that spring he mow and mow on the hillside farther and farther out mow and turn and cart home load of hay as if he would never tire -- for he have a horse already and a well-stocked farm but by mid-july he have to cut the corn for green fodder there be no help for it and now all depend on the potato crop what be that about potato be they just a thing from foreign part like coffee a luxury a extra oh the potato be a lordly fruit drought or downpour it grow and grow all the same it laugh at the weather and will stand anything only deal kindly with it and it yield fifteen-fold again not the blood of a grape but the flesh of a chestnut to be boil or roasted use in every way a man may lack corn to make bread but give he potato and he will not starve roast they in the ember and there be supper boil they in water and there be a breakfast ready as for meat it be little be need beside potato can be serve with what you please a dish of milk a herring be enough the rich eat they with butter poor folk manage with a tiny pinch of salt isak could make a feast of they on sunday with a mess of cream from goldenhorn ' milk poor despise potato -- a bless thing but now -- thing look black even for the potato crop isak look at the sky unnumbered time in the day and the sky be blue many a evening it look as if a shower be come isak would go in and say like as not we 'll be get that rain after all and a couple of hour later all would be as hopeless as before the drought have last seven week now and the heat be serious the potato stand all the time in flower flowering marvellously unnaturally the cornfield look from a distance as if under snow where be it all to end the almanac say nothing -- almanac nowadays be not what they use to be a almanac now be no good at all now it look like rain again and isak go in to inger : we 'll have rain this night god willing be it look that way ay and the horse be shiver a bit like they will inger glance towards the door and say ay you see ` twill come right enough a few drop fall hour pass they have they supper and when isak go out in the night to look the sky be blue well well say inger anyway ` twill give the last bit of lichen another day to dry say she to comfort he all she could isak have be get lichen as much as he could and have a fine lot all of the best it be good fodder and he treat it as he would hay cover it over with bark in the wood there be only a little still leave out and now when inger speak of it he answer despairingly as if it be all one i 'll not take it in if it be dry isak you do not mean it say inger and next day sure enough he do not take it in he leave it out and never touch it just as he have say let it stay where it be there would be no rain anyway let it stay where it be in god 's name he could take it in some time before christmas if so be as the sun have not burn it all up to nothing isak be deeply and thoroughly offend it be no longer a pleasure and a delight to sit outside on the door-slab and look out over he land and be the owner of it all there be the potato field flowering madly and dry up let the lichen stay where it be -- what do he care that isak who could say perhaps he have a bit of a sly little thought in he mind for all he stolid simpleness maybe he know what he be do after all try to tempt the blue sky now at the change of the moon that evening it look like rain once more you ought to have get that lichen in say inger what for say isak look all surprised ay you with you nonsense -- but it might be rain after all there 'll be no rain this year you can see for yourself but for all that it grow curiously dark in the night they could see through the glass window that it be darker -- ay and as if something beat against the pane something wet whatever it might be inger wake up ` tis rain look at the window-pane but isak only sniff rain -- not a bit of it do not know what you be talk about ah it be no good pretending say inger isak be pretend -- ay that be it rain it be sure enough and a good heavy shower -- but as soon as it have rain enough to spoil isak 's lichen it stop the sky be blue what do i say say isak stiff-necked and hard the shower make no difference to the potato crop and day come and go the sky be blue isak set to work on he timber sledge work hard at it and bow he heart and plane away humbly at runner and shaft eyah _ herregud _ ay the day come and go and the child grow inger churn and make cheese there be no serious danger folk that have they wit about they and could work need not die for the sake of one bad year moreover after nine week there come a regular blessing of rain rain all one day and night and sixteen hour of it pour as hard as it could if it have come but two week back isak would have say it be too late now as it be he say to inger you see that 'll save some of the potato ay say inger hopefully it 'll save the lot you 'll see and now thing be look better rain every day good thorough shower everything look green again as by a miracle the potato be flowering still worse than before and with big berry grow out at the top which be not as it should be but none could say what might be at the root -- isak have not venture to look then one day inger go out and find over a score of little potato under one plant and they have five week more to grow in say inger oh that inger always try to comfort and speak hopefully through she hare-lip it be not pretty to hear when she speak for a sort of hiss like steam from a leaky valve but a comfort all the same out in the wild and a happy and cheerful soul she be at all time i wish you could manage to make another bed she say to isak one day ho say he why there be no hurry but still they start get in the potato and finish by michaelma as the custom be it be a middling year -- a good year once again it be see that potato do not care so much about the weather but grow up all the same and could stand a deal a middling year -- a good year well not perhaps if they work it out exactly but that they could not do this year a lapp have pass that way one day and say how fine they potato be up there it be much worse he say down in the village and now isak have a few week more to work the ground before the frost set in the cattle be out grazing where they please it be good to work with they about and hear the bell though it do take some of he time now and again there be the bull mischievous beast would take to but at the lichen stack and as for the goat they be high and low and everywhere even to the roof of the hut trouble great and small one day isak hear a sudden shout inger stand on the door-slab with the child in she arm point over to the bull and the pretty little cow silverhorn -- they be make love isak throw down he pick and race over to the pair but it be too late by the look of it the mischief be do oh the little rascal she be all too young -- half a year too soon a child isak get she into the hut but it be too late well well say inger ` tis none so bad after all in a way if she would wait we would have have both of they bear at the same time oh that inger not so bright as some maybe yet for all that she may well have know what she be about when she let the pair loose together that morning winter come inger carding and spin isak drive down with load of wood fine dry wood and good go all he debt pay off and settle horse and cart plough and harrow he very own he drive down with inger 's goat ' milk cheese and bring back woollen thread a loom shuttle and beam and all bring back flour and provision more plank and board and nail one day he bring home a lamp as true as i be here i will not believe it say inger but she have long have in she mind about a lamp for all that they light it the same evening and be in paradise little eleseus he think no doubt it be the sun look how he stare all wonder like say isak and now inger could spin of a evening by lamplight he bring up linen for shirt and new hide shoe for inger she have ask for some dye-stuff too for the wool and he bring they then one day he come back with a clock with what -- a clock this be too much for inger she be overwhelm and could not say a word isak hang it up on the wall and set it at a guess wound it up and let it strike the child turn its eye at the sound and then look at its mother ay you may wonder say inger and take the child to she not a little touch herself of all good thing here in a lonely place there be nothing could be better than a clock to go all the dark winter through and strike so prettily at the hour when the last load be cart down isak turn woodman once more felling and stack build he street he town of wood-pile for next winter he be get farther and farther from the homestead now there be a great broad stretch of hillside all ready for tillage he would not cut close any more but simply throw the biggest tree with dry top he know well enough of course what inger have be think of when she ask for another bed best to hurry up and get it ready one dark evening he come home from the wood and sure enough inger have get it over -- another boy -- and be lie down that inger only that very morning she have try to get he to go down to the village again : ` tis time the horse have something to do say she eat he head off all day i have no time for such-like nonsense say isak shortly and go out now he understand she have want to get he out of the way and why surely 'twa as well to have he about the house why can not you ever tell a man what be come say he you make a bed for yourself and sleep in the little room say inger as for that it be not only a bedstead to make there must be bedclothes to spread they have but one skin rug and there would be no get another till next autumn when there be wether to kill -- and even then two skin would not make a blanket isak have a hard time with cold at night for a while he try bury himself in the hay under the rock-shelter try to bed down for himself with the cow isak be homeless well for he that it be may soon June would be in July a wonderful deal they have manage out there in the wilderness house for themselves and housing for the cattle and ground clear and cultivate all in three year isak be build again -- what be he build now a new shed a lean-to jut out from the house the whole place ring with the noise as he hammer in he eight-inch nail inger come out now and again and say it be try for the little one ay the little one -- go in and talk to they then sing a bit eleseus he can have a bucket lid to hammer on himself and it be only while i be do these big nail just here at the cross-beam that be get to bear the whole only plank after that two-and-a-half-inch nail as gentle as build doll ' house small wonder if isak hammer and thump there stand a barrel of herring and the flour and all kind of food-stuff in the stable better than lie out in the open maybe but the pork taste of it already a shed they must have and that be clear as for the little one they would get use to the noise in no time eleseus be incline to be ail somehow but the other take nourishment sturdily like a fat cherub and when he be not cry he sleep a wonder of a child isak make no objection to he be call sivert though he himself would rather have prefer jacob inger could hit on the right thing at time eleseus be name after the priest of she parish and that be a fine name to be sure but sivert be call after he mother 's uncle the district treasurer who be a well-to-do man with neither wife nor child to come after he they could not do better than name the boy after he then come spring and the new season 's work all be down in the earth before whitsun when there have be only eleseus to look after inger could never find time to help she husband be tie to she first-born now with two child in the house it be different she help in the field and manage a deal of odd work here and there plant potato sowing carrot and turnip a wife like that be none so easy to find and she have she loom besides at all odd minute she would slip into the little room and weave a couple of spool make half-wool stuff for underclothes for the winter then when she have dye she wool it be red and blue dress material for herself and the little one at last she put in several color and make a bedspread for isak all by herself no fancy work from inger 's loom useful and necessary thing and sound all through oh they be do famously these settler in the wild they have get on so far and if this year 's crop turn out well they would be enviable folk no less what be lack on the place at all a hayloft perhaps a big barn with a threshing-floor inside -- but that might come in time ay it would come never fear only give then time and now pretty silverhorn have calve the sheep have lamb the goat have kid the young stock fairly swarm about the place and what of the little household itself eleseus could walk already walk by himself wherever he please and little sivert be christen inger by all sign and token make ready for another turn she be not what you would call niggardly at bear another child -- oh a mere nothing to inger though to be sure she be proud enough of they when they come fine little creature as any one could see 'twa not all by a long way that the lord have bless with such fine big child inger be young and make the most of it she be no beauty and have suffer all she girlhood by reason of the same be set aside and look down on the young man never notice she though she could dance and work as well they find nothing sweet in she and turn elsewhere but now she time have come she be in full flower and constantly with child isak himself she lord and master be earnest and stolid as ever but he have get on well and be content how he have manage to live till inger come be a mystery feed no doubt on potato and goat ' milk or maybe venturesome dish without a name now he have all that a man could think of in he place in the world there come another drought a new bad year os-ander the lapp come by with he dog bring news that folk in the village have cut they corn already for fodder ` tis a poor look out say inger when it come to that ay but they have the herr a fine haul ` tis say you uncle sivert he be go to build a country house why he be none so badly off before that be true and like to be the same with you for all it seem why as to that thank god we have enough for we little need what do they say at home about I up here os-ander wag he head helplessly there be no end to the great thing they say more than he can tell a pleasant-spoken fellow like all the lapp if as you would care for a dish of milk now you have only to say so say inger ` tis more than 's worth you while but if you have a sup for the dog here milk for os-ander and food for the dog os-ander lift he head suddenly at a kind of music inside the house what be that ` tis only we clock say inger it strike the hour that way inger burst with pride the lapp wag he head again : house and cattle and all manner of thing there be nothing a man could think of but you have that thing ay we have much to be thankful for ` tis true i forget to say there be oline be ask after you oline how be it with she she be none so poorly where will you husband be now he 'll be at work in the field somewhere they say he be not buy yet say the lapp carelessly buy who say so why ` tis what they say but who be he to buy from ` tis common land ay ` tis so and sweat of he brow to every spade of it why they say ` tis the state own all the land inger could make nothing of this ay maybe so be it oline say so i do not well remember say the lapp and he shifty eye look all way around inger wonder why he do not beg for anything os-ander always beg as do all the lapp os-ander sit scrape at the bowl of he clay pipe and and light up what a pipe he puff and draw at it till he wrinkled old face look like a wizard 's rune no need to ask if the little one there be yours say he flattering again they be as like you as could be the living image of yourself when you be small now inger be a monster and a deformity to look at 'twa all wrong of course but she swell with pride for all that even a lapp can gladden a mother 's heart if it be not that you sack there be so full i would find you something to put in it say inger nay ` tis more than 's worth you while inger go inside with the child on she arm eleseus stay outside with the lapp the two make friend at once the child see something curious in the sack something soft and fluffy and want to pat it the dog stand alert bark and whine inger come out with a parcel of food she give a cry and drop down on the door-slab what be that you have get there what be it ti nothing only a hare i see it 'twa the boy want to look dog run it down this morning and kill it and i bring it along here 's you food say inger chapter v one bad year never come alone isak have grow patient and take what fall to he lot the corn be parch and the hay be poor but the potato look like pull through once more -- bad enough all thing together but not the worst isak have still a season 's yield of cordwood and timber to sell in the village and the herr fishery have be rich all round the coast so there be plenty of money to buy wood indeed it almost look like a providence that the corn harvest have fail -- for how could he have thresh it without a barn and threshing-floor call it providence there be no harm in that sometimes there be other thing not so easily put out of mind what be it a certain lapp have say to inger that summer -- something about not have buy buy what should he buy for the ground be there the forest be there he have clear and till build up a homestead in the midst of a natural wilderness win bread for himself and he ask nothing of any man but work and work alone he have often think himself of ask the lensmand -lrb- footnote : sheriff 's officer in charge of a small district -rrb- about the matter when he go down to the village but have always put it off the lensmand be not a pleasant man to deal with so people say and isak be not one to talk much what could he say if he go -- what have he come for one day that winter the lensmand himself come drive up to the place there be a man with he and a lot of papers in a bag geissler himself the lensmand no less he look at the broad open hillside clear of timber smooth and unbroken under the snow he think perhaps that it be all tilled land already for he say : why this be a whole big farm you have get you do not expect to get all this for nothing there it be isak be terror-stricken and say not a word you ought to have come to I at first and buy the land say geissler ay the lensmand talk of valuation of boundary tax tax to the state and when he have explain the matter a little isak begin to see that there be something reasonable in it after all the lensmand turn to he companion teasingly now then you call yourself a surveyor what be the extent of cultivate ground here he do not wait for the other to reply but note down himself at a guess then he ask isak about the crop how much hay how many bushel of potato and then about boundary they could not go round the place mark out waist-deep in snow and in summer no one could get up there at all what do isak think himself about the extent of woodland and pasturage -- isak have no idea at all he have always think of the place as be he own as far as he could see the lensmand say that the state require definite boundary and the greater the extent the more you will have to pay ay and they will not give you all you think you can swallow they 'll let you have what be reasonable for you need ay inger bring in some milk for the visitor they drink it and she bring in some more the lensmand a surly fellow he stroke eleseus ' hair and look at something the child be play with play with stone what let I see h be heavy look like some kind of ore there be plenty such up in the hill say isak the lensmand come back to business south and west from here 's what you want most i suppose shall we say a couple of furlong to the southward two furlong exclaim he assistant _ you _ could not till two hundred yard say he chief shortly what will that cost ask isak can not say it all depend but i 'll put it as low as i can on my report it be mile away from anywhere and difficult to get at but two furlong say the assistant again the lensmand enter duly two furlong to the southward and ask : what about the hill how much do you want that way i 'll need all up as far as the water there be a big water up there say isak the lensmand note that and how far north why it be no great matter that way ` tis but moorland most and little timber the lensmand fix the northward boundary at one furlong east that be no great matter either ` tis bare field all from here into sweden the lensmand note down again he make a rapid calculation and say : it 'll make a good-sized place even at that anywhere near the village of course it would be worth a lot of money nobody could have buy it i 'll send in a report and say a hundred _ daler _ would be fair what do you think he ask he assistant it be give it away say the other a hundred _ daler _ say inger isak you have no call to take so big a place no -- o say isak the assistant put in hurriedly : that be just what i say it be mile too big for you as it be what will you do with it cultivate it say the lensmand he have be sit there write and work in he head with the child cry every now and then he do not want to have the whole thing to do again as it be he would not be home till late that night perhaps not before morning he thrust the papers into the bag the matter be settle put the horse in he say to he companion and turn to isak : as a matter of fact they ought to give you the place for nothing and pay you into the bargain the way you have work i 'll say as much when i send in the report then we 'll see how much the state will ask for the title-deed isak -- it be hard to say how he feel about it half as if he be not ill-pleased after all to find he land value at a big price after the work he have do as for the hundred _ daler _ he could manage to pay that off no doubt in course of time he make no further business about it he could go on work as he have do hitherto clear and cultivate fetch load of timber from the untended woodland isak be not a man to look about anxiously for what might come he work inger thank the lensmand and hope he would put in a word for they with the state yes yes but i have no say in the matter myself all i have to do be to say what i have see and what i think how old be the youngest there six month as near as can be boy or girl boy the lensmand be no tyrant but shallow and not overconscientious he ignore he assistant brede olsen who by virtue of he office should be a expert in such affair the matter be settle out of hand by guesswork yet for isak and he wife it be a serious matter enough -- ay and for who should come after they maybe for generation but he set it all down as it please he make a document of it on the spot withal a kindly man he take a bright coin from he pocket and give it to little sivert then he nod to the other and go out to the sledge suddenly he ask : what do you call the place call it yes what be its name we must have a name for it no one have ever think of that before inger and isak look at each other sellanraa say the lensmand he must have invent it out of he own head maybe it be not a name at all but he only nod and say again sellanraa and drive off settle again at a guess anything would do the name the price the boundary some week later when isak be down in the village he hear rumor of some business about lensmand geissler there have be a inquiry about some money he could not account for and the matter have be report to he superior well such thing do happen some folk be content to stumble through life anyhow till they run up against those that walk then one day isak go down with a load of wood and come back who should drive with he on he sledge but lensmand geissler he step out from the tree on to the road wave he hand and simply say : take I along will you they drive for a while neither speak once the passenger take a flask from he pocket and drink offer it to isak who decline i be afraid this journey will upset my stomach say the lensmand he begin at once to talk about isak 's deal in land i send off the report at once with a strong recommendation on my own account sellanraa 's a nice name as a matter of fact they ought to let you have the place for nothing would not do to say so of course if i have they would only have take offence and put they own price on it i suggest fifty _ daler _ ho fifty you say not a hundred the lensmand pucker he brow and think a moment as far as i recollect it be fifty yes and where will you be go now ask isak over to vesterbotten to my wife 's people ` tis none so easy that way at this time of year i 'll manage could not you go with I a bit ay you sha not go alone they come to the farm and the lensmand stay the night sleep in the little room in the morning he bring out he flask again and remark : i be sure this journey 's go to upset my stomach for the rest he be much the same as last time kindly decisive but fussy and little concerned about he own affair possibly it might not be so bad after all isak venture to point out that the hillside be not all under cultivation yet but only some small square here and there the lensmand take the information in a curious fashion i know that well enough of course last time i be here when i make out the report but brede the fellow who be with I he do not see it brede he be no earthly good but they work it out by table with all the ground as i enter it and only so few load of hay so few bushel of potato they 'll say at once that it must be poor soil cheap soil you understand i do my best for you and you take my word for it that 'll do the trick it be two and thirty thousand fellow of you stamp the country want the lensmand nod and turn to inger how old 's the youngest he be just three-quarter of a year and a boy be he yes but you must see and get that business settle as soon as ever you can say he to isak again there be another man want to purchase now midway between here and the village and as soon as he do this 'll be worth more you buy now get the place first and let the price go up after -- that way you 'll be get some return for all the work you have put into it it be you that start cultivate here at all 'twa all wilderness before they be grateful for he advice and ask if it be not he himself that would arrange the matter he answer that he have do all he could everything now depend on the state i be go across to vesterbotten now and i sha not be come back he tell they straightforwardly he give inger a _ ort _ and that be overmuch you can take a bit of meat down to my people in the village next time you be kill say he my wife 'll pay you take a cheese or so too any time you can the child like it isak go with he up over the hill it be firm good go on the higher ground easier than below isak receive a whole _ daler _ in that manner be it lensmand geissler leave the place and he do not come back no great loss folk say he be look on as a doubtful personage a adventurer not that he have not the knowledge he be a learn man and have study this and that but he live too freely and spend other people 's money it come out later that he have leave the place after a sharp reprimand from he superior amtmand pleym but nothing be do about he family officially and they go on live there a good while after -- he wife and three child and it be not long before the money unaccounted for be send from sweden so that geissler 's wife and child could not be say to be hold as hostage but stay on simply because it please they isak and inger have no cause to complain of geissler 's dealings with they not by a long way and there be no say what sort of man he successor would be -- perhaps they would have to go over the whole business again the amtmand -lrb- footnote : governor of a country -rrb- send one of he clerk up to the village to be the new lensmand he be a man about forty son of a local magistrate by name heyerdahl he have lack the means to go to the university and enter the service that way instead he have be constrain to sit in a office write at a desk for fifteen year he be unmarried have never be able to afford a wife he chief amtmand pleym have inherit he from he predecessor and pay he the same miserable wage that have be give before heyerdahl take it and go on write at he desk as before isak pluck up he courage and go to see he document in the sellanraa case here they be just return from the department they want to know all sort of thing -- the whole business be in a dreadful muddle as geissler leave it say the official the department wish to be inform as to whether any considerable crop of marketable berry be to be reckon with on the estate whether there be any heavy timber whether possibly there may be ore or metal of value a the hill adjoining mention be make of water but nothing state as to any fishery in the same this geissler appear to have furnish certain information but he be not to be trust and here have i to go through the whole affair again after he i shall have to come up to sellanraa and make a thorough inspection and valuation how many mile be it up there the department of course require that adequate boundary be draw : yes we shall have to beat the bound in due order ` tis no light business set up boundary this time of year say isak not till later on in the summer anyhow it 'll have to be do the department can not wait all through the summer for a answer i 'll come up myself as soon as i can get away i shall have to be out that way in any case there be another plot of land a man 's inquire about will that be he that be go to buy up between I and the village can not say i be sure very likely as a matter of fact it be a man from the office here my assistant in the office he be here in geissler 's time ask geissler about it i understand but geissler put he off say he could not cultivate a hundred yard of land so he send in a application to the amtmand and i be instruct to see the matter through more of geissler 's muddle lensmand heyerdahl come up to the farm and bring with he he assistant brede they have get thoroughly wet cross the moor and wetter still they be before they would finish tramp the boundary line through melting snow and slush up and down the hill the lensmand set to work zealously the first day but on the second he have have enough and contented himself with stand still for the most part point and shout direction there be no further talk about prospect for ore in the adjoining hill and as for marketable berry -- they would have a look at the moor on the way back he say the department request information on quite a number of point -- there be table for all sort of thing no doubt the only thing that seem reasonable be the question of timber certainly there be some heavy timber and that within the limit of isak 's propose holding but not enough to reckon with for sale no more than would be require to keep up the place even if there have be timber in plenty who be to carry it all the many mile to where it could be sell only isak trundle like a tub-wheel through the forest in winter-time cart some few heavy stick down to the village to bring back plank and board for he building geissler the incomprehensible have it seem send in a report which be not easily upset here be he successor go through the whole thing again try to find mistake and blatant inaccuracy -- but all in vain it be noticeable that he consult he assistant at every turn and pay heed to what he say which be not geissler 's way at all that same assistant moreover must presumably have alter he own opinion since he be now a would-be purchaser himself of land from the common ground hold by the state what about the price ask the lensmand fifty _ daler _ be the most they can fairly ask of any buyer answer the expert lensmand heyerdahl draw up he report in elegant phrasing geissler have write : the man will also have to pay land tax every year he can not afford to pay more for the place than fifty _ daler _ in annual instalment over ten year the state can accept he offer or take away he land and the fruit of he work heyerdahl write : he now humbly beg to submit this application to the department : that he be allow to retain this land upon which albeit without right of possession he have up to this present effect considerable improvement for a purchase price of 50 -- fifty -- _ speciedaler _ the amount to be pay in annual instalment as may seem fit to the department to apportion the same lensmand heyerdahl promise isak to do he best i hope to succeed in procure you possession of the estate he say chapter vi the big bull be to be send away it have grow to a enormous beast and cost too much to feed isak be take it down to the village to bring up a suitable yearling in exchange it be inger 's idea and inger have no doubt she own reason for get isak out of the place on that particular day if you be go at all you would better go today she say the bull 's in fine condition ` twill fetch a good price at this time of year you take he down to the village and they 'll send he to be sell in town -- townsfolk pay anything for they meat ay say isak if only the beast do not make trouble on the way down isak make no answer but he be be out and about now this last week and get use to thing isak be silent he take a big knife hang it in a sheath at he waist and lead out the bull a mighty beast it be glossy-coated and terrible to look at sway at the buttock as it walk a trifle short in the leg when it run it crush down the undergrowth with its chest it be like a railway engine its neck be huge almost to deformity there be the strength of a elephant in that neck if only he do not get mad with you say inger isak think for a moment why if as he take it that way i 'll just have to slaughter he half-way and carry down the meat inger sit down on the door-slab she be in pain she face be aflame she have keep she foot till isak be go now he and the bull be out of sight and she could give way to a groan without fear little eleseus can talk a little already he ask : mama hurt -- yes hurt he mimic she press he hand to he side and groan little sivert be asleep inger take eleseus inside the house give he some thing to play with on the floor and get into bed herself she time be come she be perfectly conscious all the while keep a eye on eleseus glance at the clock on the wall to see the time never a cry hardly a movement the struggle be in she vitals -- a burden be loosen and glide from she almost at the same moment she hear a strange cry in the bed a bless little voice poor thing poor little thing and now she can not rest but lift herself up and look down what be it she face be gray and blank in a moment without expression or intelligence a groan be hear unnatural impossible -- a choke gasp she slip back on the bed a minute pass she can not rest the little cry down there in the bed grow louder she raise herself once more and see -- o god the direst of all no mercy no hope -- and this a girl isak could not have go more than a couple of mile or so it be hardly a hour since he have leave in less than ten minute inger have bear she child and kill it isak come back on the third day lead a half-starved yearling bull the beast could hardly walk it have be a long business get up to the place at all how do you get on ask inger she herself be ill and miserable enough isak have manage very well true the big bull have be mad the last two mile or so and he have to tie it up and fetch help from the village then when he get back it have break loose and take a deal of time to find but he have manage somehow and have sell for a good price to a trader in the village buy up for butcher in the town and here be the new one say isak let the child come and look any addition to the live stock be a great event inger look at the bull and feel it over ask what it have cost little sivert be allow to sit on its back i shall miss the big one though say inger so glossy and fine he be i do hope they 'll kill he nicely it be the busy season now and there be work enough the animal be let loose in the empty shed be case and bin of potato leave to grow isak sow more corn this year than last and do all he could to get it nicely down he make bed for carrot and turnip and inger sow the seed all go on as before inger go about for some time with a bag of hay under she dress to hide any change in she figure take out a little from time to time and finally discard the bag altogether at last one day isak notice something and ask in surprise : why how 's this have not anything happen i think no not this time ho why what be wrong 'twa mean to be so i suppose isak how long d'you think it 'll take you to work over all this land of ours yes but you mean you have you trouble -- do not go as it should ay that be it -- yes but yourself -- you be not hurt anyway after it no isak i have be think we ought to have a pig isak be not quick to change the subject that way he be silent a little then at last he say : ay a pig i have think of that myself each spring but we 'll need to have more potato first and more of the small and a bit of corn beside we have not enough to feed a pig we 'll see how this year turn out but it would be nice to have a pig ay day pass rain come field and meadow be look well -- oh the year will turn out well never fear little happening and big all in they turn : food sleep and work sunday with wash of face and comb of hair and isak sit about in a new red shirt of inger 's weave and sew then a event a happen of note in the ordinary round : a sheep roam with she lamb get catch in a cleft among the rock the other come home in the evening inger at once see there be two missing and out go isak in search isak 's first thought be to be thankful it be Sunday so he be not call away from he work and lose time he tramp off -- there be a endless range of ground to be search and meanwhile the house be all anxiety mother hush the child with brief word there be two sheep miss and they must be good all share the feeling what have happen be a matter for the whole little community even the cow know that something unusual be go on and give tongue in they own fashion for inger go out every now and then call aloud towards the wood though it be near night it be a event in the wilderness a general misfortune now and again she give a long-drawn hail to isak but there be no answer he must be out of hearing where be the sheep -- what can have come to they be there a bear abroad or have the wolf come down over the hill from sweden and finland neither as it turn out isak find the ewe stick fast in a cleft of rock with a broken leg and lacerated udder it must have be there some time for despite its wound the poor thing have nibble the grass down to the root as far as it could reach isak lift the sheep and set it free it fall to grazing at once the lamb make for its mother and suck away -- a bless relief for the wound udder to be empty now isak gather stone and fill up the dangerous cleft a wicked place it shall break no more sheep 's thigh isak wear leather brace he take they off now and fasten they round the sheep 's middle as a support for the udder then lift the animal on he shoulder he set off home the lamb at he heel after that -- splint and tar bandage in a few day ' time the patient begin twitch the foot of the wounded leg it be the fracture ache as it grow together ay all thing get well again -- until next time something happen the daily round little matter that be all important to the settler-folk themselves oh they be not trifle after all but thing of fate make for they happiness and comfort and well-being or against they in the slack time between the season isak smooth down some new tree-trunk he have throw to be use for something or other no doubt also he dig out a number of useful stone and get they down to the house as soon as there be stone enough he build a wall of they a year or so back inger would have be curious wonder what she man be after with all this -- now she seem for the most part busy with she own work and ask no question inger be busy as ever but she have take to singing which be something new and she be teach eleseus a evening prayer this also be something new isak miss she question it be she curiosity and she praise of all he do that make he the contented man the incomparable man he be but now she go by say nothing or at most with a word or so that he be work himself to death she be trouble after that last time for all she say think isak to himself oline come over to visit they once more if all have be as before she would have be welcome but now it be different inger greet she from the first with some ill-will be it what it may there be something that make inger look on she as a enemy i would half a thought i would be come just at the right time again say oline with delicate meaning how d'you mean why for the third one to be christen how be it with you now nay say inger for that matter you might have save yourself the trouble ho oline fall to praise the child so fine and big they have grow and isak take over more ground and go to build again by the look of thing -- there be no end to thing with they a wonderful place and hard to find its like and what be he go to build this time ask he yourself say inger i do not know nay say oline ` tis no business of mine i just look along to see how thing be with you here it be a pleasure and delight for I to see as for goldenhorn i 'll not ask nor speak of she -- she be fall into proper way as any one can see they talk for a while companionably inger be no longer harsh the clock on the wall strike with its sweet little note oline look up with tear in she eye never in all she humble life do she hear such a thing -- ` tis like church and organ music say oline inger feel herself rich and generous-minded towards she poor relation and say : come into the next room and see my loom oline stay all day she talk to isak and praise all he doings and i hear you have buy up the land for mile on every side could not you have get it for nothing then there be none as i can see would take it from you isak have be feel the need of praise and be the better for it now feel a man again i be buy from the government say isak ay government but they have no call to be grasp in a deal surely what be you build now why i do not know nothing much anyway ay you be get on building and get on you be paint door to the house and a clock on the wall -- ` tis a new grand house you be build i suspect you with you foolish talk say isak but he be pleased all the same and say to inger : could not you make a bit of a dish of nice cream custard for one that come a-visiting that i can not say inger for i have churn all there be ` tis no foolish talk put in oline hurriedly i be but a simple woman ask to know and if it be not a new grand house why ` twill be a new big barn i dare say and why not with all these field and meadow land fine and full of growth ay and full of milk and honey as the bible say isak ask : how 's thing look you way -- crop and the like why ` tis there as it be till now if only the lord do not set fire to it all again this year and burn up the lot -- heaven forgive I i should say the word ` tis all in he hand and almighty power but we have nothing we part that be any way like this place of yours to compare and that be the solemn truth inger ask after other relative she uncle sivert in particular he be the great man of the family and own rich fishery ` tis almost a wonder how he can find a way to spend all he have the woman talk of uncle sivert and isak and he doings somehow drop out of sight no one ask any more about he building now so at last he say : well if you want to know ` tis a bit of a barn with a threshing-floor i be try to get set up just as i thought say oline folk with real sound sense in they head they do that way fore-thought and back-thought and all as it should be there be not a pot nor pitcher in the place you have not think of a threshing-floor you say isak be a child oline 's flattering word go to he head and he answer something foolishly with fine word : as to that new house of mine there must be a threshing-floor in the same necessarily ` tis my intention so a threshing-floor say oline wag she head and where 's the sense of grow corn on the place if we have nowhere to thresh it ay ` tis as i say not a thing as could be but you have it all there in you head inger be suddenly out of humor again the talk between the other two somehow displease she and she break in : cream custard indeed and where 's the cream to come from fish it up in the river maybe oline hasten to make peace inger lord bless you child do not speak of such a thing not a word of cream nor custard either -- a old creature like I that do but idle about from house to neighbor isak sit for a while then up and say suddenly : here be i do nothing middle of the day and stone to fetch and carry for that wall of mine ay a wall like that 'll need a mighty lot of stone to be sure stone say isak ti like as if there would never be enough when isak be go the two womenfolk get on nicely together for a while they sit for hour talk of this and that in the evening oline must go out and see how they live stock have grow : cow a bull two calf and a swarm of sheep and goat i do not know where it 'll ever end say oline with she eye turn heavenwards and oline stay the night next morning she go off again once more she have a bundle of something with she isak be work in the quarry and she go another way round so that he shall not see two hour later oline come back again step into the house and ask at once : where be isak inger be wash up oline should have pass by the quarry where isak be at work and the child with he inger at once guess something wrong isak what d'you want with he want with he -- why nothing only i do not see he to say good-bye silence oline sit down on a bench without be ask drop down as if she leg refuse to carry

and they have get in a grand lot of hay almost more than they can find room for some be stow away under overhang rock in the stable under the flooring of the house itself the shed at the side be empty of everything to make room for more hay inger herself work early and late a faithful helper and support isak take advantage of every fall of rain to put in a spell of roofing on the new barn and get the south wall at least fully do once that be ready they can stuff in as much hay as they please the work be go forward they will manage never fear and they great sorrow and disaster -- ay it be there the thing be do and what it bring must come good thing mostly leave no trace but something always come of evil isak take the matter sensibly from the first he make no great word about it but ask he wife simply : how do you come to do it inger make no answer to that and a little after he speak again : strangle it -- be that what you do yes say inger you should not have do that no she agree and i can not make out how you ever could bring yourself to do it she be all the same as myself say inger how d'you mean she mouth isak think over that for some time ay well say he and nothing more be say about it at the time the day go on peacefully as ever there be all the mass of hay to be get in and a rare heavy crop all round so that by degree the thing slip into the background of they mind but it hang over they and over the place none the less they could not hope that oline would keep the secret it be too much to expect and even if oline say nothing other would speak dumb witness would find a tongue the wall of the house the tree around the little grave in the wood os-ander the lapp would throw out hint inger herself would betray it sleep or wake they be prepare for the worst isak take the matter sensibly -- what else be there to do he know now why inger have always take care to be leave alone at every birth to be alone with she fear of how the child might be and face the danger with no one by three time she have do the same thing isak shake he head touch with pity for she ill fate -- poor inger he learn of the come of the lapp with the hare and acquit she it lead to a great love between they a wild love they draw closer to each other in they peril inger be full of a desperate sweetness towards he and the great heavy fellow lumber carrier of burden feel a greed and a endless desire for she in himself and inger for all that she wear hide shoe like a lapp be no withered little creature as the lapland woman be but splendidly big it be summer now and she go about barefoot with she naked leg show almost to the knee -- isak could not keep he eye from those bare leg all through the summer she go about singing bit of hymn and she teach eleseus to say prayer but there grow up in she a unchristian hate of all lapp and she speak plainly enough to any that pass some one might have send they again like as not they have a hare in they bag as before let they go on they way and no more about it a hare what hare ho you have not hear perhaps what os-ander he do that time no well i do not care who know it -- he come up here with a hare when i be with child dear and that be a dreadful thing and what happen never you mind what happen just get along with you that be all here be a bite of food and get along you do not happen to have a odd bit of leather anywhere i could mend my shoe with no i but i 'll give you a bit of stick if you do not get out now a lapp will beg as humbly as could be but say no to he and he turn bad and threaten a pair of lapp with two child come past the place the child be send up to the house to beg and come back and say there be no one to be see about the place the four of they stand there a while talk in they own tongue then the man go up to see he go inside and stay then he wife go up and the child after all of they stand inside the doorway talk lapp the man put he head in the doorway and peep through into the room no one there either the clock strike the hour and the whole family stand listen in wonder inger must have have some idea there be stranger about she come hurry down the hillside and see lapp strange lapp into the bargain ask they straight out what they be do there what do you want in here could not you see there be no one at home h be say the man get out with you say inger again and go on you way the lapp move out slowly unwillingly we be just listen to that clock of yours say the man ` tis a wonder to hear that it be you have not a bit of bread to spare say he wife where do you come from ask inger from the water over beyond we have be walk all night and where be you go to now across the hill inger make up some food for they when she come out with it the woman start beg again : a bit of stuff for a cap a tuft of wool a stump of cheese -- anything inger have no time to waste isak and the child be in the hayfield be off with you now she say the woman try flattery we see you place up here and the cattle -- a host of they like the star in the sky ay a wonder say the man you have not a pair of old shoe to give away to needy folk inger shut the door of the house and go back to she work on the hillside the man call after she -- she pretend not to hear and walk on unheed but she hear it well enough : you do not want to buy any hare maybe there be no mistake what he have say the lapp himself might have speak innocently enough some one have tell he perhaps or he might have mean it ill be that as it may inger take it as a warning -- a message of what be to come the day go on the settler be healthy folk what be to come would come they go about they work and wait they live close to each other like beast of the forest they sleep and eat already the year be so far advance that they have try the new potato and find they large and floury the blow that be to fall -- why do it not come it be late in August already soon it would be September be they to be spare through the winter they live in a constant watchfulness every night they creep close together in they cave thankful that the day have pass without event and so the time go on until one day in October when the lensmand come up with a man and a bag the law step in through they doorway the investigation take some time inger be call up and examine privately she deny nothing the grave in the wood be open and its contents remove the body be send for examination the little body -- it be dress in eleseus ' christen robe and a cap sewn over with bead isak seem to find speech again ay say he it be as bad as well can be with we now i have say before -- you ought never to have do it no say inger how do you do it inger make no answer that you could find it in you heart she be just the same as myself to look at and so i take and twist she face round isak shake he head slowly and then she be dead go on inger begin to cry isak be silent for a while well well ` tis too late to be cry over it now say he she have brown hair sob inger there at the back of she head and again no more be say time go on as before inger be not lock up the law be merciful lensmand heyerdahl ask she question just as he might have speak to any one and only say it be a great pity such thing should happen at all inger ask who have inform against she but the lensmand answer that it be no one in particular many have speak of the matter and he have hear of it from several quarter have she not herself say something about it to some lapp inger -- ay she have tell some lapp about os-ander how he come and bring a hare that summer and give she unborn child the hare-lip and be not it oline who have send the hare -- the lensmand know nothing about that but in any case he could not think of put down such ignorant superstition in he report but my mother see a hare just before i be bear say inger the barn be finish a great big place it be with hay-stall on both side and a threshing-floor in the middle the shed and the other makeshift place be empty now and all the hay bring into the barn the corn be reap dry in stack and cart in inger take up the carrot and turnip all they crop be in now and everything might have be well with they -- they have all they need isak have start on new ground again before the frost come to make a bigger cornfield isak be a tiller of the soil but in November inger say one day she would have be six month old now and know we all ` tis no good talking of that now say isak when the winter come isak thresh he corn on the new threshing-floor and inger help he often with a arm as quick to the work as he own while the child play in the haystall at the side it be fine plump grain early in the new year the road be good and isak start cart down he load of wood to the village he have he regular customer now and the summer-dried wood fetch a good price one day he and inger agree that they should take the fine bull-calf from goldenhorn and drive it down to fru geissler with a cheese into the bargain she be delighted and ask how much it cost nothing say isak the lensmand pay for it before heaven bless he and do he say fru geissler touch at the thought she send thing up for eleseus and sivert in return -- cake and picture-book and toy when isak come back and inger see the thing she turn away and cry what be it ask isak nothing answer inger only -- she would have be just a year now and able to see it all ay but you know how it be with she say isak for comfort 's sake and after all it may be we 'll get off easier than we think i have find out where geissler be now inger look up but how 's that go to help we i do not know then isak carry he corn to the mill and have it ground and bring back flour then he turn woodman again cut the wood to be ready for next winter he life be spend in this work and that accord to the season from the field to the wood and back to the field again he have work on the place for six year now and inger five all might have be well if it be only allow to last but it be not inger work at she loom and tend the animal also she be often to be hear singing hymn but it be a pitiful singing she be like a bell without a tongue as soon as the road be passable she be send for down to the village to be examine isak have to stay behind and be there all alone it come into he mind to go across to sweden and find out geissler the former lensmand have be kind to they and might perhaps still lend a help hand some way to the folk at sellanraa but when inger return she have ask about thing herself and learn something of what she sentence be likely to be strictly speak it be imprisonment for life paragraph i but after all she have stand up in the court itself and simply confess the two witness from the village have look pityingly at she and the judge have put he question kindly but for all that she be no match for the bright intellect of the law lawyer be great man to simple folk they can quote paragraph this and section that they have learn such thing by rote ready to bring out at any moment oh they be great man indeed and apart from all this knowledge they be not always devoid of sense sometimes even not altogether heartless inger have no cause to complain of the court she make no mention of the hare but when she tearfully explain that she could not be so cruel to she poor deform child as to let it live the magistrate nod quietly and seriously but say he think of yourself you have a hare-lip and it have not spoil you life no thanks be to god be all she say she could not tell they of all she have suffer in secret as a child as a young girl but the magistrate must have understand something of what it mean he himself have a club-foot and could not dance as to the sentence he say i hardly know really it should be imprisonment for life but i can not say perhaps we might get it commuted second or third degree fifteen to twelve year or twelve to nine there be a commission sit to reform the criminal code make it more humane but the final decision will not be ready yet anyhow we must hope for the best say he inger come back in a state of dull resignation they have not find it necessary to keep she in confinement meantime two month pass then one evening when isak come back from fish the lensmand and he new assistant have be to sellanraa inger be cheerful and welcome she husband kindly praise he catch though it be little he have bring home what i be go to say -- have any one be here he ask any one be why who should there be there be fresh footmark outside man with boot on why -- there be be no one but the lensmand and one other what do they want you know that without ask do they come to fetch you fetch I no 'twa only about the sentence the lord be kind ` tis not so bad as i fear ah say isak eagerly not so long maybe no only a few year how many year why you might think it a lot maybe but i be thankful to god all the same inger do not say how long it would be later that evening isak ask when they would be come to fetch she away but this she could not or would not tell she have grow thoughtful again and talk of what be to come how they would manage she could not think -- but she suppose they would have to get oline to come and isak have no better plan to offer what have become of oline by the way she have not be up this year as she use to do be she go to stay away for ever now that she have upset everything for they the work season pass but oline do not come -- do she expect they to go and fetch she she would come loitering up of herself no doubt the great lump of blubber the monster and at last one day she do extraordinary person -- it be as nothing whatever have occur to make ill-feeling between they she be even knit a pair of new stocking for eleseus she say just come up to see how you be get on over here say she and it turn out that she have bring she clothes and thing up in a sack and leave in the wood close by ready to stay that evening inger take she husband aside and say : do not you say something about seek out geissler ` tis in the slack time now ay say isak now that oline be come i can go off tomorrow morning first thing inger be grateful and thank he and take you money with you she say -- all you have in the place why can not you keep the money here no say she inger make up a big parcel of food at once and isak wake while it be yet night and get ready to start inger go out on the door-slab to see he off she do not cry or complain but only say : they may be come for I now any day you do not know when no i can not say and i do not suppose it will be just yet but anyhow if only you could get hold of geissler perhaps he might be able to say something what could geissler do to help they now nothing but isak go inger -- oh she know no doubt more than she have be willing to say it might be too that she herself have send for oline when isak come from sweden inger be go and oline be there with the two child it be dark news for a homecoming isak 's voice be louder than usual as he ask : be she go ay say oline what day be it the day after you leave and isak know now that inger have get he out of the way on purpose -- that be why she have persuade he to take the money with he oh but she might have keep a little for herself for that long journey but the child could think of nothing else but the little pig isak have bring with he it be all he have for he trouble the address he have be out of date and geissler be no longer in sweden but have return to norway and be now in trondhjem as for the pig isak have carry it in he arm all the way feed it with milk from a bottle and sleep with it on he breast among the hill he have be look forward to inger 's delight when she see it now eleseus and sivert play with it and it be a joy to they and isak watch they forget he trouble for the moment moreover oline have a message from the lensmand the state have at last give its decision in the matter of the land at sellanraa isak have only to go down to the office and pay the amount this be good news and serve to keep he from the worst depth of despair tired and worn out as he be he pack up some food in a bag and set off for the village at once maybe he have some little hope of see inger once again before she leave there but he be disappointed inger be go -- for eight year isak feel himself in a mist of darkness and emptiness hear only a word here and there of all the lensmand say -- a pity such thing should happen hope it might be a lesson to she reform and be a better woman after and not kill she child any more lensmand heyerdahl have marry the year before he wife have no intention of ever be a mother -- no child for she thank you and she have none and now say the lensmand this business about sellanraa at last i be in a position to settle it definitely the department be graciously pleased to approve the sale of the land more or less accord to the term i suggest h be say isak it have be a lengthy business but i have the satisfaction of know that my endeavor have not be altogether fruitless the term i propose have be agree to almost without exception without exception say isak and nod here be the title-deed you can have the transfer register at the first session ay say isak and how much be there to pay ten _ daler _ a year the department have make a slight alteration here -- ten _ daler _ per annum instead of five you have no objection to that i presume as long as i can manage to pay say isak and for ten year isak look up half frightened those be the term -- the department insist even then it be no price really for all that land clear and cultivate as it be now isak have the ten _ daler _ for that year -- it be the money he have get for he load of wood and for the cheese inger have lay by he pay the amount and have still a small sum leave it be a lucky thing for you the department do not get to hear about you wife say the lensmand or they might have sell to some one else ay say isak he ask about inger be it true that she be go away for eight year that be so and can not be alter -- the law must take its course as a matter of fact the sentence be extraordinarily light there be one thing you must do now -- that be to set up clear boundary between you land and the state 's a straight direct line follow the mark i set up on the spot and enter in my register at the time the timber clear from the boundary line become you property i will come up some time and have a look at what you have do isak trudge back to he home chapter viii time fly ay when a man be grow old isak be not old he have not lose he vigor the year seem long to he he work on he land and let he iron beard grow as it would now and again the monotony of the wilderness be break by the sight of a pass lapp or by something happen to one of the animal on the place then all would be as before once there come a number of man at once they rest at sellanraa and have some food and a dish of milk they ask isak and oline about the path across the hill they be mark out the telegraph line they say and once come geissler -- geissler himself and no other there he come free and easy as ever walk up from the village two man with he carry mining tool pick and spade oh that geissler unchanged the same as ever meet and greet as if nothing have happen talk to the child go into the house and come out again look over the ground open the door of cowsh and hayloft and look in excellent say he isak have you still get those bit of stone bit of stone say isak wonder little heavy lump of stone i see the boy playing with when i be here once before the stone be out in the larder serve as weight for so many mouse-trap isak bring they in geissler and the two man examine they talk together tap they here and there weigh they in the hand copper they say could you go up with we and show where you find they ask geissler they all go up together it be not far to the place where isak have find the stone but they stay up in the hill for a couple of day look for vein of metal and firing charge here and there they come down to sellanraa with two bag fill with heavy lump of stone isak have meanwhile have a talk with geissler and tell he everything as to he own position : about the purchase of the land which have come to a hundred _ daler _ instead of fifty that be a trifle say geissler easily you have thousand like as not on you part of the hill ho say isak but you would better get those title-deed enter in the register as soon as ever you can ay then the state can not come any nonsense about it after you understand isak understand ` tis worst about inger he say ay say geissler and remain thoughtful longer than be usual with he might get the case bring up again set out the whole thing properly very likely get the sentence reduce a bit or we could put in a application for a pardon and that would probably come to the same thing in the end why if as that could be do but it would not do to try for a pardon at once have to wait a bit what be i go to say you have be take thing down to my wife -- meat and cheese and thing -- what why as to that lensmand pay for all that before do i though and help we kindly in many a way not a bit of it say geissler shortly here -- take this and he take out some _ daler _ note geissler be not the man to take thing for nothing that be plain and he seem to have plenty of money about he from the way he pocket bulge heaven only know if he really have money or not but she write all 's well and get on say isak come back to he one think what -- oh you wife ay and since the girl be bear -- she 's have a girl child bear while she be there a fine little one excellent ay and now they be all as kind as can be and help she every way she say look here say geissler i be go to send these bit of stone in to some mining expert and find out what be in they if there be a decent percentage of copper you 'll be a rich man h be say isak and how long do you think before we could apply for a pardon well not so very long perhaps i 'll write the thing for you i 'll be back here again soon what be it you say -- you wife have have a child since she leave here yes then they take she away while she be expect it that be a thing they have no right to do ho anyhow it be one more reason for let she out earlier ay if that could be say isak gratefully isak know nothing of the many lengthy writings backward and forward between the different authority concern the woman who be expect a child the local authority have let she go free while the matter be pend for two reason : in the first place they have no lock-up in the village where they could keep she and in the second place they wish to be as lenient as possible the consequence be something they could not have foresee later when they have send to fetch she away no one have inquire about she condition and she herself have say nothing of it possibly she have conceal the matter on purpose in order to have a child with she during the year of imprisonment if she behave well she would no doubt be allow to see it now and again or perhaps she have be merely indifferent and have go off carelessly despite she state isak work and toil dig ditch and break new ground set up he boundary line between he land and the state 's and gain another season 's stock of timber but now that inger be no longer there to wonder at he doings he work more from habit than for any joy in what he do and he have let two session pass without have he title-deed register care little about it at last that autumn he have pull himself together and get it do thing be not as they should be with isak now quiet and patient as ever -- yes but now it be because he do not care he get out hide because it have to be do -- goatskin and calfskin -- steep they in the river lay they in bark and tan they after a fashion ready for shoe in the winter -- at the very first threshing -- he set aside he seed corn for the next spring in order to have it do best to have thing do and do with he be a methodical man but it be a gray and lonely life eyah _ herregud _ a man without a wife again and all the rest what pleasure be there now in sit at home sunday cleanly wash with a neat red shirt on when there be no one to be clean and neat for sunday be the longest day of all day when he be force to idleness and weary thought nothing to do but wander about over the place count up all that should have be do he always take the child with he always carry one on he arm it be a distraction to hear they chatter and answer they question of everything he keep old oline because there be no one else he could get and oline be after all of use in a way card and spin knit stocking and mitten and make cheese -- she could do all these thing but she lack inger 's happy touch and have no heart in she work nothing of all she handle be she own there be a thing isak have buy once at the village store a china pot with a dog 's head on the lid it be a sort of tobacco box really and stand on a shelf oline take off the lid and drop it on the floor inger have leave behind some cutting of fuchsia under glass oline take the glass off and put it back press it down hard and maliciously next day all the cutting be dead it be not so easy for isak to bear with such thing he look displeased and show it and as there be nothing swanlike and gentle about isak it may well be that he show it plainly oline care little for look soft-spoken as ever she only say : now could i help it that i can not say answer isak but you might have leave the thing alone i 'll not touch she flower again say oline but the flower be already dead again how could it be that the lapp come up to sellanraa so frequently of late os-ander for instance have no business there at all he should have pass on he way twice in one summer he come across the hill and os-ander it should be remember have no reindeer to look to but live by beg and quarter himself on other lapp as soon as he come up to the place oline leave she work and fall to chat with he about people in the village and when he leave he sack be heavy with no end of thing isak put up with it for two year say nothing then oline want new shoe again and he could be silent no longer it be in the autumn and oline wear shoe every day instead of go in wooden patten or rough hide look like be fine today say isak h be that be how he begin ay say oline those cheese eleseus go on isak again be not it ten you count on the shelf this morning ay say eleseus well there be but nine there now eleseus count again and think for a moment inside he little head then he say : yes but then os-ander have one to take away that make ten there be silence for quite a while after that then little sivert must try to count as well and say after he brother : that make ten silence again at last oline feel she must say something ay i do give he a tiny one that be true i do not think that could do any harm but they child they be no sooner able to talk than they show what be in they and who they take after 's more than i can think or guess for ` tis not you way isak that i do know the hint be too plain to pass unchecked the child be well enough say isak shortly but i would like to know what good os-ander have ever do to I and mine what good ay that be what i say what good os-ander ay since i be to give he cheese in return oline have have time to think and have she answer ready now well now i would not have think it of you isak that i would not be it I pray that first begin with os-ander i wish i may never move alive from this spot if i ever so much as speak he name brilliant success for oline isak have to give in as he have do many a time before but oline have more to say and if you mean i be to go here clean barefoot with the winter come on and all and never own the like of a pair of shoe why you 'll please to say so i say a word of it three and four week go that i need shoe but never sign of a shoe to this day and here i be say isak : what be wrong with you patten then that you can not use they what be wrong with they repeat oline all unprepared ay that be what i would like to know with my patten ay well and I card and spin and tend cattle and sheep and all look after child here -- have you nothing to say to that i would like to know that wife of yours that be in prison for she deed do you let she go barefoot in the snow she wear she patten say isak and for go to church and visit and the like why rough hide be good enough for she ay and all the finer for it no doubt ay that she be and when she do wear she hide shoe in summer she do but stuff a wisp of grass in they and never no more but you -- you must wear stocking in you shoe all the year round say oline : as for that i 'll wear out my patten in time no doubt i would no think there be any such haste to wear out good patten all at once she speak softly and gently but with half-closed eye the same sly oline as ever and as for inger say she the changele as we call she she go about with child of mine and learn both this and that for year she do and this be what we get for it because i have a daughter that live in bergen and wear a hat i suppose that be what inger must be go away south for go to trondhjem to buy a hat he he isak get up to leave the room but oline have open she heart now unlock the store of blackness within ay she give out ray of darkness do oline thank heaven none of she child have they face slit like a fire-breathing dragon so to speak but they be none the worse for that maybe no 'twa not every one be so quick and handy at get rid of the young they bear -- strangle they in a twinkling mind what you be say shout isak and to make he meaning perfectly clear he add : you curse old hag but oline be not go to mind what she be say not in the least he he she turn up she eye to heaven and hint that a hare-lip might be this or that but some folk seem to carry it too far he he isak may well have be glad to get safely out of the house at last and what could he do but get oline the shoe a tiller of earth in the wild no longer even something of a god that he could say to he servant go he be helpless without oline whatever she do or say she have nothing to fear and she know it the night be colder now with a full moon the marshland harden till they can almost bear but thaw again when the sun come out to a impassable swamp once more isak go down to the village one cold night to order shoe for oline he take a couple of cheese with he for fru geissler half-way down to the village a new settler have appear a well-to-do man no doubt since he have call in folk from the village to build he house and hire man to plough up a patch of sandy moorland for potato he himself do little or nothing the new man be brede olsen lensmand 's assistant a man to go to when the doctor have to be fetch or a pig to be kill he be not yet thirty but have four child to look after not to speak of he wife who be as good as a child herself oh brede be not so well off perhaps after all 'twa no great money he could earn run hither and thither on all odd business and collect tax from people that would not pay so now he be try a new venture on the soil he have raise a loan at the bank to start house in the wild breidablik he call the place and it be lensmand heyerdahl 's lady that have find that splendid name isak hurry past the house not waste time on look in but he can see through the window that all the child be up already early as it be isak have no time to lose if he be to be back as far as this on the homeward journey next night while the road be hard a man living in the wild have much to think of to reckon out and fit in as best can be it be not the busiest time for he just now but he be anxious about the child leave all alone with oline he think as he walk of the first time he have come that way time have pass the two last year have be long there have be much that be good at sellanraa and a deal that be not -- eyah _ herregud _ and now here be another man clearing ground in the wild isak know the place well it be one of the kindlier spot he have note himself on he way up but he have go on farther it be nearer the village certainly but the timber be not so good the ground be less hilly but a poorer soil easy to work on the surface but hard to deal with farther down that fellow brede would find it take more than a mere turn over of the soil to make a field that would bear and why have not he build out a shed from the end of the hayloft for cart and implement isak notice that a cart have be leave stand out in the yard uncover in the open he get through he business with the shoemaker and fru geissler have leave the place he sell he cheese to the man at the store in the evening he start out for home the frost be get harder now and it be good firm go but isak trudge heavily for all that who could say when geissler would be back now that he wife have go maybe he would not be come at all inger be far away and time be get on he do not look in at brede 's on the way back on the contrary he go a long way round keep away from the place he do not care to stop and talk to folk only trudge on brede 's cart be still out in the open -- do he mean to leave it there well ` tis he own affair isak himself have a cart of he own now and a shed to house it but none the happier for that he home be but half a thing it have be a home once but now only half a thing it be full day by the time he get within sight of he own place up on the hillside and it cheer he somewhat weary and exhaust as he be after forty-eight hour on the road the house and building there they stand smoke curl up from the chimney both the little one be out and come down to meet he as he appear he go into the house and find a couple of lapp sit down oline start up in surprise : what you back already she be make coffee on the stove coffee _ coffee _ isak have notice the same thing before when os-ander or any of the other lapp have be there oline make coffee in inger 's little pot for a long time after she do it while isak be out in the wood or in the field and when he come in unexpectedly and see it she say nothing but he know that he be the poorer by a cheese or a bundle of wool each time and it be to he credit that he do not pick up oline in he finger and crush she to piece for she meanness altogether isak be try hard indeed to make himself a better man better and better whatever may be he idea whether it be for the sake of peace in the house or in some hope that the lord may give he back he inger the sooner he be something give to superstition and a ponder upon thing even he rustic wariness be innocent in its way early that autumn he find the turf on the roof of the stable be begin to slip down inside isak chew at he beard for a while then smile like a man who understand a jest he lay some pole across to keep it up not a bitter word do he say and another thing : the shed where he keep he store of provision be simply build on high stone foot at the corner with nothing between after a while little bird begin to find they way in through the big gap in the wall and stay flutter about inside unable to get out oline complain that they pick at the food and spoil the meat and make a nasty mess about the place isak say : ay ` tis a pity small bird should come in and not be able to get out again and in the thick of a busy season he turn stonemason and fill up the gap in the wall heaven know what be in he mind that he take thing so whether maybe he fancy inger might be give back to he the sooner for he gentleness chapter ix the year pass by once more there come visitor to sellanraa a engineer with a foreman and a couple of workman mark out telegraph line again over the hill by the route they be take now the line would be carry a little above the house and a straight road cut through the forest no harm in that it would make the place less desolate a glimpse of the world would make it brighter this place say the engineer will be just about midway between two line through the valley on either side they 'll very likely ask you to take on the job of linesman for both ho say isak it will be twenty-five _ daler _ a year in you pocket h be say isak and what be i to do for that keep the line in repair mend the wire when necessary clear away forest growth on the route as it come up they 'll set up a little machine thing in the house here to hang on the wall that 'll tell you when you be wanted and when it do you must leave whatever you be do and go isak think it over i could do it all right in winter he say that be no good it would have to be for the whole year summer and winter alike can not be do say isak spring and summer and autumn i have my work on the land and no time for other thing the engineer look at he for quite a while and then put a astonishing question as follow : can you make more money that way make more money say isak can you earn more money in a day by work on the land than you could by work for we why as to that i can not say answer isak it be just this way you see -- ` tis the land i be here for i have many soul and more beast to keep alive -- and ` tis the land that keep we ` tis we living if you will not i can find some one else say the engineer but isak only seem rather relieve at the threat he do not like to disoblige the great man and try to explain ` tis this way he say i have a horse and five cow besides the bull i have twenty sheep and sixteen goat the beast they give we food and wool and hide we must give they food yes yes of course say the other shortly well and so i say how be i to feed they when i have to run away all time in the busy season to work on the telegraph line say no more about it say the engineer i 'll get the man down below you brede olsen he 'll be glad to take it he turn to he man with a brief word : now lad we 'll be get on now oline have hear from the way isak speak that he be stiff-necked and unreasonable in he mind and she would make the most of it what be that you say isak sixteen goat there be no more than fifteen say she isak look at she and oline look at he again straight in the face not sixteen goat say he no say she look helplessly towards the stranger as if to say how unreasonable he be ho say isak softly he draw a tuft of he beard between he tooth and stand chew it the engineer and he man go on they way now if isak have want to show he displeasure with oline and maybe thrash she for she doings here be he chance -- a heaven-sent chance to do that thing they be alone in the house the child have go after the man when they go isak stand there in the middle of the room and oline be sit by the stove isak clear he throat once or twice just to show that he be ready to say something if he please but he say nothing that be he strength of soul what do he not know the number of he goat as he know the finger on he hand -- be the woman mad could one of the beast be miss when he know every one of they personally and talk to they every day -- he goat that be sixteen in number oline must have trade away one of they the day before when the woman from breidablik have come up to look at the place h be say isak and this time word be on the very tip of he tongue what be it oline have do not exactly murder perhaps but something not far from it he could speak in deadly earnest of that sixteenth goat but he could not stand there for ever in the middle of the room say nothing h be he say ho so there be but fifteen goat there now you say that be all i make it answer oline gently but you would better count for yourself and see now be he time -- he could do it now : reach out with he hand and alter the shape of oline considerably with but one good grip he could do it he do not do it but say boldly make for the door : i 'll say no more just now and he go out as if plainly show that next time he would have proper word to say never fear eleseus he call out where be eleseus where be the child they father have something to ask they they be big fellow now with they eye about they he find they under the floor of the barn they have creep in as far as they could hide away invisibly but betray themselves by a anxious whisper out they creep now like two sinner the fact of the matter be that eleseus have find a stump of color pencil the engineer have leave behind and start to run after he and give it back but the big man with they long stride be already far up in the forest eleseus stop the idea occur to he that he might keep the pencil -- if only he could he hunt out little sivert so that they might at least be two to share the guilt and the pair of they have creep in under the floor with they find oh that stump of pencil -- it be a event in they life a wonder they find shaving and cover they all over with sign the pencil they discover make blue mark with one end and red with the other and they take it in turn to use when they father call out so loudly and insistently eleseus whisper : they have come back for the pencil all they joy be dash in a moment sweep out of they mind at a touch and they little heart begin beat and thump terribly the brother creep forth eleseus hold out the pencil at arm 's length here it be they have not break it only wish they have never see the thing no engineer be to be see they heart settle to a quieter beat it be heavenly to be rid of that dreadful tension there be a woman here yesterday say they father yes the woman from the place down below do you see she go yes have she a goat with she no say the boy a goat do not she have a goat with she when she leave no what goat isak wonder and wonder in the evening when the animal come home he count the goat once over -- there be sixteen he count they once more count they five time there be sixteen none miss isak breathe again but what do it all mean oline miserable creature could not she count as far as sixteen he ask she angrily : what be all this nonsense there _ be _ sixteen goat be there sixteen she ask innocently ay ay well then a nice one to count you be oline answer quietly in a injured tone since all the goat be there why then thank heaven you can not say oline 's be eat they up and well for she poor thing oline have take he in completely with she trickery he be content imagine all be well it do not occur to he for instance to count the sheep he do not trouble about further counting of the stock at all after all oline be not as bad as she might have be she keep house for he after a fashion and look to he cattle she be merely a fool and that be worst for herself let she stay let she live -- she be not worth trouble about but it be a gray and joyless thing to be isak as life be now year have pass grass have grow on the roof of the house even the roof of the barn which be some year younger be green the wild mouse native of the wood have long since find way into the storehouse tit and all manner of little bird swarm about the place there be more bird up on the hillside even the crow have come and most wonderful of all the summer before seagull have appear seagull come all the way up from the coast to settle on the field there in the wilderness isak 's farm be know far and wide to all wild creature and what of eleseus and little sivert when they see the gull oh 'twa some strange bird from ever so far away not so many of they just six white bird all exactly alike waddle this way and that about the field and pecking at the grass now and then father what have they come for ask the boy there be foul weather come out at sea say they father oh a grand and mysterious thing to see those gull and isak teach he son many other thing good and useful to know they be of a age to go to school but the school be many mile away down in the village out of reach isak have himself teach the boy they a b c on sunday but 'twa not for he not for this bear tiller of the soil to give they any manner of higher education the catechism and bible history lay quietly on the shelf with the cheese isak apparently think it better for man to grow up without book-knowledge from the way he deal with he boy they be a joy and a blessing to he the two many a time he think of the day when they have be tiny thing and they mother would not let he touch they because he hand be sticky with resin ho resin the cleanest thing in the world tar and goat ' milk and marrow for instance all excellent thing but resin clean gum from the fir -- not a word so the lad grow up in a paradise of dirt and ignorance but they be nice lad for all that when they be wash which happen now and again little sivert he be a splendid fellow though eleseus be something finer and deeper how do the gull know about the weather he ask they be weather-sick say he father but as for that they be no more so than the fly how it may be with fly i can not say if they get the gout or feel giddy or what but never hit out at a fly for ` twill only make he worse -- remember that boy the horsefly he be a different sort he die of himself turn up suddenly one day in summer and there he be then one day suddenly he be go and that be the end of he but how do he die ask eleseus the fat inside he stiffen and he lie there dead every day they learn something new jump down from high rock for instance to keep you tongue in you mouth and not get it between you tooth when they grow bigger and want to smell nice for go to church the thing be to rub oneself with a little tansy that grow on the hillside father be full of wisdom he teach the boy about stone about flint how that the white stone be harder than the gray but when he have find a flint he must also make tinder then he could strike fire with it he teach they about the moon how when you can grip in the hollow side with you left hand it be wax and grip in with the right it be on the wane remember that boy now and again isak would go too far and grow mysterious one Friday he declare that it be harder for a camel to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a human be to thread the eye of a needle another time tell they of the glory of the angel he explain that angel have star set in they heel instead of hob-nail good and simple teaching well fit for settler in the wild the schoolmaster in the village would have laugh at it all but isak 's boy find good use for it in they inner life they be train and teach for they own little world and what could be better in the autumn when animal be to be kill the lad be greatly curious and fearful and heavy at heart for the one that be to die there be isak hold with one hand and the other ready to strike oline stir the blood the old goat be lead out bearded and wise the boy stand peep round the corner filthy cold wind this time say eleseus and turn away to wipe he eye little sivert cry more openly could not help call out : oh poor old goat when the goat be kill isak come up to they and give they this lesson : never stand around say ` poor thing ' and be pitiful when thing be be kill it make they tough and harder to kill remember that so the year pass and now it be near spring again inger have write home to say she be well and be learn a lot of thing where she be she little girl be big and be call leopoldine after the day she be bear the 15th November she know all sort of thing and be a genius at hemstitch and

for he down in the village by the man at the store but once he have get it into he head it stay there he know it off by heart when he get home and now he sit down with great solemnity at the head of the table spread out the letter and read it aloud to the boy he be willing enough that oline also should see how easily he could read write but he do not speak so much as a word to she directly when he have finish he say : there now eleseus and you sivert ` tis you mother herself have write that letter and learn all these thing even that little tiny sister of yours she know more than all the rest of we here remember that the boy sit still wonder in silence ay ` tis a grand thing say oline and what do she mean by that be she doubt that inger tell the truth or have she she suspicion as to isak

and again out of my own money but coffee be a thing of dream and fairy tale for isak a rainbow oline be talk nonsense of course he be not angry with she no but slow of think as he be he call to mind at last she bartering with the lapp and he say bitterly : ay i 'll buy you coffee that i will a paper of coffee be it why not a pound a pound of coffee while you be about it no need to talk that way isak my brother nil he get coffee down at breidablik too they have coffee ay for they have no milk not a drop of milk on the place they have not that be as it may be but you that know such a lot and read write as pat as a cockroach run you ought to know that coffee 's a thing should be in everybody 's house you creature say isak at that oline sit down and be not to be silence as for that inger say she if so be i may dare to say such a word say what you will ` tis all one to I she 'll be come home and learn everything of sort and bead and feather in she hat maybe ay that may be ay say oline

all he word be check he sit there stare have he hear aright oline sit there look as if she have say nothing no in a battle of word isak be altogether lose he swing out of the house full of dark thought oline that beast that thrive in wickedness and grow fat on it -- why have he not wring she neck the first year so he think try to pull himself together he could have do it -- he could not he though no one better and then a ridiculous thing happen isak go into the shed and count the goat there they be with they kid the full number he count the cow the pig fourteen hen two calf i would all but forget the sheep he say to himself he count the sheep and pretend to be all anxiety lest there should be any miss there isak know very well that there be a sheep miss he have know that a long time why should he let it appear otherwise it be this way oline have trick he nicely once before say one of the goat be go though all the goat be there as they should be he have make a great fuss about it at the time but to no purpose it be always the same when he come into conflict with oline then in the autumn at slaughter time he have see at once that there be one ewe short but he have not find courage to call she to account for it at the time and he have not find that courage since but today he be stern isak be stern oline have make he thoroughly angry this time he count the sheep over again put he forefinger on each and count aloud -- oline may hear it if she like if she should happen to be outside and he say many hard thing about oline -- say they out loud how that she use a new method of she own in feed sheep a method that simply make they vanish -- here be a ewe simply vanish she be a thieving baggage nothing less and she may know it oh he would just have like oline to be stand outside and hear it and be thoroughly frighten for once he stride out from the shed go to the stable and count the horse from there he will go in -- will go into the house and speak he mind he walk so fast that he shirt stand out like a very angry shirt behind he but oline as like as not have notice something look out through the glass window she appear in the doorway quietly and steadily

tomorrow ay tomorrow morning 's the time three sheep lose and go and coffee do she say chapter x next day be fate to bring a great event there come a visitor to the farm -- geissler come it be not yet summer on the moor but geissler pay no heed to the state of the ground he come on foot in rich high boot with broad shiny top yellow glove too he wear and be elegant to see a man from the village carry he thing he have come as a matter of fact to buy a piece of isak 's land up in the hill -- a copper mine and what about the price also by the way he have a message from inger -- good girl every one like she he have be in trondhjem and see she isak you have put in some work here ay i dare say and you have see inger what be that you have get over there build a mill of you own have you grind you own corn excellent and you have turn up a good bit of ground since i be here last be she well eh oh you wife -- yes she be well and fit let 's go in the next room i 'll tell you all about it ` tis not in order put in oline oline have she own reason for not wish they to go in they go into the little room nevertheless and close the door oline stand in the kitchen and could hear nothing geissler sit down slap he knee with a powerful hand and there he be -- master of isak 's fate you have not sell that copper tract yet he ask no good i 'll buy it myself yes i have see inger and some other people too she 'll be out before long if i be not greatly mistake -- the case have be submit to the king the king the king yes i go in to have a talk with you wife -- they manage it for I of course no difficulty about that -- and we have a long talk ` well inger how be you get on nicely what ' ` why i have no cause to complain '' like to be home again ' ` ay i 'll not say no ' ` and so you shall before very long ' say i and i 'll tell you this much isak she be a good girl be inger no blubber not so much as a tear but smile and laugh they have fix up that trouble with she mouth by the way -- operation -- sew it up again ` good-bye then ' say i ` you will not be here very long i 'll promise you that ' then i go to the governor -- he see I of course no difficulty about that ` you have a woman here ' say i ' that ought to be out of the place and back in she home -- inger sellanraa ' ` inger ' say he ` why yes she be a good sort -- i wish we could keep she for twenty year ' say he ` well you will not ' say i ` she be be here too long already ' ` too long ' say he ` do you know what she be in for ' ' i know all about it ' say i ` be lensmand in the district ' ` oh ' say he ` will not you sit down ' quite the proper thing to say of course ` why ' say the governor then ` we do what we can for she here and she little girl too so she be from you part of the country be she we have help she to get a sewing-machine of she own she be go through the workshop right to the top and we have teach she a deal -- weave household work dye cut out be here too long you say ' well i would get my answer ready for that all right but it could wait so i only say she case have be badly muddle and have to be take up again now after the revision of the criminal code she have probably have be acquit altogether and i tell he about the hare ' a hare ' say the governor ' a hare ' say i ` and the child be bear with a hare-lip ' ` oh ' say he smile ' i see and you think they ought to have make more allowance for that ' ` they do not make any at all ' say i ` for it be not mention ' ` well i dare say it be not so bad after all ' ` bad enough for she anyway ' ` do you believe a hare can work miracle then ' say he ` as to that ' say i ` whether a hare can work miracle or not be a matter i will not discuss just now the question be what effect the _ sight _ of a hare might have on a woman with she disfigurement in she condition ' well he think over that for a bit ` h be ' say he at last ` maybe maybe anyhow we be not concern with that here all we have to do be to take over the people they send we not to revise they sentence and accord to she sentence inger 's not yet finish she time ' well then i start on what i want to say all along ` there be a serious oversight make in bring she here to begin with ' say i ` a oversight ' ` yes in the first place she ought never to have be send across the country at all in the state she be in ' he look at I stiffly ` no that be perfectly true ' say he ` but it be nothing to do with we here you know ' ` and in the second place ' say i ` she ought certainly not to have be in the prison for full two month without any notice take of she condition by the authority here ' that put he out i could see he say nothing for quite a while ` be you instruct to act on she behalf ' say he at last ` yes i be ' say i well then he start on about how pleased they have be with she and tell I over again all they would teach she and do for she there -- teach she to write too he say and the little girl have be put out to nurse with decent people and so on then i tell he how thing be at home with inger away two youngster leave behind and only a hire woman to look after they and all the rest ` i have a statement from she husband ' say i ` that i can submit whether the case be take up for thorough revision or a application be make for a pardon ' ` i would like to see that statement ' say the governor ` right ' say i ` i 'll bring it along tomorrow in visit hour ' isak sit listen -- it be thrill to hear a wonderful tale from foreign part he follow geissler 's mouth with slavish eye geissler go on : i go straight back to the hotel and write out a statement do the whole thing myself you understand and sign it ` isak sellanraa ' do not imagine though i say a word against the way they would manage thing in the prison not a word next day i go along with the paper ` will not you sit down ' say the governor the moment i get inside the door he read through what i would write nod here and there and at last he say : ` very good very good indeed it would hardly do perhaps to have the case bring up again for revision but ' ` wait a bit ' say i ` i have another document that i think will make it right ' have he there again you see ` well ' he say all of a hurry ` i have be think over the matter since yesterday and i consider there be good and sufficient grounds to apply for a pardon ' ` and the application would have the governor 's support ' i ask ` certainly yes i 'll give it my best recommendation ' then i bow and say : ` in that case there will be no difficulty about the pardon of course i thank you sir on behalf of a suffering woman and a stricken home ' then say he : ' i do not think there should be any need of further declaration -- from the district i mean -- about she case you know the woman yourself -- that should be quite enough ' i know well enough of course why he want the thing settle quietly as possible so i just agree : say it would only delay the proceedings to collect further material and there you be isak that be the whole story geissler look at he watch and now let 's get to business can you go with I up to the ground again isak be a stony creature a stump of a man he do not find it easy to change the subject all at once he be all preoccupy with thought and wonder and begin ask question of this and that he learn that the application have be send up to the king and might be decide in one of the first state council ` tis all a miracle say he then they go up into the hill geissler he man and isak and be out for some hour in a very short time geissler have follow the lie of the copper vein over a wide stretch of land and mark out the limit of the tract he want here there and everywhere he be but no fool for all he hasty movement quick to judge but sound enough for all that when they come back to the farm once more with a sack full of sample of ore -- he get out write material and sit down to write he do not bury himself completely in he write though but talk now and again well isak it will not be such a big sum this time for the land but i can give you a couple of hundred _ daler _ anyway on the spot then he write again remind I before i go i want to see that mill of yours say he then he catch sight of some blue and red mark on the frame of the loom and askedwho draw that now that be eleseus have draw a horse and a goat he use he color pencil on the loom and woodwork anywhere have no paper not at all bad say geissler and give eleseus a coin geissler go on write for a bit and then look up you 'll be have other people take up land hereabouts before long at this the man with he speak : there be some start already ho and who might that be well first there be the folk at breidablik as they call it -- man brede at breidablik he -- puh sniff geissler contemptuously then there be one or two other besides have buy doubt if they be any good any of they say geissler and notice at the same moment that there be two boy in the room he catch hold of little sivert and give he a coin a remarkable man be geissler he eye by the way have begin to look soreish there be a kind of redness at the edge might have be sleeplessness the same thing come at time from drinking of strong water but he do not look deject at all and for all he talking of this and that between time he be think no doubt of he document all the while for suddenly he pick up the pen and write a piece more at last he seem to have finish he turn to isak : well as i say it will not make you a rich man all at once this deal but there may be more to come we 'll fix it up so that you get more later on anyhow i can give you two hundred now isak understand but little of the whole thing but two hundred _ daler _ be at any rate another miracle and a unreasonable sum he would get it on paper of course not pay in cash but let that be isak have other thing in he head just now and you think she 'll be pardon he ask eh oh you wife well if there would be a telegraph office in the village i would have wire to trondhjem and ask if she have not be set free already isak have hear man speak of the telegraph a wonderful thing a string hang up on big pole something altogether above the common earth the mention of it now seem to shake he faith in geissler 's big word and he put in anxiously : but suppose the king say no say geissler : in that case i send in my supplementary material a full account of the whole affair and then they _ must _ set she free there be not a shadow of doubt then he read over what he have write the contract for purchase of the land two hundred _ daler _ cash down and later a nice high percentage of receipt from work or ultimate disposal by further sale of the copper tract sign you name here say geissler isak would have sign readily enough but he be no scholar in all he life he have get no farther than cut initial in wood but there be that hateful creature oline look on he take up the pen -- a beastly thing too light to handle anyway -- turn it right end down and _ write _ -- write he name whereupon geissler add something presumably a explanation and the man he have bring with he sign as a witness settle but oline be still there stand immovable -- it be indeed but now she have turn so stiff what be to happen dinner on the table oline say isak possibly with a tough of dignity after have sign he name in write on a paper such as we can offer he add to geissler smell good enough say geissler sound meat and drink here isak here 's you money geissler take out he pocket-book -- thick and fat it be too -- draw from it two bundle of note and lay they down count it over yourself not a movement not a sound isak say geissler again ay yes answer isak and murmur overwhelmed ` tis not that i have ask for it nor would -- after all you have do ten ten in that -- should be and twenty fives here say geissler shortly and i hope there 'll be more than that by a long way for you share soon and then it be that oline recover from she trance the wonder have happen after all she set the food on the table next morning geissler go out to the river to look at the mill it be small enough and roughly build ay a mill for dwarf for trollfolk but strong and useful for a man 's work isak lead he guest a little farther up the river and show he another fall he have be work on a bit it be to turn a saw if so be god give he health the only thing he say it be a heavy long way from school : i 'll have to get the lad to stay down in the village but geissler always so quick to find a way see nothing to worry about here there be more people buy and settle here now say he it will not be long before there be enough to start a school ay maybe but not before my boy be grow well why not let they live on a farm down in the village you could drive in with the boy and some food and bring they up again three week -- six week after it would be easy enough for you surely ay maybe say isak ay all thing would be easy enough if inger come home house and land and food and grand thing enough and a big sum of money too he have and he strength he be hard as nail health and strength -- ay full and unspoiled unworn in every way the health and strength of a man when geissler have go isak begin think of many presumptuous thing ay for have not geissler that blessing to they all say at parting that he would send a message very soon -- would send a telegram as soon as ever he could you can call in at the post office in a fortnight 's time he have say and that in itself be a wonderful thing enough isak set to work make a seat for the cart a seat of course that could be take off when use the cart for manure but to be put in again when any one want to drive and when he have get the seat make it look so white and new that it have to be paint darker as for that there be thing enough that have to be do the whole place want painting to begin with and he have be think for year past of build a proper barn with a bridge to house in the crop he have think too of get that saw set up and finish of fencing in all he cultivate ground of build a boat on the lake up in the hill many thing he have think of do but hard as he work unreasonably hard -- what do it help against time time -- it be the time that be too short it be Sunday before he know and then directly after lo it be Sunday again paint he would in any case that be decide and emphatic the building stand there gray and bare -- stand there like house in they shirt sleeve there be time yet before the busy season the spring be hardly begin yet the young thing be out

again and inger sit up hold the rein i have bring a paper of coffee too she say but you can not have any this evening for it be not roasted yet ` tis more than 's need this evening and all say he a hour later the sun go down and it grow colder inger get down to walk together they tuck the rug closer about leopoldine and smile to see how soundly she can sleep man and wife talk together again on

count the bull have you sell any butter ay and egg what have we chicken now ay of course we have and a pig inger be so astonished at all this that she forget herself altogether and stop for a moment -- _ ptro _ and isak be proud and keep on try to overwhelm she completely that geissler he say you remember he he come up a little while back oh i have sell he a copper mine ho what be that -- a copper mine copper yes up in the hill all along the north side of the water you -- you do not mean he pay you money for it ay that he do geissler he would not buy thing and not pay for they what do

while back say isak well -- you be a wonder you be truly it be a pleasure to see inger all surprised and make she a rich wife isak do not forget to add that he have no debt nor owing at the store or anywhere else and he have not only geissler 's two hundred untouched but more than that -- a hundred and sixty _ daler _ more ay they might well be thankful to god they speak of geissler again inger be able to tell how he have help to get she set free it have not be a easy matter for he after all it seem he have be a long time get the matter through and have call on the governor ever so many time geissler have also write to some of the state councillor or some other high authority but this he have do behind the governor 's back and when the governor hear of it he be furious which be not surprising but geissler be not to be frighten he demand a revision of the case new trial new examination and everything and after that the king have to sign ex-lensmand geissler have always be a good friend to they both and they have often wonder why he get nothing out of it but they poor thanks -- it be more than they could understand inger have speak with he in trondhjem and could not make he out he do not seem to care a bit about any in the village but we she explain do he say so yes he be furious with the village here he would show they he say ho and they would find out one day and be sorry they would lose he he say they reach the fringe of the wood and come in sight of they home there be more building there than before and all nicely paint inger hardly know the place again and stop dead you -- you do not say that be we place -- all that she exclaim little leopoldine wake at last and sit up thoroughly rest now they lift she out and let she walk be we there now she ask yes be not it a pretty place there be small figure move over by the house it be eleseus and sivert keep watch now they come run up inger be seize with a sudden cold -- a dreadful cold in the head with sniff and cough -- even she eye be all red and water too it always give one a dreadful cold on board ship -- make one 's eye wet and all but when the boy come nearer they stop run all of a sudden and stare they have forget what they mother look like and little sister they have never see but father -- they do not know he at all till he come quite close he have cut off he heavy beard chapter xii all be well now isak sow he oats harrow and roll it in little leopoldine come and want to sit on the roller sit on a roller -- nay she be all too little and unknowing for that yet she brother know better there be no seat on father 's roller but father think it fine and a pleasure to see little leopoldine come up so trustingly to he already he talk to she and show she how to walk nicely over the field and not get she shoe full of earth and what be that -- why if you have not a blue frock on today -- come let I see ay ` tis blue so it be and a belt round and all remember when you come on the big ship and the engine -- do you see they that be right -- and now run home to the boy again they 'll find you something to play with oline be go and inger have take up she old work once more in house and yard she overdo it a little maybe in cleanliness and order just by way of show that she be go to have thing differently now and indeed it be wonderful to see what a change be make even the glass window in the old turf hut be clean and the box sweep out but it be only the first day the first week after that she begin to be less eager about the work there be really no need to take all that trouble about cowshed and thing she could make better use of she time now inger have learn a deal among the town folk and it would be a pity not to turn it to account she take to she spinning-wheel and loom again -- true enough she be even quicker and neater than before -- a trifle too quick -- _ huus _ -- especially when isak be look on he could not make out how any one could learn to use they finger that way -- the fine long finger she have to she big hand but inger have a way of drop one piece of work to take up another all in a moment well well there be more thing to be look to now than before and maybe she be not altogether so patient as she have be a trifle of unrest have manage to creep in first of all there be the flower she have bring with she -- bulb and cutting little life these too that must be think of the glass window be too small the ledge too narrow to set flower-pot on and besides she have no flower-pot isak must make some tiny box for begonia fuchsia and rose also one window be not enough -- fancy a room with only one window and oh by the way say inger i want a iron you know there be not one in the place i could use a flat iron for press when i be sew dress and thing but you can not do proper work without a iron of some sort isak promise to get the blacksmith down at the village to make a first-rate pressing-iron oh isak be ready to do anything do all that she ask in every way for he could see well enough that inger have learn a heap of thing now and matchless clever she be grow she speak too in a different way a little finer use elegant word she never shout out to he now as she use to : come and get you food but would say instead : dinner 's ready if you please everything be different now in the old day he would answer simply ay or say nothing at all and go on work for a bit before he come now he say thanks and go in at once love make the wise a fool : now and then isak would say thanks thanks ay all be different now -- maybe a trifle too fine in some way when isak speak of dung and be rough in he speech as peasant be inger would call it manure for the sake of the child you know she be careful with the child and teach they everything educate they let tiny leopoldine go on quickly with she crochet work and the boy with write and schooling they would not be altogether behindhand when the time come for they to go to school in the village eleseus in particular be grow a clever one but little sivert be nothing much if the truth must be tell -- a madcap a jackanapes he even venture to screw a little at mother 's sewing-machine and have already hack off splinter from table and chair with he new pocket-knife inger have threaten to take it away altogether the child of course have all the animal about the place and eleseus have still he color pencil besides he use it very carefully and rarely lend it to he brother but for all that the wall be cover with blue and red drawing as time go on and the pencil get smaller and smaller at last eleseus be simply force to put sivert on ration with it lend he the pencil on Sunday only for one draw sivert be not please with the arrangement but eleseus be a fellow who would stand no nonsense not so much as be the stronger but he have longer arm and could manage better when it come to a quarrel but that sivert now and again he would come across a bird 's nest in the wood once he talk about a mouse-hole he have find and make a lot of that another time it be a great fish as big as a man he have see in the river but it be all evidently he own invention he be somewhat incline to make black into white be sivert but a good sort for all that when the cat have kitten it be he who bring she milk because she hiss too much for eleseus sivert be never tire of stand look at the box full of movement a nest of tumble furry paw the chicken too he notice every day : the cock with he lordly carriage and fine feather the hen trip about chatter low and pecking at the sand or scream out as if terribly hurt every time they have lay a egg and there be the big wether little sivert have read a good deal to what he know before but he could not say of the wether that the beast have a fine roman nose begad that he could not say but he could do better than that he know the wether from the day when it have be a lamb he understand it and be one with it -- a kinsman a fellow-creature once a strange primitive impression flicker through he sens : it be a moment he never forget the wether be grazing quietly in the field suddenly it throw up its head stop munch simply stand there look out sivert look involuntarily in the same direction no -- nothing remarkable but sivert himself feel something strange within he : ` tis most as if he stand look into the garden of eden he think there be the cow -- the child have each a couple -- great sailing creature so friendly and tame that they let themselves be catch whenever you like let human child pat they there be the pig white and particular about its person when decently look after listen to every sound a comical fellow always eager for food and ticklish and fidgety as a girl and there be the billy-goat there be always one old billy-goat at sellanraa for as soon as one die another be ready to take he place and be there ever anything so solemnly ridiculous to look at just now he have a whole lot of goat to look after but at time he would get sick and tired of they all and lie down a bearded thoughtful spectacle a veritable father abraham and then in a moment up again and off after the flock he always leave a trail of sourish air behind he \* \* \* \* \* the daily round of the farm go on now and again a traveller come by on he way up to the hill and ask : and how 's all with ye here and isak answer : ay thank ye kindly isak work and work consult the almanac for all that he do note the change of the moon pay heed to the sign of the weather and work on he have beat out so much of a track down to the village that he can drive in now with horse and cart but for the most part he carry he load himself carry load of cheese or hide and bark and resin and butter and egg all thing he can sell to bring back other wares instead no in the summer he do not often drive down -- for one thing because the road down from breidablik the last part of the way be so badly keep he have ask brede olsen to help with the upkeep of the road and do he share brede olsen promise but do not hold to he word and isak will not ask he again rather carry a load on he back himself and inger say : i can not understand how you ever manage it all oh but he could manage anything he have a pair of boot so unimaginably heavy and thick with great slab of iron on the sole even the strap be fasten with copper nail -- it be a marvel that one man could walk in such boot at all on one of he journey down he come upon several gang of man at work on the moor put down stone socket and fix telegraph pole some of they be from the village brede olsen be there too for all that he have take up land of he own and ought to be work on that isak wonder that brede can find time the foreman ask if isak can sell they telegraph pole isak say no not if he be well pay for they -- no -- oh isak be grow a thought quicker in he dealings now he could say no if he sell they a few pole to be sure it would be money in he pocket so many _ daler _ more but he have no timber to spare there be nothing gain by that the engineer in charge come up himself to ask but isak refuse we have pole enough say the engineer but it would be easier to take they from you ground up there and save transport i have no timber to spare myself say isak i want to get up a bit of a saw and do some cut there be some more building i 'll need to have ready soon here brede olsen put in a word and say : if i be you isak i would sell they pole for all he patience isak give brede a look and say : ay i dare say you would well -- what ask brede only that i be not you say isak some of the workman chuckle a little at this ay isak have reason enough just then to put he neighbor down that very day he have see three sheep in the field at breidablik and one of they he know -- the one with the flat ear that oline have barter away he may keep it think isak as he go on he way brede and he woman may get all the sheep they want for I that business of the saw be always in he thought it be as he have say last winter when the road be hard he have cart up the big circular blade and the fitting order from trondhjem through the village store the part be lie in one of the shed now well smear with oil to keep off the rust he have bring up some of the beam too for the framework he could begin build when he please but he put it off what could it be be he begin to grow slack be he wear out he could not understand it himself it would have be no surprise to other perhaps but isak could not believe it be he head go he have never be afraid of take up a piece of work before he must have change somehow since the time when he have build he mill across a river just as big he could get in help from the village but he would try again alone he would start in a day or so -- and inger could lend he a hand he speak to inger about it hm i do not know if you could find time one of these day to lend a hand with that sawmill inger think for a moment ye -- s if i can manage it so you be go to set up a sawmill ay ` tis my intention so i have work it all out in my head will that be harder than the mill be much harder ten time as hard why it be all get to be as close and exact -- down to the tiniest line and the saw itself exactly midway if only you can manage it say inger thoughtlessly isak be offend and answer as to that we shall see could not you get a man to help you some one that know the work no well then you will not be able to manage it say she again isak put up he hand to he hair -- it be like a bear lift he paw 'twa just that i have be fear say he that i might not manage it and that be why i want you that be learn so much to help I that be one to the bear but nothing gain after all inger toss she head and turn aside unkindly and would have nothing to do with he saw well then -- say isak why do you want I to stand get drench in the river and have I lay up and who be to do all the sewing and look to the animal and keep house and all the rest no that be true say isak oh but it be only the four corner post and the middle one for the two long side he want help with that be all inger -- be she really grow so different in she heart through living among folk from the town the fact be that inger have change a good deal she think now less of they common good than of herself she have take loom and wheel into use again but the sew machine be more to she taste and when the pressing-iron come up from the blacksmith 's she be ready to set up as a fully-trained dressmaker she have a profession now she begin by make a couple of little frock for leopoldine isak think they pretty and praise they maybe a think too much inger hint that it be nothing to what she could do when she try but they be too short say isak they be wear that way in town say inger you know nothing about it isak see he have go too far and to make up for it say something about get some material for inger herself for something or other for a cloak say inger ay or what you would like inger agree to have something for a cloak and describe the sort of stuff she want but when she have make the cloak she have to find some one to show it to accordingly when the boy go down to the village to be put to school inger herself go with they and that journey might have seem a little thing but it leave its mark they come first of all to breidablik and the breidablik woman and she child come out to see who it be go by there sit inger and the two boy drive down lordly-wise -- the boy on they way to school nothing less and inger wear a cloak the breidablik woman feel a sting at the sight the cloak she could have do without -- thank heaven _ she _ set no store by such foolishness -- but she have child of she own -- barbro a great girl already helge the next and kathrine all of a age for school the two eldest have be to school before when they live down in the village but after move up to breidablik to a out-of-the-way place up on the moor they have be force to give it up and let the child run heathen again you 'll be want a bite for the boy maybe say the woman food do you see this chest here it be my travel trunk that i bring home with I -- i have that full of food and what 'll be in it of sort what sort i have meat and pork in plenty and bread and butter and cheese besides ay you have no lack up at sellanraa say the other and she poor sallow-faced child listen with eye and ear to this talk of rich thing to eat and where will they be stay ask the mother at the blacksmith 's say inger ho say the other ay mine 'll be go to school again soon they 'll stay with the lensmand ho say inger ay or at the doctor 's maybe or at the parsonage brede he be in with the great folk there of course inger fumble with she cloak and manage to turn it so that a bit of black silk fringe appear to advantage where do you get the cloak ask the woman one you have with you maybe i make it myself ay ay ` tis as i say : wealth and riches full and run over inger drive on feel all set up and pleased with herself and come into the village she may have be a trifle overproud in she bearing lensmand heyerdahl 's lady be not please at the sight of that cloak the sellanraa woman be forget she place -- forget where it be she have come from after five year ' absence but inger have at least a chance of show off she cloak and the storekeeper 's wife and the blacksmith 's wife and the schoolmaster 's wife all thought of get one like it for themselves -- but it could wait a bit and now it be not long before inger begin to have visitor one or two woman come across from the other side of the hill out of curiosity oline have perhaps chance to say something against she will to this one or that those who come now bring news from inger 's own birthplace what more natural than that inger should give they a cup of coffee and let they look at she sewing-machine young girl come up in pair from the coast from the village to ask inger 's advice it be autumn now and they have be save up for a new dress and want she to help they inger of course would know all about the latest fashion after be out in the world and now and again she would do a little cut out inger herself brighten up at these visit and be glad kindly and helpful she be too and clever at the work besides she could cut out material without a pattern sometimes she would even hem a whole length on she machine and all for nothing and give the stuff back to the girl with a delightful jest : there -- now you can sew the button on yourself later in the year inger be send for down to the village to do dressmaking for some of the great folk there inger could not go she have a household to look after and animal besides all the work of the home and she have no servant have no what servant she speak to isak one day if only i have some one to help I i could put in more time sew isak do not understand help yes help in the house -- a servant-girl isak must have be take aback at this he laugh a little in he iron beard and take it as a jest ay we should have a servant-girl say he housewife in the town always have a servant say inger ho say isak well isak be not perhaps in the best of humor just then not exactly gentle and content no for he have start work on that sawmill and it be a slow and toilsome business he could not hold the baulk with one hand and a level in the other and fix end at the same time but when the boy come back from school again it be easier the lad be useful and a help bless they sivert especially have a genius for knock in nail but eleseus be better at handle a plumb-line by the end of a week isak and the boy have actually get the foundation post in and soundly fix with stretcher piece as thick as the beam themselves it work out all right -- everything work out all right somehow but isak be begin to feel tired in the evening now -- whatever it could be it be not only build a sawmill and get that do -- there be everything else besides the hay be in but the corn be stand yet soon it would have to be cut and stack : there be the potato too they would have to be take up before long but the boy be a wonderful help he do not thank they 'twa not the way among folk of they sort but he be mightily please with they for all that now and again they would sit down in the middle of they work and talk together the father almost ask he son ' advice as to what they should do next those be proud moment for the lad they learn also to think well before they speak lest they should be in the wrong ` twould be a pity not to have the saw roof in before the autumn rain say they father if only inger have be as in the old day but inger be not so strong as she have be it seem and that be natural enough after she long spell within wall that she mind too seem change be another matter strange how little thought how little care she seem to take now shallow and heedless -- be this inger one day she speak of the child she have kill and a fool i be to do it she say we might have have she mouth sew up too and then i need not have throttle she and she never steal off now to a tiny grave in the forest where once she have pat the earth with she hand and set up a little cross but inger be not altogether heartless yet she care for she other child keep they clean and make new clothes for they she would sit up late at night mend they thing it be she ambition to see they get on in the world the corn be stack and the potato be take up then come the winter no the sawmill do not get roof in that autumn but that could not be help -- after all 'twa not a matter of life or death next summer would be time and mean enough chapter xiii the winter round of work be as before cart wood mending tool and implement inger keep house and do sewing in she spare time the boy be down in the village again for the long term at school for several winter past they have have a pair of _ ski _ between they they manage well enough that way as long as they be at home one wait while the other take he turn or one standing on behind the other ay they manage finely with but one pair it be the finest thing they know and they be innocent and glad but down in the village thing be different the school be full of _ ski _ even the child at breidablik it seem have each a pair and the end of it be that isak have to make a new pair for eleseus sivert keep the old pair for he own isak do more he have the boy well clad and give they everlasting boot but when that be do isak go to the storekeeper and ask for a ring a ring say the man a finger ring ay i have grow that high and mighty now i must give my wife a ring do you want a silver one or gold or just a brass ring dip to look like gold let 's say a silver ring the storekeeper think for a while look you isak he say if you want to do the proper thing and give you wife a ring she need not be ashamed to wear you would better make it a gold ring what say isak aloud though maybe in he inmost heart he have be think of a gold ring all the time they talk the matter over seriously and agree about get a measurement of some sort for the ring isak be thoughtful and shake he head and reckon it be a big thing to do but the storekeeper refuse to order anything but a gold ring isak go home again secretly please with he decision but somewhat anxious for all that at the extravagant length he have go to all for be in love with he wife there be a good average snowfall that winter and early in the year when the road be passable folk from the village begin cart up telegraph pole over the moor drop they load at regular interval they drive big team and come up past breidablik past sellanraa farm and meet new team beyond come down with pole from the other side of the hill -- the line be complete so life go on day by day without any great event what be there to happen anyway spring come and the work of set up the pole begin brede olsen be there again with the gang though he should have be work on he own land at that season ` tis a wonder he be the time think isak isak himself have barely time to eat and sleep it be a close thing to get through the season 's work now with all the land he have bring under tillage then between season he get he sawmill roof in and could set to work put up the machine part and look you 'twa no marvel of fine woodwork he have set up but strong it be as a giant of the hill and stand there to good use the saw could work and cut as a sawmill should isak have keep he eye about he down in the village and use they well it be hearty and small this sawmill he have build but he be please with it he carve the date above the doorway and put he mark and that summer something more than usual do come about after all at sellanraa the telegraph worker have now reach so far up over the moor that the foremost gang come to the farm one evening and ask to be lodge for the night they be give shelter in the big barn as the day go on the other gang come along and all be house at sellanraa the work go on ahead pass the farm but the man still come back to sleep in the barn one Saturday evening come the engineer in charge to pay the man at sight of the engineer eleseus feel he heart jump and steal out of the house lest he should be ask about that color pencil oh there would be trouble now -- and sivert nowhere to be see he would have to face it alone eleseus slipped round the corner of the house like a pale ghost find he mother and beg she to tell sivert to come there be no help for it now sivert take the matter less to heart -- but then he be not the chief culprit the two brother go a little way off and sit down and eleseus say : if you would say it be you now I say sivert you be younger he would not do anything to you sivert think over it and see that he brother be in distress also it flatter he to feel that the other need he help why i might help you out of it perhaps say he in a grown-up voice ay if you would say eleseus and quite simply give he brother the bit of pencil that be leave you can have it for keep he say they be go in again together but eleseus recollect he have something he must do over at the sawmill or rather at the cornmill something he must look to and it would take some time -- he would not be finish just yet sivert go in alone there sit the engineer pay out note and silver and when he have finish inger give he milk to drink a jug and a glass and he thank she then he talk to little leopoldine and then notice the drawing on the wall ask straight out who have do that be it you he ask turn to sivert the man feel perhaps he owe something for inger 's hospitality and praise the drawing just to please she inger on she part explain the matter as it be : it be she boy have make the drawing -- both of they they have no paper till she come home and look to thing so they have mark all about the wall but she have not the heart to wash it off again why leave it as it be say the engineer paper do you say and he take out a heap of big sheet there draw away on that till i come round again and how be you off for pencil sivert step forward simply with the stump he have and show how small it be and behold the man give he a new color pencil not even sharpen there now you can start afresh but i would make the horse red if i be you and do the goat with blue never see a blue horse have you and the engineer go on he way that same evening a man come up from the village with a basket -- he hand out some bottle to the workman and go off again but after he have go it be no longer so quiet about the place some one play a accordion the man talk loudly and there be singing and even dance at sellanraa one of the man ask inger out to dance and inger -- who would have think it of she -- she laugh a little laugh and actually dance a few turn round after that some of the other ask she and she dance not a little in the end inger -- who could say what be in she mind here she be dance gaily maybe for the first time in she life seek after riotously pursue by thirty man and she alone the only one to choose from no one to cut she out and those burly telegraph man -- how they lift she why not dance eleseus and sivert be fast asleep in the little chamber undisturbed by all the noise outside little leopoldine be up look on wonderingly at she mother as she dance isak be out in the field all the time he have go off directly after supper and when he come home to go to bed some one offer he a bottle he drink a little and sit watch the dancing with leopoldine on he lap ` tis a gay time you be have say he kindly to inger -- foot it properly tonight after a while the music stop and the dance be over the workman get ready to leave -- they be go down to the village for the rest of the evening and would be there all next day come back on Monday morning soon all be quiet again at sellanraa a couple of the older man stay behind and turn in to sleep in the barn isak wake up in the night -- inger be not there could she be go to see to the cow he get up and go across to the cowshed inger he call no answer the cow turn they head and look at he all be still unthinkingly from ancient habit he count head count the sheep also there be one of the ewe have a bad habit of stay out at night -- and out it be now inger he call again still no answer surely she could not have go with they down to the village the summer night be light and warm isak stay a while sit on the door-slab then he go out into the wood to look for the ewe and he find inger inger and one other they sit in the heather she twirl he peaked cap on one finger both talk together -- they be after she again it seem isak trundle slowly over towards they inger turn and see he and bow forward where she sit all the life go out of she she hang like a rag h be do you know that ewe 's out again ask isak but no you would not know say he the young telegraph hand pick up he cap and begin sidle away i 'll be get along after the other he say good-night to ye no one answer so you be sit here say isak go to stay out a bit maybe and he turn towards home inger rise to she knee get on she foot and follow after and so they go man in front and wife behind tandem-wise they go home inger must have find time to think oh she find a way 'twa the ewe i be after say she i see it be out again then one of the man come up and help I look we would not be sit a moment when you come where be you go now i seem i would better look for the creature myself no no go and lie down if any one 's to go let I go and lie down you 'll be need rest and as for that the ewe can stay out where she be -- ` two not be the first time and be eat up by some beast or other say isak and go off inger run after he do not do not it be not worth it she say you need rest let I go isak give in but he would not hear of inger go out to search by herself and they go indoors together inger turn at once to look for the child go into the little chamber to see to the boy as if she have be out on some perfectly natural errand it almost seem indeed as if she be try to make up to isak -- as if she expect he to be more in love with she than ever that evening -- after she have explain it all so neatly but no isak be not so easy to turn he would rather have see she thoroughly distressed and beside herself with contrition ay that would have be better what matter that she have collapse for a moment when he come on she in the wood the little moment of shame -- what be the good of that when it all pass off so soon he be far from gentle too the next day and that a Sunday go off and look to the sawmill look to the cornmill look over the field with the child or by himself inger try once to join he but isak turn away : i be go up to the river he say something up there there be trouble in he mind like enough but he bear it silently and make no scene oh there be something great about isak as it might be israel promise and ever deceive but still believe by Monday the tension be less marked and as the day go on the impression of that unhappy Saturday evening grow fainter time can mend a deal of thing a spit and a shake a meal and a good night 's rest and it will heal the sorriest of wound isak 's trouble be not so bad as it might have be after all he be not certain that he have be wrong and apart from that he have other thing to think of the harvesting be at hand and last not least the telegraph line be all but finish now in a little while they would be leave in peace a broad light road a king 's highway have be cut through the dark of the forest there be pole and wire run right up over the hill next Saturday paytime the last there be to be isak manage to be away from home -- he wish it so he go down into the village with cheese and butter and come back on Sunday night the man be all go from the barn nearly all that be the last man stumble out of the yard with he pack on he shoulder -- all but the last that be that it be not altogether safe as yet isak could see for there be a bundle leave on the floor of the barn where the owner be he could not say and do not care to know but there be a peaked cap on top of the bundle -- a offence to the eye isak heave the bundle out into the yard fling the cap out after it and close the door then he go into the stable and look out through the window and think belike : let the bundle stay there and let the cap lie there ` tis all one whose they may be a bit of dirt he be and not worth my while -- so he might have think but when the fellow come for he bundle never doubt but that isak will be there to take he by the arm and make that arm a trifle blue and as for kick he off the place in a way he would remember -- why isak would give he that too whereupon isak leave he window in the stable and go back to the cowsh and look out from there and could not rest the bundle be tie up with string the poor fellow have no lock to he bag and the string have come undo -- isak could not feel sure he have not deal over hardly with that bundle whatever it might be -- he be not sure he have act rightly only just now he have be in the village and see he new harrow a brand-new harrow he have order -- oh a wonderful machine a idol to worship and it have just come a thing like that must carry a blessing with it and the power above that guide the footstep of man might be watch he now at this moment to see if he deserve a blessing or not isak give much thought to the power above ay he have see god with he own eye one night in harvest-time in the wood it be rather a curious sight isak go out into the yard and stand over the bundle he be still in doubt he thrust he hat back and scratch he head which give he a devil-may-care appearance for the moment something lordly and careless as it might have be a spaniard but then he must have think something like this : nay here be i and far from be in any way splendid or excellent a very dog and then he tie up the bundle neatly once more pick up the cap and carry all back into the barn again and that be do as he go out from the barn and over to the mill away from the yard away from everything there be no inger to be see in the window of the house nay then let she be where she please -- no doubt she be in bed -- where else should she be but in the old day in those first innocent year inger could never rest but sit up at night wait for he when he have be down to the village it be different now different in every way as for instance when he have give she that ring could anything have be more utterly a failure isak have be gloriously modest and far from venture to call it a gold ring ` tis nothing grand but you might put it on you finger just to try be it gold she ask ay but ` tis none so thick say he and here she be to have answer : ay but indeed it be but instead she have say : no ` tis not very thick but still nay ` tis worth no more than a bit of grass belike say he at last and give up hope but inger have indeed be glad of the ring and wear it on she right hand look fine there when she be sew now and again she would let the village girl try it on and sit with it on they finger for a bit when they come up to ask of this or that foolish isak -- not to understand that she be proud of it beyond measure it be a profitless business sit there alone in the mill listen to the fall the whole night through isak have do no wrong he have no cause to hide himself away he leave the mill go up over the field and home -- into the house and then in truth it be a shamefaced isak shamefaced and glad brede olsen sit there he neighbor and no other sit there drink coffee ay inger be up the two of they sit there simply and quietly talk and drink coffee here 's isak say inger pleasantly as could be and get up and pour out a cup for he evening say brede and be just as pleasant too isak could see that brede have be spend the evening with the telegraph gang the last night before they go he be somewhat the worse for it maybe but friendly and good-humoured enough he boast a little as be he way : have not the time really to bother with this telegraphic work the farm take all of a man 's day -- but he could not very well say no when the engineer be so anxious to have he and so it have come about too that brede have have to take over the job of line inspector not for the sake of the money of course he could earn many time that down in the village but he have not like to refuse and they would give he a neat little machine set up on the wall a curious little thing a sort of telegraph in itself ay brede be a wastrel and a boaster but for all that isak could bear he no grudge he himself be too relieved at find he neighbor in the house that evening instead of a stranger isak have the peasant 's coolness of mind he few feeling stability stubbornness he chat with brede and nod at he shallowness another cup for brede say he and inger pour it out inger talk of the engineer a kindly man he be beyond measure have look at the boy ' drawing and writings and even say something about take eleseus to work under he to work with he say isak ay to the town to do write and thing be a clerk in the office -- all for he be so pleased with the boy 's writing and draw ho say isak well and what do you say he be go to have he confirm too that be a great thing to my mind ay a great thing indeed say brede and when the engineer say he 'll do a thing he 'll do it i know he and you can take my word for that we have no eleseus to spare on this farm as i know of say isak there be something like a painful silence after that isak be not a easy man to talk to but when the boy himself want to get on say inger at last and have it in he too silence again then say brede with a laugh : i wish he would ask for one of mine anyway i have enough of they and to spare but barbro 's the eldest and she be a girl and a good girl enough say inger for politeness ' sake ay i 'll not say no say brede barbro 's well enough and clever at this and that -- she be go to help at the lensmand 's now go to the lensmand 's well i have to let she go -- he wife be so set on it i could not say no it be well on towards morning now and brede rise to go i have a bundle and a cap i leave in you barn he say that be if the man have not run off with it he add jestingly chapter xiv and time go on yes eleseus be send to town after all inger manage that he be there for a year then he be confirm and after that have a regular place in the engineer 's office and grow more and more clever at write and thing to see the letter he send home -- sometimes with red and black ink like picture almost and the talk of they the word he use now and again he ask for money something towards he expense a watch and chain for instance he must have so as not to oversleep himself in the morning and be late at the office money for a pipe and tobacco also such as the other young clerk in the town always have and for something he call pocket-money and something he call evening class where he learn draw and gymnastics and other matter proper to he rank and position altogether it be no light matter to keep eleseus go in a berth in town pocket-money say isak be that money to keep in you pocket maybe that must be it no doubt say inger so as not to be altogether without and it be not much only a _ daler _ now and then ay that be just it say isak harshly a _ daler _ now and a _ daler _ then but he harshness be all because he miss eleseus himself and want he home it make too many _ daler _ in the long run say he i can not keep on like this you must write and tell he he can have no more ho very well then say inger in a offended tone there be sivert -- what do he get by way of pocket-money inger answer : you have never be in a town and so you do not know these thing sivert 's no need of pocket-money and talking of money sivert ought to be none so badly off when he uncle sivert die you do not know ay but i do know and this be right enough in a way uncle sivert have say something about make little sivert he heir uncle sivert have hear of eleseus and he grand doings in town and the story do not please he he nod and bite he lip and mutter that a nephew call up as he namesake -- name after uncle sivert -- should not come to want but what be this fortune uncle sivert be suppose to possess have he really besides he neglect farm and he fishery the heap of money and mean folk generally think no one could say for certain and apart from that uncle sivert himself be a obstinate man he insist that little sivert should come to stay with he it be a point of honor with he this last he should take little sivert and look after he as the engineer have do with eleseus but how could it be do send little sivert away from home -- it be out of the question he be all the help leave to isak now moreover the lad himself have no great wish to go and stay with he famous uncle he have try it once but have come home again he be confirm shoot up in stature and grow the down show on he cheek he hand be big a pair of willing slave and he work like a man isak could hardly have manage to get the new barn build at all without sivert 's help -- but there it stand now with bridge-way and air-hole and all as big as they have at the parsonage itself true it be only a half-timbered building cover with board but extra stout build with iron clinch at the corner and cover with one-inch plank from isak 's own sawmill and sivert have hammer in more than one nail at the work and lift the heavy beam for the framework till he be near fainting sivert get on well with he father and work steadily at he side he be make of the same stuff and yet he be not above such simple way as go up the hillside for tansy to rub with so as to smell nice in church 'twa leopoldine be the one for get fancy in she head which be natural enough she be a girl and the only daughter that summer if you please she have discover that she could not eat she porridge at supper without treacle -- simply could not and she be no great use at any kind of work either inger have not yet give up she idea of keep a servant she bring up the question every spring and every time isak oppose it stubbornly all the cut out and sewing and fine weave she could do not to speak of make embroidered slipper if she have but the time to herself and of late isak have be something less firm in he refusal though he grumble still ho the first time he have make a whole long speech about it not as a matter of right and reason nor yet from pride but alas from weakness from anger at the idea but now he seem to be give way as if ashamed if ever i be to have help in the house now be the time say inger a few year more and leopoldine 'll be big enough to do this and that help say isak what do you want help with anyway want with it indeed have not you help yourself have not you sivert all the time what could isak say to a meaningless argument like that he answer : ay well when you get a girl up here i doubt you 'll be able to plough and sow and reap and manage all by yourselve and then sivert and i can go we way that be as may be say inger but i 'll just say this : that i could get barbro to come now she be write home about it what barbro say isak be it that brede 's girl you mean yes she be in bergen now i 'll not have that brede 's girl barbro up here say he whoever you get i 'll have none of she that be better than nothing isak refuse to have barbro he no longer say they would have no servant at all barbro from breidablik be not the sort of girl isak approve of she be shallow and unsettled like she father -- maybe like she mother too -- a careless creature no steady character at all she have not stay long at the lensmand 's only a year after she confirmation she go to help at the storekeeper 's and be there another year here she turn pious and get religion and when the salvation army come to the village she join it and go about with a red band on she sleeve and carry a guitar she go to bergen in that costume on the storekeeper 's boat -- that be last year and she have just send home a photograph of herself to she people at breidablik isak have see it a strange young lady with she hair curl up and a long watch-chain hang down over she breast she parent be proud of little barbro and show the photograph about to all who come 'twa grand to see how she have learn town way and get on in the world as for the red band and the guitar she have give they up it seem i take the picture along and show it to the lensmand 's lady say brede she do not know she again be she go to stay in bergen say isak suspiciously why unless she go on to christianium perhaps say brede what be there for she to do here she be get a new place now as housekeeper for two young clerk they have no wife nor womenfolk of they own and they pay she well how much say isak she do not say exactly in the letter but it must be something altogether different from what folk pay down here that be plain why she get christmas present and present other time as well and not count off she wages at all ho say isak you would not like to have she up at you place ask brede i say isak all take aback no of course he he it be only a way of speak barbro 's well enough where she be what be i go to say you do not notice anything wrong with the line come down -- the telegraph what with the telegraph no no no there be not much wrong with it now since i take over and then i have my own machine here on the wall to give a warning if anything happen i 'll have to take a walk up along the line one of these day and see how thing be i have too much to manage and look after ` tis more than one man 's work but as long as i be inspector here and hold a official position of course i can not neglect my duty if i have not the telegraph of course and it may not be for long why say isak you think of give it up maybe well i can not say exactly say brede i have not quite decide they want I to move down into the village again who be it want you ask isak oh all of they the lensmand want I to go and be assistant there again and the doctor want I to drive for he and the parson 's wife say more than once she miss I to lend a hand if it be not such a long way to go how be it with that strip of hill isak -- the bit you sell do you get as much for it as they say ay ` tis no lie answer isak but what do geissler want with it anyway it lie there still -- curious thing year after year and nothing do it be a curious thing isak have often wonder about it himself he have speak to the lensmand about it and ask for geissler 's address think to write to he ay it be a mystery ` tis more than i can say say isak brede make no secret of he interest in this matter of the sale they say there be more of the same sort up there he say besides yours maybe there be more in it than we know ` tis a pity that we should sit here like dumb beast and know nothing of it all i have think of go up one day myself to have a look but do you know anything about metal and such-like ask isak why i know a bit and i have ask one or two other anyhow i 'll have to find something i can not live and keep we all here on this bit of a farm it be sheer impossible 'twa another matter with you that be get all that timber and good soil below ` tis naught but moorland here moorland 's good soil enough say isak shortly i have the same myself but there be no drain it say brede it can not be do but it could be do come down the road that day isak notice other clearing two of they be lower down nearer the village but there be one far up above between breidablik and sellanraa -- ay man be begin to work on the land now in the old day when isak first come up it have lie waste all of it and these three new settler be folk from another district man with some sense in they head by the look of thing they do not begin by borrow money to build a house no they come up one year and do they spade work and go away again vanish as if they be dead that be the proper way ditch first then plough and sow axel ström be nearest to isak 's land now he next-door neighbor a clever fellow unmarried he come from helgeland he have borrow isak 's new harrow to break up he soil and not till the second year have he set up a hayshed and a turf hut for himself and a couple of animal he have call he place maaneland because it look nice in the moonlight he have no womenfolk himself and find it difficult to get help in the summer lie so far out but he manage thing the right way no doubt about that not as brede olsen do build a house first and then come up with a big family and little one and all with neither soil nor stock to feed they what do brede olsen know of drain moorland and break new soil he know how to waste he time idle do brede he come by sellanraa one day go up to the hill -- simply to look for precious metal he come back the same evening have not find anything definite he say but certain sign -- and he nod he would come up again soon and go over the hill thoroughly over towards sweden and sure enough brede come up again he have take a fancy to the work no doubt but he call it telegraph business this time -- must go up and look over the whole of the line meanwhile he wife and child at home look after the farm or leave it to look after itself isak be sick and tired of brede 's visit and go out of the room when he come then inger and brede would sit talk heartily together what could they have to talk about brede often go down to the village and have always some news to tell of the great folk there inger on the other hand could always draw upon she famous journey to trondhjem and she stay there she have grow talkative in the year she have be away and be always ready to gossip with any one no she be no longer the same straightforward simple inger of the old day girl and woman come up continually to sellanraa to have a piece of work cut out or a long hem put through the machine in a moment and inger entertain they well oline too come again could not help it belike come both spring and autumn fair-spoken soft as butter and thoroughly false just look along to see how thing be with you she say each time and i have be longing so for a sight of the lad i be that fond of they the little angel they be ay they be big fellow now but it be strange i can not forget the time when they be small and i have they in my care and here 's you build and build again and make a whole town of the place go to have a bell to ring maybe at the roof of the barn same as at the parsonage once oline come and bring another woman with she and the pair of they and inger have a nice day together the more inger have sit round she the better she work at she sewing and cut out make a show of it wave she scissors and swing the iron it remind she of the place where she have learn it all -- there be always many of they in the workroom there inger make no secret of where she have get she knowledge and all she art from it be from trondhjem it almost appear as if she have not be in prison at all in the ordinary way but at school in a institute where one could learn to sew and weave and write and do dress and dye -- all that she have learn in trondhjem she speak of the place as of a home there be so many people she know there superintendent and forewoman and attendant it have be dull and empty to come back here again and hard to find herself altogether cut off from the life and society she have be accustom to she even make some show of have a cold -- could not stand the keen air there for year after she return she have be too poorly to work out of door in all season it be for the outside work she really ought to have a servant ay heaven save we say oline and why should not you have a servant indeed when you have means and learning and a great fine house and all it be pleasant to meet with sympathy and inger do not deny it she work away at she machine till the place shake and the ring on she finger shine there you can see for yourself say oline to the woman with she it be true what i say inger she wear a gold ring on she finger would you like to see it ask inger take it off oline seem still to have she doubt she turn it in she finger as a monkey with a nut look at the mark ay ` tis as i say inger with all she means and riches the other woman take the ring with veneration and smile humbly you can put it on for a bit if you like say inger do not be afraid it will not break and inger be amiable and kind she tell they about the cathedral at trondhjem and begin like this : you have not see the cathedral at trondhjem maybe no you have not be there and it might have be she own cathedral from the way she praise it boast of it tell they height and breadth it be a marvel seven priest could stand there preach all at once and never hear one another and then i suppose you have never see st olaf 's well right in the middle of the cathedral itself it be on one side and it be a bottomless well when we go there we take each a little stone with we and drop it in but it never reach the bottom never reach the bottom whisper the two woman shake they head and there be a thousand other thing besides in that cathedral exclaim inger delightedly there be the silver chest to begin with it be holy st olaf he own silver chest that he have but the marble church -- that be a little church all of pure marble -- the danes take that from we in the war it be time for the woman to go oline take inger aside lead she out into the larder where she know all the cheese be store and close the door what be it ask inger oline whisper : os-ander he do not dare come here any more i have tell he ho say inger i tell he if he only dare after what he would do to you ay say inger but he be be here many a time since for all that and he can come if he like i be not afraid no that be so say oline but i know what i know and if you like i 'll lay a charge against he ho say inger no you have no call to do that ti not worth it but she be not ill pleased to have oline on she side it cost she a cheese to be sure but oline thank she so fulsomely : ` tis as i say ` tis as i have always say : inger she give with both hand nothing grudging nothing spare about she no maybe you be not afraid of os-ander but i have forbid he to come here all the same 'twa the least i could do for you say inger then : what harm could it do if he do come anyway he can not hurt I any more oline prick up she ear : ho you have learn a way yourself maybe i sha not have any more child say inger and now they be quit each hold as good a trump as the other : for oline stand there know all the time that os-ander the lapp have die the day before \* \* \* \* \* why should inger say that about have no more child she be not on bad term with she husband 'twa no cat-and-dog life between they -- far from it they have each they own little way but it be rarely they quarrel and never for long at a time it be soon make up and many a time inger would suddenly be just as she have be in the old day work hard in the cowsh or in the field as if she have have a relapse into health again and at such time isak would look at he wife with grateful eye if he have be the sort of man to speak he mind at once he might have say h be what do this mean heh or something of the sort just to show he appreciate it but he wait too long and he praise come too late so inger no doubt find it not worth while and do not care to keep it up she might have have child till past fifty as it be she be perhaps hardly forty now she have learn all sort of thing at the institution -- have she also learn to play trick with herself she have come back so thoroughly train and educate after she long association with the other murderess maybe the man have teach she something too -- the gaoler the doctor she tell isak one day what one young medical man have say of she little crime : why should it be a criminal offence to kill child -- ay even healthy child they be nothing but lump of flesh after all isak ask : be not he terribly cruel himself then he exclaim inger and tell how kind he have be to she herself it be he who have get another doctor to operate on she mouth and make a human being of she now there be only a scar to be see only a scar yes and a fine woman she be in she way tall and not over-stout dark with rich hair in summer she go barefooted mostly and with she skirt kilt high inger be not afraid of let she calf be see isak see they -- as who do not they do not quarrel no isak have no talent for quarrel and he wife have grow readier-witted to answer back a thorough good quarrel take a long time to grow with isak heavy stub of a man as he be he find himself all entangled in she word and could say next to nothing himself and besides he be fond of she -- powerfully in love be isak and it be not often he have any need to answer inger do not complain he be a excellent husband in many way and she let he alone what have she to complain of at all isak be not a man to be despise she might have marry a worse wear out be he true he show sign of be tire now at time but nothing serious he be full of old health and unwasted strength like herself and in this autumn of they married life he fulfil he part at least as affectionately as she do but nothing particularly beautiful nor grand about he no and here come she superiority inger might well think to herself at time how she have see finer man handsome gentleman with walking-stick and handkerchief and starched collar to wear -- oh those gentleman of the town and so she keep isak in he place treat he as it be no better than he deserve he be only a peasant a clodhopper of the wild if she mouth have be as it be now from the start she would never have take he be sure of that no she could have do better than that the home he have give she the life he offer she be poor enough she might at least have marry some one from she own village and live among neighbor with a circle of friend instead of here like a outcast in the wild it be not the place for she now she have learn to look differently at life strange how one could come to look differently at thing inger find no pleasure now in admire a new calf she do not clap she hand in surprise when isak come down from the hill with a big basket of fish no she have live for six year among greater thing and of late she have even cease to be heavenly and sweet when she call he in to dinner you food 's ready be not you come in be all she say now and it do not sound nice isak wonder a little at first it be a curious way to speak a nasty uncaring take-it-or-leave-it way to speak and he answer : why i do not know 'twa ready but when inger point out that he ought to have know or might have guess it anyway by the sun he say no more and let the matter drop ah but once he get a hold on she and use it -- that be when she try to steal he money from he not that isak be a miser in that way but the money be clearly he ho it be nearly be ruin and disaster for she that time but even then it be not exactly thoroughgoing out-and-out wickedness on inger 's part she want the money for eleseus -- for she bless boy eleseus in town who be ask for he _ daler _ again be he to go there among all the fine folk and with empty pocket after all she have a mother 's heart she ask he father for the money first and find it be no good have take it herself whether isak have have some suspicion beforehand or have find it out by accident -- anyhow it be find out and suddenly inger find herself grip by both arm feel herself lift from the floor and thump down on to the floor again it be something strange and terrible -- a sort of avalanche isak 's hand be not weak not wear out now inger give a groan she head fall back she shiver and give up the money even then isak say little though inger make no attempt to hinder he from speak what he do say be utter as it be in one hard breath : huttch you -- you be not fit to have in the place she hardly know he again oh but it must have be long-stored bitterness that would not be repress a miserable day and a long night and a day beyond isak go out of the house and lay outside for all that there be hay to be get in sivert be with he father inger have little leopoldine and the animal to keep she company but lonely she be for all that cry nearly all the time and shake she head at herself only once in all she life before have she feel so move and this day call it to mind it be when she have lie in she bed and throttle a newborn child where be isak and he son they have not be idle no they have steal a day and a night or thereabout from the haymaking and have build a boat up on the lake oh a rough and poor-looking vessel enough but strong and sound as they work have always be they have a boat now and could go fishing with net when they come home the hay be dry as ever they have cheat providence by trust it and suffer no loss they have gain by it and then sivert fling out a arm and say : ho mother 's be haymake isak look down over the field and say h be isak have notice already that some of the hay have be shift inger ought to be home now for she midday meal it be well do indeed of she to get in the hay after he have scold she the day before and say huttch and it be no light hay to move she must have work hard and all the cow and goat to milk besides go in and get something to eat he say to sivert be not you come then no a little while after inger come out and stand humbly on the door-slab and say : if you would think of yourself a little -- and come in and have a bite to eat isak grumble at that and say h be but it be so strange a thing of late for inger to be humble in any way that he stubbornness be shake if you could manage to set a couple of tooth in my rake i could get on again with the hay say she ay she come to she husband the master of the place to ask for something and be grateful that he do not turn scornfully away you have work enough say he rake and cart and all no ` tis not enough i have no time anyway to mend rake now you can see there be rain come soon and isak go off to he work it be all mean to save she no doubt for the couple of minute it would have take to mend the rake would have be more than tenfold repay by let inger work on anyhow inger come out with she rake as it be and fall to haymake with a will sivert come up with the horse and haycart and all go at it sweating at the work and the hay be get in it be a good stroke of work and isak fall to think once more of the power above that guide all we way -- from steal a _ daler _ to get a crop of hay moreover there lay the boat after half a generation of think it over the boat be finish it be there up on the lake eyah _ herregud _ say isak chapter xv it be a strange evening altogether : a turning-point inger have be run off the line for a long time now and one lift up from the floor have set she in she place again neither speak of what have happen isak have feel ashamed of himself after -- all for the sake of a _ daler _ a trifle of money that he would have have to give she after all because he himself would gladly have let the boy have it and then again -- be not the money as much inger 's as he own there come a time when isak find it he turn to be humble there come many sort of time inger must have change she mind again it seem once more she be different gradually forget she fine way and turn earnest anew : a settler 's wife earnest and thoughtful as she have be before to think that a man 's hard grip could work such wonder but it be right here be a strong and healthy woman sensible enough but spoil and warped by long confinement in a artificial air -- and she have but into a man who stand firmly on he foot never for a moment have he leave he natural place on the earth on the soil nothing could move he many sort of time next year come the drought again kill the growth off slowly and wear down human courage the corn stand there and shrivel up the potato -- the wonderful potato -- they do not shrivel up but flowered and flower the meadow turn gray but the potato flower the power above guide all thing no doubt but the meadow be turn gray then one day come geissler -- ex-lensmand geissler come again at last it be good to find that he be not dead but have turn up again and what have he come for now geissler have no grand surprise with he this time by the look of it no purchase of mining rights and document and such-like geissler be poorly dress he hair and beard turn greyer and he eye redder at the edge than before he have no man either to carry he thing but have he papers in a pocket and not even a bag _ goddag _ say geissler _ goddag _ answer isak and inger here be the like of visitor to see this way geissler nod and thanks for all you do that time -- in trondhjem say inger all by herself and isak nod at that and say : ay ` tis two of we owe you thanks for that but geissler -- it be not he way to be all feeling and sentiment he say : yes i be just go across to sweden for all they trouble of mind over the drought sellanraa 's folk be glad to see geissler again they give he the best they have and be heartily glad to do what they could for he after all he have do geissler himself have no trouble that could be see he grow talkative at once look out over the field and nod he carry himself upright as ever and look as if he have several hundred of _ daler _ in he pocket it liven they up and brighten everything to have he there not that he make any boisterous fun but a lively talker that he be fine place sellanraa splendid place he say and now there be other come up one after another since you have start isak i count five myself be there any more seven in all there be two that can not be see from the road seven holding say fifty soul why it 'll be a densely populated neighborhood before long and you have a school already so i hear ay we have there -- what do i say a school all to yourselve down by brede 's place be more in the middle fancy brede as a farmer in the wild and geissler laugh at the thought ay i have hear all about you isak you be the best man here and i be glad of it sawmill too you have get ay such as it be but it serve I well enough and i have saw a bit now and again for they down below bravo that be the way i would be glad to hear what you think of it lensmand if so be you would care to look at that sawmill for yourself geissler nod with the air of a expert yes he would look at it examine it thoroughly then he ask : you have two boy have not you -- what be become of the other in town clerk in a office h be say geissler but this one here look a sturdy sort -- what be you name now sivert and the other one eleseus and he be in a engineer 's office -- what be he reckon to learn there a starvation-business much better have come to I say geissler ay say isak for politeness ' sake he feel a sort of pity for geissler at the moment oh that good man do not look as if he could afford to keep clerk have to work hard enough by himself belike that jacket -- it be wear to fringe at the wrist will not you have some dry hose to put on say inger and bring out a pair of she own they be from she best day fine and thin with a border no thanks say geissler shortly though he must have be wet through -- much better have come to I he say again speaking of eleseus i want he badly he take a small silver tobacco box from he pocket and sit play with it in he finger it be perhaps the only thing of value leave he now but geissler be restless change from one thing to another he slip the thing back into he pocket again and start a new theme but -- what be that why the meadow that be all gray i think it be the shadow the ground be simply parch come along with I sivert he rise from the table suddenly think no more of food turn in the doorway to say thank you to inger for the meal and disappear sivert follow they go across to the river geissler peer keenly about all the time here he cry and stop and then he explain : where 's the sense of let you land dry up to nothing when you have a river there big enough to drown it in a minute we 'll have that meadow green by tomorrow sivert all astonishment say yes dig down obliquely from here see -- on a slope the ground 's level have to make some sort of a channel you have a sawmill there -- i suppose you can find some long plank from somewhere good run and fetch a pick and spade and start here i 'll go back and mark out a proper line he run up to the house again he boot squelching for they be wet through he set isak to work make pipe a whole lot of they to be lay down where the ground could not well be cut with ditch isak try to object that the water might not get so far the dry ground would soak it up before it reach the parched field geissler explain that it would take some time the earth must drink a little first but then gradually the water would go on -- field and meadow green by this time tomorrow ho say isak and fall to boxing up long plank as hard as he could off hurry geissler to sivert once more : that be right -- keep at it -- do not i say he be a sturdy sort follow these stake you understand where i have mark out if you come up against heavy boulder or rock then turn aside and go round but keep the level -- the same depth you see what i mean then back to isak again : that be one finish -- good but we shall want more -- half a dozen perhaps keep at it isak you see we 'll have it all green by tomorrow -- we have save you crop and geissler sit down on the ground slap he knee with both hand and be delighted chatter away think in flash of lightning any pitch any oakum or anything about the place that be splendid -- get everything these thing 'll leak at the edge you see to begin with but the wood 'll swell after a while and they 'll be as taut as a bottle oakum and pitch -- fancy you have it too -- what build a boat you say where be the boat up in the lake good i must have a look at that too oh geissler be all promise light come light go -- and he seem more give to fuss about than before he work at thing by fit and start but at a furious rate when he do work there be a certain superiority about he after all true he exaggerate a bit -- it be impossible of course to get all green by this time tomorrow as he have say but for all that geissler be a sharp fellow quick to see and take a decision ay a strange man be geissler and it be he and no other that save the crop that year at sellanraa how many have you get do not enough the more wood you can lay the quicker it 'll flow make they twenty foot long or twenty-five if you can any plank that length on the place good fetch they along -- you 'll find it 'll pay you at harvest-time restless again -- up and off to sivert once more that be the way sivert man get on finely you father 's turn out culvert like a poet there 'll be more than i ever think run across and get some now and we 'll make a start all that afternoon be one hurry spell sivert have never see such a furious piece of work he be not accustom to see thing do at that pace they hardly give themselves time to eat but the water be flow already here and there they have to dig deeper a culvert have to be raise or lower but it flow the three man be at it till late that night touch up they work and keenly on the look out for any fault but when the water begin to trickle out over the driest spot there be joy and delight at sellanraa i forget to bring my watch say geissler what be the time i wonder ay she 'll be green by this time tomorrow say he sivert get up in the middle of the night to see how thing be go and find he father out already on the same errand oh but it be a thrilling time -- a day of great event but next day geissler stay in bed till nearly noon wear out now that the fit have pass he do not trouble to go up and look at the boat on the lake and but for what he have say the day before he would never have bother to look at the sawmill even the irrigation work interested he less than at first -- and when he see that neither field nor meadow have turn green in the course of the night he lose heart never think of how the water flow and flow all the time and spread out farther and farther over the ground he back down a little and say now : it may take time -- you will not see any change perhaps before tomorrow again but it 'll be all right never fear later in the day brede olsen come lounge in he have bring some sample of rock he want geissler to see and something out of the common this time to my mind say brede geissler would not look at the thing that the way you manage a farm he ask scornfully potter about up in the hill look for a fortune brede apparently do not fancy be take to task now by he former chief he answer sharply without any form of respect treat the ex-lensmand as a equal : if you think i care what you say you have no more sense than you have before say geissler fooling away you time what about yourself say brede what about you i would like to know you have get a mine of you own up here and what have you do with it huh lie there do nothing ay you be the sort to have a mine be not you he he get out of this say geissler and brede do not stay long but shoulder he load of sample and go down to he own _ menage _ without say good-bye geissler sit down and begin to look over some papers with a thoughtful air he seem to have catch a touch of the fever himself and want now to look over that business of the copper mine the contract the analysis it be fine ore almost pure copper he must do something with it and not let everything slide what i really come up for be to get the whole thing settle he say to isak i have be think of make a start here and that very soon get a lot of man to work and run the thing properly what do you think isak feel sorry for the man and would not say anything against it it be a matter that concern you as well you know there 'll be a lot of bother of course a lot of man about the place and a bit rowdy at time perhaps and blast up in the hill -- i do not know how you 'll like that on the other hand there 'll be more life in the district where we begin and you 'll have a good market close at hand for farm produce and that sort of thing fix you own price too ay say isak besides you share in the mine -- you 'll get a high percentage of earnings you know big money isak say isak : you have pay I fairly already and more than enough next morning geissler leave hurry off eastward over toward sweden no thanks he say shortly when isak offer to go with he it be almost painful to see he start off in that poor fashion on foot and all alone inger have put up a fine parcel of food for he to take all as nice as she could make it and make some wafer specially to put in even that be not enough she would have give he a can of cream and a whole lot of egg but he would not carry they and inger be disappointed geissler himself must have find it hard to leave sellanraa without pay as he generally do for he keep so he pretend that he have pay make as if he have lay down a big note in payment and say to little leopoldine : here child here 's something for you as well and with that he give she the silver box he tobacco box you can rinse it out and use it to keep pin and thing in he say it be not the sort of thing for a present really if i be at home i could have find she something else i have a heap of thing but geissler 's waterwork remain after geissler have go there it be work wonder day and night week after week the field turn green the potato cease to flower the corn shoot up the settler from the holding farther down begin to come up all anxious to see the marvel for themselves axel ström -- the neighbor from maaneland the man who have no wife and no woman to help he but manage for himself -- he come too he be in a good humor that day he tell they how he have just get a promise of a girl to help through the summer -- and that be a weight off he mind he do not say who the girl be and isak do not ask but it be brede 's girl barbro who be to come it would cost the price of a telegram to bergen to fetch she but axel pay the money though he be not one of you extravagant sort but rather something of a miser it be the waterwork business that have entice he up today he have look it over from one end to the other and be highly interested there be no big river on he land but he have a bit of a stream he have no plank either to make culvert with but he would dig he channel in the earth it could be do up to now thing be not absolutely at they worst on he land which lay lower down the slope but if the drought continue he too would have to irrigate when he have see what he want he take he leave and go back at once no he would not come in have not the time he be go to start ditch that same evening and off he go this be something different from brede 's way oh brede he could run about the moorland farm now tell news : miraculous waterworks at sellanraa it do not pay to work you soil overmuch he have say look at isak up there he be dig and dig about so long that at last he be have to water the whole ground isak be patient but he wish many a time that he could get rid of the fellow hang about sellanraa with he boastful way brede put it all down to the telegraph as long as he be a public official it be he duty to keep the line in order but the telegraph company have already have occasion several time to reprimand he for neglect and have again offer the post to isak no it be not the telegraph that be in brede 's mind all the time but the ore up in the hill it be he one idea now a mania he take to drop in often now at sellanraa confident that he have find the treasure he would nod he head and say : i can not tell you all about it yet but i do not mind say i have strike something remarkable this time waste hour and energy all for nothing and when he come back in the evening to he little house he would fling down a little sack of sample on the floor and puff and blow after he day 's work as if no man could have toil harder for he daily bread he grow a few potato on sour peaty soil and cut the tuft of grass that grow by themselves on the ground about the house -- that be brede 's farming he be never make for a farmer and there could be but one end to it all he turf roof be fall to piece already and the step to the kitchen be rotten with damp a grindstone lay on the ground and the cart be still leave uncovered in the open brede be fortunate perhaps in that such little matter never trouble he when the child roll he grindstone about for play he be kind and indulgent and would even help they to roll it himself a easy-going idle nature never serious but also never down-heart a weak irresponsible character but he manage to find food such as it be and keep himself and he alive from day to day manage to keep they somehow but it be not to be expect that the storekeeper could go on feed brede and he family for ever he have say so more than once to brede himself and he say it now in earnest brede admit he be right and promise to turn over a new leaf -- he would sell he place and very likely make a good thing out of it -- and pay what he owe at the store oh but brede would sell out anyhow even at a loss what be the good of a farm for he he be home-sick for the village again the easy gossip life there and the little shop -- it suit he better than settle down here to work and try to forget the world outside could he ever forget the christmas tree and party or the national feasting on constitution day or the bazaar hold in the meeting-room he love to talk with he kind to exchange news and view but who be there to talk with here inger up at sellanraa have seem to be one of he sort for a while but then she have change -- there be no get a word out of she now and besides she have be in prison and for a man in he position -- no it would never do no he have make a mistake in ever leave the village it be throw himself away he note with envy that the lensmand have get another assistant and the doctor another man to drive for he he have run away from the people who need he and now that he be no longer there they manage without he but the man who have take he place -- they be no earthly good of course properly speak he brede ought to be fetch back to the village in triumph then there be barbro -- why have he back up the idea of get she to go as help to sellanraa well that be after talk over thing with he wife if all go well it might mean a good future for the girl perhaps a future of a sort for all of they all very well to be housekeeper for two young clerk in bergen but who could say what she would get out of that in the long run barbro be a pretty girl and like to look well there might be a better chance for she here after all for there be two son at sellanraa but when brede see that this plan would never come to anything he hit on another after all there be no great catch in marry into inger 's lot -- inger who have be in prison and there be other lad to be think of besides those two sellanraa boy -- there be axel ström for instance he have a farm and a hut of he own he be a man who scrape and save and little by little manage to get hold of a bit of live stock and such-like but with no wife and no woman to help he well i do not mind tell you if you take barbro she 'll be all the help you 'll need say brede to he look here 's she picture you can see and after a week or so come barbro axel be in the midst of he haymaking and have to do he mowing by day and haymaking by night and all by himself -- and then come barbro it be a godsend barbro soon show she be not afraid of work she wash clothes and clean thing cook and milk and help in the hayfield -- help to carry in the hay she do axel determine to give she good wages and not lose by it she be not merely a photograph of a fine lady here barbro be straight and thin speak somewhat hoarsely show sense and experience in various way -- she be not a child axel wonder what make she so thin and haggard in the face i would know you by you look he say but you be not like the photograph that be only the journey she say and live in town air all that time and indeed she very soon grow plump and well-looking again take my word for it say barbro it pull you down a bit a journey like that and live in town like that she hint also at the temptation of life in bergen -- one have to be careful there but while they sit talk she beg he to take in a paper -- a bergen newspaper -- so that she could read a bit and see the news of the world she have get accustom to reading and theater and music and it be so dull in a place like this axel be please with the result of he summer help and take in a paper he also bear with the frequent visit of the brede family who be constantly drop in at he place and eating and drinking he be anxious to show that he appreciate this servant-girl of he and what could be nicer and homelier than when barbro sit there of a Sunday evening twang the string of a guitar and singing a little with she hoarse voice axel be touch by it all by the pretty strange song by the mere fact that some one really sit there singing on he poor half-baked farm true in the course of the summer he learn to know other side of barbro 's character but on the whole he be content she have she fancy and could answer hastily at time be somewhat over-quick to answer back that Saturday evening for instance when axel himself have to go down to the village to get some thing it be wrong of barbro to run away from the hut and the animal and leave the place to itself they have a few word over that and where have she be only to she home to breidablik but still when axel come back to the hut that night barbro be not there he look to the animal get himself something to eat and turn in towards morning barbro come i only want to see what it be like to step on a wooden floor again she say somewhat scornfully and axel could find nothing much to say to that see that he have as yet but a turf hut with a floor of beaten earth he do say however that if it come to that he could get a few plank himself and no doubt but he would have a house with a wooden floor himself in time barbro seem penitent at that she be not altogether unkindly and for all it be Sunday she go off at once to the wood and gather fresh juniper twig to spread on the earthen floor and then see she be so fine-hearted and behave so splendidly what could axel do but bring out the kerchief he have buy for she the evening before though he have really think of keep it by a while and get something respectable out of she in return and there she be please with it and try it on at once -- ay she turn to he and ask if she do not look nice in it and yes indeed she do and she might put on he old fur cap if she like and she would look nice in that barbro laugh at this and try to say something really nice in return she say : i would far rather go to church and communion in this kerchief than wear a hat in bergen of course we always wear hat -- all except common servant-girl from the country friend again as nice as could be and when axel bring out the newspaper he have fetch from the post office barbro sit down to read news of the world : of a burglary at a jeweller 's shop in one bergen street and a quarrel between two gipsy in another of a horrible find in the harbor -- the dead body of a newborn child sew up in a old shirt with the sleeve cut off i wonder who can have do it say barbro and she read the list of marketing price too as she always do so the summer pass chapter xvi great change at sellanraa there be no know the place again after what it have be at first : sawmill cornmill building of all sort and kind -- the wilderness be peopled country now and there be more to come but inger be perhaps the strangest of all so altered she be and good and clever again the great event of last year when thing have come to a head be hardly enough in itself perhaps to change she careless way there be backslide now and then as when she find herself begin to talk of the institute again and the cathedral at trondhjem oh innocent thing enough and she take off she ring and let down that bold skirt of hers some inch she be grow thoughtful there be more quiet about the place and visit be less frequent the girl and woman from the village come but rarely now for inger no longer care to see they no one can live in the depth of the wild and have time for such foolishness happiness and nonsense be two different thing in the wild each season have its wonder but always unchangingly there be that immense heavy sound of heaven and earth the sense of be surround on all side the darkness of the forest the kindliness of the tree all be heavy and soft no thought be impossible there north of sellanraa there be a little tarn a mere puddle no bigger than a aquarium there live some tiny baby fish that never grow bigger live and die there and be no use at all -- _ herregud _ no use on earth one evening inger stand there listen for the cowbell all be dead about she she hear nothing and then come a song from the tarn a little little song hardly there at all almost lose it be the tiny fish ' song \* \* \* \* \* they have this good fortune at sellanraa that every spring and autumn they could see the gray goose sailing in fleet above that wilderness and hear they chatter up in the air -- delirious talk it be and as if the world stand still for a moment till the train of they have pass and the human soul beneath do they not feel a weakness glide through they now they go to they work again but draw breath first something have speak to they something from beyond great marvel be about they at all time in the winter be the star in winter often too the northern light a firmament of wing a conflagration in the mansion of god now and then not often not commonly but now and then they hear the thunder it come mostly in the autumn and a dark and solemn thing it be for man and beast the animal grazing near home would bunch together and stand wait bow they head -- what for wait for the end and man what of man standing in the wild with bow head wait when the thunder come wait for what the spring -- ay with its haste and joy and madcap delight but the autumn it call up a fear of darkness drive one to a evening prayer there be vision about and warning on the air folk might go out one day in autumn seek for something -- the man for a piece of timber to he work the woman after cattle that run wild now after mushroom growth : they would come home with many secret in they mind do they tread unexpectedly upon a ant crush its hind part fast to the path so the fore part could not free itself again or step too near a white grouse nest put up a flutter hiss mother to dash against they even the big cow-mushroom be not altogether meaningless not a mere white emptiness in the eye the big mushroom do not flower it do not move but there be something overturn in the look of it it be a monster a thing like a lung standing there alive and naked -- a lung without a body inger grow despondent at last the wild oppress she she turn religious how could she help it no one can help it in the wild life there be not all earthly toil and worldliness there be piety and the fear of death and rich superstition inger maybe feel that she have more reason than other to fear the judgment of heaven and it would not pass she by she know how god walk about in the evening time look out over all he wilderness with fabulous eye ay he would find she there be not so much in she daily life wherein she could improve true she might bury she gold ring deep in the bottom of a clothes chest and she could write to eleseus and tell he to be convert too after that there be nothing more she could find beyond do she work well and not spare herself ay one thing more she could dress in humble thing only fasten a blue ribbon at she neck of sunday false unnecessary poverty -- but it be the expression of a kind of philosophy self-humiliation stoicism the blue ribbon be not new it have be cut from a cap little leopoldine have grow out of it be fade here and there and to tell the truth a little dirty -- inger wear it now as a piece of modest finery on holy day ay it may be that she go beyond reason feign to be poor strive falsely to imitate the wretched who live in hovel but even so -- would she desert have be greater if that sorry finery have be she best leave she in peace she have a right to peace she overdo thing finely and work harder than she ought there be two man on the place but inger take the chance when both be away at once and set to work herself saw wood and where be the good of torture and mortify the flesh that way she be so insignificant a creature so little worth she power of so common a sort she death or life would not be notice in the land in the state only here in the wild here she be almost great -- at any rate the greatest and she may well have think herself worth all the chastening she order and endure she husband say : sivert and i we have be talk about this we be not go to have you saw wood and wear yourself out i do it for conscience ' sake she answer conscience the word make isak thoughtful once more he be get on in year slow to think but weighty when he do come to anything conscience must be something pretty strong if it could turn inger all upside down like that and however it might be inger 's conversion make a change in he also he catch it from she grow tame and give to ponder life be all heavy-like and stern that winter he seek for loneliness for a hiding-place to save he own tree he have buy up a piece of the state forest near by with some good timber over toward the swedish side and he do the felling now alone refuse all help sivert be order to stay at home and see that he mother do not work too much and so in those short winter day isak go out to he work in the dark and come home in the dark it be not always there be a moon or any star and at time he own track of the morning would be cover with snow by nightfall so he be hard put to it to find he way and one evening something happen he be near home in the fine moonlight he could see sellanraa there on the hillside neat and clear of the forest but small undergroundish to look at by reason of the snow bank high against the wall he have more timber now and it be to be a grand surprise for inger and the child when they hear what use he would make of it -- the wonderful building he have in mind he sit down in the snow to rest a bit not to seem wear out when he come home all be quiet around he and god 's blessing on this quiet and thoughtfulness for it be nothing but good isak be a man at work on a clearing in the forest and he look out over the ground reckon what be to be clear next turn heave aside great stone in he mind -- isak have a real talent for that work there he know now be a deep bare patch on he ground it be full of ore there be always a metallic film over every puddle of water there -- and now he will dig it out he mark out square with he eye make he plan for all speculate over all they be to be make green and fruitful oh but a piece of tilled soil be a great and good thing it be like right and order to he mind and a delight beyond he get up and feel suddenly confuse h be what have happen now nothing only that he have be sit down a bit now there be something standing there before he a be a spirit gray silk -- no it be nothing he feel strange -- take one short uncertain step forward and walk straight into a look a great look a pair of eye at the same moment the aspen close by begin rustling now any one know that a aspen can have a horrible eerie way of rustling at time anyhow isak have never before hear such a utterly horrible rustling as this and he shudder also he put out one hand in front of he and it be perhaps the most helpless movement that hand have ever make but what be this thing before he be it ghost-work or reality isak would all he day have be ready to swear that this be a higher power and once indeed he have see it but the thing he see now do not look like god possibly the holy ghost if so what be it stand there for anyway in the midst of nowhere two eye a look and nothing more if it have come to he to fetch away he soul why so it would have to be it would happen one day after all and then he would go to heaven and be among the blest isak be eager to see what would come next he be shiver still a coldness seem to radiate from the figure before he -- it must be the evil one and here isak be no longer sure of he ground so to speak it might be the evil one -- but what do he want here what have he isak be do nothing but sit still and till the ground as it be in he thought -- there could surely be no harm in that there be no other guilt he could call to mind just then he be only come back from he work in the forest a tired and hungry woodman go home to sellanraa -- he mean no harm he take a step forward again but it be only a little one and to tell the truth he step back again immediately the vision would not give way isak knit he brow as if begin to suspect something if it be the evil one why let it be the evil one be not all-powerful -- there be luther for instance who have nearly kill the fiend himself not to speak of many who have put he to flight by the sign of the cross and jesu name not that isak mean to defy the peril before he it be not in he mind to sit down and laugh in its face but he certainly give up he first idea of die and the next world he take two step forward straight at the vision cross himself and cry out : in jesu name h be at the sound of he own voice he come as it be to himself again and see sellanraa over on the hillside once more the two eye in the air have go he lose no time in get home and take no step to challenge the spectre further but when he find himself once more safely on he own door-slab he clear he throat with a sense of power and security he walk into the house with lofty mien like a man -- ay a man of the world inger start at the sight of he and ask what make he so pale and at that he do not deny have meet the evil one himself where she ask over there right up towards we place inger evince no jealousy on she part she do not praise he for it true but there be nothing in she manner suggestive of a hard word or a contemptuous kick inger herself you see have grow somewhat lighter of heart and kindlier of late whatever the cause and now she merely ask : the evil one himself isak nod : as far as he could see it be himself and no other and how do you get rid of he i go for he in jesu name say isak inger wag she head altogether overwhelm and it be some time before she could get he supper on the table anyhow say she at last we 'll have no more of you go out alone in the wood by yourself she be anxious about he -- and it do he good to know it he make out to be as bold as ever and altogether careless whether he go alone or in company but this be only to quiet inger 's mind not to frighten she more than necessary with the awful thing that have happen to himself it be he place to protect she and they all he be the man the leader but inger see through it also and say : oh i know you do not want to frighten I but you must take sivert with you all the same isak only sniff you might be take poorly of a sudden take ill out in the wood -- you have not be over well lately isak sniff again ill tired perhaps and wear out a bit but ill no need for inger to start worry and make a fool of he he be sound and well enough eat sleep and work he health be simply terrific it be incurable once fell a tree the thing have come down on top of he and break he ear but he make light of it he set the ear in place again and keep it there by wear he cap draw over it night and day and it grow together again that way for internal complaint he dose himself with _ treak _ boil in milk to make he sweat -- liquorice it be buy at the store a old and try remedy the _ teriak _ of the ancient if he chance to cut he hand he treat the wound with a ever-present fluid contain salt and it heal up in a few day no doctor be ever send for to sellanraa no isak be not ill a meeting with the evil one might happen even to the healthiest man and he feel none the worse for he adventure afterwards on the contrary it seem to have strengthen he and as the winter draw on and it be not such a dreadful time to wait till the spring he the man and the leader begin to feel himself almost a hero : he understand these thing only trust to he and all would be well in case of need he could exorcise the evil one himself altogether the day be longer and lighter now easter be past isak have haul up all he timber everything look bright human being could breathe again after another winter go inger be again the first to brighten up she have be more cheerful now for a long time what could it be ho 'twa for a very simple reason inger be heavy again expect a child again everything work out easily in she life no hitch anywhere but what a mercy after the way she have sin it be more than she have any right to expect ay she be fortunate fortunate isak himself actually notice something one day and ask she straight out : look to I as if you be on the way again what do you say yourself ay lord be thank ` tis surely so she answer they be both equally astonished not that inger be past the age of course to isak 's mind she be not too old in any way but still another child well well and little leopoldine go to school several time a year down at breidablik -- that leave they with no little one about the place now -- besides which leopoldine herself be grow up now some day pass and isak resolutely throw away a whole week-end -- from Saturday evening till Monday morning -- on a trip down to the village he would not say what he be go for when he set out but on he return he bring with he a girl this be jensine he say come to help ` tis all you nonsense say inger i have no need of help at all isak answer that she do need a help -- just now need or not -- it be a kind and generous thought of he inger be abashed and grateful the new girl be a daughter of the blacksmith and she be to stay with they for the present through the summer anyhow and then they would see and i have send a telegram say isak after he eleseus this fairly startled inger startle the mother a telegram do he mean to upset she completely with he thoughtfulness it have be she great sorrow of late that boy eleseus be away in town -- in the evil-minded town she have write to he about god and likewise explain to he how he father here be begin to sink under the work and the place get bigger all the time little sivert could not manage it all by himself and besides he be to have money after he uncle one day -- all this she have write and send he the money for he journey once for all but eleseus be a man-about-town now and have no sort of longing for a peasant 's life he answer something about what be he to do anyway if he do come home work on a farm and throw away all the knowledge and learn he have gain in point of fact -- that be how he put it -- i have no desire to come back now and if you could send I some stuff for underclothes it would save I get the thing on credit so he write and yes he mother send he stuff -- send he remarkable quantity of stuff from time to time for underclothes but when she be convert and get religion the scale fall from she eye and she understand that eleseus be sell the stuff and spend the money on other thing he father see it too he never speak of it he know that eleseus be he mother 's darling and how she cry over he and shake she head but one piece of finely weave stuff go after another the same way and he know it be more than any live man could use for underclothes altogether it come to this : isak must be man and leader again -- head of the house and step in and interfere it have cost a terrible lot of money to be sure get the storekeeper to send a telegram but in the first place a telegram could not fail to make a impression on the boy and also -- it be something unusually fine for isak himself to come home and tell inger he carry the servant-girl 's box on he back as he stride home but for all that he be proud and full of weighty secret as he have be the day he come home with that gold ring it be a grand time after that for a long while inger could not do enough in the way of show she husband how good and useful she could be she would say to he now as in the old day : you be work yourself to death or again : ` tis more than any man can stand or again : now you be not to work any more come in and have dinner -- i have make some wafer for you and to please he she say : i should just like to know now what you have get in you mind with all that wood and what you be go to build now next why i can not say as yet say isak make a mystery of it ay just as in the old day and after the child be bear -- and it be a little girl -- a great big girl fine-looking and sturdy and sound -- after that isak must have be a stone and a miserable creature if he have not thank god but what be he go to build it would be more news for oline to go gad about with -- a new building again at sellanraa a new wing of the house -- a new house it be to be and there be so many now at sellanraa -- they have a servant-girl and eleseus he be come home and a brand-new little girl-child of they own just come -- the old house would be just a extra room now nothing more and of course he have to tell inger about it one day she be so curious to know and though maybe inger know it all beforehand from sivert -- they two be often whisper together -- she be all surprise as any one could be and let she arm fall and say : ` tis all you nonsense -- you do not mean it and isak brimming over with greatness inside he answer she : why with you bring i do not know how many more child on the place ` tis the least i can do it seem the two menfolk be out now every day get stone for the wall of the new house they work they utmost together each in he own way : the one young and with he young body firmly set quick to see he way to mark out the stone that would suit the other ageing -- tough with long arm and a mighty weight to bear down on a crowbar when they have manage some specially difficult feat they would hold a breathing-space and talk together in a curious reserved fashion of they own brede he talk of sell out say the father ay say the son wonder what he 'll be ask for the place ay i wonder you have not hear anything no i have hear two hundred the father think for a while and say : what d'you think 'll this be a good stone all depend if we can get this shell off he say sivert and be on he foot in a moment give the setting-hammer to he father and take the sledge himself he grow red and hot stand up to he full height and let the sledge-hammer fall rise again and let it fall twenty stroke alike -- twenty thunder-stroke he spare neither tool nor strength it be heavy work he shirt ruck up from he trousers at the waist leave he bare in front he lift on he toe each time to give the sledge a better swing twenty stroke now let 's look cry he father the son stop and ask : marked he any and they lay down together to look at the stone look at the beast the devil of a thing no not mark any as yet i have a mind to try with the sledge alone say the father and stand up still harder work this sheer force alone the hammer grow hot the steel crush the pen grow blunt she 'll be slip the head he say and stop and i be no hand at this any more he say oh but he never mean it it be not he thought that he be no hand at the work any more this father this barge of a man simple full of patience and goodness he would let he son strike the last few blow and cleave the stone and there it lay split in two ay you have the trick of it say the father h be yes breidablik might make something but of that place ay should think so say the son only the land be fairly ditched and turn the house would have to be do up ay that of course place all do up -- ` twould mean a lot of work at first but what i be go to say d'you know if you mother be go to church come Sunday ay she say something like it ho h be keep you eye open now and look out for a good big door-slab for the new house you have not see a bit would do no say sivert and they fall to work again a couple of day later both agree they have enough stone now for the wall it be Friday evening they sit take a breathing-space and talk together the while h be -- what d'you say say the father should we think it over maybe about breidablik how d'you mean ask the son what to do with it why i do not know there be the school there and it be midway down this tract now and what then ask the son i do not know what we would do with it though it be not worth much as it be that be what you have be think of no not that way unless eleseus he would like to have the place to work on eleseus well no i do not know -- long pause the two man think hard the father begin gather tool together pack up to go home ay unless say sivert you might ask he what he say the father make a end of the matter thus : well there be another day and we have not find that door-slab yet either next day be Saturday and they have to be off early to get across the hill with the child jensine the servant-girl be to go with they that be one godmother the rest they would have to find from among inger 's folk on the other side inger look nice she have make herself a dainty cotton dress with white at the neck and wrist the child be all in white with a new blue silk ribbon draw through the lower edge of its dress but then she be a wonder of a child to be sure that could smile and chatter already and lay and listen when the clock strike on the wall she father have choose she name it be he right he be determine to have he say -- only trust to he he have hesitate between jacobine and rebecca as be both sort of related to isak and at last he go to inger and ask timidly : what d'you think now of rebecca why yes say inger and when isak hear that he grow suddenly independent and master in he own house if she be to have a name at all he say sharply it shall be rebecca i 'll see to that and of course he be go with the party to church partly to carry and partly for propriety 's sake it would never do to let rebecca go to be christen without a decent follow isak trim he beard and put on a red shirt as in he younger day it be in the worst of the hot weather but he have a nice new winter suit that look well on he and he wear it but for all that isak be not the man to make a duty of finery and show as now for instance he put on a pair of fabulously heavy boot for the march sivert and leopoldine stay behind to look after the place then they row in a boat across the lake and that be a deal easier than before when they have have to walk round all the way but half-way across as inger unfasten she dress to nurse the child isak notice something bright hung in a string round she neck whatever it might be and in the church he notice that she wear that gold ring on she finger oh inger -- it have be too much for she after all chapter xvii eleseus come home he have be away now for some year and have grow taller than he father with long white hand and a little dark growth on he upper lip he do not give himself air but seem anxious to appear natural and kindly he mother be surprised and pleased he share the small bedroom with sivert the two brother get on well together and be constantly play trick on each other by way of amusement but naturally eleseus have to take he share of the work in build the house and tired and miserable it make he all unused as he be to bodily fatigue of any kind it be worse still when sivert have to go off and leave it all to the other two eleseus then be almost more of a hindrance than a help and where have sivert go off to why 'twa oline have come over the hill one day with word from uncle sivert that he be die and of course young sivert have to go a nice state of thing all at once -- it could not have happen worse than to have sivert run off just now but there be no help for it say oline : i would no time to go run errand and that be the truth but for all that i have take a fancy to the child here all of they and little sivert and if as i could help he to he legacy but be uncle sivert very bad then bad heaven bless we he be fall away day by day be he in bed then in bed how can you talk so light and flighty of death before god 's judgment-seat nay he 'll neither hop nor run again in this world will you uncle sivert all this seem to mean that uncle sivert have not long to live and inger insist that little sivert should set off at once but uncle sivert incorrigible old knave be not on he death-bed be not even confine to bed at all when young sivert come he find the little place in terrible muddle and disorder they have not finish the spring season 's work properly yet -- have not even cart out all the winter manure but as for approach death there be no sign of it that he could see uncle sivert be a old man now over seventy he be something of a invalid and pottered about half-dressed in the house and often keep he bed for a time he need help on the place in many way as for instance with the herr net that hang rot in the shed oh but for all that he be by no means at he last gasp he could still eat sour fish and smoke he pipe when sivert have be there half a hour and see how thing be he be for go back home again home say the old man we be build a house and father 's none to help he properly ho say he uncle be not eleseus come home then ay but he be not use to the work then why do you come at all sivert tell he about oline and she message how she have say that uncle sivert be on the point of death point of death cry the old man say i be on the point of death do she a cursed old fool ha ha ha say sivert the old man look sternly at he eh laugh at a die man do you and you call after I and all but sivert be too young to put on a graveyard face for that he have never care much for he uncle and now he want to get back home again ho so you think so too say the old man again think i be at my last gasp and that fetch you do it 'twa oline say so answer sivert he uncle be silent for a while then speak again : look you here if you 'll mend that net of mine and put it right i 'll show you something h be say sivert what be it well never you mind say the old man sullenly and go to bed again it be go to be a long business evidently sivert writhe uncomfortably he go out and take a look round the place everything be shamefully neglect and uncared for it be hopeless to begin work here when he come in after a while he uncle be sit up warm himself at the stove see that he point to a oak chest on the floor at he foot it be he money chest as a matter of fact it be a line case make to hold bottle such as visit justice and other great folk use to carry with they when travel about the country in the old day but there be no bottle in it now the old man have use it for he document and papers as district treasurer he keep he account and he money in it now the story run that it be full of uncounted riches the village folk would shake they head and say : ah if i would only as much as lie in old sivert he chest uncle sivert take out a paper from the box and say solemnly : you can read write i suppose little sivert be not by any mean a great hand at that it be true but he make out so much as tell he he be to inherit all that he uncle might leave at he death there say the old man and now you can do as you please and he lay the paper back in the chest sivert be not greatly impressed after all the paper tell he no more than he have know before ever since he be a child he have hear say that he be to have what uncle sivert leave one day a sight of the treasure would be another matter there be some fine thing in that chest i doubt say he there be more than you think say the old man shortly he be angry and disappointed with he nephew he lock up the box and go to bed again there he lay deliver jet of information i have be district treasurer and warden of the public money in this village over thirty year _ i have _ no need to beg and pray for a help hand from any man who tell oline i would like to know that i be on my deathbed i can send three man carriage and cart to fetch a doctor if i want one do not try you game with I young man can not even wait till i be go it seem i have show you the document and you have see it and it be there in the chest -- that be all i have get to say but if you go run off and leave I now you can just carry word to eleseus and tell _ he _ to come he be not name after I and call by my earthly name -- let _ he _ come but for all the threatening tone sivert only think a moment and say : ay i 'll tell eleseus to come oline be still at sellanraa when sivert get back she have find time to pay a visit lower down to axel ström and barbro on they place and come back full of mystery and whispering that girl barbro 's fill out a deal of late -- lord know what it may mean but not a word that i have say so and here 's sivert back again no need to ask what news i suppose you uncle sivert 's pass away ay well a old man he be and a aged one on the brink of the grave what -- not dead well well we have much to be thankful for and that be a solemn word I talk nonsense you say oh if i would never more to answer for how be i to know you uncle he be lie there a sham and a false pretender before the lord not long to live that be what i say and i 'll hold by it when the time come before the throne what be that you say well and be not he lie there he very self in he bed and folding he hand on he breast and say ` twould soon be over there be no argue with oline she bewilder she adversary with talk and cast they down when she learn that uncle sivert have send for eleseus she grasp at that too and make she own advantage of it : there you be and see if i be talk nonsense here 's old sivert call up he kinsfolk and longing for a sight of he own flesh and blood ay he be near he end you can not refuse he eleseus off with you at once this minute and see you uncle while there be life in he i be go that way too we 'll go together oline do not leave sellanraa without take inger aside for more whispering of barbro not a word i have say -- but i could see the sign of it and now i suppose she 'll be wife and all on the farm there ay there be some folk be bear to great thing for all they may be small as the sand of the sea in they beginning and who would have ever think it of that girl barbro axel yes never doubt but he be a toiling sort and get on and great fine land and means and all like you have get here -- ` tis more than we know of over on we side the hill as you know 's a true word inger be bear and come of the place yourself barbro she would a trifle of wool in a chest 'twa naught but winter wool and i be not ask and she never offer I we say but _ goddag _ and _ farvel _ for all that i would know she from she be a toddle child all that time i be here at sellanraa by reason of you be away and learn knowledge at the institute there be rebecca cry say inger breaking in on oline but she give she a handful of wool then a great thanksgiving speech from oline : ay be not it just as she have say to barbro herself of inger and how there be not she like to be find for give to folk ay she would give till she be bare and give she finger to the bone and never complain ay go in and see to the sweet angel and never be there a child in the world so like she mother as rebecca -- no do inger remember how she would say one day as she would never have child again ah now she could see no better give ear to they as be grow old and have bear child of they own for who should fathom the lord he way say oline and with that she pad off after eleseus up through the forest shrunken with age gray and abject and for ever nose after thing imperishable go to old sivert now to let he know how she oline have manage to persuade eleseus to come but eleseus have need no persuade there be no difficulty there for look you eleseus have turn out better after all than he would begin a decent lad in he way kindly and easy-going from a child only nothing great in the way of bodily strength it be not without reason he have be unwilling to come home this time he know well enough that he mother have be in prison for child-murder he have never hear a word about it there in the town but at home in the village every one would remember and it be not for nothing he have be live with companion of another sort he have grow to be more sensitive and finer feeling than ever before he know that a fork be really just as necessary as a knife as a man of business he use the term of the new coinage whereas out in the wild man still count money by the ancient _ daler _ ay he be not unwilling to walk across the hill to other part here at home he be constantly force to keep down he own superiority he try he best to adapt himself to the other and he manage well but it be always have to be on he guard as for instance when he have first come back to sellanraa a couple of week ago he have bring with he he light spring overcoat though it be midsummer and when he hang it up on a nail he might just as well have turn it so as to show the silver plate inside with he initial but he do not and the same with he stick -- he walking-stick true it be only a umbrella stick really that he have dismantle and take the framework off but here he have not use it as he do in town swing it about -- only carry it hide against he thigh no it be not surprising that eleseus go across the hill he be no good at build house he be good at write with letter a thing not every one could do but here at home there be no one in all the place that set any store by the art of it save perhaps he mother he set off gaily through the wood far ahead of oline he could wait for she farther up he run like a calf he hurry eleseus have in a way steal off from the farm he be afraid of be see for to tell the truth he have take with he both spring coat and walking-stick for the journey over on the other side there might be a chance of see people and be see himself he might even be able to go to church and so he sweat happily under the weight of a unnecessary spring coat in the heat of the sun they do not miss he at the building far from it isak have sivert back again and sivert be worth a host of he brother at that work he could keep at it from morning to night it do not take they long to get the framework up it be only three wall as they be build out from the other and they have less trouble with the timber they could cut they plank at the sawmill which give they the outside piece for roofing at the same time and one fine day there be the house all finish before they eye roof floor and with the window in they have no time for more than this between the season the board and paint would have to wait and now come geissler with a great follow across the hill from sweden and the man with he ride on horseback with glossy-coated horse and yellow saddle rich traveller they must be no doubt stout heavy man the horse bow under they weight and among all these great personage come geissler on foot four gentleman and geissler make up the party and then there be a couple of servant each lead a packhorse the rider dismount outside the farm and geissler say : here 's isak -- here be the margrave of the place himself _ goddag _ isak i have come back again you see as i say i would geissler be the same as ever for all that he come on foot he manner show no consciousness of inferiority to the rest ay he threadbare coat hang long and wretched-look down over he shrunken back but he put on a grand enough air for all that he even say : we be go up into the hill a bit these gentleman and myself -- it 'll do they good to get they weight down a bit the gentleman themselves be nice and pleasant enough they smile at geissler 's word and hope isak would excuse they come rioting over he land like this they have bring they own provision and do not propose to eat he out of house and home but they would be glad of a roof over they head for the night perhaps he could put they up in the new building there when they have rest a while and geissler have be inside with inger and the child the whole party go up into the hill and stay out till evening now and again in the course of the afternoon the folk at sellanraa could hear a unusually heavy report from the distance and the train of they come down with new bag of sample blue copper they say nod at the ore they talk long and learnedly and consult a sort of map they have draw there be a engineer among they and a mining expert one appear to be a big landowner or manager of work they talk of aerial railway and cable traction geissler throw in a word here and there and each time as if advise they they pay great attention to what he say who own the land south of the lake one of they ask isak the state answer geissler quickly he be wide awake and sharp and hold in he hand the document isak have once sign with he mark i tell you before -- the state he say no need to ask again if you do not believe I you can find out for yourself if you please later in the evening geissler take isak aside and say : look here shall we sell that copper mine say isak : why as to that 'twa so that lensmand buy it of I once and pay for it true say geissler i buy the ground but then there be a provision that you be to have a percentage of receipt from work or sale be you willing to dispose of you share this be more than isak could understand and geissler have to explain isak could not work a mine be a farmer and a clearer of forest land geissler himself could not run a mine either money capital ho as much as he want never fear but he have not the time too many thing to do always run about the country attend to he property in the south he property in the north and now geissler be think of sell out to these swedish gentleman here they be relative of he wife all of they and rich man do you see what i mean i 'll do it what way you please say isak a strange thing -- this complete confidence seem to comfort geissler wonderfully in he threadbareness well i be not sure it be the best thing you could do he say thoughtfully then suddenly he be certain and go on : but if you 'll give I a free hand to act on my discretion i can do better for you at any rate than you could by yourself h be begin isak you have always be a good man to we all here but geissler frown at that and cut he short : all right then next morning the gentleman sit down to write it be a serious business there be first of all a contract for forty thousand _ krone _ for the sale of the mine then a document whereby geissler make over the whole of the money to he wife and child isak and sivert be call in to witness the signature to these when it be do the gentleman want to buy over isak 's percentage for a ridiculous sum -- five hundred _ krone _ geissler put a stop to that however jest apart he say isak himself understand but little of the whole affair he have sell the place once and get he money but in any case he do not care much about _ krone _ -- it be not real money like _ daler _ sivert on the other hand follow the business with more understanding there be something peculiar he think about the tone of these negotiation it look very much like a family affair between the party one of the stranger would say : my dear geissler you ought not to have such red eye you know whereto geissler answer sharply if evasively : no i ought not i know but we do not all get what we ought to in this world it look very much as if fru geissler 's brother and kinsman be try to buy off she husband secure themselves against he visit for the future and get quit of a troublesome relation as to the mine it be worth something in itself no doubt no one deny it but it lay far out of the way and the buyer themselves say they be only take it over in order to sell it again to some one better in a position to work it there be nothing unreasonable in that they declare too quite frankly that they have no idea what they would be able to get for it as it stand if it be take up and work then the forty thousand might turn out to be only a fraction of what it be worth if it be allow to lie there as it be the money be simply throw away but in any case they want to have a clear title without encumbrance and therefore they offer isak five hundred _ krone _ for he share i be act on he behalf say geissler and i be not go to sell out he share for less than ten per cent of the purchase-money four thousand say the other four thousand say geissler the land be he and he share come to four thousand it be not mine and i get forty thousand kindly turn that over in you mind if you please yes but -- four thousand _ krone _ geissler rise from he place and say : that or no sale they think it over whisper about it go out into the yard talk as long as they could get the horse ready they call to the servant one of the gentleman go in to inger and pay royally for coffee a few egg and they lodging geissler walk about with a careless air but he be wide awake all the same how do that irrigation work turn out last year he ask sivert it save the whole crop you have cut away that mound there since i be here last what ay you must have another horse on the farm say geissler he notice everything one of the stranger come up now then let 's get this matter settle and have do with it he say they all go into the new building again and isak 's four thousand _ krone _ be count out geissler be give a paper which he thrust into he pocket as if it be of no value at all keep that carefully they tell he and in a few day you wife shall have the bankbook send geissler pucker he forehead and say shortly : very good but they be not finish with geissler yet not that he open he mouth to ask for anything he simply stand there and they see how he stand there : maybe he have stipulate beforehand for a trifle on he own account the leader give he a bundle of note and geissler simply nod again and say : very good and now i think we ought to drink a glass with geissler say the other they drink and that be do and then they take leave of geissler just at that moment come brede olsen walk up now what do he want brede have doubtless hear the report of the blasting charge the day before and understand that there be something on foot in the way of mine and now he come up ready to sell something too he walk straight past geissler and address himself to the gentleman he have find some remarkable specimen of rock hereabouts quite extraordinary some blood-like other like silver he know every cranny and corner in the hill around and could go straight to every spot he know of long vein of some heavy metal -- whatever it might be have you any sample ask the mining expert yes brede have sample but could not they just as well go up and look at the place at once it be not far sample -- oh sack of they whole packing-case full no he have not bring they with he they be at home -- he could run down and fetch they but it would be quicker just to run up into the hill and fetch some more if they would only wait the man shake they head and go on they way brede look after they with a injured air if he have feel a glimmer of hope for the moment it be go now fate be against he nothing ever go right well for brede that he be not easily cast down he look after the man as they ride away and say at last : wish you a pleasant journey and that be all but now he be humble again in he manner towards geissler he former chief and no longer treat he as a equal but used form of respect geissler have take out he pocket-book on some pretext or other and any one could see that it be stuff full of note if only lensmand could help I a bit say brede go back home and work you land properly say geissler and help he not a bit i might easily have bring up a whole barrow-load of sample but would not it have be easier to go up and look at the place itself while they be here geissler take no notice of he and turn to isak : do you see what i do with that document it be a most important thing -- a matter of several thousand _ krone _ oh here it be in among a bundle of note who be those people ask brede just out for a ride or what geissler have be have a anxious time no doubt and now he cool down but he have still something of life and eagerness in he enough to do a little more he go up into the hill with sivert and take a big sheet of paper with he and draw a map of the ground south of the lake -- heaven know what he have in mind when he come down to the farm some hour later brede be still there but geissler take no notice of he question geissler be tired and wave he aside he sleep like a stone till next morning early then he rise with the sun and be himself again sellanraa say he stand outside and look all round all that money say isak do it mean i be to have it all all say geissler heaven man can not you see it ought to have be ever so much more and it be my business really to pay you accord to we contract but you see how thing be -- it be the only way to manage it what do you get only a thousand _ daler _ accord to the old reckoning i have be think you 'll need another horse on the place now ay well i know of one that fellow heyerdahl 's assistant he be let he place go to rack and ruin take more interest in run about sell folk up he be sell a deal of he stock already and he 'll be willing to sell the horse i 'll see he about it say isak geissler wave he hand broadly around and say : margrave landowner -- that be you house and stock and cultivate land -- they can not starve you out if they try no say isak we have all we could wish for that the lord ever make geissler go fuss about the place and suddenly slip in to inger could you manage a bit of food for I to take along again he ask just a few wafer -- no butter and cheese there be good thing enough in they already no do as i say i can not carry more out again geissler be restless he go into the new building and sit down to write he have think it all out beforehand and it do not take long now to get it down send in a application to the state he explain loftily to isak -- to the ministry of the interior you understand yes i have no end of thing to look after all at once when he have get he parcel of food and have take leave he seem to remember something all of a sudden : oh by the way i be afraid i owe you something from last time -- i take out a note from my pocket-book on purpose and then stick it in my waistcoat pocket -- i find it there afterwards too many thing to think about all at once he put something into inger 's hand and off he go ay off go geissler bravely enough to all seem nothing downcast nor anyway near he end he come to sellanraa again after and it be long year before he die each time he go away the sellanraa folk miss he as a friend isak have be think of ask he about breidablik get he advice but nothing come of it and maybe geissler would have dissuade he there have think it a risky thing to buy up land for cultivation and give it to eleseus to a clerk chapter xviii uncle sivert die after all eleseus spend three week look after he and then the old man die eleseus arrange the funeral and manage thing very well get hold of a fuchsia or so from the cottage round and borrow a flag to hoist at half-mast and buy some black stuff from the store for lowered blind isak and inger be send for and come to the burial eleseus act as host and serve out refreshment to the guest ay and when the body be carry out and they have sing a hymn eleseus actually say a few suitable word over the coffin and he mother be so proud and touch that she have to use she handkerchief everything go off splendidly then on the way home with he father eleseus have to carry that spring coat of he openly though he manage to hide the stick in one of the sleeve all go well till they have to cross the water in a boat then he father sit down unexpectedly on the coat and there be a crack what be that ask isak oh nothing say eleseus but he do not throw the broken stick away as soon as they get home he set about look for a bit of tube or something to mend it with we 'll fix it all right say sivert the incorrigible look here get a good stout splint of wood on either side and lash all fast with wax thread i 'll lash you with wax thread say eleseus ha ha ha well perhaps you would rather tie it up neatly with a red garter ha ha ha say eleseus himself at that but he go in to he mother and get she to give he a old thimble file off the end and make quite a fine ferrule oh eleseus be not so helpless after all with he long white hand the brother tease each other as much as ever be i to have what uncle sivert 's left ask eleseus you have it how much be it ask sivert ha ha ha you want to know how much it be first you old miser well you can have it anyway say sivert it be between five and ten thousand _ daler _ cry sivert he could not help it now eleseus never reckon in _ daler _ but he do not like to say no at the time so he just nod and leave it at that till next day then he take up the matter again be not you sorry you give I all that yesterday he say woodenhead of course not say sivert that be what he say but -- well five thousand _ daler _ be five thousand _ daler _ and no little sum if he brother be anything but a lousy indian savage he ought to give back half well to tell the truth explain eleseus i do not reckon to get fat on that legacy after all sivert look at he in astonishment ho do not you no nothing special that be to say not what you might call _ par excellence _ eleseus have some notion of account of course and uncle sivert 's money-chest the famous bottle-case have be open and examine while he be there he have have to go through all the account and make up a balance sheet uncle sivert have not set this nephew to work on the field or mending of herr net he have initiate he into a complex muddle of figure the weirdest book-keeping ever see if a man have pay he tax some year back in kind with a goat say or a load of dry cod there be neither flesh nor fish to show for it now but old sivert search he memory and say he be pay right then we 'll cross he out say sivert eleseus be the man for this sort of work he be bright and quick and encourage the invalid by assure he that thing be all right the two have get on well together even to jest at time eleseus be a bit of a fool perhaps in some thing but so be he uncle and the two of they sit there draw up elaborate document in favor not only of little sivert but also to benefit the village the commune which the old man have serve for thirty year oh they be grand day i could not have get a better man to help with all this than you eleseus boy say uncle sivert he send out and buy mutton in the middle of the summer fish be bring up fresh from the sea eleseus be order to pay cash from the chest they live well enough they get hold of oline -- they could not have find a better person to invite to a feast nor one more sure to spread abroad the news of uncle sivert 's greatness to the end and the satisfaction be mutual we must do something for oline too say uncle sivert she be a widow and not well off there 'll be enough for little sivert anyhow eleseus manage it with a few stroke of the pen a mere codicil to the last will and testament and lo oline be also a sharer in the inheritance i 'll look after you say uncle sivert to she if so be i should not get better this time and get about again on earth i 'll take care you be not leave out oline declare that she be speechless but speechless she be not she weep and be touch to the heart and grateful there be none to compare with oline for find the immediate connection between a worldly gift and be repay a thousandfold eternally in the world to come no speechless she be not but eleseus at first perhaps he may have take a bright enough view of he uncle 's affair but after a while he begin to think thing over and talk as well he try at first with a slight hint : the account be not exactly as they should be he say well never mind that say the old man there 'll be enough and to spare when i be go you have money outstanding besides maybe say eleseus in a bank or so for so report have say h be say the old man that be as it may be but anyhow with the fishery the farm and building and stock red cow and white cow and all -- do not you worry about that eleseus my boy eleseus have no idea what the fishery business might be worth but he have see the live stock it consist of one cow partly red and partly white uncle sivert must have be delirious some of the account too be difficult to make out at all they be a muddle a bare jumble of figure especially from the date when the coinage be change the district treasurer have frequently reckon the small _ krone _ as if they be full _ daler _ no wonder he fancy himself rich but when everything be reduce to something like order eleseus fear there would not be much left over perhaps not enough to settle at all ay sivert might easily promise he all that come to he from he uncle the two brother jest about it sivert be not upset over the matter not at all perhaps indeed it might have irk he something more if he really have throw away five thousand _ daler _ he know well enough that it have be a mere speculation name he after he uncle he have no claim to anything there and now he press eleseus to take what there be it be to be yours of course say he come along let 's get it set down in write i would like to see you a rich man do not be too proud to take it ay they have many a laugh together sivert indeed be the one that help most to keep eleseus at home it would have be much harder but for he as a matter of fact eleseus be get rather spoil again the three week ' idle on the other side of the hill have not do he any good he have also be to church there and make a show ay he have even meet some girl there here at sellanraa there be nothing of that sort jensine the servant-maid be a mere nothing a worker and no more rather suit to sivert i have a fancy to see how that girl barbro from breidablik turn out now she be grow up say eleseus one day well go down to axel ström 's place and see say sivert eleseus go down one Sunday ay he have be away gain confidence and high spirit once more he have taste excitement of a sort and he make thing livelier at axel 's little place barbro herself be by no means to be despise at any rate she be the only one anywhere near she play the guitar and talk readily moreover she do not smell of tansy but of real scent the sort you buy in shop eleseus on he part let it be understand that he be only home for a holiday and would soon be call back to the office again but it be not so bad be at home after all in the old place and of course he have the little bedroom to live in but it be not like be in town nay that be a true word say barbro town 's very different from this axel himself be altogether out of it with these two town-folk he find it dull with they and prefer to go out and look over he land the pair of they be leave to do as they like and eleseus manage thing grandly he tell how he have be over to the neighbouring village to bury he uncle and do not forget to mention the speech he have make over the coffin when he take he leave he ask barbro to go part of the way home with he but barbro thank you be not incline that way be that the way they do thing where you have be she ask -- for the lady to escort the gentleman home that be a nasty hit for eleseus he turn red and understand he have offend she nevertheless he go down to maaneland again next Sunday and this time he take he stick they talk as before and axel be out of it altogether as before ` tis a big place you father 's get say he and building again now it seem ay it be all very well for he say eleseus anxious to show off a little he can afford it it be another matter with poor folk like ourselves how d'you mean oh have not you hear there be be some swedish millionaire come down the other day and buy a mine of he a copper mine why you do not say and he 'll have get a heap of money for it then enormous well i do not want to boast but it be at any rate ever so many thousand what be i go to say build you have a deal of timber lie about here yourself when be you go to start barbro put in she word here : never now that be pure exaggeration and impertinence axel have get he stone the autumn before and cart they home that winter now between season he have get the foundation wall do and cellar and all else -- all that remain be to build the timbered part above he be hope to get part of it roof in this autumn and have think of ask sivert to lend he a hand for a few day -- what do eleseus think of that eleseus think like as not but why not ask I he say smile you say axel and he speak with sudden respect at the idea you have talent for other thing than that i take it oh but it be pleasant to find oneself appreciate here in the wild why i be afraid my hand be not much good at that sort of work say eleseus delicately let I look say barbro and take he hand axel drop out of the conversation again and go out leave the two of they alone they be of a age have be to school together and play and kiss each other and race about and now with a fine disdainful carelessness they talk of old time -- exchange reminiscence -- and barbro perhaps be incline to show off a little before she companion true this eleseus be not like the really fine young man in office that wear glass and gold watch and so on but he could pass for a gentleman here in the wild there be no deny that and she take out she photograph now and show he -- that be what she look like then -- all different now of course and barbro sigh why what be the matter with you now he ask do not you think i have change for the worse since then change for the worse indeed well i do not mind tell you you be ever so much prettier now say he fill out all round for the worse ho that be a fine idea but it be a nice dress do not you think cut open just a bit front and back and then i have that silver chain you see there and it cost a heap of money too it be a present from one of the young clerk i be with then but i lose it not exactly lose it you know but i want money to come home eleseus ask : can i have the photo to keep to keep h be what 'll you give I for it oh eleseus know well enough what he want to say but he dare not i 'll have mine take when i go back to town he say instead and send it you barbro put away the photograph no it be the only one i have leave that be a stroke of darkness to he young heart and he stretch out he hand towards the picture well give I something for it now she say laughing and at that he up and kiss she properly after that it be easier all round eleseus brighten up and get on finely they flirt and joke and laugh and be excellent friend when you take my hand just now it be like a bit of swan 's down -- yours i mean oh you 'll be go back to town again and never come back here i 'll be bind say barbro do you think i be that sort say eleseus ah i dare say there be a somebody there you be fond of no there be not between you and I i be not engage at all say he oh yes you be i know no solemn fact i be not they carry on like this quite a while eleseus be plainly in love i 'll write to you say he may i yes say she for i would not be mean enough if you do not care about it you know and suddenly he be jealous and ask : i have hear say you be promise to axel here be it true axel she say scornfully and he brighten up again i 'll see he farther but then she turn penitent and add : alex he be good enough for I though and he take in a paper all for I to read and give I thing now and again -- lot of thing i will say that oh of course eleseus agree he may be a excellent fellow in he way but that be not everything but the thought of axel seem to have make barbro anxious she get up and say to eleseus : you 'll have to go now i must see to the animal next Sunday eleseus go down a good deal later than usual and carry the letter himself it be a letter a whole week of excitement all the trouble it have cost he to write but here it be at last he have manage to produce a letter : to fröken barbro bredesen it be two or three time now i have have the inexpressible delight of see you again come so late as he do now barbro must at any rate have finish see to the animal and might perhaps have go to bed already that would not matter -- quite the reverse indeed but barbro be up sit in the hut she look now as if she have suddenly lose all idea of be nice to he and make love -- eleseus fancy axel have perhaps get hold of she and warn she here be the letter i promise you he say thank you say she and open it and read it through without seem much move i wish i could write as nice a hand as that she say eleseus be disappointed what have he do -- what be the matter with she and where be axel he be not there begin to get tired of these foolish Sunday visit perhaps and prefer to stay away or he might have have some business to keep he over when he go down to the village the day before anyhow he be not there what d'you want to sit here in this stuffy old place for on a lovely evening ask eleseus come out for a walk i be wait for axel she answer axel can not you live without axel then yes but he 'll want something to eat when he come back time go time dribble away they come no nearer each other barbro be as cross and contrary as ever he try tell she again of he visit across the hill and do not forget about the speech he have make : 'twa not much i have to say but all the same it bring out the tear from some of they do it say she and then one Sunday i go to church what news there news oh nothing only to have a look round not much of a priest as far as i know anything about it no sort of manner he have time go what d'you think axel would say if he find you here this evening again say barbro suddenly there be a thing to say it be as if she have strike he have she forget all about last time have not they agree that he be to come this evening eleseus be deeply hurt and murmur : i can go if you like what have i do he ask then he lip tremble he be in distress in trouble that be plain to see do oh you have not do anything well what be the matter with you anyway this evening with I ha ha ha -- but come to think of it ` tis no wonder axel should be angry i 'll go then say eleseus again but she be still indifferent not in the least afraid caring nothing that he sit there struggle with he feeling fool of a woman and now he begin to grow angry he hint he displeasure at first delicately : to the effect that she be a nice sort indeed and a credit to she sex huh but when that produce no effect -- oh he would have do better to endure it patiently and say nothing but he grow no better for that he say : if i would know you be go to be like this i would never have come this evening at all well what if you have not say she you would have lose a chance of air that cane of yours that you be so fond of oh barbro she have live in bergen she know how to jeer at a man she have see real walking-stick and could ask now what he want to go swing a patched-up umbrella handle like that for but he let she go on i suppose now you 'll be want that photograph back you give I he say and if that do not move she surely nothing would for among folk in the wild there be nothing count so mean as to take back a gift that be as it may be she answer evasively oh you shall have it all right he answer bravely i 'll send it back at once never fear and now perhaps you 'll give I back my letter eleseus rise to he foot very well she give he back the letter but now the tear come into she eye as she do so this servant girl be touch she friend be forsake she -- good-bye for ever you have no need to go she say i do not care for what axel say but eleseus have the upper hand now and must use it he thank she and say good-bye when a lady carry on that way he say there be nothing else to be do he leave the house quietly and walk up homeward whistle swing he stick and play the man huh a little while after come barbro walk up she call to he once or twice very well he stop so he do but be a wounded lion she sit down in the heather look penitent she fidget with a sprig and a little after he too soften and ask for a kiss the last time just to say good-bye he say no she would not be nice and be a dear like you be last time he beg and move round she on all side step quickly if he could see he chance but she would not be a dear she get up and there she stand and at that he simply nod and go when he be out of sight axel appear suddenly from behind some bush barbro start all take aback and ask : what be that -- where have you be up that way no i have be down that way he answer but i see you two go up here ho do you and a lot of good it do you i dare say she cry suddenly furious she be certainly not easier to deal with now what be you poke and sniff about after i would like to know what be it to do with you axel be not in the best of temper himself h be so he be be here again today well what if he have what do you want with he i want with he it be what you want with he i would like to ask you ought to be ashamed ashamed huh the least say about that if you ask I say barbro i be here to sit in the house like a statue i suppose what have i get to be ashamed of anyway if you like to go and get some one else to look after the place i be ready to go you hold you tongue that be all i have get to say if it be not too much to ask i be go back now to get you supper and make the coffee and after that i can do as i please they come home with the quarrel at its height no they be not always the best of friend axel and barbro there be trouble now and again she have be with he now for a couple of year and they have have word before mostly when barbro talk of find another place he want she to stay there for ever to settle down there and share the house and life with he he know how hard it would be for he if he be leave without help again and she have promise several time -- ay in she more affectionate moment she would not think of go away at all but the moment they quarrel about anything she invariably threaten to go if for nothing else she must go to have she tooth see to in town go go away axel feel he must find a means to keep she keep she a lot barbro care for he try to keep she if she do not want to stay ho so you want to go away again say he well and if i do _ can _ you d'you think well and why not if you think i be afraid because the winter 's come on but i can get a place in bergen any day i like then say axel steadily enough : it 'll be some time before you can do that anyway as long as you be with child with child what be you talk about axel stare be the girl mad true he himself should have be more patient now that he have the means of keep she he have grow too confident and that be a mistake there be no need to be sharp with she and make she wild he need not have order she in so many word to help he with the potato that spring -- he might have plant they by himself there would be plenty of time for he to assert he authority after they be marry until then he ought to have have sense enough to give way but -- it _ be _ too bad this business with eleseus this clerk who come swaggering about with he walking-stick and all he fine talk for a girl to carry on like that when she be promise to another man -- and in she condition it be beyond understand up to then axel have have no rival to compete with -- now it be different here be a new paper for you he say and here be a bit of a thing i get you do not know if you 'll care about it barbro be cold they be sit there together drink scalding hot coffee from the bowl but for all that she answer icy cold : i suppose that be the gold ring you have be promising I this twelvemonth and more this however be beyond the mark for it _ be _ the ring after all but a gold ring it be not and that he have never promise she -- 'twa a invention of she own silver it be with gilt hand clasp real silver with the mark on and all but ah that unlucky voyage of hers to bergen barbro have see real engagement ring -- no use tell she that ring huh you can keep it yourself what be wrong with it then wrong with it there be nothing wrong with it that i know she answer and get up to clear the table why you 'll need make do with it for now he say maybe i 'll manage another some day barbro make no answer a thankless creature be barbro this evening a new silver ring -- she might at least have thank he nicely for it it must be that clerk with the town way that have turn she head axel could not help say : i would like to know what that fellow eleseus keep come here for anyway what do he want with you with I ay be he such a greenhorn and can not see how ` tis with you now have not he eye in he head barbro turn on he straight at that : oh so you think you have get a hold on I because of _ that _ you 'll find out you be wrong that be all ho say axel ay and i 'll not stay here neither but axel only smile a little at this not broadly and laugh in she face no for he do not mean to cross she and then he speak soothingly as to a child : be a good girl now barbro ` tis you and I you know and of course in the end barbro give in and be good and even go to sleep with the silver ring on she finger it would all come right in time never fear for the two in the hut yes but what about eleseus 'twa worse with he he find it hard to get over the shameful way barbro have treat he he know nothing of hysteric and take it as all pure cruelty on she part that girl barbro from breidablik think a deal too much of herself even though she _ have _ be in bergen he send she back the photograph in a way of he own -- take it down himself one night and stick it through the door to she in the hayloft where she sleep 'twa not do in any rough unmannerly way not at all he have fidget with the door a long time so as to wake she and when she rise up on she elbow and ask what be the matter can not you find you way in this evening he understand the question be mean for some one else and it go through he like a needle like a sabre he walk back home -- no walking-stick no whistle he do not care about play the man any longer a stab at the heart be no light matter and be that the last of it one Sunday he go down just to look to peep and spy with a sickly and unnatural patience he lay in hiding among the bush stare over at the hut and when at last there come a sign of life and movement it be enough to make a end of he altogether : axel and barbro come out together and go across to the cowsh they be loving and affectionate now ay they have a bless hour they walk with they arm round each other and he be go to help she with the animal ho yes eleseus watch the pair with a look as if he have lose all as a ruin man and he thought maybe be like this : there she go arm in arm with axel ström how she could ever do it i can not think there be a time when she put she arm round I and there they disappear into the shed well let they huh be he to lie here in the bush and forget himself a nice thing for he -- to lie there flat on he belly and forget himself who be she after all but he be the man he be huh again he spring to he foot and stand up brush the twig and dust from he clothes and draw himself up and stand upright again he rage and desperation come out in a curious fashion now : he throw all care to the wind and begin sing a ballad of highly frivolous import and there be a earnest expression on he face as he take care to sing the worst part loudest of all chapter xix isak come back from the village with a horse ay it have come to that he have buy the horse from the lensmand 's assistant the animal be for sale as geissler have say but it cost two hundred and forty _ krone _ -- that be sixty _ daler _ the price of horseflesh have go up beyond all bound : when isak be a boy the best horse could be buy for fifty _ daler _ but why have he never raise a horse himself he have think of it have imagine a nice little foal -- that he have be wait for these two year past that be a business for folk who could spare the time from they land could leave waste patch lie waste till they get a horse to carry home the crop the lensmand 's assistant have say : i do not care about pay for a horse 's keep myself i have no more hay than my womenfolk can get it in by themselves while i be away on duty the new horse be a old idea of isak 's he have be think of it for year it be not geissler who have put he up to it and he have also make preparation such as he could a new stall a new rope for tethering it in the summer as for cart he have some already he must make some more for the autumn most important of all be the fodder and he have not forget that of course or why should he have think it so important to get that last patch break up last year if it have not be to save get rid of one of the cow and yet have enough keep for a new horse it be sow for green fodder now that be for the calving cow ay he have think it all out well might inger be astonish again and clap she hand just as in the old day isak bring news from the village breidablik be to be sell there be a notice outside the church the bit of crop such as it be -- hay and potato -- to go with the rest perhaps the live stock too a few beast only nothing big be he go to sell up the home altogether and leave nothing cry inger and where 's he go to live in the village it be true enough brede be go back to the tillage but he have first try to get axel ström to let he live there with barbro he do not succeed brede would never dream of interfere with the relation between he daughter and axel so he be careful not to make himself a nuisance though to be sure it be a hard set-back with all the rest axel be go to get he new house build that autumn well then when he and barbro move in there why could not brede and he family have a hut no 'twa so with brede he do not look at thing like a farmer and a settler on new land he do not understand that axel have to move out because he want the hut for he grow stock the hut be to be a new cowsh and even when this be explain to he he fail to see the point of view surely human being should come before animal he say no a settler 's way be different animal first a man could always find himself a shelter for the winter but barbro put in a word herself now : ho so you put the animal first and we after ` tis just as well i know it so axel have make enemy of a whole family because he have not room to house they but he would not give way he be no good-natured fool be axel but on the contrary he have grow more and more careful he know well that a crowd like that move in would give he so many more mouth to fill brede bid he daughter be quiet and try to make out that he himself would rather move down to the village again could not endure life in the wilderness he say -- 'twa only for that reason he be sell the place oh but to tell the truth it be not so much brede be sell the place 'twa the bank and the storekeeper be sell up breidablik though for the sake of appearance they let it be do in brede 's name that way he think he be save from disgrace and brede be not altogether deject when isak meet he he console himself with the thought that he be still inspector on the telegraph line that be a regular income anyway and in time he would be able to work up to he old position in the place as the lensmand 's companion and this and that he be something affect at the change of course 'twa not so easy to say good-bye to a place where one have live and toil and moil so many year and come to care for but brede good man be never long cast down 'twa he best point the charm of he he have once in he life take it into he head to be a tiller of the soil 'twa a inspiration have come to he true he have not make a success of it but he have take up other plan in the same airy way and get on better and who could say -- perhaps he sample of ore might after all turn out something wonderful in time and then look at barbro he have get she fix up there at maaneland and she would not be leave axel ström now that he could swear -- 'twa plain indeed for any one to see no there be nothing to fear as long as he have he health and could work for himself and those that look to he say brede olsen and the child be just grow up and big enough now to go out and make they own way in the world say he helge be go to the herr fishery already and katrine be go to help at the doctor 's that leave only the two youngest -- well well there be a third on the way true but anyhow isak have more news from the village : the lensmand 's lady have have a baby inger suddenly interested at this : boy or girl why i do not hear which say isak but the lensmand 's lady have have a child after all -- after all the way she have speak at the woman 's club about the increase birth-rate among the poor better give woman the franchise and let they have some say in they own affair she say and now she be catch yes the parson 's wife have say she 's have some say in lot of thing -- but she own affair be none the better for it ha ha ha and that be a clever say that go the round of the village and there be many that understand what be mean -- inger no doubt as well it be only isak who do not understand isak understand he work he call he be a rich man now with a big farm but the heavy cash payment that have come to he by a lucky chance he use but poorly he put the money aside the land save he if he have live down in the village maybe the great world would have affect even he so much gaiety so many elegant manners and way he would have be buy useless trifle and wear a red Sunday shirt on weekday here in the wild he be sheltered from all immoderation he live in clear air wash himself on Sunday morning and take a bath when he go up to the lake those thousand _ daler _ -- well 'twa a gift from heaven to be keep intact what else should he do he ordinary outgoing be more than cover by the produce of he field and stock eleseus of course know better he have advise he father to put the money in the bank well perhaps that be the best but isak have put off do it for the present -- perhaps it would never be do at all not that isak be above take advice from he son eleseus be no fool as he show later on now in the haymaking season he have try he hand with the scythe -- but he be no master hand at that no he keep close to sivert and have to get he to use the whetstone every time but eleseus have long arm and could pick up hay in first-rate fashion and he and sivert and leopoldine and jensine the servant-maid they be all busy now in the field with the first lot of hay that year eleseus do not spare himself either but rake away till he hand be blister and have to be wrap in rag he have lose he appetite for a week or so but work none the worse for it now something have come over the boy it look perhaps as if a certain unhappy love affair or something of the sort a touch of never-to-be-forgotten sorrow and distress have do he a world of good and look you he have by now smoke the last of the tobacco he have bring with he from town ordinarily that would have be enough to make a clerk go about bang door and express himself emphatically upon many point but no eleseus only grow the steadier for it firmer and more upright a man indeed even sivert the jester could not put he out of countenance today the pair of they be lie out on boulder in the river to drink and sivert imprudently offer to get some extra fine moss and dry it for tobacco -- unless you would rather smoke it raw he say i 'll give you tobacco say eleseus and reach out duck sivert head and shoulder in the water ho one for he sivert come back with he hair still drip look like eleseus he be turn out for the good thought isak to himself watch he son at work and to inger he say : h be -- wonder if eleseus he 'll be stay home now for good and she just as queerly cautious again : ` tis more than i can say no i doubt if he will ho have you say a word of it to himself no -- well yes i have talk a bit with he maybe but that be the way i think like to know now -- suppose he would a bit of land of he own how do you mean if he would work on a place of he own no well have you say anything say anything can not you see for yourself no i do not see anything in he eleseus that way do not sit there talk ill of he say isak impartially all i can see be he be do a good day 's work down there ay maybe say inger submissively and i can not see what you have get to find fault with the lad cry isak evidently displeased he do he work better and better every day and what can you ask more inger murmur : ay but he be not like he use to be you try talk to he about waistcoat about waistcoat what d'you mean how he use to wear white waistcoat in summer when he be in town so he say isak ponder this a while it be beyond he well can not he have a white waistcoat he say isak be out of he depth here of course it be only woman 's nonsense to he mind the boy have a perfect right to a white waistcoat if it please he anyhow he could not see what there be to make a fuss about and be incline to put the matter aside and go on well what do you think if he have brede 's bit of land to work on who say inger he eleseus breidablik nay ` tis more than 's worth you while the fact be she have already be talk over that very plan with eleseus she have hear it from sivert who could not keep the secret and indeed why should sivert keep the matter secret when he father have surely tell he of it on purpose to feel he way it be not the first time he have use sivert as a go-between well but what have eleseus answer just as before as in he letter from town that no he would not throw away all he have learn and be a insignificant nothing again that be what he have say well and then he mother have bring out all she good reason but eleseus have say no to they all he have other plan for he life young heart have they unfathomable depths and after what have happen likely enough he do not care about stay on with barbro as a neighbor who could say he have put it loftily enough in talk to he mother he could get a better position in town than the one he have could go as clerk to one of the higher official he must get on he must rise in the world in a few year perhaps he might be a lensmand or perhaps a lighthouse keeper or get into the custom there be so many road open to a man with learn however it might be he mother come round be draw over to he point of view oh she be so little sure of herself yet the world have not quite lose its hold on she last winter she have go so far as to read occasionally a certain excellent devotional work which she have bring from trondhjem from the institute but now eleseus might be a lensmand one day and why not say eleseus what be heyerdahl himself but a former clerk in the same department splendid prospects he mother herself advise he not to give up he career and throw himself away what be a man like that to do in the wild but why should eleseus then trouble to work hard and steadily as he be do now on he father 's land heaven know he have some reason maybe something of inborn pride in he still perhaps he would not be outdo by other and besides it would do he no harm to be in he father 's good book the day he go away to tell the truth he have a number of little debt in town and it would be a good thing to be able to settle they at once -- improve he credit a lot and it be not a question now of a mere hundred _ krone _ but something worth consider eleseus be far from stupid but on the contrary a sly fellow in he way he have see he father come home and know well enough he be sit there in the window at that moment look out no harm in put he back into it then for a bit work a little harder for the moment -- it would hurt no one and might do himself good eleseus be somehow change whatever it might be something in he have be warped and quietly spoil he be not bad but something blemish have he lack a guide hand those last few year what could he mother do to help he now only stand by he and agree she could let herself be dazzle by she son 's bright prospects for the future and stand between he and he father to take he part -- she could do that but isak grow impatient at last over she opposition to he mind the idea about breidablik be by no mean a bad one only that very day come up he have stop the horse almost without think to look out with a critical eye over the ill-tended land ay it could be make a fine place in proper hand why not worth while he ask inger now i have that much feeling for eleseus anyway that i would help he to it if you have any feeling for he then say never a word of breidablik again she answer ho ay for he be greater thought in he head than the like of we isak too be hardly sure of himself here and it weaken he but he be by no means please at have show he hand and speak straight out about he plan he be unwilling to give it up now he shall do as i say declare isak suddenly and he raise he voice threateningly in case inger by any chance should be hard of hear ay you may look i 'll say no mere it be midway up with a schoolhouse by and everything what be the greater thought he be get beyond that i would like to know with a son like that i might starve to death -- be that any better d'you think and can you tell I why my own flesh and blood should turn and go contrary to -- to my own flesh and blood isak stop he realize that the more he talk the worse it would be he be on the point of change he clothes get out of he best thing he have put on to go down to the village in but no he alter he mind he would stay as he be -- whatever he mean by that you would better say a word of it to eleseus he say then and inger answer : best if you would say it yourself he will not do as i say very well then isak be head of the house so he should think now see if eleseus dare to murmur but whether it be because he fear defeat isak draw back now and say : ay ` tis true i might say a word of it myself but by reason of have so many thing to do and busy with this and that i have something else to think of well say inger in surprise and isak go off again -- not very far only to the farther field but still he go off he be full of mystery and must hide himself out of the way the fact be this : he have bring back a third piece of news from the village today and that be something more than the rest something enormous and he have hide it at the edge of the wood there it stand wrap up in sack and paper he uncover it and lo a huge machine look red and blue wonderful to see with a heap of tooth and a heap of knife with joint and arm and screw and wheel -- a mowing-machine no isak would not have go down today for the new horse if it have not be for that machine he stand with a marvellously keen expression go over in he mind from begin to end the instruction for use that the storekeeper have read out he set a spring here and shift a bolt there then he oils every hole and every crevice then he look over the whole thing once more isak have never know such a hour in he life to pick up a pen and write one 's mark on a paper a document -- ay 'twa a perilous great thing that no doubt likewise in the matter of a new harrow he have once bring up -- there be many curiously twist part in that to be consider not to speak of the great circular saw that have to be set in its course to the nicety of a pencil line never sway east nor west lest it should fly asunder but this -- this mowing-machine of he -- 'twa a crawl nest of steel spring and hook and apparatus and hundred of screw -- inger 's sewing-machine be a bookmarker compare with this isak harness himself to the shaft and try the thing here be the wonderful moment and that be why he keep out of sight and be he own horse for -- what if the machine have be wrongly put together and do not do its work but go to piece with a crash no such calamity happen however the machine could cut grass and so indeed it ought after isak have stand there deep in study for hour the sun have go down again he harness himself and try it ay the thing cut grass and so indeed it ought when the dew begin to fall close after the heat of the day and the boy come out each with he scythe to mow in readiness for next day isak come in sight close to the house and say : put away scythe for tonight get out the new horse you can and bring he down to the edge of the wood and on that instead of go indoors to he supper as the other have do already he turn where he stand and go back the way he have come d'you want the cart then sivert call after he no say he father and walk on swell with mystery full of pride with a little lift and throw from the knee at every step so emphatically do he walk so a brave man might walk to death and destruction carry no weapon in he hand the boy come up with the horse see the machine and stop dead it be the first mowing-machine in the wild the first in the village -- red and blue a thing of splendor to man 's eye and the father head of they all call out oh in a careless tone as if it be nothing uncommon : harness up to this machine here and they drive it the father drive brrr say the thing and fell the grass in swath the boy walk behind nothing in they hand do no work smile the father stop and look back h be not as clear as it might be he screw up a nut here and there to bring the knife closer to the ground and try again no not right yet all uneven the frame with the cutter seem to be hop a little father and son discuss what it can be eleseus have find the instruction and be read they here it say to sit up on the seat when you drive -- then it run steadier he say ho say he father ay ` tis so i know he answer i have study it all through he get up into the seat and start off again it go steadily now suddenly the machine stop work -- the knife be not cut at all _ ptro _ what be wrong now father down from he seat no longer swell with pride but bend a anxious question face down over the machine father and son all stare at it something must be wrong eleseus stand hold the instruction here be a bolt or something say sivert pick up a thing from the grass ho that be all right then say he father as if that be all that be need to set everything in order i be just look for that bolt but now they could not find the hole for it to fit in -- where in the name of wonder could the hole be now and it be now that eleseus could begin to feel himself a person of importance he be the man to make out a print paper of instruction what would they do without he he point unnecessarily long to the hole and explain : accord to the illustration the bolt should fit in there ay that be where she go say he father 'twa there i have it before and by way of regain lose prestige he order sivert to set about look for more bolt in the grass there ought to be another he say look very important as if he carry the whole thing in he head can not you find another well well it 'll be in its hole then all right father start off again wait a minute -- this be wrong cry eleseus ho eleseus standing there with the drawing in he hand with the law in he hand no get away from he that spring there go outside he say to he father ay what then why you have get it in under you have set it wrong it be a steel spring and you have to fix it outside else the bolt jar out again and stop the knife you can see in the picture here i have leave my spectacles behind and can not see it quite say he father something meekly you can see better -- you set it as it should go i do not want to go up to the house for my spectacles now all in order now and isak get up eleseus call after he : you must drive pretty fast it cut better that way -- it say so here isak drive and drive and everything go well and brrr say the machine there be a broad track of cut grass in he wake neatly in line ready to take up now they can see he from the house and all the womenfolk come out inger carry little rebecca on she arm though little rebecca have learn to walk by herself long since but there they come -- four womenfolk big and small -- hurry with strain eye down towards the miracle flock down to see oh but now be isak 's hour now he be truly proud a mighty man sit high aloft dress in holiday clothes in all he finery in jacket and hat though the sweat be pour off he he swing round in four big angle go over a good bit of ground swing round drive cut grass pass along by where the woman be stand they be dumbfounded it be all beyond they and brrr say the machine then isak stop and get down longing no doubt to hear what these folk on earth down there will say what they will find to say about it all he hear smother cry they fear to disturb he these being on earth in he lordly work but they turn to one another with awed questioning and he hear what they say and now that he may be a kind and fatherly lord and ruler to they all to encourage they he say : there i 'll just do this bit and you can spread it tomorrow have not you time to come in and have a bite of food say inger all overwhelm nay i have other thing to do he answer then he oils the machine again give they to understand that he be occupy with scientific work drive off again cut more grass and at long last the womenfolk go back home happy isak -- happy folk at sellanraa very soon the neighbor from below will be come up axel ström be interested in thing he may be up tomorrow but brede from breidablik he might be here that very evening isak would not be loth to show they he machine explain it to they tell they how it work and all about it he can point out how that no man with a scythe could ever cut so fine and clean but it cost money of course -- oh a red-and-blue machine like that be a terribly costly thing happy isak but as he stop for oil the third time there he spectacles fall from he pocket and worst of all the two boy see it be there a higher power behind that little happen -- a warning against overweening pride he have put on those spectacles time and again that day to study the instruction without make out a word eleseus have to help he with that eyah _ herregud _ 'twa a good thing no doubt to be book-learned and by way of humbling himself isak determine to give up he plan of make eleseus a tiller of soil in the wild he will never say a word of it again not that the boy make any great business about that matter of the spectacles far from it sivert the jester have to say something of course it be too much for he he pluck eleseus by the sleeve and say : here come along we 'll go back home and throw those scythe on the fire father 's go to do all the mow now with he machine and that be a jest indeed book two chapter i sellanraa be no longer a desolate spot in in the waste human being live here -- seven of they count great and small but in the little time the haymaking last there come a stranger or so folk want to see the mowing-machine brede olsen be first of course but axel ström come too and other neighbor from lower down -- ay from right down in the village and from across the hill come oline the imperishable oline this time too she bring news with she from she own village 'twa not oline 's way to come empty of gossip old sivert 's affair have be go into he account reckon up and the fortune remain after he come to nothing nothing here oline press she lip together and look from one to another well be there not a sigh -- would not the roof fall down eleseus be the first to smile let 's see -- you be call after you uncle sivert be not you he ask softly and little sivert answer as softly again : that be so but i make you a present of all that might come to I after he and how much be it between five and ten thousand _ daler _ cry eleseus suddenly mimic he brother oline no doubt think this ill-timed jesting oh she have herself be cheat of she due for all that she have manage to squeeze out something like real tear over old sivert 's grave eleseus should know best what he himself have write -- so-and-so much to oline to be a comfort and support in she decline year and where be that support oh a broken reed poor oline they might have leave she something -- single golden gleam in she life oline be not over-blessed with this world 's goods practice in evil -- ay well use to edge she way by trick and little meanness from day to day strong only as a scandalmonger as one whose tongue be to be fear ay so but nothing could have make she worse than before least of all a pittance leave she by the dead she have toil all she life have bear child and teach they she own few art beg for they maybe steal for they but always manage for they somehow -- a mother in she poor way she power be not less than those of other politician she act for herself and those belong to she set she speech accord to the moment and gain she end earn a cheese or a handful of wool each time she also could live and die in commonplace insincerity and readiness of wit oline -- maybe old sivert have for a moment thought of she as young pretty and rosy-cheeked but now she be old deform a picture of decay she ought to have be dead where be she to be bury she have no family vault of she own nay she will be lower down in a graveyard to lie among the bone of stranger and unknown ay to that she come at last -- oline bear and die she have be young once a pittance leave to she now at the eleventh hour ay a single golden gleam and this slave-woman 's hand would have be fold for a moment justice would have overtake she with its late reward for that she have beg for she child maybe steal for they but always manage for they some way a moment -- and the darkness would reign in she as before she eye glower she finger feel out graspingly -- how much she would say what no more she would say she would be right again a mother many time realize life -- it be worthy of a great reward but all go otherwise old sivert 's account have appear more or less in order after eleseus have be through they but the farm and the cow the fishery and net be barely enough to cover the deficit and it be due in some measure to oline that thing have turn out no worse so earnest be she in try to secure a small remainder for herself that she drag to light forget item that she as gossip and newsmonger for year remember still or matter outstanding which other would have pass over on purpose to avoid cause unpleasantness to respectable fellow-citizen oh that oline and she do not even say a word against old sivert now he have make he will in kindness of heart and there would have be a plenty after he but that the two man send by the department to arrange thing have cheat she but one day all would come to the ear of the almighty say oline threateningly strange she find nothing ridiculous in the fact that she be mention in the will after all it be a honor of a sort none of she likes be name there with she the sellanraa folk take the blow with patience they be not altogether unprepared true inger could not understand it -- uncle sivert that have always be so rich he might have stand forth a upright man and a wealthy before the lamb and before the throne say oline if they have not rob he isak be stand ready to go out to he field and oline say : pity you have get to go now isak then i sha not see the new machine after all you have get a new machine they say ay ay there be talk of it about and how it cut quicker than a hundred scythe and what have not you get isak with all you means and riches priest we way he be get a new plough with two handle but what be he compare with you and i would tell he so to he face sivert here 'll show you the machine he be better at work she than he father say isak and go out isak go out there be a auction to be hold at breidablik that noon and he be go there be but just time to get there now not that isak any longer think of buy the place but the auction -- it be the first auction hold there in the wild and it would be strange not to go he get down as far as maaneland and see barbro and would pass by with only a greet but barbro call to he and ask if he be go down ay say isak make to go on again it be she home that be be sell and that be why he answer shortly you go to the sale she ask to the sale well i be only go down a bit what you have do with axel axel nay i do not know he be go down to sale doubt he 'll be see he chance to pick up something for nothing like the rest heavy to look at be barbro now -- ay and sharp and bitter-tongued the auction have begin isak hear the lensmand call out and see a crowd of people come nearer he do not know they all there be some from other village but brede be fuss about in he best finery and chatter in he old way _ goddag _ isak so you be do I the honor to come and see my auction sale thanks thanks ay we have be neighbor and friend these many year now and never a ill word between we brede grow pathetic ay ` tis strange to think of leave a place where you have live and toil and grow fond of but what be a man to do when it be fate so to be maybe ` twill be better for you after say isak comfortingly why say brede grasp at it himself to tell the truth i think it will i be not regret it not a bit i will not say i have make a fortune on the place here but that be to come maybe and the young one get older and leave the nest -- ay ` tis true the wife 's get another on the way but for all that and suddenly brede tell he news straight out : i have give up the telegraph business what ask isak i have give up that telegraph give up the telegraph ay from new year to be what be the good of it anyway and suppose i be out on business or drive for the lensmand or the doctor then to have to look after the telegraph first of all -- no there be no sense nor meaning in it that way well enough for they that be time to spare but run over hill and dale after a telegraph wire for next to nothing wages ` tis no job that for brede and then besides i have have word with the people from the telegraph office about it -- they have be make a fuss again the lensmand keep repeat the bid for the farm they have get up to the few hundred _ krone _ the place be judge to be worth and the bidding go slowly now with but five or ten _ krone _ more each time why surely -- ` tis axel there be bidding cry brede suddenly and hurry eagerly across what you go to take over my place too have not you enough to look after i be bidding for another man say axel evasively well well ` tis no harm to I 'twa not that i mean the lensmand raise he hammer a new bid be make a whole hundred _ krone _ at once no one bid higher the lensmand repeat the figure again and again wait for a moment with he hammer raise and then strike whose bid axel ström -- on behalf of another the lensmand note it down : axel ström as agent who be that you buy for ask brede not that it be any business of mine of course but but now some man at the lensmand 's table be put they head together there be a representative from the bank the storekeeper have send he assistant there be something the matter the creditor be not satisfied brede be call up and brede careless and light-hearted only nod and be agree -- but who have ever have think it do not come up to more say he and suddenly he raise he voice and declare to all present : see as we have a auction hold anyhow and i have trouble the lensmand all this way i be willing to sell what i have get here on the place : the cart live stock a pitchfork a grindstone i have no use for the thing now we 'll sell the lot small bidding now brede 's wife careless and light-hearted as himself for all the fulness of she in front have begin sell coffee at a table she find it amusing to play at shop and smile and when brede himself come up for some coffee she tell he jestingly that he must pay for it like the rest and brede actually take out he lean purse and pay there be a wife for you he say to the other thrifty what the cart be not worth much -- it have stand too long uncover in the open but axel bid a full five _ krone _ more at last and get the cart as well after that axel buy no more but all be astonished to see that cautious man buying so much as he have then come the animal they have be keep in they shed today so as to be there in readiness what do brede want with live stock when he have no farm to keep they on he have no cow he have start farm with two goat and have now four besides these there be six sheep no horse isak buy a certain sheep with flat ear when brede 's child lead it out from the shed he start bid at once and people look at he isak from sellanraa be a rich man in a good position with no need of more sheep than he have brede 's wife stop sell coffee for a moment and say : ay you may buy she isak she be old ` tis true but she be two and three lamb every bless year and that be the truth i know it say isak look straight at she i have see that sheep before he walk up with axel ström on the way back lead he sheep on a string axel be taciturn seemingly anxious about something whatever it might be there be nothing he need be trouble about that one can see think isak he crop be look well most of he fodder be house already and he have begin timber he house all as it should be with axel ström a thought slowly but sure in the end and now he have get a horse so you have buy brede 's place say isak go to work it yourself no not for myself i buy it for another man ho what d'you think be it too much i give for it why no ti good land for a man that 'll work it as it should i buy it for a brother of mine up in helgeland ho then i think perhaps i would half a mind to change with he too change with he -- would you and perhaps how barbro she have like it better that way ay maybe say isak they walk on for a good way in silence then say axel : they have be after I to take over that telegraph business the telegraph h be ay i hear that brede he be give it up h be say axel smile ` tis not so much that way of it but brede that be be turn off ay so say isak and try to find some excuse for brede it take a deal of time to look after no doubt they give he notice to the new year if he do not do better h be you do not think it would be worth my while to take it isak think for a long while and answer : ay there be the money true but still they have offer I more how much double double why then i would say you should think it over but they have make the line a bit longer now no i do not know what be best to do -- there be not so much timber to sell here as you have get on yours and i have need to buy more thing for the work that i have get now and buy thing need money in ` cash and i have not so much out of the land and stock that there be much over to sell seem to I i 'll have to try a year at the telegraph to begin with it do not occur to either of they that brede might do better and keep the post himself when they reach maaneland oline be there already on she way down ay a strange creature oline crawl about fat and round as a maggot and over seventy year and all but still get about she sit drinking coffee in the hut but see the man come up all must give way to that and she come out _ goddag _ axel and welcome back from the sale you 'll not mind I look in to see how you and barbro 's get on and you be get on finely to see and build a new house and get richer and richer and you be buy sheep isak ay say isak you know she maybe if i know she nay with these flat ear you can see flat ear how d'you mean now and what then what i be go to say : who buy brede 's place after all i be just say to barbro here who would be you neighbor that way now say i and barbro poor thing she sit cry as natural enough to be sure but the almighty that be decree she a new home here at maaneland flat ear i have see a deal of sheep in my day with flat ear and all and i 'll tell you isak that machine of yours 'twa almost more than my old eye could see nor understand and what she 'll have cost you i will not even ask for i never could count so far axel if you have see it you know what i mean 'twa all as it might be elijah and he chariot of fire and heaven forgive I that i say it when the hay be all in eleseus begin make preparation for he return to town he have write to the engineer to say he be come but receive the extraordinary reply that time be bad and they would have to economize the office would have to dispense with eleseus ' service and the chief would do the work himself the deuce and all but after all what do a district surveyor want with a office staff when he have take eleseus on as a youngster he have do so no doubt only to show himself as a great man to these folk in the wild and if he have give he clothes and board till he confirmation he have get some return for it in the way of write work that be true now the boy be grow up and that make all the difference but say the engineer if you do come back i will do all i can to get you a place somewhere else though it may be a difficult matter as there be more young man than be wanted look out for the same thing with kind regard eleseus would go back to town of course there could be no question about that be he to throw himself away he want to get on in the world and he say nothing to those at home as to the altered state of affair it would be no use and to tell the truth he feel a little out of humor with the whole thing anyhow he say nothing the life at sellanraa be have its effect on he again it be a inglorious commonplace life but quiet and dull to the sense a dreamy life there be nothing for he to show off about a looking-glass be a thing he have no use for he town life have work a schism in himself and make he finer than the other make he weaker he begin indeed to feel that he must be homeless anywhere he have come to like the smell of tansy again -- let that pass but there be no sense at all in a peasant lad 's standing listen in the morning to the girl milk the cow and think thus : they be milk listen now ` tis almost by way of something wonderful to hear a kind of song in nothing but little stream different from the brass band in the town and the salvation army and the steamer siren music streaming into a pail it be not the way at sellanraa to show one 's feeling overmuch and eleseus dread the moment when he would have to say good-bye he be well equip now again he mother have give he a stock of weave stuff for underclothes and he father have commission some one to hand he money as he go out of the door money -- could isak really spare such a thing as money but it be so and no otherwise inger hint that it would doubtless be the last time for be not eleseus go to get on and rise in the world by himself h be say isak there be a atmosphere of solemnity of stillness in the home they have each have a boil egg at the last meal and sivert stand outside all ready to go down with he brother and carry he thing it be for eleseus to begin he begin with leopoldine well and good she say good-bye in return and manage it very well likewise jensine the servant-maid she sit card wool and answer good-bye -- but both girl stare at he confound they and all because he might perhaps be the least bit red about the eye he shake hand with he mother and she cry of course quite openly never care to remember how he hate cry goo -- ood-bye and bl -- bless you she sob out it be worst with he father worst of all with he oh in every way he be so toil-worn and so utterly faithful he have carry the child in he arm have tell they of the seagull and other bird and beast and the wonder of the field it be not so long ago a few year father stand by the glass window then suddenly he turn round grasp he son 's hand and say quickly and peevishly : well good-bye there be the new horse get loose and he swing out of the door and hurry away oh but he have himself take care to let the new horse loose a while ago and sivert the rascal know it too as he stand outside watch he father and smile to himself and anyway the horse be only in the rowen eleseus have get it over at last and then he mother must need come out on the door-slab and hiccup again and say god bless you and give he something take this -- and you be not to thank he he say you be not to and do not forget to write write often two hundred _ krone _ eleseus look down the field : he father be furiously at work drive a tethering-peg into the ground he seem to find it a difficult matter for all that the ground be soft enough the brother set off down the road they come to maaneland and there stand barbro in the doorway and call to they to come up you go away again eleseus nay then you must come in and take a cup of coffee at least they go into the hut and eleseus be no longer a prey to the pang of love nor wishful to jump out of window and take poison nay he spread he light spring overcoat across he knee take care to lay it so the silver plate be to be see then he wipe he hair with he handkerchief and observe delicately : beautiful day be not it -- simply classic barbro too be self-possessed enough she play with a silver ring on one hand and a gold ring on the other -- ay true enough if she have not get a gold ring too -- and she wear a apron reach from neck to foot as if to say she be not spoil as to she figure whoever else may be that way and when the coffee be ready and she guest be drink she sew a little to begin with on a white cloth and then do a little crochet-work with a collar of some sort and so with all manner of maidenly task barbro be not put out by they visit and all the better they can talk naturally and eleseus can be all on the surface again young and witty as he please what have you do with axel ask sivert oh he be about the place somewhere she answer pull herself up and so we 'll not be see you this way any more i doubt she ask eleseus it be hardly probable say he ay ` tis no place for one as be use to the town i only wish i could go along with you you do not mean that i know do not mean it oh i have know what it be to live in town and what it be like here and i have be in a bigger town than you for that matter -- and should not i miss it i do not mean that way say eleseus hastily after you be in bergen itself and all strange how impatient she be after all i only know that if it be not for have the papers to read i would not stay here another day say she but what about axel then and all the rest -- 'twa that i be think as for axel ` tis no business of mine and what about yourself -- i doubt there 'll be some one wait for you in town and at that eleseus could not help show off a little and close he eye and turn over the morsel on he tongue : perhaps true enough there be some one wait for he in town oh but he could have manage this ever so differently snap at the chance if it have not be for sivert sit there as it be he could only say : do not talk such nonsense ho say she -- and indeed she be shamefully ill-humoured today -- nonsense indeed well what can you expect of folk at maaneland we be not so great and fine as you -- no oh she could go to the devil what do eleseus care she face be visibly dirty and she condition plain enough now even to he innocent eye can not you play a bit on the guitar he ask no answer barbro shortly what i be go to say : sivert could not you come and help axel a bit with the new house a day or so if you could begin tomorrow say when you come back from the village sivert think for a moment ay maybe but i have no clothes i could run up and fetch you work clothes this evening so they 'll be here when you get back ay say sivert if you could and barbro unnecessarily eager now : oh if only you would come here 's summer nearly go already and the house that should be up and roof before the autumn rain axel he be be go to ask you a many time before but he could not somehow oh you would be help we no end i 'll help as well as i can say sivert and that be settle but now it be eleseus ' turn to be offend he can see well enough that it be clever of barbro and all that to look out and manage to she own advantage and axel 's too and get help for the building and save the house but the whole thing be a little too plain after all she be not mistress of the place as yet and it be not so long since he himself have kiss she -- the creature be there never a atom of shame in she at all ay say eleseus then suddenly : i 'll come back again in time and be a godfather when you be ready she send he a glance and answer in great offence : godfather indeed and who be talk nonsense now i would like to know ` twill be time enough for you when i send word i be look out for godfather and what could eleseus do then but laugh foolishly and wish himself out of the place here 's thanks say sivert and get up from he seat to go here 's thanks say eleseus also but he do not rise nor bow as a man should do in say thanks for a cup of coffee not he indeed -- he would see she at the devil for a bitter-tongued lump of ugliness let I look say barbro oh yes the young man i stay with in town they have silver plate on they overcoat too much bigger than this say she well then you 'll come in on you way back sivert and stay the night i 'll get you clothes all right and that be good-bye to barbro the brother go on again eleseus be not distressed in any way in the matter of barbro she could go to the devil -- and besides he have two big bank-note in he pocket the brother take care not to touch on any mournful thing such as the strange way father have say good-bye or how mother have cry they go a long way round to avoid be stop at breidablik and make a jest of that little ruse but when they come down in sight of the village and it be time for sivert to turn homeward again they both behave in somewhat unmanly fashion sivert for instance be weak enough to say : i doubt it 'll be a bit lonely maybe when you be go and at that eleseus must fall to whistle and look to he shoe and find a splinter in he finger and search after something in he pocket some papers he say could not make out oh ` twould have go ill with they if sivert have not save thing at the last touch he cry suddenly and touch he brother on the shoulder and spring away it be better after that they shout a word of farewell or so from a distance and go each on he own way fate or chance -- whatever it might be eleseus go back after all to the town to a post that be no longer open for he but that same occasion lead to axel ström 's get a man to work for he they begin work on the house the 21st of August and ten day later the place be roof in oh 'twa no great house to see and nothing much in the way of height the best that could be say of it be that it be a wooden house and no turf hut but at least it mean that the animal would have a splendid shelter for the winter in what have be a house for human being up to then chapter ii on the 3rd of September barbro be not to be find 'twa not that she be altogether lose but she be not up at the house axel be do carpenter 's work the best he could he be try hard to get a glass window and a door set in the new house and it be take all he time to do it but be long past noon and no word say about come in to dinner he go in himself into the hut no one there he get himself some food and look about while he be eat all barbro 's clothes be hang there she must be out somewhere that be all he go back to he work on the new building and keep at it for a while then he look in at the hut again -- no nobody there she must be lie down somewhere he set out to find she barbro he call no he look all round the house go across to some bush on the edge of he land search about a long while maybe a hour call out -- no he come on she a long way off lie on the ground hide by some bush the stream flow by at she foot she be barefoot and bareheaded and wet all up the back as well you lie here say he why do not you answer i could not she answer and she voice so hoarse he can scarcely hear what -- you be in the water yes slip down -- oh be it hurt you now ay -- it be over now be it over say he yes help I to get home where 's what be not it -- the child no twa dead be it dead yes axel be slow of mind and slow to act he stand there still where be it then he ask you have no call to know say she help I back home twa dead i can walk if you hold my arm a bit axel carry she back home and set she in a chair the water drip off she be it dead he ask i tell you 'twa so she answer what have you do with it then d'you want to smell it d'you get anything to eat while i be away but what do you want down by the water by the water i be look for juniper twig juniper twig what for for clean the bucket there be none that way say he you get on with you work say she hoarsely and all impatient what be i do by the water i want twig for a broom have you have anything to eat d'you hear eat say he how d'you feel now tis well enough i doubt i would better fetch the doctor up you would better try say she get up and look about for dry clothes to put on as if you would no better to do with you money axel go back to he work and ` tis but little he get do but make a bit of noise with planing and hammer so she can hear at last he get the window wedge in and stop the frame all round with moss that evening barbro seem not to care for she food but go about all the same busy with this and that -- go to the cowsh at milking-time only step a think more carefully over the door-sill she go to bed in the haysh as usual axel go in twice to look at she and she be sleep soundly she have a good night next morning she be almost as usual only so hoarse she could hardly speak at all and with a long stock wound round she throat they could not talk together day pass and the matter be no longer new other thing crop up and it slip aside the new house ought by rights to have be leave a while for the timber to work together and make it tight and sound but there be no time for that now they have to get it into use at once and the new cowshed ready when it be do and they have move in they take up the potato and after that there be the corn to get in life be the same as ever but there be sign enough great or small that thing be different now at maaneland barbro feel herself no more at home there now than any other serving-maid no more bind to the place axel could see that he hold on she have loosen with the death of the child he have think to himself so confidently : wait till the child come but the child have come and go and at last barbro even take off the ring from she finger and wear neither what be that mean he ask what be it mean she say toss she head but it could hardly mean anything else than faithlessness and desertion on she part and he have find the little body by the stream not that he have make any search for it to speak of he know pretty closely where it must be but he have leave the matter idly as it be then chance will it so that he should not forget it altogether bird begin to hover above the spot shriek grouse and crow and then later on a pair of eagle at a giddy height above to begin with only a single bird have see something bury there and be unable to keep a secret like a human being have shout it abroad then axel rouse himself from he apathy and wait for a opportunity to steal out to the spot he find the thing under a heap of moss and twig keep down by flat stone and wrap in a cloth in a piece of rag with a feeling of curiosity and horror he draw the cloth a little aside -- eye close dark hair a boy and the leg cross -- that be all he see the cloth have be wet but be dry now the whole thing look like a half-wrung bundle of wash he could not leave it there in the light of day and in he heart perhaps he fear some ill to himself or to the place he run home for a spade and dig the grave deeper but be so near the stream the water come in and he have to shift it farther up the bank as he work he fear lest barbro should come and find he disappear he grow defiant and thoroughly bitter let she come and he would make she wrap up the body neatly and decently after she stillborn or no he see well enough all he have lose by the death of the child how he be face now with the prospect of be leave without help again on the place -- and that moreover with three time the stock to care for he have have at first let she come -- he do not care but barbro -- it might be she have some inkling of what he be at anyway she do not come and axel have to wrap up the body himself as best he could and move it to the new grave he lay down the turf again on top just as before hide it all when he have do there be nothing to be see but a little green mound among the bush he find barbro outside the house as he come home where you be she ask the bitterness must have leave he for he only say : nowhere where have you be oh but the look on he face must have warn she she say no more but go into the house he follow she look here he say and ask she straight out what d'you mean by take off those ring barbro maybe find it best to give way a little she laugh and answer : well you be serious today -- i can not help laugh but if you want I to put on the ring and wear they out weekday why i will and she get out the ring and put they on but see he look all foolish and content at that she grow bolder be there anything else i have do i would like to know i be not complain answer he and you have only to be as you be before all the time before when you first come that be all i mean ` tis not so easy to be always together and always agree axel go on : when i buy that place after you father 'twa think maybe you would like better to be there and so we could shift what d'you think ho there he give himself away he be afraid of lose she and be leave without help with none to look to the place and the animal again -- she know ay you have say that before she answer coldly ay so i have but i have get no answer answer say she oh i be sick of hear it axel might fairly consider he have be lenient he have let brede and he family stay on at breidablik and for all that he have buy the good crop with the place he have cart home no more than a few load of hay and leave the potato to they it be all unreasonable of barbro to be contrary now but she pay no heed to that and ask indignantly : so you would have we move down to breidablik now and turn out a whole family to be homeless have he hear aright he sit for a moment stare and gaping clear he throat as if to answer thoroughly but it come to nothing he only ask : be not they go to the village then do not ask I say barbro or perhaps you have get a place for they to be there axel be still loth to quarrel with she but he could not help let she see he be surprise at she just a little surprised you be get more and more cross and hard say he though you do not mean any harm belike i mean every word i say she answer and why could not you have let my folk come up here -- answer I that then i would have have mother to help I a bit but you think perhaps i have so little to do i have no need of help there be some sense in this of course but also much that be unreasonable altogether if brede have come they would have have to live in the hut and axel would have have no place for he beast -- as badly off as before what be the woman get at -- have she neither sense nor wit in she head look here say he you would better have a servant-girl to help now -- with the winter come on and less to do than ever no you should have think of that when i need it here again she be right in a way when she have be heavy and ailing -- that be the time to talk of help but then barbro herself have do she work all the time as if nothing be the matter she have be quick and clever as usual do all that have to be do and have never speak a word about get help well i can not make it out anyway say he hopelessly silence barbro ask : what be this about you take over the telegraph after father what who say a word about that well they say it be to be why say axel it may come to something i 'll not say no ho but why d'you ask nothing say barbro only that you have turn my father out of house and home and now you be take the bread out of he mouth silence oh but that be the end of axel 's patience i 'll tell you this he cry you be not worth all i have do for you and yours ho say barbro no say he strike he fist on the table and then he get up you can not frighten I so do not think whimper barbro and move over nearer the wall frighten you he say again and sniff scornfully i be go to speak out now in earnest what about that child do you drown it drown it ay it be be in the water ho so you have see it you have be -- sniff at it she be go to say but dare not axel be not to be play with just then by he look you have be and find it i see it have be in the water ay say she and well it might 'twa bear in the water i slip in and could not get up again slip do you yes and the child come before i could get out h be say he but you take the bit of wrap with you before you go out -- be that in case you should happen to fall in wrap say she again a bit of white rag -- one of my shirt you would cut half across ay say barbro 'twa a bit of rag i take with I to carry back juniper twig in juniper twig yes do not i tell you that be what i would be for ay so you say or else it be twig for a broom well no matter what it be it be a open quarrel between they this time but even that die away after a time and all be well again that be to say not well exactly -- no but passable barbro be careful and more submissive she know there be danger but that way life at maaneland grow even more forced and intolerable -- no frankness no joy between they always on guard it could not last long but as long as it last at all axel be force to be content he have get this girl on the place and have want she for himself and have she tie he life to she it be not a easy matter to alter all that barbro know everything about the place : where pot and vessel stand when cow and goat be to bear if the winter feed would be short or plenty how much milk be for cheese and how much for food -- a stranger would know nothing of it all and even so a stranger be perhaps not to be have oh but axel have think many a time of get rid of barbro and take another girl to help she be a wicked thing at time and he be almost afraid of she even when he have the misfortune to get on well with she he draw back at time in fear of she strange cruelty and brutal way but she be pretty to look at and could be sweet at time and bury he deep in she arm so it have be -- but that be over now no thank you -- barbro be not go to have all that miserable business over again but it be not so easy to change let 's get marry at once then say axel urge she at once say she nay i must go into town first about my tooth they be all but go as it be so there be nothing to do but go on as before and barbro have no real wages now but far beyond what she wages would have be and every time she ask for money and he give it she thank he as for a gift but for all that axel could not make out where the money go -- what could she want money for out in the wild be she hoard for herself but what on earth be there to save and save for all the year round there be much that axel could not make out have not he give she a ring -- ay a real gold ring and they have get on well together too after that last gift but it could not last for ever far from it and he could not go on buy ring to give she in a word -- do she mean to throw he over woman be strange creature be there a man with a good farm and a well-stocked place of he own wait for she somewhere else axel could at time go so far as to strike he fist on the table in he impatience with woman and they foolish humor a strange thing barbro seem to have nothing really in she head but the thought of bergen and town life well and good but if so why have she come back at all confound she a telegram from she father would never have move she a step in itself she must have have some other reason and now here she be eternally discontented from morning to night year after year all these wooden bucket instead of proper iron pail cooking-pot instead of saucepan the everlasting milk instead of a little walk round to the dairy heavy boot yellow soap a pillow stuff with hay no military band no people live like this they have many little bout after the one big quarrel ho time and again they be at it you say no more about it if you be wise say barbro and not to speak of what you have do about father and all say axel : well what have i do oh you know well enough say she but for all that you 'll not be inspector anyway ho no that you will not i 'll believe it when i see it mean i be not good enough perhaps oh good enough and good enough anyway you can not read nor write and never so much as take a newspaper to look at as to that say he i can read and write all i have any need for but as for you with all you gabble and talk i be sick of it well then here be that to begin with say she and throw down the silver ring on the table ho say he after a while and what about the other oh if you want you ring back that you give I you can have they say she try to pull off the gold one you can be as nasty as you please say he if you think i care and he go out and naturally enough soon after barbro be wear both she ring again in time too she cease to care at all for what he say about the death of the child she simply sniff and toss she head not that she ever confess anything but only say : well and suppose i have drown it you live here in the wild and what do you know of thing elsewhere once when they be talk of this she seem to be try to get he to see he be take it all too seriously she herself think no more of get rid of a child than the matter be worth she know two girl in bergen who have do it but one of they have get two month ' imprisonment because she have be a fool and have not kill it but only leave it out to freeze to death and the other have be acquit no say barbro the law 's not so cruel hard now as it use to be and besides it be not always it get find out there be a girl in bergen at the hotel who have kill two child she be from christianium and wear a hat -- a hat with feather in they have give she three month for the second one but the first be never discover say barbro axel listen to all this and grow more than ever afraid of she he try to understand to make out thing a little in the darkness but she be right after all he take these thing too seriously in he way with all she vulgar depravity barbro be not worth a single earnest thought infanticide mean nothing to she there be nothing extraordinary in the killing of a child she think of it only with the looseness and moral nastiness that be to be expect of a servant-girl it be plain too in the day that follow never a hour do she give herself up to think she be easy and natural as ever unalterably shallow and foolish unalterably a servant-girl i must go and have my tooth see to she say and i want one of those new cloak there be a new kind of half-length coat that have be fashionable for some year past and barbro must have one and when she take it all so naturally what could axel do but give way and it be not always that he have any real suspicion of she she herself have never confess have indeed deny time and again but without indignation without insistence as a trifle as a servant-girl would have deny have break a dish whether she have do so or not but after a couple of week axel could stand it no longer he stop dead one day in the middle of the room and see it all as by a revelation great heaven every one must have see how it be with she heavy with child and plain to see -- and now with she figure as before -- but where be the child suppose other come to look for it they would be ask about it sooner or later and if there have be nothing wrong it would have be far better to have have the child bury decently in the churchyard not there in the bush there on he land no ` twould only have make a fuss say barbro they would have cut it open and have a inquest and all that i do not want to be bother if only it may not come to worse later on say he barbro ask easily : what be there to worry about let it lie where it be ay she smile and ask : be you afraid it 'll come after you leave all that nonsense and say no more about it ay well do i drown the child i have tell you it drown itself in the water when i slip in i never hear such thing as you get in you head and anyway it would never be find out say she 'twa find out all the same with inger at sellanraa say axel barbro think for a moment well i do not care say she the law 's all different now and if you read the papers you would know there be heap that have do it and do not get anything to speak of barbro set out to explain it to teach he as it be -- get he to take a broad view of thing it be not for nothing she herself have be out in the world and see and hear and learn so much now she could sit here and be more than a match for he she have three main argument which she be continually advance : in the first place she have not do it in the second it be not such a terrible thing after all if she have do it but in the third place it would never be find out everything get find out seem to I he object not by a long way she answer and whether to astonish he or to encourage he or perhaps from sheer vanity and as something to boast of all of a sudden she throw a bombshell thus : i have do something myself that never get find out you say he all unbelieve what have you do what have i do kill something she have not mean perhaps to go so far but she have to go on now there he be stare at she oh and it be not grand indomitable boldness even it be mere bravado vulgar show off she want to look big herself and silence he you do not believe I she cry d'you remember that in the paper about the body of a child find in the harbor 'twa I that do it what say he body of a child you never remember anything we read about it in the paper you bring up after a moment he burst out : you must be out of you sens but he confusion seem to incite she more to give she a sort of artificial strength she could even give the detail i have it in my box -- it be dead then of course -- i do that as soon as it be bear and when we get out into the harbor i throw it overboard axel sit dark and silent but she go on it be a long time back now many year the time she have first come to maaneland so there he could see 'twa not everything be find out not by a long way what would thing be like if everything folk do get out what about all the married people in the town and the thing they do they kill they child before they be bear -- there be doctor who manage that they do not want more than one or at most two child and so they would get in a doctor to get rid of it before it come ho axel need not think that be such a great affair out in the world ho say axel then i suppose you do get rid of the last one too that way no i do not she answer carelessly as could be for i drop it she say but even then she must go on again about it be nothing so terrible if she have she be plainly accustom to think of the thing as natural and easy it do not affect she now the first time perhaps it might have be a little uncomfortable something of a awkward feeling about it to kill the child but the second she could think of it now with a sort of historic sense : as a thing that have be do and could be do axel go out of the house heavy in mind he be not so much concern over the fact that barbro have kill she first child -- that be nothing to do with himself that she have have a child at all before she come to he be nothing much either she be no innocent and have never pretend to be so far from it she have make no secret of she knowledge and have teach he many thing in the dark well and good but this last child -- he would not willingly have lose it a tiny boy a little white creature wrap up in a rag if she be guilty of that child 's death then she have injure he axel -- break a tie that he prize and that could not be replace but it might be that he wrong she after all : that she _ have _ slip in the water by accident but then the wrapping -- the bit of shirt she have take with she meantime the hour pass dinner-time come and evening and when axel have go to bed and have lie stare into the dark long enough he fall asleep at last and sleep till morning and then come a new day and after that day other day barbro be the same as ever she know so much of the world and could take lightly many little trifle that be terrible and serious thing for folk in the wild it be well in a way she be clever enough for both of they careless enough for both and she do not go about like a terrible creature herself barbro a monster not in the least she be a pretty girl with blue eye a slightly turned-up nose and quick-handed at she work she be utterly sick and tired of the farm and the wooden vessel that take such a lot of cleaning sick and tired perhaps of axel and all of the out-of-the-way life she lead but she never kill any of the cattle and axel never find she standing over he with uplifted knife in the middle of the night only once it happen that they come to talk again of the body in the wood axel still insist that it ought to have be bury in the churchyard in consecrated ground but she maintain as before that she way be good enough and then she say something which show that she be reason after she fashion -- ho be sharp enough could see beyond the tip of she nose could think with the pitiful little brain of a savage if it get find out i 'll go and talk to the lensmand i have be in service with he and fru heyerdahl she 'll put in a word for I i know it be not every one that can get folk to help they like that and they get off all the same and then besides there be father that know all the great folk and be assistant himself and all the rest but axel only shake he head well what be wrong with that d'you think you father would ever be able to do anything a lot you know about it she cry angrily after you have ruin he and all take he farm and the bread out of he mouth she seem to have a sort of idea herself that she father 's reputation have suffer of late and that she might lose by it and what could axel say to that nothing he be a man of peace a worker chapter iii that winter axel be leave to himself again at maaneland barbro be go ay that be the end of it she journey to town would not take long she say 'twa not like go to bergen but she be not go to stay on here lose one tooth after another till she have a mouth like a calf what 'll it cost say axel how do i know say she but anyway it will not cost you anything i 'll earn the money myself she have explain too why it be best for she to go just then there be but two cow to milk and in the spring there would be two more besides all the goat with kid and the busy season and work enough right on till June do as you please say axel it be not go to cost he anything not at all but she must have some money to start with just a little there be the journey and the dentist to pay and besides she must have one of the new cloak and some other little thing but of course if he do not care to you have have money enough up to now say he h be say she anyway it be all go have not you put by anything put by anything you can look in my box it you like i never put by anything in bergen and i get more wages then i have no money to give you say he he have but little faith in she ever come back at all and she have plague he so much with she humor this way and that he have grow indifferent at last and though he give she money in the end it be nothing to speak of but he take no notice when she pack away a enormous hoard of food to take with she and he drive she down himself with she box to the village to meet the steamer and that be do he could have manage alone on the place he have learn to do so before but it be awkward with the cattle if ever he have to leave home there be none to look to they the storekeeper in the village have urge he to get oline to come for the winter she have be at sellanraa for year before she be old now of course but fit and able to work and axel do send for oline but she have not come and send no word meantime he work in the forest thresh out he little crop of corn and tend he cattle it be a quiet and lonely life now and again sivert from sellanraa would drive past on he way to and from the village take down load of wood or hide or farm produce but rarely bring anything up home there be little they need to buy now at sellanraa now and again too brede olsen would come trudge along more frequently of late -- whatever he might be after it look as if he be try to make himself indispensable to the telegraph people in the little time that remain so as to keep he job he never come in to see axel now that barbro be go but go straight by -- a piece of high-and-mightiness ill fit to he state see that he be still live on at breidablik and have not move one day when he be pass without so much as a word of greet axel stop he and ask when he have think of get out of the place what about barbro and the way she leave you ask brede in return and one word lead to another : you send she off with neither help nor mean 'twa a near thing but she never get to bergen at all ho so she be in bergen be she ay get there at last so she write but little thanks to you i 'll have you out of breidablik and that sharp say axel ay if you would be so kind say the other with a sneer but we 'll be go of ourselves at the new year he say and go on he way so barbro be go to bergen -- ay 'twa as axel have think he do not take it to heart take it to heart no indeed he be well rid of she but for all that he have hope a little until then that she might come back 'twa all unreasonable but somehow he have come to care overmuch for the girl -- ay for that devil of a girl she have she sweet moment unforgettable moment and it be on purpose to hinder she from run off to bergen that he have give she so little money for the journey and now she have go there after all a few of she clothes still hang in the house and there be a straw hat with bird ' wing on wrap up in a paper in the loft but she do not come to fetch they eyah maybe he take it to heart a little only a little and as if to jeer at he as a mighty jest in he trouble come the paper he have order for she every week and it would not stop now till the new year well well there be other thing to think about he must be a man next spring he would have to put up a shed against the north wall of the house the timber would have to be fell that winter and the plank cut axel have no timber to speak of not grow close but there be some heavy fir scatter about here and there on the outskirts of he land and he mark out those on the side toward sellanraa to have the shortest way to cart he timber up to the sawmill and so one morning he give the beast a extra feed to last they till the evening shut all door behind he and go out felling tree besides he ax and a basket of food he carry a rake to clear the snow away the weather be mild there have be a heavy snowstorm the day before but now it have stop he follow the telegraph line all the way to the spot then pull off he jacket and fall to work as the tree be fell he strip off the branch leave the clean trunk and pile up the small wood in heap brede olsen come by on he way up -- trouble on the line no doubt after yesterday 's storm or maybe brede be out on no particular errand but simply from pure zeal -- ho he be mighty keen on he duty of late be brede the two man do not speak do not so much as lift a hand in greet the weather be change again the wind be get up axel mark it but go on with he work it be long past noon and he have not yet eat then fell a big fir he manage to get in the way of its fall and be throw to the ground he hardly know how it happen -- but there it be a big fir sway from the root : a man will have it fall one way the storm say another -- and the storm it be that win he might have get clear after all but the lie of the ground be hide by snow axel make a false step lose he footing and come down in a cleft of rock astride of a boulder pin down by the weight of a tree well and what then he might still have get clear but as it chance he have fall awkwardly as could be -- no bone break as far as he could tell but twisted somehow and unable to drag himself out after a while he get one hand free support himself on the other but the ax be beyond he reach he look round take think as any other beast in a trap would do look round and take thought and try to work he way out from under the tree brede must be come by on he way down before long he think to himself and give himself a breathing-space he do not let it trouble he much at first it be only annoying to lose time at he work there be no thought in he mind of be in danger let alone in peril of he life true he can feel the hand that support he grow numbed and dead he foot in the cleft grow cold and helpless too but no matter brede must be here soon brede do not come the storm increase axel feel the snow drive full in he face ho ` tis come down in earnest now say he to himself still never troubling much about it all -- ay ` tis as if he blink at himself through the snow to look out for now thing be begin in earnest after a long while he give a single shout the sound would hardly carry far in the gale but it would be upward along the line towards brede axel lie there with all sort of vain and useless thought in he head : if only he could reach the ax and perhaps cut he way out if he could only get he hand up -- it be press against something sharp a edge of stone and the stone be eat its way quietly and politely into the back of he hand anyhow if only that infernal stone itself have not be there -- but no one have ever yet hear tell of such a touching act of kindness on the part of a stone get late now get later the snow drift thick axel be get snow up himself the snow pack all innocently all unknow about he face melting at first till the flesh grow cold and then it melt no longer ay now ` tis begin in earnest he give two great shout and listen he ax be get snow up now he can see but a bit of the haft over there be he basket of food hang on a tree -- if he could but have reach it and have a feed -- oh huge big mouthful and then he go one step farther in he demand and ask yet more : if he only have he coat on -- it be get cold he give another swing shout and there be brede stop in he track stand still look toward the man as he call he stand there but for a moment glance that way as if to see what be amiss reach I the ax here will you call axel a trifle weakly brede look away hurriedly fully aware now of what be the matter he glance up at the telegraph wire and seem to be whistle what can he mean by that here reach I the ax can not you cry axel louder i be pin here under a tree but brede be strangely full of zeal in he duty now he keep on look at the telegraph wire and whistle all the time note also that he seem to be whistle gaily as it be vengefully ho so you be go to murder I -- will not even reach I the ax cry axel and at that it seem as if there be trouble farther down the line which brede must see to without delay he move off and be lose to sight in the drive snow ho -- well and good but after that well it would just serve thing generally right if axel be to manage by himself after all and get at the ax without help from any one he strain all the muscle of he chest to lift the huge weight that bear he down the tree move he can feel it shake but all he gain by that be a shower of snow and after a few more try he give up grow dark now brede be go -- but how far can he have get axel shout again and let off a few straightforward word into the bargain leave I here to die would you like a murderer he cry have ye no soul nor thought of what be to come and the worth of a cow no less to lend a help hand but ` tis a dog you be and ever be brede and leave a man to die ho but there be more shall know of this never fear and true as i be lie here and will not even come and reach I that ax silence axel strain away at the tree once more lift it a little and bring down a new shower of snow give it up again and sigh he be wear out now and get sleepy there be the cattle at home they 'll be stand in the hut and bellow for food not a bite nor a drop since the morning no barbro to look to they now -- no barbro 's go run off and go and take both she ring gold and silver take they with she get dark now ay evening night well well but there be the cold to reckon with too he beard be freezing soon he eye will freeze too as well ay if he have but he jacket from the tree there and now he leg -- surely it can not be that -- but all the same one leg feel dead now up to the hip all in god 's hand he say to himself -- seem like he can talk all godly and pious when he will get dark ay but a man can die without the light of a lamp he feel all soft and good now and of sheer humility he smile foolishly and kindly at the snowstorm round ` tis god 's own snow a innocent thing ay he might even forgive brede and never say a word he be very quiet now and grow ever more sleepy ay as if some poison be numbing he all over and there be too much whiteness to look at every way wood and land great wing white veil white sail white white what can it be nonsense man and he know well enough it be but snow he be lie out in the snow ` tis no fancy that he be lie there pin down beneath a tree he shout again at hazard throw out a roar there in the snow a man 's great hairy chest swell to a roar bellow so it could be hear right down at the hut again and again ay and a swine and a monster he cry after brede again never a thought of how you be leave I to lie and be perish and could not even reach I the ax that be all i ask and call yourself a man or a beast of the field ay well then go you way and good luck to you if that be you will and think to go he must have sleep he be all stiff and lifeless now but he eye be open set in ice but open he can not wing nor blink -- have he be sleep with open eye drop off for a second maybe or for a hour god know but here 's oline standing before he he can hear she asking : in jesu name say if there be life in you and ask he if it be he lie there and if he be lose he wit or no always something of a jackal about oline sniff and scent out always on the spot where there be trouble ay she would nose it out and how could she ever have manage through life at all if it have not be that same way axel 's word have reach she and for all she seventy year she have cross the field to come snow up at sellanraa in the storm of the day before and then on again to maaneland not a soul on the place feed the cattle stand in the doorway listen milk the cow at milking-time listen again what could it be and then a cry come down and she nod axel maybe or maybe the hill-folk devil -- anyway something to sniff and scent and find -- to worm out the meaning of it all the wisdom of the almighty with the dark and the forest in the hollow of he hand -- and he would never harm oline that be not worthy to unloose the latchet of he shoe and there she stand the ax oline dig down and down in the snow and find no ax manage without then -- and she strain at the tree to lift it where it lie but with no more strength than a child she can but shake the branch here and there try for the ax again -- it be all dark but she dig with hand and foot axel can not move a hand to point only tell where it lay before but ` tis not there now if it have not be so far to sellanraa say axel then oline fall to search she own way and axel call to she that there be no ax there ay well say oline i be but look a bit and what be this maybe say she you have find it say he ay by the grace of the lord almighty answer oline with high-sounding word but there be little pride in axel now no more than he 'll give in that he be wrong after all and maybe not all clear in he head and what be he to do with the ax now ` tis there he can not stir and oline have to cut he free herself oh oline have wield a ax before that day have ax off many a load of firing in she life axel can not walk one leg be dead to the hip and something wrong with he back shooting pain that make he groan curiously -- ay he feel but a part of himself as if something be leave behind there under the tree do not know say he -- do not know what it can be but oline know and tell he now with solemn word ay for she have save a human creature from death and she know it ` tis the almighty have see fit to lay on she this charge where he might have send legion of angel let axel consider the grace and infinite wisdom of the almighty even in this and if so be as it have be he pleasure to send a worm out of the earth instead all thing be possible to he ay i know say axel but i can not make out how ` tis with I -- feel strange feel strange do it oh but only wait wait just a little 'twa but to move and stretch the least bit at a time till the life come back and get he jacket on and get warm again but never in all she day would she forget how the angel of the lord have call she out to the doorway that last time that she might hear a voice -- the voice of one cry in the forest ay 'twa as in the day of paradise when trumpet blow and compass round the wall of jericho ay strange but while she talk axel be take he time learn the use of he limb again get to walk they get along slowly towards home oline still play savior and support he they manage somehow a little farther down they come upon brede what be here say brede hurt yourself let I help a bit axel take no heed he have give a promise to god not to be vengeful not to tell of what brede have do but beyond that he be free and what be brede go up that way again for now have he see that oline be at maaneland and guess that she would hear and it be you here oline be it go on brede easily where d'you find he under a tree well now ` tis a curious thing say he i be up that way just now on duty along the line and seem like i hear some one shout turn round and listen quick as a flash -- brede 's the man to lend a hand if there be need and so 'twas axel be it lie under a tree d'you say ay say axel and well you know that saw and hear as well but never help hand good lord deliver we cry oline aghast as i be a sinner brede explain saw why yes i see you right enough but why do not you call out you might have call out if there be anything wrong i see you right enough ay but never think but you be lie down a bit to rest you would better say no more say axel warningly you know well enough you leave I there and hope i would never rise again oline see she way now brede must not be allow to interfere she must be indispensable nothing can come between she and axel that could make he less completely indebted to herself she have save he she alone and she wave brede aside will not even let he carry the ax or the basket of food oh for the moment she be all on axel 's side -- but next time she come to brede and sit talk to he over a cup of coffee she will be on he let I carry the ax and thing anyway say brede nay say oline speaking for axel he 'll take they himself and brede go on again : you might have call to I anyway we be not so deadly enemy that you could not say a word to a man -- you do call well you might have shout then so a man could hear blow a gale and all leastway you might have wave a hand i would no hand to wave answer axel you see how 'twa with I shut down and lock in all way nay that i 'll swear i do not well i never hear here let I carry those thing oline put in : leave he alone he be hurt and poorly but axel 's mind be get to work again now he have hear of oline before and understand it will be a costly thing for he and a plague besides if she can claim to have save he life all by herself better to share between they as far as may be and he let brede take the basket and the tool ay he let it be understand that this be a relief that it ease he to get rid of it but oline will not have it she snatch away the basket she and no other will carry what be to be carry there sly simplicity at war on every side axel be leave for a moment without support and brede have to drop the basket and hold he though axel can stand by himself now it seem then they go on a bit that way brede hold axel 's arm and oline carry the thing carry carry full of bitterness and flash fire a miserable part indeed to carry a basket instead of lead a helpless man what do brede want come that way at all -- devil of a man brede say she what be it they be say you have sell you place and all and who be it want to know say brede boldly why as to that i would never think 'twa any secret not to be know why do not you come to the sale then and bid with the rest I -- ay ` tis like you to make a jest of poor folk well and i think 'twa you have grow rich and grand be not it you have leave you old sivert 's chest and all he money in he he he oline be not pleased not soften at be mind of that legacy ay old sivert he have a kindly think for I and i 'll not say otherwise but once he be dead and go 'twa little they leave after he in worldly goods and you know yourself how ` tis to be strip of all and live under other man 's roof but old sivert he be in palace and mansion now and the likes of you and I be leave on earth to be spurn underfoot ho you and you talk say brede scornfully and turn to axel : well i be glad i come in time -- help you back home not go too fast eh no talk to oline stand up and argue with oline be never a man could do it but to he cost never in life would she give in and never she match for turn and twist heaven and earth to a medley of seeming kindness and malice poison and senseless word this to she face now : brede make as if 'twa himself be bring axel home what i be go to say she begin : they gentleman come up to sellanraa that time do you ever get to show they all those sack of stone you would get eh brede axel say brede let I hoist you on my shoulder and i 'll carry you down rest of the way nay say axel for all it be good of you to ask so they go on not far now to go oline must make the best of she time on the way better if you would save he at the point of death say she and how be it brede you come by and see he in deadly peril and hear he cry and never stop to help you hold you tongue say brede and it might have be easier for she if she have wade deep in snow and out of breath and a heavy burden and all but 'twa not oline 's way to hold she tongue she have a bit in reserve a dainty morsel ho 'twa a dangerous thing to talk of but she dare it there be barbro now say she and how 's it with she not run off and away perhaps ay she have answer brede carelessly and leave a place for you for the winter by the same but here be a first-rate opening for oline again she could let it be see now what a personage she be how none could manage long without oline -- oline that have to be send for near or far she might have be two place ay three for that matter there be the parsonage -- they would have be glad to have she there too and here be another thing -- ay let axel hear it too ` twould do no harm -- they would offer she so-and-so much for the winter not to speak of a new pair of shoe and a sheepskin into the bargain but she know what she be do come to maaneland come to a man that be lordly to give and would pay she over and above what other folk do -- and so she would come no 'twa no need for brede to trouble himself that gait -- when she heavenly father have watch over she all those year and open this door and that before she foot and bid she in ay and it seem like god himself have know what he be do send she up to maaneland that day to save the life of one of he creature on earth axel be get wearied again by now he leg could hardly bear he and seem like give up strange he have be get better by degree able to walk as the life and warmth come back into he body but now -- he must lean on brede for support it seem to begin when oline start talk about she wages and then when she be save he life again it be worse than ever be he try to lessen she triumph once more heaven know -- but he mind seem to be work again as they near the house he stop and say : look like i 'll never get there after all brede hoist he up without a word and carry he so they go on like that oline all venom axel up full length on brede 's back what i be go to say get out oline -- about barbro -- be not she far go with child child groan brede under the weight oh ` tis a strange procession but axel let himself be carry all the way till he be set down at he own door brede puff and blow mightily out of breath ay or how -- be it ever bear after all ask oline axel cut in quickly with a word to brede : i do not know how i would ever have get home this night but for you and he do not forget oline : and you oline that be the first to find I i have to thank you both for it all that be how axel be save \* \* \* \* \* the next few day oline would talk of nothing but the great event axel be hard put to it to keep she within bound oline can point out the very spot where she be stand in the room when a angel of the lord call she out to the door to hear a cry for help -- axel go back to he work in the wood and when he have fell enough begin cart it up to the sawmill at sellanraa good regular winter work as long as it last cart up rough timber and bring back sawn plank the great thing be to hurry and get through with it before the new year when the frost set in in earnest and the saw can not work thing be go on nicely everything as well as could be wish if sivert happen to come up from the village with a empty sledge he stop and take a stick of timber on the way to help he neighbor and the pair of they talk over thing together and each be glad of a talk with the other what be the news down village ask axel why nothing much say sivert there be a new man come to take up land so they say a new man -- nothing in that 'twa only sivert 's way of put it new man come now every year or so to take up land there be five new holding now below breidablik higher up thing go more slowly for all that the soil be richer that way the one who have venture farthest be isak when he settle down at sellanraa he be the boldest and the wisest of they all later axel ström have come -- and now there be a new man besides the new man be to have a big patch of arable land and forest down below maaneland -- there be land enough hear what sort of a man it be ask axel nay say sivert but he be

fishery there so they say h be -- fishery wonder if he know much about farm say axel that all you hear nothing more no he pay all down in cash for the title-deed that be all i hear must have make a heap of money with he fishery they say and now he be go to start here with a store ho a store ay so they say h be so he be go to start a store this be the one really important piece of news and the two neighbor talk it over every way as they drive up it be a big piece of news -- the greatest event perhaps in all the history of the place ay there be much to say of that who be he go to trade with this new man the eight of they that have settle on the common land or do he reckon on get custom from the village as well anyway the store would mean a lot to they like as not it would bring up more settler again the holding might rise in value -- who could say they talk it over as if they would never tire ay here be two man with they own interest and aim as great to they as other man 's the settlement be they world work season crop be the adventure of they life be not that interest and excitement enough ho enough indeed many a time they have need to sleep but lightly to work on long past meal-time but they stand it they endure it and be none the worse a matter of seven hour lie pin down beneath a tree be not a thing to spoil they for life as long as they limb be whole a narrow world a life with no great prospects ho indeed what of this new storborg a shop and a store here in the wild -- be not that prospect enough they talk it over until christmas come axel have get a letter a big envelope with a lion on it it be from the state he be to fetch supplies of wire a telegraph apparatus tool and implement from brede olsen and take over inspection of the line from new year 's day

of they to help with the cartage here we 'll pay you well why say sivert that be none so bad dare say but we be press just now and can not spare the time what can not spare the time to make money say the foreman but they have not always time at sellanraa there be much to do on the place they have hire man to help -- the first time such a thing have ever be do at sellanraa -- two stoneworker from the swedish side to get out stone for a new cowsh this have be isak 's great idea for year past to build a proper cowsh the turf hut where the cattle be house at present be too small and out of repair he would have a stone-built shed with double wall and a proper dung-pit under it be to be do now but there be many other thing to be do as well one thing always lead to another the building work at any rate seem never to be finish he have a sawmill and a cornmill and a summer shed for the cattle it be but reasonable he should have a smithy only a little place for odd job as need arise it be a long way to send down to the village when the sledge-hammer curl at the edge or a horseshoe or so want look to just enough to manage with that be all -- and why should not he altogether there be many outbuilding little and big at sellanraa the place be grow get bigger and bigger a mighty big place at last impossible now to manage without a girl to help and jensine have to stay on she father the blacksmith ask after she now and again if she be not come home soon but he do not make a point of it be a easy-going man and maybe with he own reason for let she stay and there be sellanraa farthest out of all the settlement grow bigger and bigger all the time the place that be the house and the ground only the folk be the same the day be go when wander lapp could come to the house and get all they want for the ask they come but rarely now seem rather to go a long way round and keep out of sight none be even see inside the house but wait without if they come at all lapp always keep to the outlying spot in dark place light and air distress they they can not thrive ` tis with they as with maggot and vermin now and again a calf or a lamb disappear without a trace from the outskirts of sellanraa from the farthest edge of the land -- there be no help that and sellanraa can bear the loss and even if sivert could shoot he have no gun but anyway he can not shoot a good-tempered fellow nothing warlike a bear jester : and anyway i doubt but there be a law against shooting lapp say he ay sellanraa can bear the loss of a head or so of cattle here and there it stand there great and strong but not without its trouble for all that inger be not altogether please with herself and with life all the year round no once she make a journey to a place a long way off and it seem to have leave a ugly discontent behind it may disappear for a time but always it return she be clever and hard-working as in she best day and a handsome healthy wife for a man for a barge of a man -- but have she no memory of trondhjem do she never dream ay and in winter most of all full of life and spirit at time and want no end of thing -- but a woman can not dance by herself and so there be no dancing at sellanraa heavy thought and book of devotion ay well but there be something heaven know in the other sort of life something splendid and unequalled she have learn to make do with little the swedish stoneworker be something at any rate strange face and new voice about the place but they be quiet elderly man give to work rather than play still better than nothing -- and one of they sing beautifully at he work inger stop now and again to listen hjalmar be he name and that be not all the trouble at sellanraa there be eleseus for instance -- a disappointment there he have write to say that he place in the engineer 's office be no longer open but he be go to get another all right -- only wait then come another letter he be expect something to turn up very shortly a first-rate post but meantime he could not live on nothing at all and when they send he a hundred - _ krone _ note from home he write back to say it be just enough to pay off some small debt he have h be say isak but we have these stoneworker folk to pay and a deal of thing write and ask if he would not rather come back here and lend a hand and inger write but eleseus do not care about come home again no no sense in make another journey all to no purpose he would rather starve well perhaps there be no first-rate post vacant just then in the city and eleseus perhaps be not as sharp as a razor in push he way heaven know -- perhaps he be not over clever at he work either write ay he could write well enough and quick and hard-working maybe but there might be something lack for all that and if so what be to become of he when he arrive from home with he two hundred _ krone _ the city be wait for he with old account outstanding and when those be pay well he have to get a proper walking-stick and not the remains of a umbrella there be other little thing as well that be but reasonable -- a fur cap for the winter like all he companion wear a pair of skate to go on the ice with as other do a silver toothpick which be a thing to clean one 's tooth and play with daintily when chat with friend over a glass of this or that and as long as he have money he stand treat as far as he be able at a festive evening hold to celebrate he return to town he order half a dozen bottle of beer and have they open sparingly one after another what -- twenty _ ore _ for the waitress say he friend ten 's quite enough do not do to be stingy say eleseus nothing stingy nor mean about eleseus no he come from a good home from a big place where he father the margrave own endless tract of timber and four horse and thirty cow and three mowing-machine eleseus be no liar and it be not he who have spread abroad all the fantastic story about the sellanraa estate 'twa the district surveyor who have amuse himself talk grandly about it a long while back but eleseus be not displeased to find the story take more or less for truth be nothing in himself it be just as well to be the son of somebody that count for something it give he credit and be useful that way but it could not last for ever the day come when he could no longer put off pay and what be he to do then one of he friend come to he help get he into he father 's business a general store where the peasant buy they wares -- better than nothing it be a poor thing for a grown lad to start at a beginner 's wage in a little shop no short cut to the position of a lensmand still it give he enough to live on help he over the worst for the present -- oh 'twa not so bad after all eleseus be willing and good-tempered here too and people like he he write home to say he have go into trade this be he mother 's greatest disappointment eleseus serve in a shop -- 'twa not a whit better than be assistant at the store down in the village before he have be something apart something different from the rest none of they neighbor have go off to live in a town and work in a office have he lose sight of he great aim and end inger be no fool she know well enough that there be a difference between the ordinary and the uncommon though perhaps she do not always think to reckon with it isak be simpler and slower of think he reckon less and less with eleseus now when he reckon at all he eldest son be gradually slip out of range isak no longer think of sellanraa divide between he two son when he himself should be go \* \* \* \* \* some way on in spring come engineer and workman from sweden go to build road put up hutment work in various way blast levelling get up supplies of food hire team of horse make arrangement with owner of land by the waterside what -- what be it all about this be in the wild where folk never come but those who live there well they be go to start that copper mine that be all so it have come to something after all geissler have not be merely boast it be not the same big man that have come with he that time -- no the two of they have stay behind have business elsewhere no doubt but the same engineer be there and the mining expert that have come at first they buy up all the sawn plank isak could spare buy food and drink and pay for it well chat in kindly fashion and be please with sellanraa aerial railway they say cable haulage from the top of the fjeld down to the waterside they say what down over all this moorland here say isak be slow to think but they laugh at that no on the other side man not this way ` twould be mile to go no on the other side of the fjeld straight down to the sea a good fall and no distance to speak of run the ore down through the air in iron tank oh it 'll work all right you wait and see but we 'll have to cart it down at first make a road and have it haul down in cart we shall want fifty horse -- you see we 'll get on finely and we have more man on the work than these few here -- that be nothing there be more come up from the other side gang of man with hut all ready to put up and store of provision and material and tool and thing -- then we meet and make connection with they half-way on the top you see we 'll make the thing go never fear -- and ship the ore to south america there be million to be make out of it what about the other gentleman ask isak that come up here before what oh they have sell out so you remember they no they have sell and the people that buy they out have sell again it be a big company now that own the mine -- any amount of money behind it and geissler where 'll he be now ask isak geissler never hear of he who be he lensmand geissler that sell you the place first of all oh he geissler be he name heaven know where he be now so you remember he too \* \* \* \* \* blast and work up in the hill gang of man at work all through the summer -- there be plenty do about the place inger do a busy trade in milk and farm produce and it amuse she -- go into business as it be and see all the many folk come and go isak tramp about with he lumber tread and work on he land nothing disturb he sivert and the two stoneworker get the new cowsh up it be a fine building but take a deal of time before it be finish with only three man to the work and sivert moreover often call away to help in the field the mowing-machine be useful now and a good thing too to have three active woman that could take a turn at the haymake all go well there be life in the wild now and money grow blossom everywhere and look at storborg the new trader 's place -- there be a business on a proper scale this aron must be a wizard a devil of a fellow he have learn somehow beforehand of the mining operation to come and be on the spot all ready with he shop and store to make the most of it business he do business enough for a whole state -- ay enough for a king to begin with he sell all kind of household utensil and workman 's clothes but miner earn good money be not afraid to spend it not content with buy necessaries only they would buy anything and everything and most of all on Saturday evening the trading station at storborg be crowd with folk and aron rake money in he clerk and he wife be both call in to help behind the counter and aron himself serve and sell as hard as he could go at it -- and even then the place would not be empty till late at night and the owner of horse-flesh in the village they be right 'twa a mighty cart and haul of wares up to storborg more than once they have to cut off corner of the old road and make new short cut -- a fine new road it be at last very different from isak 's first narrow path up through the wild aron be a blessing and a benefactor nothing less with he store and he new road he name be not aron really that be only he christian name properly he be aronsen and so he call himself and he wife call he the same they be a family not to be look down upon and keep two servant-girl and a lad as for the land at storborg it remain untouched for the present aronsen have no time for work on the soil -- where be the sense of digging up a barren moor but aronsen have a garden with a fence all round and currant bush and aster and rowan and plant tree -- ay a real garden there be a broad path down it where aronsen could walk o ' sunday and smoke he pipe and in the background be the verandah of the house with pane of color glass orange and red and blue storborg and there be child -- three pretty little thing about the place the girl be to learn to play she part as daughter of a wealthy trader and the boy be to learn the business themselves -- ay three child with a future before they aronsen be a man to take thought for the future or he would not have come there at all he might have stick to he fishery and like enough be lucky at that and make good money but 'twa not like go into business nothing so fine a thing for common folk at best people do not take off they hat to a fisherman aronsen have row he boat before pull at the oar now he be go to sail instead there be a word he be always use : cash down he use it all sort of way when thing go well they be go cash down he child be to get on in the world and live more cash down even than himself that be how he put it mean that they should have a easier life of it than he have have and look you thing do go well neighbor take notice of he and of he wife -- ay even of the child it be not the least remarkable thing that folk take notice of the child the miner come down from they work in the hill and have not see a child 's face for many day when they catch sight of aronsen 's little one play in the yard they would talk kindly to they at once as if they have meet three puppy at play they would have give they money but see they be the trader 's child it would hardly do so they play music for they on they mouth-organ instead young gustaf come down the wildest of they all with he hat over one ear and he lip ever ready with a merry word ay gustaf it be that come and play with they for long at a time the child know he every time and run to meet they he would pick they up and carry they on he back all three of they and dance with they ho say gustaf and dance with they and then he would take out he mouth-organ and play tune and music for they till the two servant-girl would come out and look at he and listen with tear in they eye ay a madcap be gustaf but he know what he be do then after a bit he would go into the shop and throw he money about buy up a whole knapsack full of thing and when he go back up the road again it be with a whole little stock-in-trade of he own -- and he would stop at sellanraa on the way and open he pack and show they notepaper with a flower in the corner and a new pipe and a new shirt and a fringed neckerchief -- sweet for the womenfolk and shiny thing a watch-chain with a compass a pocket-knife -- oh a host of thing ay there be rocket he have buy to let off on Sunday for every one to see inger give he milk and he joke with leopoldine and pick up little rebecca and swing she up in the air -- _ hoy huit _ and how 's the building get on he ask the swede -- gustaf be a swede himself and make friend with they too the building be get on as best it could with but themselves to the work why then he would come and give they a hand himself would gustaf though that be only say in jest ay if you only would say inger for the cowsh ought to be ready by the autumn when the cattle be bring in gustaf let off a rocket and have let off one there be no sense in keep the rest as well let they off too -- and so he do half a dozen of they and the woman and child stand round breathless at the magic of the magician and inger have never see a rocket before but the wild fire of they somehow remind she of the great world she have once see what be a sewing-machine to this and when gustaf finish up by play he mouth-organ inger would have go off along the road with he for sheer emotion the mine be work now and the ore be cart down by team of horse to the sea a steamer have load up one cargo and sail away with it to south america and another steamer wait already for the next load ay ` tis a big concern all the settler have be up to look at the wonderful place as many as can walk brede olsen have be up with he sample of stone and get nothing for he pain see that the mining expert be go back to sweden again on sunday there be a crowd of people come up all the way from the village ay even axel ström who have no time to throw away turn off from he proper road along the telegraph line to look at the place hardly a soul now but have see the mine and its wonder and at last inger herself inger from sellanraa put on she best gold ring and all and go up to the hill what do she want there nothing do not even care to see how the work be do inger have come to show herself that be all when she see the other woman go up she feel she must go too a disfigure scar on she upper lip and grown child of she own have inger but she must go as the other do it irk she to think of the other young woman ay but she will try if she can not compete with they all the same she have not begin to grow stout as yet but have still a good figure enough tall and natty enough she can still look well true she coloring be not what it use to be and she skin be not comparable to a golden peach -- but they should see for all that ay they should say after all she be good enough they greet she kindly as she could wish the workman know she she have give they many a drink of milk and they show she over the mine the hut the stable and kitchen the cellar and storeshed the bolder man edge in close to she and take she lightly by the arm but inger do not feel hurt at all it do she good and where there be step to go up or down she lift she skirt high show she leg a trifle but she manage it quietly as if without a think ay she be good enough think the man to themselves oh but there be something touch about she this woman get on in year plain to see that a glance from one of these warm-blooded menfolk come all unexpectedly to she she be grateful for it and return it she be a woman like other woman and it thrill she to feel so a honest woman she have be but like enough 'twa for lack of opportunity get on in year gustaf come up leave two girl from the village and a comrade just to come gustaf know what he be at no doubt he take inger 's hand with more warmth more pressure than be need and thank she for the last pleasant evening at sellanraa but he be careful not to plague she with attention well gustaf and when be you come to help we with the building say inger go red and gustaf say he will come sure enough before long he comrade hear it and put in a word that they 'll all be come down before long ho say inger be not you go to stay on the mine then come winter the man answer cautiously that it do not look like it but can not be sure but gustaf be bolder and laugh and say look like they have scrape out the bit of copper there be you 'll not say that in earnest surely say inger and the other man put in that gustaf have better be careful not to say any such thing but gustaf be not go to be careful he say a great deal more and as for inger 'twa strange how he manage to win she for himself for all that he never seem to put himself forward that way one of the other lad play a concertina but 'twa not like gustaf 's mouth-organ another lad again and a smart fellow he be too try to draw attention to himself by sing a song off by heart to the music but that be nothing either for all that he have a fine rolling voice and a little while after there be gustaf and if he have not get inger 's gold ring on he little finger and how have it come about when he never plague nor push himself forward oh he be forward enough in he way but quiet with it all as inger herself they do not talk of thing and she let he play with she hand as if without notice later on when she sit in one of the hut drink coffee there be a noise outside high word between the man and she know it be about herself and it warm she a pleasant thing to hear for one no longer young for a woman get on in year and how do she come home from the hill that Sunday evening ho well enough virtuous as she have come no more and no less there be a crowd of man to see she home the crowd of they that would not turn back as long as gustaf be there would not leave she alone with he not if they know it inger have never have such a gay time not even in the day when she have be out in the world have not inger lose something they ask at last lose something no a gold ring for instance and at that gustaf have to bring it out he be one against all a whole army oh 'twa a good thing you find it say inger and make haste to say good-bye to she escort she draw nearer sellanraa see the many roof of the building it be she home that lay there and she awake once more come back to herself like the clever wife she be and take a short cut through to the summer shed to look to the cattle on the way she pass by a place she know a little child have once lain bury there she have pat down the earth with she hand set up a tiny cross -- oh but it be long ago now she be wonder if those girl have finish they milking in good time the work at the mine go on but there be whispering of something wrong the yield be not as good as it have promise the mining expert who have go back home come out again with another expert to help he they go about blast and bore and examine all the ground what be wrong the copper be fine enough nothing wrong with that but thin and no real depth in it get thicker to the southward lie deep and fine just where the company 's hold reach its limit -- and beyond that be _ almenning _ the property of the state well the first purchaser have perhaps not think so much of the thing anyway it be a family affair some relative who have buy the place as a speculation they have not trouble to secure the whole range all the mile to the next valley no they have but take over a patch of ground from isak sellanraa and geissler and then sell it again and what be to be do now the lead man with the expert and the foreman know well enough they must start negotiation with the state at once so they send a messenger off at full speed to sweden with letter and plan and chart and ride away themselves down to the lensmand below to get the rights of the fjeld south of the water and here they difficulty begin the law stand in they way they be foreigner and can not be purchaser in they own right they know all about that and have make arrangement but the southern side of the fjeld be sell already -- and that they do not know sell ay long ago year back who buy it then geissler what geissler -- oh that fellow -- h be and the title-deed approve and register say the lensmand 'twa bare rock no more and he get it for next to nothing who be this fellow geissler that keep crop up where be he heaven know where he be now and a new messenger be send off to sweden they must find out all about this geissler meanwhile they could not keep on all the man they must wait and see so gustaf come down to sellanraa with all he worldly goods on he back and here he be he say ay gustaf have give up he work at the mine -- that be to say he have be a trifle too outspoken the Sunday before about the mine and the copper in the mine the foreman have hear of it and the engineer and gustaf be give he discharge well good-bye then and maybe 'twa the very thing he want there could be nothing suspicious now about he come to sellanraa they set he to work at once on the cowsh they work and work at the stone wall and when a few day later another man come down from the mine he be take on too now there be two spell and the work go apace ay they would have it ready by the autumn never fear but now one after another of the miner come down dismiss and take the road to sweden the trial working be stop for the present there be something like a sigh from the folk in the village at the news foolish folk they do not understand what a trial working be that it be only work on trial but so it be there be dark foreboding and discouragement among the village folk money be scarcer wages be reduce thing be very quiet at the trading station at storborg what do it all mean just when everything be go on finely and aronsen have get a flagstaff and a flag and have buy a fine white bearskin for a rug to have in the sledge for the winter and fine clothes for all the family little matter these but there be greater thing happen as well here be two new man have buy up land for clearing in the wild high up between maaneland and sellanraa and that be no small event for the whole of that little outlying community the two new settler have build they turf hut and start clear ground and digging they be hard-working folk and have do much in a little time all that summer they have buy they provision at storborg but when they come down now last time there be hardly anything to be have nothing in stock -- and what do aron want with heavy stock of this and that now the work at the mine have stop he have hardly anything of any sort on the place now -- only money of all the folk in the neighborhood aronsen be perhaps the most dejected he reckoning be all upset when some one urge he to cultivate he land and live on that till better time he answer : cultivate the land 'twa not that i come and set up house here for at last aronsen could stand it no longer he must go up to the mine and see for himself how thing be it be a Sunday when he get to sellanraa he want isak to go with he but isak have never yet set foot on the mine since they have start he be more at home on the hillside below inger have to put in a word you might as well go with aronsen when he ask you she say and maybe inger be not sorry to have he go 'twa Sunday and like as not she want to be rid of he for a hour or so and so isak go along there be strange thing to be see up there in the hill isak do not recognize the place at all now with its hut and shed a whole town of they and cart and waggon and great gaping hole in the ground the engineer himself show they round maybe he be not in the best of humor just now that same engineer but he have try all along to keep away the feeling of gloom that have fall upon the village folk and the settler round -- and here be he chance with no less person than the margrave of sellanraa and the great trader from storborg on the spot he explain the nature of the ore and the rock in which it be find copper iron and sulphur all be there together ay they know exactly what there be in the rock up there -- even gold and silver be there though not so much of it a mining engineer he know a deal of thing and it be all go to shut down now ask aronsen shut down repeat the engineer in astonishment a nice thing that would be for south america if we do no they be discontinue they preliminary operation for a while only for a short time they have see what the place be like what it could produce then they could build they aerial railway and get to work on the southern side of the fjeld he turn to isak : you do not happen to know where this geissler 's get to no well no matter -- they would get hold of he all right and then they would start to work again shut down the idea isak be suddenly lose in wonder and delight over a little machine that work with a treadle -- simply move you foot and it work he understand it at once -- ` tis a little smithy to carry about on a cart and take down and set up anywhere you please what be a thing like that cost now he ask that portable forge oh nothing much they have several of the same sort it appear but nothing to what they have down at the sea all sort of machine and apparatus huge big thing isak be give to understand that mine the making of valley and enormous chasm in the rock be not a business that could be do with you fingernail -- ha ha they stroll about the place and the engineer mention that he himself will be go across to sweden in a few day ' time but you 'll be come back again say aronsen why of course know of no reason why the government or the police should try to keep he isak manage to lead round to the portable forge once more and stop look at it again and what might a bit of a machine like that cost he ask cost could not say off-hand -- a deal of money no doubt but nothing to speak of in mining operation oh a grand fellow be the engineer not in the best of humor himself just then perhaps but he keep up appearance and play up rich and fine to the last do isak want a forge well he might take that one -- the company would never trouble about a little thing like that -- the company would make he a present of a portable forge a hour after aronsen and isak be on they way down again aronsen something calmer in mind -- there be hope after all isak trundle down the hillside with he precious forge on he back ay a barge of a man he could bear a load the engineer have offer to send a couple of man down with it to sellanraa next morning but isak thank he -- 'twa more than worth he while he be think of he own folk ` twould be a fine surprise for they to see he come walk down with a smithy on he back but 'twa isak be surprise after all a horse and cart turn into the courtyard just as he reach home and a highly remarkable load it bring the driver be a man from the village but beside he walk a gentleman at whom isak stare in astonishment -- it be geissler chapter v there be other thing that might have give isak matter for surprise but he be no great hand at thinking of more than one thing at a time where 's inger be all he say as he pass by the kitchen door he be only anxious to see that geissler be well receive inger inger be out pluck berry have be out pluck berry ever since isak start -- she and gustaf the swede ay get on in year and all in love again and wild with it autumn and winter near but she feel the warmth in herself again flower and blossom again come and show where there be cloudberry say gustaf cranberry say he and how could a woman say no inger run into she little room and be both earnest and religious for several minute but there be gustaf standing wait outside the world be at she heel and all she do be to tidy she hair look at herself carefully in the glass and out again and what if she do who would not have do the same oh a woman can not tell one man from another not always -- not often and they two go out pluck berry pluck cloudberry on the moorland step from tuft to tuft and she lift she skirt high and have she neat leg to show all quiet everywhere the white grouse have they young one grow already and do not fly up hiss any more they be sheltered spot where bush grow on the moor less than a hour since they start and already they be sit down to rest say inger : oh i do not think you be like that oh she be all weakness towards he and smile piteously be so deep in love -- ay a sweet and cruel thing to be in love ` tis both right and proper to be on she guard -- ay but only to give in at last inger be so deep in love -- desperately mercilessly she heart be full of kindliness towards he she only care to be close and precious to he ay a woman get on in year when the work 's finish you 'll be go off again say she no he be not go well of course some time but not yet not for a week or so have not we better be get home say she no they pluck more berry and in a little while they find a sheltered place among the bush and inger say : gustaf you be mad to do it and hour pass -- they 'll be sleep now belike among the bush sleep wonderful -- far out in the wilderness in the garden of eden then suddenly inger sit upright and listen : seem like i hear some one down on the road away off the sun be set the tuft of heather darken in shadow as they walk home they pass by many sheltered spot and gustaf see they and inger she see they too no doubt but all the time she feel as if some one be drive ahead of they oh but who could walk all the way home with a wild handsome lad and be on she guard all the time inger be too weak she can only smile and say : i never know such a one she come home alone and well that she come just then a fortunate thing a minute later have not be well at all isak have just come into the courtyard with he forge and aronsen -- and there be a horse and cart just pull up _ goddag _ say geissler greet inger as well and there they stand all look one at another -- could not be better geissler back again year now since he be there but he be back again age a little greyer a little but bright and cheerful as ever and finely dress this time with a white waistcoat and gold chain across a man beyond understanding have he a inkling maybe that something be go on up at the mine and want to see for himself well here he be very wide awake to look at glance round at the place at the land turn he head and use he eye every way there be great change to note the margrave have extend he domain and geissler nod what be that you be carry he ask isak ` tis a load for one horse in itself say he ` tis for a forge explain isak and a mighty useful thing to have on a bit of a farm say he -- ay call sellanraa a bit of a farm no more where do you get hold of it up at the mine engineer he give I the thing for a present he say the company 's engineer say geissler as if he have not understand and geissler be he to be outdo by a engineer on a copper mine i have hear you would get a mowing-machine say he and i have bring along a patent raker thing that be handy to have and he point to the load on the cart there it stand red and blue a huge comb a hayrake to be drive with horse they lift it out of the cart and look at it isak harness himself to the thing and try it over the ground no wonder he mouth open wide marvel on marvel come to sellanraa they speak of the mine of the work up in the hill they be ask about you quite a lot say isak who the engineer and all the other gentleman ` have to get hold of you somehow ' they say oh but here isak be say overmuch it seem geissler be offend no doubt he turn sharp and curt and say : well i be here if they want I next day come the two messenger back from sweden and with they a couple of the mine-owner on horseback they be fine gentleman and portly mighty rich folk by the look of they they hardly stop at sellanraa at all simply ask a question or so about the road without dismount and ride on up the hill geissler they pretend not to see though he stand quite close the messenger with they loaded packhorse rest for a hour talk to the man at work on the building learn that the old gentleman in the white waistcoat and gold chain be geissler and then they too go on again but that same evening one of they come ride down to the place with a message by word of mouth for geissler to come up to the gentleman at the mine i be here if they want I be the answer geissler send back geissler be grow a important personage it seem think himself a man of power of all the power in the world consider it perhaps beneath he dignity to be send for by word of mouth but how be it he have come to sellanraa at all just then -- just when he be most want a great one he must be for know thing all manner of thing anyway when the gentleman up at the mine have geissler 's answer there be nothing for it but they must bestir themselves and come all the way down to sellanraa again the engineer and the two mining expert come with they so many crooked way and turning be there before that meeting be bring about it look ill to start with ay geissler be over-lordly by far the gentleman be polite enough this time beg he to excuse they have send a verbal message the day before be tire out after they journey geissler be polite in return and say he too be tire out after he journey or he would have come well and then to get to business would geissler sell the land south of the water do you wish to purchase on you own account may i ask say geissler or be you act as agent now this could be nothing but sheer contrariness on geissler 's part he could surely see for himself that rich and portly gentleman of they stamp would not be act as agent they go on to discuss term what about the price say they the price -- yes say geissler and sit think it over a couple of million say he indeed say the gentleman and smile but geissler do not smile the engineer and the two expert have make a rough investigation of the ground make a few boring and blasting and here be they report : the occurrence of ore be due to eruption it be irregular and from they preliminary examination appear to be deepest in the neighborhood of the boundary between the company 's land and geissler 's decrease from there onward for the last mile or so there be no ore to be find worth work geissler listen to all this with the greatest nonchalance he take some papers from he pocket and look at they carefully but the papers be not chart nor map -- like as not they be thing no way connect with the mine at all you have not go deep enough say he as if it be something he have read in he papers the gentleman admit that at once but the engineer ask : how do he know that -- you have not make boring yourself i suppose and geissler smile as if he have bore hundred of mile down through the globe and cover up the hole again after they keep at it till noon talk it over this way and that and at last begin to look at they watch they have bring geissler down to half a million now but not a hair 's breadth farther no they must have put he out sorely some way or other they seem to think he be anxious to sell oblige to sell but he be not -- ho not a bit there he sit as easy and careless as themselves and no mistake it fifteen say twenty thousand would be a decent price anyway say they geissler agree that might be a decent price enough for any one sorely in need of the money but five-and-twenty thousand would be better and then one of the gentleman put in -- say it perhaps by way of keep geissler from soar too far : by the way i have see you wife 's people in sweden -- they send they kind regard thank you say geissler well say the other gentleman see geissler be not to be win over that way a quarter of a million it be not gold we be buy but copper ore exactly say geissler it be copper ore and at that they lose patience all of they and five watch-case be open and snap to again no more time to fool away now it be time for dinner they do not ask for food at sellanraa but ride back to the mine to get they own and that be the end of the meeting geissler be leave alone what would be in he mind all this time -- what be he ponder and speculate about nothing at all maybe but only idle and careless no indeed he be think of something but calm enough for all that after dinner he turn to isak and say : i be go for a long walk over my land up there and i would have like to have sivert with I same as last time ay so you shall say isak at once no he be other thing to do just now he shall go with you at once say isak and call to sivert to leave he work but geissler hold up he hand and say shortly : no he walk round the yard several time come back and talk to the man at they work chat easily with they and go off and come back again and all the time with this weighty matter on he mind yet talk as if it be nothing at all geissler have long be so long accustom to change of fortune maybe he be past feeling there be anything at stake now whatever might be in the air here he be the man he be by the merest chance he have sell the first little patch of land to he wife 's relation and what then go off and buy up the whole tract south of the water -- what for be it to annoy they by make himself they neighbor at first no doubt he have only think of take over a little strip of the land there just where the new village would have to be build if the workings come to anything but in the end he have come to be owner of the whole fjeld the land be to be have for next to nothing and he do not want a lot of trouble with boundary so from sheer idleness he have become a mining king a lord of the mountain he have think of a site for hut and machine shed and it have become a kingdom stretch right down to the sea in sweden the first little patch of land have pass from hand to hand and geissler have take care to keep himself inform as to its fate the first purchaser of course have buy foolishly buy without sense or forethought the family council be not mining expert they have not secure enough land at first think only of buy out a certain geissler and get rid of he but the new owner be no less to be laugh at mighty man no doubt who could afford to indulge in a jest and take up land for amusement 's sake for a drunken wager or heaven know what but when it come to trial workings and exploit the land in earnest then suddenly they find themselves but up against a wall -- geissler child think geissler maybe in he lofty mind he feel he power now feel strong enough to be short and abrupt with folk the other have certainly do they best to take he down a peg they imagine they be deal with a man in need of money and throw out hint of some fifteen or twenty thousand -- ay child they do not know geissler and now here he stand they come down no more that day from the fjeld thinking best no doubt not to show themselves over-anxious next morning they come down packhorse and all on they way home and lo -- geissler be not there not there that put a end to any idea they might have have of settle the manner in lordly wise from the saddle they have to dismount and wait and where be geissler if you please nobody could tell they he go about everywhere do geissler take a interest in sellanraa and all about it the last they have see of he be up at the sawmill the messenger be send out to look for he but geissler must have go some distance it seem for he give no answer when they shout the gentleman look at they watch and be plainly annoy at first and say : we be not go to fool about here wait like this if geissler want to sell he must be on the spot oh but they change they tone in a little while show no annoyance after a while but even begin to find something amusing in it all to jest about it here be they in a desperate case they would have to lie out there in the desolate hill all night and get lose and starve to death in the wild and leave they bone to bleach undiscovered by they mourning kin -- ay they make a great jest of it all at last geissler come have be look round a bit -- just come from the cattle enclosure look as if that 'll be too small for you soon say he to isak how many head have you get up there now altogether ay he could talk like that with those fine gentleman stand there watch in hand curiously red in the face be geissler as if he have be drink puh say he i be all hot walking we half expect you would be here when we come say one of the gentleman i have no word of you want to see I at all answer geissler otherwise i might have be here on the spot well and what about the business now be geissler prepare to accept a reasonable offer today it be not every day he have a chance of fifteen or twenty thousand -- what unless of course if the money be nothing to he why then this last suggestion be not to geissler 's taste at all he be offend a nice way to talk well they would not have say it perhaps if they have not be annoy at first and geissler no doubt would hardly have turn suddenly pale at they word if he have not be out somewhere by himself and get red as it be he pale and answer coldly : i do not wish to make any suggestion as to what you gentleman may be in a position to pay -- but i know what i be willing to accept and what not i have no use for more child 's prattle about the mine my price be the same as yesterday a quarter of a million _ krone _ yes the gentleman mount they horse look here say one we 'll go this far and say twenty-five thousand you be still incline to joke i see say geissler but i 'll make _ you _ a offer in sober earnest : would you care to sell you bit of a mine up there why say they somewhat take aback -- why we might do that perhaps i be ready to buy it say geissler oh that geissler with the courtyard full of people now listen to every word all the sellanraa folk and the stoneworker and the messenger like as not he could never have raise the money nor anything near it for such a deal but again who could say a man beyond understanding be geissler anyhow he last word rather disconcert those gentleman on horseback be it a trick do he reckon to make he own land seem worth more by this maneuver the gentleman think it over ay they even begin to talk softly together about it they get down from they horse again then the engineer put in a word he think no doubt it be get beyond all bearing and he seem to have some power some kind of authority here and the yard be full of folk all listen to what be go on we 'll not sell say he not ask he companion no they whisper together again and they mount they horse once more -- in earnest this time twenty-five thousand call out one of they geissler do not answer but turn away and go over to talk to the stoneworker again and that be the end of they last meeting geissler appear to care nothing for what might come of it he walk about talk of this that and the other for the moment he seem chiefly interested in the lay of some heavy beam across the shell of the new cowhouse they be to get the work finish that week with a temporary roof -- a new fodder loft be to be build up over later on isak keep sivert away from the building work now and leave he idle -- and this he do with a purpose that geissler might find the lad ready at any time if he want to go explore with he in the hill but isak might have save himself the trouble geissler have give up the idea or perhaps forget all about it what he do be to get inger to pack he up some food and set off down the road he stay away till evening he pass the two new clearing that have be start below sellanraa and talk to the man there go right down to maaneland to see what axel ström have get do that year nothing very great it seem not as much as he might have wish but he have put in some good work on the land geissler take a interest in this place too and ask he : get a horse ay well i have a mowing-machine and a harrow down south both new i 'll send they up if you like how asked axel unable to conceive such magnificence and think vaguely of payment by instalment i mean i 'll make you a present of they say geissler ` tis hard to believe say axel but you 'll have to help those two neighbor of yours up above break new land ay never fear for that say axel he could still hardly make out what geissler mean by it all so you have machine and thing down south i have a deal of thing to look after say geissler now as a matter of fact geissler have no great deal of thing to look after but he like to make it appear so as for a mowing-machine and a harrow he could buy they in any of the town and send up from there he stay talk a long while with axel ström about the other settler near of storborg the trading station of axel 's brother newly marry who have come to breidablik and have start drain the moor and get the water out axel complain that it be impossible to get a woman anywhere to help he have none but a old creature by name oline not much good at the best of time but he might be thankful to have she as long as she stay axel have be work day and night part of that summer he might perhaps have get a woman from he own part from helgeland but that would have mean pay for she journey besides wages a costly business all round axel further tell how he have take over the inspection of the telegraph line but rather wish he have leave it alone that sort of thing 's only fit for brede and he like say geissler ay that be a true word axel admit but there be the money to think of how many cow have you get four and a young bull 'twa too far to go up to sellanraa to theirs but there be a far weightier matter axel badly want to talk over with geissler barbro 's affair have come to light somehow and a investigation be in progress come to light of course it have barbro have be go about evidently with child and plain to see and she have leave the place by herself all unencumbered and no child at all how have it come about when geissler understand what the matter be he say quite shortly : come along with I and he lead axel with he away from the house geissler put on a important air as one in authority they sit down at the edge of the wood and geissler say : now then tell I all about it come to light of course it have how could it be help the place be no longer a desert with never a soul for mile and moreover oline be there what have oline to do with it ho and to make thing worse brede olsen have make a enemy of she himself no means of get round oline now here she be on the spot and could worm thing out of axel a bit at a time 'twa just such underhand work she live for ay live by in some degree and here be the very thing for she -- trust oline for scent it out truth to tell oline be grow too old now to keep house and tend cattle at maaneland she ought to have give it up but how could she how could she leave a place where a fine deep mystery lay simply wait to be bring to light she manage the winter 's work ay she get through the summer too and it be a marvel of strength she gain from the mere thought of be able one day to show up a daughter of brede himself the snow be not go from the field that spring before oline begin poke about she find the little green mound by the stream and see at once that the turf have be lay down in square she have even have the luck to come upon axel one day standing by the little grave and tread it down so axel know all about it and oline nod she gray head -- ay it be she turn now not but axel be a kindly man enough to live with but miserly count he cheese and keep good note of every tuft of wool oline could not do as she like with thing not by a long way and then that matter of the accident last year when she have save he -- if axel have be the right sort he would have give she the credit for it all and acknowledge he debt to she alone but not a bit of it -- axel still hold to the division he have make on the spot ay he would say if oline have not happen to come along he would have have to lie out there in the cold all night but brede he have be a good help too on the way home and that be all the thanks she get oline be full of indignation -- surely the lord almighty must turn away he face from he creature how easy it would have be for axel to lead out a cow from its stall and bring it to she and say : here be a cow for you oline but no not a word of it well let he wait -- wait and see if it might not come to cost he more than the worth of a cow in the end all through that summer oline keep a look-out for every passer-by and whisper to they and nod and confide thing to they in secret but never a word i have say so she charge they every time oline go down to the village too more than once and now there be rumor and talk of thing about the place ay drift like a fog settle on face and get into ear even the child go to school at breidablik begin nod secret among themselves and at last the lensmand have to take it up have to bestir himself and report it and ask for instruction then he come up with a book to write in and a assistant to help he come up to maaneland one day and investigate thing and write thing down and go back again but three week after he come up once more investigate and write down again and this time he open a little green mound by the stream and take out the body of a child oline be a invaluable help to he and in return he have to answer a host of question she put among other thing he say yes it might perhaps come to have axel arrest too at that oline clasp she hand in dismay at all the wickedness she have get mix up with here and only wish she be out of the place far away from it all but the girl she whisper what about barbro herself the girl barbro say the lensmand she be under arrest now in bergen the law must take its course say he and he take the little body and go back again to the village little wonder then that axel ström be anxious he have speak out to the lensmand and deny nothing he be in part responsible for the come of the child at all and in addition he have dig a grave for it and now he be ask geissler what he have better do next would he have to go in to the town to a new and worse examination and be tortured there geissler be not the man he have be -- no and the long story have weary he he seem duller now whatever might be the cause he be not the bright and confident soul he have be that morning he look at he watch get up and say : this 'll want think over i 'll go into it thoroughly and let you know before i leave and geissler go off he come back to sellanraa that evening have a little supper and go to bed sleep till late next morning sleep rest thoroughly he be tired no doubt after he meeting with the swedish mine-owner not till two day after do he make ready to leave he be he lordly self again by then pay liberally for he keep and give little rebecca a shine _ krone _ he make a speech to isak and say : it do not matter in the least if nothing come of the deal this time it 'll come all right later on for the present i be go to stop the work up there and leave it a bit as for those fellow -- child think they would teach I do they do you hear what they offer I twenty-five thousand ay say isak well say geissler and wave he hand as if dismiss all impertinent offer of insignificant sum from he mind well it will not do any harm to the district if i do stop the work there a bit -- on the contrary it 'll teach folk to stick to they land but they 'll feel it in the village they make a pile of money there last summer fine clothes and fine living for all -- but there be a end of that now ay it might have be worth they while the good folk down there to have keep in with I thing might have be different then now it 'll be as i please but for all that he do not look much of a man to control the fate of village as he go away he carry a parcel of food in he hand and he white waistcoat be no longer altogether clean he good wife might have equip he for the journey up this time out of the rest of the forty thousand she have once get -- who could say perhaps she have anyhow he be go back poor enough he do not forget to look in at axel ström on the way down and give the result of he think over i have be look at it every way say he the matter 's in abeyance for the present so there be nothing to be do just yet you 'll be call up for a further examination and you 'll have to say how thing be word nothing more geissler have probably never give the matter a think at all and axel agree dejectedly to all he say but at last geissler flicker up into a mighty man again pucker he brow and say thoughtfully : unless perhaps i could manage to come to town myself and watch the proceedings ay if you would be so good say axel geissler decide in a moment i 'll see if i can manage it if i can get the time but i have a heap of thing to look after down south i 'll come if i can good-bye for now i 'll send you those machine all right and geissler go would he ever come again chapter vi the rest of the workman come down from the mine work be stop the fjeld lie dead again the building at sellanraa too be finish now there be a makeshift roof of turf put on for the winter the great space beneath be divide into room bright apartment a great salon in the middle and large room at either end as if it be for human being here isak once live in a turf hut together with a few goat -- there be no turf hut to be see now at sellanraa loose box manger and bin be fit up the two stoneworker be still busy keep on to get the whole thing finish as soon as possible but gustaf be no hand at woodwork so he say and he be leave gustaf have be a splendid lad at the stonework heaving and lifting like a bear and in the evening a joy and delight to all play he mouth-organ not to speak of help the womenfolk carry heavy pail to and from the river but he be go now no gustaf be no hand at woodwork so he say it look almost as if he be in a hurry to get away can not it wait till tomorrow say inger no it can not wait he be no more work to do here and besides go now he will have company across the hill go over with the last gang from the mine and who be to help I with my bucket now say inger smile sadly but gustaf be never at a loss he have he answer ready and say hjalmar now hjalmar be the younger of the two stoneworker but neither of they be young as gustaf himself none like he in any way hjalmar -- huh say inger contemptuously then suddenly she change she tone and turn to gustaf think to make he jealous though after all he be nice to have on the place be hjalmar say she and so prettily he sing and all do not think much of he anyway say gustaf he do not seem jealous in the least but you might stay one more night at least no gustaf could not stay one more night -- he be go across with the other ay maybe gustaf be get tired of the game by now 'twa a fine thing to snap she up in front of all the rest and have she for he own the few week he be there -- but he be go elsewhere now like as not to a sweetheart at home -- he have other thing in view be he to stay on loaf about here for the sake of she he have reason enough for bring the thing to a end as she herself must know but she be grow so bold so thoughtless of any consequence she seem to care for nothing no thing have not hold for so very long between they -- but long enough to last out the spell of he work there inger be sad and down-hearted enough ay so erringly faithful that she mourn for he ` tis hard for she she be honestly in love without any thought of vanity or conquest and not ashamed no she be a strong woman full of weakness she be but follow the law of nature all about she it be the glow of autumn in she as in all thing else she breast heave with feeling as she pack up food for gustaf to take with he no thought of whether she have the right of whether she dare risk this or that she give herself up to it entirely hungry to taste to enjoy isak might lift she up to the roof and thrust she to the floor again -- ay what of that it would not make she feel the less she go out with the parcel to gustaf now she have set the bucket by the step on purpose in case he should care to go with she to the river just once more maybe she would like to say something to give he some little thing -- she gold ring heaven know she be in a state to do anything but there must be a end of it some time gustaf thanks she say good-bye and go and there she stand hjalmar she call out aloud -- oh so much louder than she need as if she be determine to be gay in spite of all -- or cry out in distress gustaf go on he way \* \* \* \* \* all through that autumn there be the usual work in the field all round right away down to the village : potato to be take up corn to be get in the horn cattle let loose over the ground eight farm there be now and all be busy but at the trading station at storborg there be no cattle and no green land only a garden and there be no trade there now and nothing for any to be busy about there they have a new root crop at sellanraa call turnip send up a colossal growth of green wave leave out of the earth and nothing can keep the cow away from they -- the beast break down all hedgework and storm in bellow nothing for it but to set leopoldine and little rebecca to keep guard over the turnip field and little rebecca walk about with a big stick in she hand and be a wonder at drive cow away she father be at work close by now and again he come up to feel she hand and foot and ask if she be cold leopoldine be big and grow up now she can knit stocking and mitten for the winter while she be watch the herd bear in trondhjem be leopoldine and come to sellanraa five year old but the memory of a great town with many people and of a long voyage on a steamer be slip away from she now grow more and more distant she be a child of the wild and know nothing now of the great world beyond the village down below where she have be to church once or twice and where she be confirm the year before and the little casual work of every day go on with this thing and that to be do beside as for instance the road down below that be get bad one or two place the ground be still workable and isak go down one day with sivert ditching and drain the road there be two patch of bog to be drain axel ström have promise to take part in the work see that he have a horse and use the road himself -- but axel have press business in the town just then heaven know what it could be but very press he say it be but he have ask he brother from breidablik to work with they in he stead fredrik be this brother 's name a young man newly marry a light-hearted fellow who could make a jest but none the worse for that sivert and he be something alike now fredrik have look in at storborg on he way up that morning aronsen of storborg be he nearest neighbor and he be full of all the trader have be tell he it begin this way fredrik want a roll of tobacco i 'll give you a roll of tobacco when i have one say aronsen what you have no tobacco in the place no nor will not order any there be nobody to buy it what d'you think i make out of one roll of tobacco ay aronsen have be in a nasty humor that morning sure enough feel he have be cheat somehow by that swedish mining concern here have he set up a store out in the wild and then they go and shut down the work altogether fredrik smile slyly at aronsen and make fun of he now he be not so much as touch that land of he say he and have not even feed for he beast but must go and buy it ask I if i would any hay to sell no i would no hay to sell ` ho d'you mean you do not want to make money ' say aronsen think money 's everything in the world seem like put down a hundred - _ krone _ note on the counter and say ` money ' ` ay money 's well enough ' say i ` cash down ' say he ay he be just a little bit touch that way so to speak and he wife she go about with a watch and chain and all on weekday -- lord he know what can be she be so set on remember to the minute say sivert : do aronsen say anything about a man name geissler ay say something about he would be want to sell some land he have get and aronsen be wild about it he be -- ` fellow that use to be lensmand and get turn out ' he say and ` like as not without so much as a five _ krone _ in he book and ought to be shoot ' ` ay but wait a bit ' say i ` and maybe he 'll sell after all ' ` nay ' say aronsen ` do not you believe it i be a business man ' say he ` and i know -- when one party put up a price of two hundred and fifty thousand and the other offer twenty-five thousand there be too big a difference there 'll be no deal ever come out of that well let 'em go they own way and see what come of it ' say he ' i only wish i would never set my foot in this hole and a poor thing it be be for I and mine ' then i ask he if he do not think of sell out himself ` ay ' say he ` that be just what i be think of this bit of bogland ' say he ' a hole and a desert -- i be not make a single _ krone _ the whole day now ' say he they laugh at aronsen and have no pity for he at all think he 'll sell out ask isak well he do speak of it and he be get rid of the lad he have already ay a curious man a queer sort of man that aronsen ` tis sure send away he lad could be work on the place get in winter fuel and cart hay with that horse of he but keep on he storeman -- chief clerk he call he ` tis true enough as he say not sell so much as a _ krone _ all day for he be no stock in the place at all and what do he want with a chief clerk then i doubt it 'll be just by way of look grand and make a show must have a man there to stand at a desk and write up thing in book ha ha ha ay look like he be just a little bit touch that way be aronsen the three man work till noon eat food from they basket and talk a while they have matter of they own to talk over matter of good and ill to folk on the land no trifle to they but thing to be discuss warily they be clear-minded folk they nerve unworn and not fly out where they should not it be the autumn season now a silence in the wood all round the hill be there the sun be there and at evening the moon and the star will come all regular and certain full of kindliness a embrace man have time to rest here to lie in the heather with a arm for a pillow fredrik talk of breidablik how ` tis but little he be get do there yet awhile nay say isak ` tis none so little already i see when i be down that way this be praise from the oldest among they the giant himself and fredrik might well be pleased he ask frankly enough : do you think so now well it 'll be better before long i have have a deal of thing to hinder this year the house to do up be leaky and like to fall to piece hayloft to take down and put up again and no sort of room in the turf hut for beast see i would cow and heifer more than brede he would ever have in he time say fredrik proudly and you be thrive like up here ask isak ay i 'll not say no and wife she be thrive too why should not we there be good room and outlook all about we can see up and down the road both way and a neat little copse by the house all pretty to look at birch and willow -- i 'll plant a bit more other side of the house when i have time and it be fine to see how the bogland 's dry only since last year 's ditch -- ` tis all a question now what 'll grow on she this year ay thrive when we have house and home and land and all -- ` tis enough for the two of we surely ho say sivert slyly and the two of you -- be that all there be ever to be why as to that say fredrik bravely ` tis like enough there 'll be more to come and as to thrive -- well the wife 's not fall off anyway by the look of she they work on until evening draw up now and again to straighten they back and exchange a word or so and so you do not get the tobacco say sivert no that be true but 'twa no loss for i have no use for it anyway say fredrik no use for tobacco nay 'twa but for to drop in at aronsen 's like and hear what he would get to say and the two jester laugh together at that on the way home father and son talk little as be they way but isak must have be think out something for himself he say : sivert ay say sivert again nay 'twa nothing they walk on a good way and isak begin again : how 's he get on then with he trading aronsen when he be nothing to trade with nay say sivert but there be not folk enough here now for he to buy for ho you think so why i suppose ` tis so ay well sivert wonder a little at this after a while he father go on again : there be but eight place now in all but there might be more before long more well i do not know sivert wonder more than ever -- what can he father be get at the pair of they walk on a long way in silence they be nearly home now h be say isak what you think aronsen he would ask for that place of he now ho that be it say sivert want to buy it do you he ask jestingly but suddenly he understand what it all means : ` tis eleseus the old man have in mind oh he be not forget he after all but keep he faithfully in mind just as he mother only in he own way nearer earth and nearer to sellanraa ` twill be go for a reasonable price i doubt say sivert and when sivert say so much he father know the lad have read he thought and as if in fear of have speak out too clearly he fall to talk of they road-mending a good thing they have get it do at last for a couple of day after that sivert and he mother be put they head together and hold council and whisper -- ay they even write a letter and when Saturday come round sivert suddenly want to go down to the village what you want to go down village again for now say he father in displeasure wear boot to rag oh isak be more bitter than need be he know well enough that sivert be go to the post go to church say sivert 'twa all he could find by way of excuse and he father mutter : well what you want to go for but if sivert be go to church why he might harness up and take little rebecca with he little rebecca ay surely she might have that bit of a treat for once in she life after be so clever guard turnip and be all way the pearl and blessing of they all ay that she be and they harness up and rebecca have the maid jensine to look after she on the way and sivert say never a word against that either while they be away it so happen that aronsen 's man he chief clerk from storborg come up the road what do this mean why nothing very much ` tis only andresen the chief clerk from storborg come up for a bit of a walk this way -- he master have send he nothing more and no great excitement among the folk at sellanraa over that -- 'twa not as in the old day when a stranger be a rare sight on they new land and inger make a great to-do no inger 's grown quieter now and keep to herself these day a strange thing that book of devotion a guide upon the way a arm round one 's neck no less when inger have lose hold of herself a little lose she way a little out pluck berry she find she way home again by the thought of she little chamber and the holy book ay she be humble now and a godfearing soul she can remember long year ago when she would say a evil word if she prick she finger sewing -- so she have learn to do from she fellow-worker round the big table in the institute but now she prick she finger and it bleed and she suck the blood away in silence ` tis no little victory gain to change one 's nature so and inger do more than that when all the workman be go and the stone building be finish and sellanraa be all forsake and still then come a critical time for inger she cry a deal and suffer much she blame none but herself for it all and she be deeply humble if only she could have speak out to isak and relieved she mind but that be not they way at sellanraa there be none of they would talk they feeling and confess thing all she could do be to be extra careful in the way she ask she husband to come in to meal go right up to he to say it nicely instead of shout from the door and in the evening she look over he clothes and sew button on ay and even more she do one night she lift up on she elbow and say : isak what be it say isak be you awake ay nay 'twa nothing say inger but i have not be all as i ought what say isak ay so much he say and rise up on he elbow in turn they lay there and go on talk inger be a matchless woman after all and with a full heart i have not be as i ought towards you she say and i be that sorry about it the simple word move he this barge of a man be touch ay he want to comfort she know nothing of what be the matter but only that there be none like she naught to cry about my dear say isak there be none of we can be as we ought nay ` tis true she answer gratefully oh isak have a strong sound way of take thing straighten they out he do when they turn crooked none of we can be as we ought ay he be right the god of the heart -- for all that he be a god he go a deal of crooked way go out adventure the wild thing that he be and we can see it in he look one day rolling in a bed of rose and lick he lip and remember thing next day with a thorn in he foot desperately try to get it out die of it never a bit he be as well as ever a nice look-out it would be if he be to die and inger 's trouble pass off too she get over it but she keep on with she hour of devotion and find a merciful refuge there hard-working and patient and good she be now every day know isak different from all other man and want none but he no gay young spark of a singer true in he look and way but good enough ay good enough indeed and once more it be see that the fear of the lord and contentment therewith be a precious gain and now it be that the little chief clerk from storborg andresen come up to sellanraa one Sunday and inger be not in the least affected far from it she do not so much as go in herself to give he a mug of milk but send leopoldine in with it by reason that jensine the maid be out and leopoldine could carry a mug of milk as well as need be and she give it he and say here you be and blush for all she be wear she Sunday clothes and have nothing to be ashamed of anyway thanks ` tis overkind of you say andresen be you father at home say he ay he 'll be about the place somewhere andresen drink and wipe he mouth with a handkerchief and look at the time be it far up to the mine he ask no ` tis a hour 's walk or hardly that i be go up to look over they d'you see for he aronsen -- i be he chief clerk ho you 'll know I yourself no doubt i be aronsen 's chief clerk you have be down buy thing at we place before ay and i remember you well enough say andresen you have be down twice buy thing ` tis more than could be think you would remember that say leopoldine and have no more strength after that but stand holding by a chair but andresen have strength enough he go on and say : remember you well of course i should and he say more : you would not like to walk up to the mine with I say he and a little after something go wrong with leopoldine 's eye everything turn red and strange about she and the floor be slip away from under and chief clerk andresen be talk from somewhere ever so far off say : could not you spare the time no say she and heaven know how she manage to get out of the kitchen again she mother look at she and ask what be the matter nothing say leopoldine nothing no of course but now look you 'twa leopoldine 's turn to be affect to begin the same eternal round she be well fit for the same overgrown and pretty and newly confirm a excellent sacrifice she would make a bird be flutter in she young breast she long hand be like she mother 's full of tenderness full of sex could she dance -- ay indeed she could a marvel where she have manage to learn it but learn it they do at sellanraa as well as elsewhere sivert could dance and leopoldine too a kind of dancing peculiar to the spot growth of the new-cleared soil a dance with energy and swing : schottische mazurka waltz and polka in one and could not leopoldine deck herself out and fall in love and dream by daylight all awake ay as well as any other the day she stand in church she be allow to borrow she mother 's gold ring to wear no sin in that 'twa only neat and nice and the day after go to she communion she do not get the ring on till it be over ay she might well show herself in church with a gold ring on she finger be the daughter of a great man on the place -- the margrave when andresen come down from the mine he find isak at sellanraa and they ask he in give he dinner and a cup of coffee all the folk on the place be in there together now and take part in the conversation andresen explain that he master aronsen have send he up to see how thing be at the mine if there be any sign of begin work there again soon heaven know maybe andresen sit there lie all the time about be send by he master he might just as well have hit on it for he own account -- and anyway he could not have be at the mine at all in the little time he have be away ` tis none so easy to see from outside if they be go to start work again say isak no andresen admit that be so but aronsen have send he and after all two pair of eye could see better than one but here inger seemingly could contain herself no longer she ask : be it true what they be say aronsen be go to sell he place again andresen answer : he be thinking of it and a man like he can surely do as he like see all the means and riches he be get ho be he so rich then ay say andresen nod he head rich enough and that be a true word again inger can not keep silence but ask right out : i wonder now what he would be ask for the place isak put in a word here like as not he be more curious to know than inger herself but it must not seem that the idea of buy storborg be any thought of he he make himself a stranger to it and say now : why what you want to know for inger i be but ask say she and both of they look at andresen wait and he answer : answer cautiously enough that as to the price he can say nothing of that but he know what aronsen say the place have cost he and how much be that ask inger have no strength to keep she peace and be silent ` tis sixteen hundred _ krone _ say andresen ho and inger clap she hand at once to hear it for if there be one thing womenfolk have no sense nor thought of ` tis the price of land and property but anyway sixteen hundred _ krone _ be no small sum for folk in the wild and inger have but one fear that isak may be frighten off the deal but isak he sit there just exactly like a fjeld and say only : ay it be the big house he be put up ay say andresen again ` tis just that ` tis the fine big house and all just when andresen be make ready to go leopoldine slip out by the door a strange thing but somehow she can not bring herself to think of shake hand with he so she have find a good place standing in the new cowsh look out of a window and with a blue silk ribbon round she neck that she have not be wear before and a wonder she ever find time to put it on now there he go a trifle short and stout spry on he foot with a light full beard eight or ten year older than herself ay none so bad-looking to she mind and then the party come back from church late on Sunday night all have go well little rebecca have sleep the last few hour of the way up and be lift from the cart and carry indoors without wake sivert have hear a deal of news but when he mother ask well what you have get to tell he only say : nay nothing much axel he be get a mowing-machine and a harrow what be that say he father all interested do you see they ay i see they right enough down on the quay ho so that be what he must go in to town for say he father and sivert sit there swell with pride at know better but say never a word he father might just as well believe that axel 's press business in the town have be to buy machine he mother too might think so for all that ho but there be neither of they think so in they heart they have hear whisper enough of what be the matter of a new child-murder case in the wild time for bed say he father at last sivert go off to bed swell with knowledge axel have be summon for examination 'twa a big affair -- the lensmand have go with he -- so big indeed that the lensmand 's lady who have just have another child have leave the baby and be go in to town with she husband she have promise to put in a word to the jury herself gossip and scandal all abroad in the village now and sivert see well enough that a certain earlier crime of the same sort be be call to mind again outside the church the group would stop talk as he come up and have he not be the man he be perhaps some would have turn away from he good to be sivert those day a man from a big place to begin with son of a wealthy landowner -- and then beside to be know as a clever fellow a good worker he rank before other and be look up to for himself sivert have always be well like among folk if only jensine do not learn too much before they get home that day and sivert have he own affair to think of -- ay folk in the wild can blush and pale as well as other he have see jensine as she leave the church with little rebecca she have see he too but go by he wait a bit and then drive over to the smith 's to fetch they they be sit at table all the family at dinner sivert be ask to join they but have have he dinner thanks they know he would be come they might have wait that bit of a while for he -- so they would have do at sellanraa but not here it seem nay ` tis not what you be use to i dare say say the smith 's wife and what news from church say the smith for all he have be at church himself when jensine and little rebecca be seat up in the cart again say the smith 's wife to she daughter : well good-bye jensine we 'll be want you home again soon and that could be take two way think sivert but he say nothing if the speech have be more direct more plain and outspoken he might perhaps he wait with puckered brow but no more be say they drive up homeward and little rebecca be the only one with a word to say she be full of the wonder of go to church the priest in he dress with a silver cross and the light and the organ music after a long while jensine say : ` tis a shameful thing about barbro and all what do you mother mean about you come home soon ask sivert what she mean ay you think of leave we then why they 'll be want I home some time i doubt say she _ ptro _ say sivert stop he horse like I to drive back with you now perhaps jensine look at he he be pale as death no say she and a little after she begin to cry rebecca look in surprise from one to the other oh but little rebecca be a good one to have on a journey like that she take jensine 's part and pat she and make she smile again and when little rebecca look threateningly at she brother and say she be go to jump down and find a big stick to beat he sivert have to smile too but what do _ you _ mean now i would like to know say jensine sivert answer straight out at once : i mean if you do not care to stay with we why we must manage without and a long while after say jensine : well there be leopoldine she be big now and fit and all to do my work seem ay 'twa a sorrowful journey chapter vii a man walk up the way through the hill wind and rain the autumn downpour have begin but the man care little for that he look glad at heart and glad he be ` tis axel ström come back from the town and the court and all -- they have let he go free ay a happy man -- first of all there be a mowing-machine and a harrow for he down at the quay and more than that he be free and not guilty have take no part in the killing of a child ay so thing can turn out but the time he have be through standing there as a witness this toiler in the field have know the hardest day of he life 'twa no gain to he to make barbro 's guilt seem greater and for that reason he be careful not to say too much he do not even say all he know every word have to be drag out of he and he answer mostly with but yes and no be it not enough be he to make more of it than there be already oh but there be time when it look serious indeed there be the man of law black-robed and dangerous easy enough for they it seem just with a word or so to turn the whole thing as they pleased and have he sentence but they be kindly folk after all and do not try to bring he to destruction also as it happen there be powerful influence at work try to save barbro and it be all to he advantage as well then what on earth be there for he to trouble about barbro herself would hardly try to make thing look worse than need be for she former master and lover he know terrible thing about this and a earlier affair of the same sort she could not be such a fool no barbro be clever enough she say a good word for axel and declare that he have know nothing of she have bear a child till after it be all over he be different in some way perhaps from other man and they do not always get on well together but a quiet man and a good man in every way no it be true he have dig a new grave and bury the body away there but that be long after and by reason he have think the first place be not dry enough though indeed it be and 'twa only axel 's odd way of think what need then for axel to fear at all when barbro take all the blame on herself that way and as for barbro herself there be mighty influence at work fru lensmand heyerdahl have take up the case she go about to high and low never spare herself demand to be call as a witness and make a speech in court when she turn come she stand there before they all and be a great lady indeed she take up the question of infanticide in all its aspect and give the court a long harangue on the subject -- it almost seem as if she have obtain permission beforehand to say what she please ay folk might say what they would of fru lensmand heyerdahl but make a speech that she could and be learn in politics and social question no doubt about that 'twa a marvel where she find all she word now and again the preside justice seem wishful to keep she to the point but maybe he have not the heart to interrupt and let she run on and at the end of it all she volunteer one or two useful item of information and make a startling offer to the court leave out all legal technicality what take place be this : we woman say fru heyerdahl we be a unfortunate and oppressed moiety of humanity it be the man who make the law and we woman have not a word to say in the matter but can any man put himself in the position of a woman in childbirth have he ever feel the dread of it ever know the terrible pang ever cry aloud in the anguish of that hour in the present instance it be a servant-girl who have bear the child a girl unmarried and consequently try all through the critical time to hide she condition and why must she seek to hide it because of society society despise the unmarried woman who bear a child not only do society offer she no protection but it persecute she pursue she with contempt and disgrace atrocious no human creature with any heart at all could help feeling indignant at such a state of thing not only be the girl to bring a child into the world a thing in itself surely hard enough but she be to be treat as a criminal for that very fact i will venture to say that it be well for the unfortunate girl now accuse before the court that she child be bear by accident when she fall into the water and drown well for herself and for the child as long as society maintain its present attitude a unmarried mother should be count guiltless even if she do kill she child here a slight murmur be hear from the preside justice or at any rate she punishment should be merely nominal say fru heyerdahl we be all agreed of course she go on that infant life should be preserve but be that to mean that no law of simple humanity be to apply to the unfortunate mother think consider what she have be through during all the period of pregnancy what suffering she have endure in strive to hide she condition and all the time never know where to turn for herself and the child when it come no man can imagine it say she the child be at least kill in kindness the mother try to save herself and the child she love from the misery of its life the shame be more than she can bear and so the plan gradually form itself in she mind to put the child out of the way the birth take place in secret and the mother be for four-and-twenty hour in such a delirious state that at the moment of kill the child she be simply not responsible for she action practically speak she have not herself commit the act at all be out of she sens at the time with every bone in she body ache still after she delivery she have to take the little creature 's life and hide away the body -- think what a effort of will be demand here naturally we all wish all child to live we be distressed at the thought that any should be exterminate in such a way but it be the fault of society that it be so the fault of a hopeless merciless scandalmongering mischievous and evil-minded society ever on the watch to crush a unmarried mother by every means in its power but -- even after such treatment at the hand of society the persecute mother can rise up again it often happen that these girl after one false step of the sort be lead by that very fact to develop they best and noblest quality let the court inquire of the superintendent at refuge home where unmarried mother and they child be receive if this be not the case and experience have show that it be just such girl who have -- whom society have force to kill they own child that make the best nurse surely that be a matter for any and all to think seriously about then there be another side of the question why be the man to go free the mother find guilty of infanticide be thrust into prison and tortured but the father the seducer he be never touch yet be as he be the cause of the child 's existence he be a party to the crime he share in it indeed be greater than the mother 's have it not be for he there would have be no crime then why should he be acquit because the law be make by man there be the answer the enormity of such man-made law cry of itself to heaven for intervention and there can be no help for we woman till we be allow a say in the election and in the making of law ourselves but say fru heyerdahl if this be the terrible fate that be mete out to the guilty -- or let we say the more clearly guilty -- unmarried mother who have kill she child what of the innocent one who be merely suspect of the crime and have not commit it what reparation do society offer to she none at all i can testify that i know the girl here accuse have know she since she be a child she have be in my service and she father be my husband 's assistant we woman venture to think and feel directly in opposition to man 's accusation and persecution we dare to have we own opinion the girl there have be arrest deprive of she liberty on suspicion of have in the first place conceal the birth of a child and further of have kill the child so bear i have no doubt in my own mind that she be not guilty of either -- the court will itself arrive at this self-evident conclusion concealment of birth -- the child be bear in the middle of the day true the mother be alone at the time -- but who could have be with she in any case the place be far away in the wild the only live soul within reach be a man -- how could she send for a man at such a moment any woman will tell you it be impossible -- not to be think of and then -- it be allege that she must have kill the child after but the child be bear in the water -- the mother fall down in a icy stream and the child be bear what be she do by the water she be a servant-girl a slave that be to say and have she daily work to do she be go to fetch juniper twig for cleaning and cross the stream she slip and fall in and there she lie the child be bear and be drown in the water fru heyerdahl stop she could see from the look of the court and the spectator that she have speak wonderfully well there be a great silence in the place only barbro sit dab she eye now and again for sheer emotion and fru heyerdahl close with these word : we woman have some heart some feeling i have leave my own child in the care of stranger to travel all this way and appear as a witness on behalf of the unfortunate girl sit there man 's law can not prevent woman from think and i think this that the girl there have be punish sufficiently for no crime acquit she let she go free and i will take charge of she myself she will make the best nurse i have ever have and fru heyerdahl step down say the justice then : but i think you say a moment ago that the best nurse be those who _ have _ kill they child oh but the justice be not of a mind to go against fru heyerdahl not in the least -- he be as humane as could be himself a man as gentle as a priest when the advocate for the crown put a few question to the witness afterwards the justice sit for the most part make note on some papers the proceedings last only till a little over noon there be few witness and the case be clear enough axel ström sit hope for the best then suddenly it seem as if the advocate for the crown and fru heyerdahl be join force to make thing awkward for he because he have bury the body instead of notify the death he be cross-examine somewhat sharply on this point and would likely enough have come out badly if he have not all at once catch sight of geissler sit in the court ay 'twa right enough geissler be there this give axel courage he no longer feel himself alone against the law that be determine to beat he down and geissler nod to he ay geissler be come to town he have not ask to be call as a witness but he be there he have also spend a couple of day before the case come on in go into the matter himself and note down what he remember of axel 's own account give he at maaneland most of the document seem to geissler somewhat unsatisfactory this lensmand heyerdahl be evidently a narrow-minded person who have throughout endeavor to prove complicity on axel 's part fool idiot of a man -- what do he know of life in the wild when he could see that the child be just what axel have count on to keep the woman he helpmeet on the place geissler speak to the advocate for the crown but it seem there be little need of intervention there he want to help axel back to he farm and he land but axel be in no need of help from the look of thing for the case be go well as far as barbro herself be concerned and if she be acquit then there could be no question of any complicity at all it would depend on the testimony of the witness when the few witness have be hear -- oline have not be summon but only the lensmand axel himself the expert a couple of girl from the village -- when they have be hear it be time to adjourn for the midday break and geissler go up to the advocate for the crown once more the advocate be of opinion that all be go well for the girl barbro and so much the better fru lensmand heyerdahl 's word have carry great weight all depend now upon the finding of the court be you at all interested in the girl ask the advocate why to a certain extent answer geissler -- or rather perhaps in the man have she be in you service too no he be never be in my service i be speak of the girl it be she that have the sympathy of the court no she be never be in my service at all the man -- h be he do not seem to come out of it so well say the advocate go off and bury the body all by himself in the wood -- look bad very bad he want to have it bury properly i suppose say geissler it have not be really bury at all at first well of course a woman have not the strength of a man to go digging and in she state -- she must have be do up already altogether say the advocate i think we have come to take a more humane view of these infanticide case generally of late if i be to judge i should never venture to condemn the girl at all and from what have appear in this case i shall not venture to demand a conviction very pleased to hear it say geissler with a bow the advocate go on : as a man as a private person i will even go further and say : i would never condemn a single unmarried mother for kill she child most interesting say geissler to find the advocate for the crown so entirely in agreement with what fru heyerdahl say before the court oh fru heyerdahl still to my mind there be a great deal in what she say after all what be the good of all these conviction unmarried mother have suffer enough beforehand and be bring so low in every human regard by the brutal and callous attitude of the world -- the punishment ought to suffice geissler rise and say at last : no doubt but what about the child true say the advocate it be a sad business about the child still all thing consider perhaps it be just as well illegitimate child have a hard time and turn out badly as often as not geissler feel perhaps some touch of malice at the portly complacency of the man of law he say : erasmus be bear out of wedlock erasmus erasmus of rotterdam h be and leonardo the same leonardo da vincus really well of course there be exception otherwise there would be no rule but on the whole we pass protective measure for beast and bird say geissler seem rather strange do not it not to trouble about we own young the advocate for the crown reach out slowly and with dignity after some papers on the table as a hint that he have not time to continue the discussion yes say he absently yes yes no doubt geissler express he thanks for a most instructive conversation and take he leave he sit down in the court-house again to be there in good time he be not ill-pleased maybe to feel he power he have knowledge of a certain piece of wrap a man 's shirt cut across to carry -- let we say twig for a broom of the body of a child float in the harbor at bergen -- ay he could make matter awkward for the court if he choose a word from he would be as effective as a thousand sword but geissler have doubtless no intention of utter that word now unless it be need thing be go splendidly without even the advocate for the crown have declare himself on the side of the accuse the room fill and the court be sit again a interesting comedy to watch in a little town the warning gravity of the advocate for the crown the emotional eloquence of the advocate for the defense the court sit listen to what appear to be its duty in regard to the case of a girl name barbro and the death of she child for all that it be no light matter after all to decide the advocate for the crown be a presentable man to look at and doubtless also a man of heart but something appear to have annoy he recently or possibly he have suddenly remember that he hold a certain office in the state and be bind to act from that point of view a incomprehensible thing but he be plainly less disposed to be lenient now than he have be during the morning if the crime have be commit he say it be a serious matter and thing would look black indeed if they could with certainty be declare so black as would appear from the testimony of the witness already hear that be a matter for the court to decide he wish to draw attention to three point : firstly whether they have before they a concealment of birth whether this be clear to the court he make some personal remark on this head the second point be the wrap the piece of a shirt -- why have the accuse take this with she be it in order to make use of it for a certain purpose preconceive he develop this suggestion further he third point be the hurry and suspicious burial without any notification of the death to either priest or lensmand here the man be the person chiefly responsible and it be of the utmost importance that the court should come to the right conclusion in that respect for it be obvious that if the man be a accomplice and have therefore undertake the burial himself then he servant-girl must have commit a crime before he could be a accomplice in it h be from some one in court axel ström feel himself again in danger he look up without meet a single glance all eye be fix on the advocate speaking but far down in the court sit geissler again look highly supercilious as if burst with he own superiority he under-lip thrust forward he face turn towards the ceiling this enormous indifference to the solemnity of the court and that h be utter loudly and without concealment cheer axel mightily he feel himself no longer alone against the world and now thing take a turn again for the better this advocate for the crown seem at last to think he have do enough have achieve all that be possible in the way of direct suspicion and ill-feeling towards the man and now he stop he do more he almost as it be face round and make no demand for a conviction he end by say in so many word that after the testimony of the witness in the case he on he part do not call upon the court to convict the accuse this be well enough thought axel -- the business be practically over then come the turn of the advocate for the defense a young man who have study the law and have now be entrust with this most satisfactory case he tone itself show the view he take of it never have a man be more certain of defend a innocent person than he truth to tell this fru heyerdahl have take the wind out of he sail beforehand and use several of he own intended argument that morning he be annoy at she have already exploit the society theme -- oh but he could have say some first-rate thing about society himself he be incense at the mistaken leniency of the preside justice in not stop she speech it be a defense in itself a brief prepared beforehand -- and what be there leave for he he begin at the beginning of the life-story of the girl barbro she people be not well off albeit industrious and respectable she have go out to service at a early age first of all to the lensmand 's the court have hear that morning what she mistress fru heyerdahl thought of she -- no one could wish for a finer recommendation barbro have then go to bergen here the advocate lay great stress on a most feelingly write testimonial from two young business man in whose employ barbro have be while at bergen -- evidently in a position of trust barbro have come back to act as housekeeper for this unmarried man in a outlying district and here she trouble begin she find herself with child by this man the learn counsel for the prosecution have already refer -- in the most delicate and considerate manner be it say -- to the question of concealment of birth have barbro attempt to conceal she condition have she deny be with child the two witness girl from she own village have be of opinion that she be in that condition but when they have ask she she have not deny it at all she have merely pass the matter off what would a young girl naturally do in such a case but pass it off no one else have ask she about it at all go to she mistress and confess she have no mistress she be mistress on the place herself she have a master certainly but a girl could not be expect to confide in a man upon such a matter she bear she cross herself do not sing do not whisper but be silent as a trappist concealment no but she keep herself to herself the child be bear -- a sound and healthy boy have live and breathe after birth but have be suffocate the court have be make aware of the circumstance attend this birth : it have take place in the water the mother fall into the stream and the child be bear but she be incapable of save the child she lie there unable even to rise herself till some time after no mark of violence be to be see upon the body there be nothing to indicate that it have be intentionally kill it have be drown by misadventure at birth that be all the most natural explanation in the world he learn colleague have make some mention of a cloth or wrap consider it something of a mystery why she should have take half a shirt with she that day the mystery be clear enough she have take the shirt to carry strip juniper in she might have take -- let we say a pillow-case as it be she have take this piece of a shirt something she must have in any case she could not carry the stuff back in she hand no there be surely no ground for make a mystery of this one point however be not quite so clear : have the accuse be treat with the care and consideration which she condition at the time demand have she master deal kindly with she it would be as well for he if it be find so the girl herself have under cross-examination refer to the man in satisfactory term and this again be evidence in itself of she own nobility of character the man on he part axel ström have likewise in he deposition refrain from any attempt to add to the burden of the girl or to blame she in any way in this he have act rightly -- not to say wisely see that he own case depend very largely upon how matter go with she by lay the blame on she he would if she be convict bring about he own downfall it be impossible to consider the document and deposition in the present case without feel the deepest sympathy for this young girl in she forsake situation and yet there be no need to appeal to mercy on she behalf only to justice and human understanding she and she master be in a way betroth but a certain dissimilarity of temperament and interest prevent they from marry the girl could not entrust she future to such a man it be not a pleasant subject but it might be well to return for a moment to the question of the wrap that have be speak of before it should here be note that the girl have take not one of she own undergarment but one of she master 's shirt the question at once arise : have the man himself offer the material for the purpose here one be at first inclined to see a possibility at any rate that the man axel have have some part in the affair h be from some one in court loud and hard -- so much so indeed that the speaker pause and all look round to see who might be responsible for the interruption the preside justice frowned but go on the advocate for the defense collect himself again in this respect also we can set we mind at rest thanks to the accuse herself it might seem well to she advantage to divide the blame here but she have not attempt to do so she have entirely and without reserve absolved axel ström from any complicity whatever in the fact of she have take he shirt instead of something of she own on she way to the water -- that be on she way to the wood to gather juniper there be not the slightest reason for doubt the asseveration of the accuse on this point she deposition have throughout be find in accordance with the fact and the same be evidently the case in this have the shirt be give she by the man this would have be to presuppose a killing of the child already plan -- the accuse truthful as she be have not attempt to charge even this man with a crime that have never be commit she demeanor throughout have be commendably frank and open she have make no endeavor to throw the blame on other there be frequent instance before the court of this delicacy of feeling on the part of the accuse as for instance the fact that she have wrap up the body of the child as well as she could and put it away decently as the lensmand have find it here the preside justice interpose merely as a matter of form observe that it be grave no 2 which the lensmand have find -- the grave in which axel have bury the body after its removal from the first true that be true i stand correct say the advocate with all proper respect for the president of the court perfectly true but -- axel have himself state that he have only carry the body from one grave and lay it in the other and there could be no doubt but that a woman be better able to wrap up a child than be a man -- and who best of all surely a mother 's tender hand the preside justice nod in any case -- could not this girl -- if she have be of another sort -- have bury the child naked one might even go so far as to say that she might have throw it into a dustbin she might have leave it out under a tree in the open to freeze to death -- that be to say of course if it have not be dead already she might have put it in the oven when leave alone and burn it up she might have take it up to the river at sellanraa and throw it in there but this mother do none of these thing she wrap the dead child neatly in a cloth and bury it and if the body have be find wrap neatly when the grave be open it must be a woman and not a man who have so wrap it and now the advocate for the defense go on it lay with the court to determine what measure of guilt could properly be attribute to the girl barbro in the matter there be but little remain for which she could be blame at all -- indeed in he counsel 's opinion there be nothing unless the court find reason to convict on the charge of have fail to notify the death but here again -- the child be dead and nothing could alter that the place be far out in the wild many mile from either priest or lensmand natural enough surely to let it sleep the eternal sleep in a neat grave in the wood and if it be a crime to have bury it thus then the accuse be not more guilty than the father of the child -- as it be the misdemeanor be surely slight enough to be overlook modern practice be grow more and more disposed to lay more stress on reform the criminal than on punish the crime it be a antiquated system which seek to inflict punishment for every mortal thing -- it be the _ lex talioni _ of the old testament a eye for a eye and a tooth for a tooth there be no longer the spirit of the law in modern time the law of the present day be more humane seek to adjust itself accord to the degree of criminal intent and purpose display in each case no the court could never convict this girl it be not the object of a trial to secure a addition to the number of criminal but rather to restore to society a good and useful member it should be note that the accuse have now the prospect of a new position where she would be under the best possible supervision fru lensmand heyerdahl have from she intimate knowledge of the girl and from she own valuable experience as a mother throw wide the door of she own home to the girl the court would bear in mind the weight of responsibility attach to its decision here and would then convict or acquit the accuse finally he wish to express he thanks to the learn counsel for the prosecution who have generously refrain from demand a conviction -- a please evidence of deep and humane understand the advocate for the defense sit down the remainder of the proceedings do not take long the sum up be but a repetition of the same point as view from opposite side a brief synopsis of the action of the play dry dull and dignified it have all be manage very satisfactorily all round both the advocate have point out what the court should consider and the preside justice find he task easy enough light be light a couple of lamp hang from the ceiling -- a miserable light it be the justice could hardly see to read he note he mention with some severity the point that the child 's death have not be duly notify to the proper authority -- but that under the circumstance should be consider rather the duty of the father than of the mother owe to she weakness at the time the court have then to determine whether any case have be prove with regard to concealment of birth and infanticide here the evidence be again recapitulate from begin to end then come the usual injunction as to be duly conscious of responsibility which the court have hear before and finally the not uncommon reminder that in case of doubt the scale should be allow to turn in favor of the accuse and now all be clear and ready the judge leave the room and go into another apartment they be to consider a paper with certain question which one of they have with he they be away five minute and return with a no to all the question no the girl barbro have not kill she child then the preside judge say a few more word and declare that the girl barbro be now free the court-house empty the comedy be over someone take axel ström by the arm : it be geissler h be say he so you be do with that now ay say axel but they have waste a lot of you time to no purpose ay say axel again but he be come to himself again gradually and after a moment he add : none the less i be glad it be no worse no worse say geissler i would have like to see they try he speak with emphasis and axel fancy geissler must have have something to do with the case himself that he have intervene heaven know if after all it have not be geissler himself that have lead the whole proceedings and gain the result he wish it be a mystery anyway so much at least axel understand that geissler have be on he side all through i have a deal to thank you for say he offer he hand what for ask geissler why for -- for all this geissler turn it off shortly i have do nothing at all do not trouble to do anything -- 'twa not worth while but for all that geissler be not displeased maybe at be thank it be as if he have be wait for it and now it have come i have no time to stand talk now he say go back tomorrow be you good good-bye then and good luck to you and geissler stroll off across the street \* \* \* \* \* on the boat go home axel encounter the lensmand and he wife barbro and the two girl call as witness well say fru heyerdahl be not you glad it turn out so well axel say yes he be glad it have come out all right in the end the lensmand himself put in a word and say : this be the second of these case i have have while i have be here -- first with inger from sellanraa and now this no it be no good try to countenance that sort of thing -- justice must take its course but fru heyerdahl guess no doubt that axel be not over pleased with she speech of the day before and try to smooth it over to make up for it somehow now you understand of course why i have to say all that about you yesterday h be -- ye -- e say axel you understand of course i know you do not think i want to make thing harder for you in any way i have always think well of you and i do not mind say so ay say axel no more but he be pleased and touch at she word yes i mean it say fru heyerdahl but i be oblige to try and shift the blame a little you way otherwise barbro would have be convict and you too it be all for the best indeed it be i thank you kindly say axel and it be i and no other that go about from one to another through the place try to do what i could for you both and you see of course that we all have to do the same thing -- make out that you be partly to blame so as to get you both off in the end ay say axel surely you do not imagine for a moment that i mean any harm to you when i have always think so well of you ay this be good to hear after all the disgrace of it axel at any rate be so touch that he feel he must do something give fru heyerdahl something or other whatever he could find -- a piece of meat perhaps now autumn be come he have a young bull fru lensmand heyerdahl keep she word she take barbro to live with she on board the steamer too she look after the girl and see that she be not cold nor hungry take care also that she do not get up to any nonsense with the mate from bergen the first time it occur she say nothing but simply call barbro to she but a little while after there be barbro with he again she head on one side talk bergen dialect and smile then she mistress call she up and say : really barbro you ought not to be go on like that among the man now remember what you have just be through and what you have come from i be only talk to he a minute say barbro i could hear he be from bergen axel do not speak to she he notice that she be pale and clear-skinned now and she tooth be better she do not wear either of he ring and now here be axel tramp up to he own place once more wind and rain but he be glad at heart a mowing-machine and a harrow down at the quay he have see they oh that geissler never a word have he say in town about what he have send ay a unfathomable man be geissler chapter viii axel have no long time to rest at home as it turn out the autumn gale lead to fresh trouble and bothersome work that he have bring upon himself : the telegraph apparatus on he wall announce that the line be out of order oh but he have be think overmuch of the money surely when he take on that post it have be a nuisance from the start brede olsen have fairly threaten he when he go down to fetch the apparatus and tool ay have say to he in as many word : you do not seem like remember how i save you life last winter 'twa oline save my life answer axel ho indeed and do not i carry you down myself on my own poor shoulder anyway you be clever enough to buy up my place in summer-time and leave I homeless in the winter ay brede be deeply offended he go on : but you can take the telegraph for I ay all the rubble of it for I i and mine we 'll go down to the village and start on something there -- you do not know what it 'll be but wait and see what about a hotel place where folk can get coffee you see but we 'll manage all right there be my wife can sell thing to eat and drink as well as another and i can go out on business and make a heap more than you ever do but i do not mind tell you axel i could make thing awkward for you in many odd way see all i know about the telegraph and thing ay ` twould be easy enough both to pull down pole and cut the line and all and then you to go run out after it midway in the busy time that be all i 'll say to you axel and you bear it in mind now axel should have be down and bring up the machine from the quay -- all over gilt and color they be like picture to see and he might have have they to look at all that day and learn the manner of use they -- but now they must wait 'twa none so pleasant to have to put aside all manner of necessary work to run and see after a telegraph line but 'twa the money up on the top of the hill he meet aronsen ay aronsen the trader standing there look and gaze out into the storm like a vision himself what do he want there no peace in he mind now it seem but he must go up the fjeld himself and look at the mine with he own eye and this look you trader aronsen have do from sheer earnest thought of he own and he family 's future here he be face to face with bare desolation on the forsake hill machine lie there to rust cart and material of all sort leave out in the open -- 'twa dismal to see here and there on the wall of the hut be placard notice write by hand forbid any one to damage or remove the company 's property -- tool cart or building axel stop for a few word with the mad trader and ask if he have come out shooting shooting ay if i could only get within reach of he he who then why he that be ruin I and all the rest of we hereabout he that will not sell he bit of fjeld and let thing get to work again and trade and money pass same as before d'you mean he geissler then ay ` tis he i mean ought to be shoot axel laugh at this and say : geissler he be in town but a few day back you should have talk to he there but if i might be so bold as to say i doubt you would better leave he alone after all and why ask aron angrily why i have a mind he would be overwise and mysterious for you in the end they argue over this for a while and aronsen grow more excited than ever at last axel ask jestingly : well anyway you 'll not be so hard on we all to run away and leave we to ourselves in the wild huh think i be go to stay fool about here in you bog and never so much as make the price of a pipe cry aron indignantly find I a buyer and i 'll sell out sell out say axel the land 's good ordinary land if she be handle as should be -- and what you have get 's enough to keep a man have not i just say i 'll not touch it cry aronsen again in the gale i can do better than that axel think if that be so ` twould be easy to find a buyer but aronsen laugh scornfully at the idea -- there be nobody there in the wild have money to buy he out not here in the wild maybe but elsewhere here 's naught but filth and poverty say aron bitterly why that be as it may be say axel in some offence but isak up at sellanraa he could buy you out any day do not believe it say aronsen ` tis all one to I what you believe say axel and turn to go aronsen call after he : hi wait a bit what be that you say -- isak might take the place be that what you say ay say axel if 'twa only the money he be means enough to buy up five of you storborg and all aronsen have go round keep wide of sellanraa on he way up take care not to be see but go back he call in and have a talk with isak but isak only shake he head and say nay 'twa a matter he have never think of and do not care to but when eleseus come back home that christma isak be easier to deal with true he maintain that it be a mad idea to think of buy storborg 'twa nothing have ever be in he mind still if eleseus think he could do anything with the place why they might think it over eleseus himself be midway between as it be not exactly eager for it yet not altogether indifferent if he do settle down here at home then he career in one way be at a end 'twa not like be in a town that autumn when a lot of people from he part have be up for cross-examination in a certain place he have take care not to show himself he have no desire to meet any that know he from that quarter they belong to another world and be he now to go back to that same world himself he mother be all for buy the place sivert too say it would be best they stick to eleseus both of they and one day the three drive down to storborg to see the wonder with they own eye but once there be a prospect of sell aronsen become a different man he be not press to get rid of it not at all if he do go away the place could stand as it be 'twa a first-rate hold a cash down place there would be no difficulty in sell it any time you would not give my price say aronsen they go over the house and store the warehouse and shed inspect the miserable remains of the stock consist of a few mouth-organ watch-chain box of color papers lamp with hang ornament all utterly unsaleable to sensible folk that live on they land there be a few case of nail and some cotton print and that be all eleseus be constrain to show off a bit and look over thing with a know air i have no use for that sort of truck say he why then you have no call to buy it say aronsen anyhow i 'll offer you fifteen hundred _ krone _ for the place as it stand with goods live stock and the rest say eleseus oh he be careless enough he offer be but a show for something to say and they drive back home no there be no deal eleseus have make a ridiculous offer that aronsen regard as a insult i do not think much of you young man say aronsen ay call he young man consider he but a slip of a lad that have grow conceit in the town and think to teach he aronsen the value of goods i 'll not be call ` young man ' by you if you please say eleseus offend in he turn they must be mortal enemy after that but how could it be that aronsen have all along be so independent and so sure of not be force to sell there be a reason for it : aronsen have a little hope at the back of he mind after all a meeting have be hold in the village to consider the position which have arise owe to geissler 's refusal to sell he part of the mining tract 'twa not only the outlying settler who stand to lose by this it would be fatal to the whole district why could not folk go on living as well or as poorly now as before there have be any mine at all well they could not and that be all about it they have grow accustomed to better food finer bread store-bought clothes and higher wages general extravagance -- ay folk have learn to reckon with money more that be the matter and now the money be go again have slip away like a shoal of herr out to sea -- 'twa dire distress for they all and what be to be do there be no doubt about it : ex-lensmand geissler be take he revenge upon the village because they have help he superior to get he dismiss equally clear be it that they have underestimate he at the time he have not simply disappear and leave by the simplest means merely by demand a unreasonable price for a mine he have succeed in check the entire development of the district ay a strong man axel ström from maaneland could bear they out in this he be the one who have last meet geissler brede 's girl barbro have have a lawsuit in the town and come home acquit but geissler he have be there in court all the time and if any one suggest that geissler be deject and a broken man why he have only to look at the costly machine that same geissler have send up as a present to axel ström this man it be then who hold the fate of the district in he hand they would have to come to some agreement with he what price would geissler ultimately be dispose to accept for he mine they must ascertain in any case the swede have offer he twenty-five thousand -- geissler have refuse but suppose the village here the commune be to make up the remainder simply to get thing go again if it be not a altogether unheard-of amount it might be worth while both the trader at the shore station and aronsen up at storborg would be willing to contribute privately and secretly fund devote to such a purpose now would be repay in the long run the end of it be that two man be depute to call on geissler and take up the matter with he and they be expect back shortly so it be then that aronsen cherish a flicker of hope and think he could afford to stand on he dignity with any who offer to buy up storborg but it be not to last a week later the deputation return home with a flat refusal oh they have do the worst thing possible at the outset in choose brede olsen as one of the man they send -- they have take he as be one who best could spare the time they have find geissler but he have only shake he head and laugh go back home again he have say but geissler have pay for they journey back then the district be to be leave to its fate after aronsen have rage for a while and grow more and more desperate he go up one day to sellanraa and close the deal ay aronsen do eleseus get it for the price he have offer land and house and shed live stock and goods for fifteen hundred _ krone _ true on go through the inventory after it be find that aronsen 's wife have convert most of the cotton print to she own use but trifle of that sort be nothing to a man like eleseus it do not do to be mean he say nevertheless eleseus be not exactly delighted with thing as they have turn out -- he future be settle now he be to bury himself in the wild he must give up he great plan he be no longer a young gentleman in a office he would never be a lensmand not even live in a town at all to he father and those at home he make it appear that he be proud at have secure storborg at the very price he have fix -- it would show they he know what he be about but that small triumph do not go very far he have also the satisfaction of take over andresen the chief clerk who be thus as it be include in the bargain aronsen have no longer any use for he until he have a new place go it be a pleasant sensation to be eleseus when andresen come up beg to be allow to stay here it be eleseus who be master and head of the business -- for the first time in he life you can stay yes he say i shall be want a assistant to look after the place when i be away on business -- open up connection in bergen and trondhjem say he and andresen be no bad man to have as it soon prove he be a good worker and look after thing well when eleseus be away 'twa only at first he have be somewhat incline to show and play the fine gentleman and that be the fault of he master aronsen it be different now in the spring when the bog be thaw some depth sivert come down from sellanraa to storborg to start a bit of ditch for he brother and lo andresen himself go out on the land digging too heaven know what possess he to do it for 'twa no work of he but that be the sort of man he be it be not thaw deep enough yet and they could not get as far as they want by a long way but it be something do at any rate it be isak 's old idea to drain the bog at storborg and till the land there properly the bit of a store be only to be a extra a convenience to save folk go all the way down to the village for a reel of thread so sivert and andresen stand there digging and talk now and again when they stop for a rest andresen have also somehow or other manage to get hold of a gold piece a twenty - _ krone _ piece and sivert would gladly have have the bright thing himself but andresen would not part with it -- keep it wrap up in tissue paper in he chest sivert propose a wrestling match for the money -- see who could throw the other but andresen would not risk it sivert offer to stake twenty _ krone _ in note against the gold piece and do all the digging himself into the bargain if he win but andresen take offence at that ho say he and you would like to go back home no doubt and say i be no good at work on the land at last they agree to set twenty-five _ krone _ in note against the gold twenty - _ krone _ piece and sivert slip home to sellanraa that night to ask he father for the money a young man 's trick the pretty play of youth a night 's sleep throw away to walk mile up and mile down again and work next day as usual -- 'twa nothing to a young man in he strength and a bright gold piece be worth it all andresen be a little inclined to make fun of he over the deal but sivert be not at a loss he have only to let fall a word of leopoldine there i be nearly forget leopoldine she ask after you and andresen stop he work of a sudden and go very red pleasant day for they both drain and ditch get up long argument for fun and work and argue again now and then eleseus would come out and lend a hand but he soon tire eleseus be not strong either of body or will but a thorough good fellow for all that here be that oline come along sivert the jester would say now you 'll have to go in and sell she a paper of coffee and eleseus be glad enough to go sell oline some trifle or other mean so many minute ' rest from throw heavy clod and oline poor creature she might well be need a pinch of coffee now and again whether by chance she manage to get the money from axel to pay for it or barter a goat ' milk cheese in exchange oline be not altogether what she have be the work at maaneland be too hard for she she be a old woman now and it be leave its mark not that she ever confess to any weakness or ageing herself ho she would have find plenty to say if she have be dismiss tough and irrepressible be oline do she work and find time to wander over to neighbor here or there for a real good gossip 'twa she plain right and there be little gossip at maaneland axel himself be not give that way as for that barbro case oline be displeased ay disappoint be oline both of they acquit that brede 's girl barbro should be let off when inger sellanraa have get eight year be not to oline 's taste at all she feel a unchristian annoyance at such favouritism but the almighty would look to thing no doubt in he own good time and oline nod as if prophesy divine retribution at a later date naturally also oline make no secret of she dissatisfaction with the finding of the court more especially when she happen to fall out with she master axel over any little trifle then she would deliver herself in the old soft-spoken way of much deep and bitter sarcasm ay ` tis strange how the law 's change these day for all the wickedness of sodom and gomorrah but the word of the lord 's my guide as ever be and a bless refuge for the meek oh axel be sick and tired of he housekeeper now and wish she anywhere and now with spring come again and all the season 's work to do alone haymake to come and what be he to do 'twa a poor look-out he brother 's wife at breidablik have write home to helgeland try to find a decent woman to help he but nothing have come of it as yet and in any case it would mean he have to pay for the journey nay 'twa a mean and wicked trick of barbro to make away with the bit of a child and then run off herself a summer and two winter now he have be force to make do with oline and no say how much longer it might be yet and barbro the creature do she care he have have a few word with she down in the village one day that winter but never a tear have trickle slowly from she eye to freeze on she cheek what you have do with ring i give you ask he ring ay the ring i have not get they now ho so you have not get they now 'twa all over between we say she and i could not wear they after that ` tis not the way to go on wear ring when it be all over between you well i would just like to know what you have do with they that be all want I to give they back maybe say she well i never think you would have have I put you to that shame axel think for a moment and say : i could have make it up to you other way that you should not lose by it i mean but no barbro have get rid of the ring and never so much as give he the chance of buy back a gold ring and a silver ring at a reasonable price for all that barbro be not so thoroughly harsh and unlovable that she be not she have a long apron thing that fasten over the shoulder and with tuck at the edge and a strip of white stuff up round she neck -- ay she look well there be some say she would find a lad already down in the village to go sweetheart with though maybe 'twa but they talk after all fru heyerdahl keep a watchful eye on she at any rate and take care not to let she go to the christmas dance ay fru heyerdahl be careful enough that she be here be axel standing talk to he former servant-girl about a matter of two ring and suddenly fru heyerdahl come right between they and say : barbro i think you be go to the store off go barbro and she mistress turn to axel and say : have you come down with some meat or something h be say axel just that and touch he cap now it be fru heyerdahl that have praise he up so that last autumn say he be a splendid fellow and she have always think well of he and one good turn be worth another no doubt axel know the way of do thing 'twa a old story when simple folk have deal with they betters with authority and he have think at once of a piece of butcher 's meat a bull he have that might be useful there but time go on and month and month pass by and autumn be go and the bull be never kill and what harm could it do after all if he keep it for himself -- give it away and he would be so much poorer and 'twa a fine beast anyway h be _ goddag _ nay say axel shake he head he have no meat with he today but fru heyerdahl seem to be guess he thought for she say : i have hear you have a ox or what ay so i have say axel be you go to keep it ay i 'll be keep he yet i see you have no sheep to be kill not now i have not ` tis this way i have never have but what be to be keep on the place oh i see say fru heyerdahl well that be all and she go on she way axel drive up homeward but he could not help think somewhat of what have pass he rather fear he have make a false step somehow the lensmand 's lady have be a important witness once for and against he but important anyway he have be through a unpleasant time on that occasion but after all he have get out of it in the end -- get out of a very awkward business in connection with the body of a child find bury on he land perhaps after all he have better kill that sheep and strangely enough this thought be somehow connect with barbro if he come down bring sheep for she mistress it could hardly fail to make a certain impression on barbro herself but again the day go on and nothing evil happen for they go on next time he drive down to the village he have no sheep on he cart no still no sheep but at the last moment he have take a lamb a big lamb though not a miserable little one by any means and he deliver it with these word : ` tis rare tough meat on a wether and no sort of a gift to bring but this be none so bad but fru heyerdahl would not hear of take it as a gift say what you want for it she say oh a fine lady 'twa not she way to take gift from folk and the end of it be that axel get a good price for he lamb he see nothing of barbro at all lensmand 's lady have see he come and get she out of the way and good luck go with she -- barbro that have cheat he out of he help for a year and a half chapter ix that spring something unexpected happen -- something of importance indeed work at the mine be start again geissler have sell he land inconceivable oh but geissler be a unfathomable mind he could make a bargain or refuse shake he head for a no or nod the same for yes could make the whole village smile again conscience have prick he maybe he have no longer the heart to see the district where he have be lensmand famishing on home-made gruel and short of money or have he get he quarter of a million possibly again geissler himself have at last begin to feel the need of money and have be force to sell for what he could get twenty-five or fifty thousand be not to be despise after all as a matter of fact there be rumor that it be he eldest son who have settle the business on he father 's account be that as it might work be recommence the same engineer come again with he gang of man and the work go on anew the same work ay but in a different fashion now go backwards as it be all seem in regular order : the swedish mine-owner have bring they man and dynamite and money -- what could be wrong anyway even aronsen come back again aronsen the trader who have set he mind on buy back storborg from eleseus no say eleseus it be not for sale you 'll sell i suppose if you be offer enough no no eleseus be not go to sell storborg the truth be he have change he mind somewhat as to the position it be none so bad after all to be owner of a trading station in the hill he have a fine verandah with color glass window and a chief clerk to do all the work while he himself go about the country travel ay travel first class with fine folk one day perhaps he might be able to go as far as america -- he often think of that even these little journey on business to the town down in the south be something to live on for a long time after not that he let himself go altogether and charter a steamer of he own and held wild orgy on the way -- orgy be not in he line a strange fellow be eleseus he no longer care about girl have give up such thing altogether lose all interest in they no but after all he be the margrave 's son and travel first class and buy up load of goods and each time he come back a little finer than before a greater man the last time he even wear galosh to keep he foot dry what be that -- you take to wear two pair of shoe they say i have be suffer from chilblain lately say eleseus and every one sympathize with eleseus and he chilblain glorious day -- a grand life with no end of leisure no he be not go to sell storborg what go back to a little town and stand behind the counter in a little shop and no chief clerk of he own at all moreover he have make up he mind now to develop the business on a grand scale the swede have come back again and would flood the place with money he would be a fool to sell out now aronsen be force to go back each time with a flat refusal more and more disgusted at he own lack of foresight in ever have give up the place oh but aronsen might have save himself a deal of self-reproach and likewise eleseus with he plan and intention that he might have keep in moderation and more than all the village would have do well to be less confident instead of go about smile and rub its hand like angel sure of be bless -- no call for they to do so if they have but know for now come disappointment and no little one at that who would ever have think it work at the mine commence again true enough -- but at the other end of the fjeld eight mile away on the southern boundary of geissler 's hold far off in another district altogether a district with which they be in no way concerned and from there the work be to make its way gradually northward to the original mine isak 's mine to be a blessing to folk in the wild and in the village at best it would take year any number of year a generation the news come like a dynamite charge of the heaviest sort with shock and stop of ear the village folk be overcome with grief some blame geissler 'twa geissler that devil of a man who have trick they once more other huddle together at a meeting and send out a new deputation of trusty man this time to the mining company to the engineer but nothing come of it the engineer explain that he be oblige to start work from the south because that be nearest the sea and save the need of a aerial railway reduce the transport almost to nil no the work must begin that way no more to be say then it be that aronsen at once rise up and set out for the new workings the new promised land he even try to get andresen to go with he : what be the sense of you stay on here in the wild say he much better come with I but andresen would not leave incomprehensible but so it be there be something which hold he to the spot he seem to thrive there have take root it must be andresen who have change for the place be the same as ever folk and thing be unaltered the mining work have turn away to other tract but folk in the wild have not lose they head over that they have they land to till they crop they cattle no great wealth in money true but in all the necessaries of life ay absolutely all even eleseus be not reduce to misery because the stream of gold be flow elsewhere the worst of it be that in he first exaltation he have buy great stock of goods that be now unsaleable well they could stay there for the time be it look well at any rate to have plenty of wares in a store no a man of the wild do not lose he head the air be not less healthy now than before there be folk enough to admire new clothes there be no need of diamond wine be a thing he know from the feast at cana a man of the wild be not put out by the thought of great thing he could not get art newspaper luxury politics and such-like be worth just what folk be willing to pay for they no more growth of the soil be something different a thing to be procure at any cost the only source the origin of all a dull and desolate existence nay least of all a man have everything he power above he dream he love he wealth of superstition sivert walk one evening by the river stop on a sudden there on the water be a pair of duck male and female they have sight he they be aware of man and afraid one of they say something utter a little sound a melody in three tone and the other answer with the same then they rise whirl off like two little wheel a stone 's - throw up the river and settle again then as before one speak and the other answer the same speech as at first but mark a new delight : _ it be set two octave higher _ sivert stand look at the bird look past they far into a dream a sound have float through he a sweetness and leave he stand there with a delicate thin recollection of something wild and splendid something he have know before and forget again he walk home in silence say no word of it make no boast of it 'twa not for worldly speech and it be but sivert from sellanraa go out one evening young and ordinary as he be and meet with this it be not the only thing he meet with -- there be more adventure beside another thing which happen be that jensine leave sellanraa and that make sivert not a little perturb in he mind ay it come to that : jensine would leave if you please she wish it so oh jensine be not one of you common sort none could say that sivert have once offer to drive she back home at once and on that occasion she have cry which be a pity but afterwards she repent of that and make it clear that she repent and give notice and would leave ay a proper way to do nothing could have suit inger at sellanraa better than this inger be begin to grow dissatisfied with she maid strange she have nothing to say against she but the sight of the girl annoy she she could hardly endure to have she about the place it all arise no doubt from inger 's state of mind she have be heavy and religious all that winter and it would not pass off want to leave do you why then well and good say inger it be a blessing the fulfilment of nightly prayer two grown woman they be already what do they want with this jensine fresh as could be and marriageable and all inger think with a certain displeasure of that same marriageableness think maybe how she have once be the same herself she deep religiousness do not pass off she be not full of vice she have taste sip let we say but 'twa not she intent to persevere in that way all through she old age not by any means inger turn aside with horror from the think the mine and all its workman be no longer there -- and heaven be praise virtue be not only tolerable but inevitable it be a necessary thing ay a necessary good a special grace but the world be all awry look now here be leopoldine little leopoldine a seedle a slip of a child go about burst with sinful health but a arm round she waist and she would fall helpless -- oh fie there be spot on she face now too -- a sign in itself of wild blood ay she mother remember well enough 'twas the wild blood would out inger do not condemn she child for a matter of spot ` on she face but it must stop she would have a end of it and what do that fellow andresen want come up to sellanraa of sunday to talk fieldwork with isak do the two menfolk imagine the child be blind ay young folk be young folk as they have ever be thirty forty year ago but worse than ever now why that be as it may be say isak when they speak of the matter but here be the spring come and jensine go and who be to manage the summer work leopoldine and i can do the haymaking say inger ay i would rather go rake night and day myself say she bitterly and on the point of cry isak could not understand what there be to make such a fuss about but he have he own idea no doubt and off he go to the edge of the wood with crowbar and pick and fall to work at a stone nay indeed isak could not see why jensine should have leave they a good girl and a worker to tell the truth isak be often at a loss in all save the simplest thing -- he work he lawful and natural doings a broad-shouldered man well fill out nothing astral about he at all he eat like a man and throve on it and 'twa rarely he be throw off he balance in any way well here be this stone there be stone more in plenty but here be one to begin with isak be look ahead to the time when he will need to build a little house here a little home for himself and inger and as well to get to work a bit on the site and clear it while sivert be down at storborg otherwise the boy would be ask question and that be not to isak 's mind the day must come of course when sivert would need all there be of the place for himself -- the old folk would be want a house apart ay there be never a end of building at sellanraa that fodder loft above the cowsh be not do yet though the beam and plank for it be there all ready well then here be this stone nothing so big to look at above ground but not to be move at a touch for all that it must be a heavy fellow isak dig round about it and try he crowbar but it would not move he dig again and try once more but no back to the house for a spade then and clear the earth away then digging again try again -- no a mighty heavy beast to shift thought isak patiently enough he dig away now for a steady while but the stone seem reach ever deeper and deeper down there be no get a purchase on it a nuisance it would be if he have to blast it after all the boring would make such a noise and call up every one on the place he dig off again to fetch a levering pole and try that -- no he dig again isak be begin to be annoy with this stone he frown and look at the thing as if he have just come along to make a general inspection of the stone in that neighborhood and find this one particularly stupid he criticize it ay it be a round-faced idiotic stone no get hold of it any way -- he be almost incline to say it be deform blast the thing be not worth a charge of powder and be he to give it up be he to consider the possibility of be beat by a stone he dig hard work that it be but as to give up at last he get the nose of he lever down and try it the stone do not move technically speak there be nothing wrong with he method but it do not work what be the matter then he have get out stone before in he life be he get old funny thing he he he ridiculous indeed true he have notice lately that he be not so strong as he have be -- that be to say he have notice nothing of the sort never heed it 'twa only imagination and he go at the stone once more with the best will in the world oh 'twa no little matter when isak bear down on a levering pole with all he weight there he be now hoist and hoist again a cyclop enormous with a torso that seem build in one to the knee a certain pomp and splendor about he he equator be astounding but the stone do not move no help for it he must dig again try blast not a word no dig again he be intent on he work now the stone should come up it would be wrong to say there be anything at all perverse in this on isak 's part it be the ingrown love of a worker on the soil but altogether without tenderness it be a foolish sight first gathering as it be about the stone from all side then make a dash at it then digging all round its side and fumble at it throw up the earth with he bare hand ay so he do yet there be nothing of a caress in it all warmth yes but the warmth of zeal alone try the lever again he thrust it down where there be best hold -- no a altogether remarkable instance of obstinacy and defiance on the part of the stone but it seem to be give isak try again with a touch of hope the earth-breaker have a feeling now that the stone be no longer invincible then the lever slip throw he to the ground devil say he ay he say that he cap have get thrust down over one ear as he fall make he look like a robber like a spaniard he spit here come inger isak come in and have you food now say she kindly and pleasant as can be ay say he but will have she no nearer and want no question oh but inger never dream she come nearer what be in you mind now she ask to soften he with a hint of the way he think out some new grand thing almost every day but isak be sullen terribly sullen and stern he say : nay i do not know and inger again foolish that she be -- ugh keep on talk and ask and will not go see as you have see it yourself say he at last i be get up this stone here ho go to get he up ay and could not i help a bit at all she ask isak shake he head but it be a kindly think anyway that she would have help he and he can hardly be harsh in return if you just wait the least bit of a while say he and run home for the hammer if he could only get the stone rough a bit knock off a flake or so in the right spot it would give the lever a better hold inger hold the setting-hammer and isak strike strike strike ay sure enough off go a flake 'twa a good help say isak and thanks but do not trouble about food for I this bit of a while i must get this stone up first but inger do not go and to tell the truth isak be pleased enough to have she there watch he at he work ` tis a thing have always pleased he since they young day and lo he get a fine purchase now on the lever and put he weight into it -- the stone move he be move say inger ` tis but you nonsense say isak nonsense indeed but it be get so far then -- and that be something the stone be so to speak convert now be on he side they be work together isak hoist and heave with he lever and the stone move but no more he keep at it a while nothing more all at once he understand that it be not merely a question of weight the dead pull of he body no the fact be that he have no longer he old strength he have lose the tough agility that make all the difference weight a easy matter enough to hang on with he weight and break a iron-shod pole no he be weaken that be it and the patient man be fill with bitterness at the thought -- at least he might have be spare the shame of have inger here to see it suddenly he drop the lever and grasp the sledge a fury take he he be mind to go at it violently now and see he cap still hang on one ear robber-fashion and now he step mightily threateningly round the stone try as it be to set himself in the proper light ho he will leave that stone a ruin and a wreck of what it have be why not when a man be fill with mortal hatred of a stone it be a mere formality to crush it and suppose the stone resist suppose it decline to be crushed why let it try -- and see which of the two survive but then it be that inger speak up a little timidly again see no doubt what be trouble he : what if we both hang on the stick there and the thing she call a stick be the lever nothing else no cry isak furiously but after a moment 's thought he say : well well since you be here -- though you might as well have go home let 's try and they get the stone up on edge ay they manage that and puh say isak but now come a revelation a strange thing to see the underside of the stone be flat mightily broad finely cut smooth and even as a floor the stone be but the half of a stone the other half be somewhere close by no doubt isak know well enough that two half of the same stone may lie in different place the frost no doubt that in course of time have shift they apart but he be all wonder and delight at the find ` tis a useful stone of the best a door-slab a round sum of money would not have fill this fieldworker 's mind with such content a fine door-slab say he proudly and inger simple creature : why now how on earth could you tell that beforehand h be say isak think i would go here digging about for nothing they walk home together isak enjoy new admiration on false pretence 'twa something he have not deserve but it taste but little different from the real thing he let it be understand that he have be look out for a suitable door-slab for a long time and have find it at last after that of course there could be nothing in the least suspicious about he work there again he could root about as much as he please on pretext of look for the other half and when sivert come home he could get he to help but if it have come to this that he could no longer go out alone and heave up a stone why thing be sorely change ay 'twa a bad look-out and the more need to get that site clear quick as might be age be upon he he be ripen for the chimney-corner the triumph he have steal in the matter of the door-slab fade away in a few day 'twa a false thing and not make to last isak stoop a little now in he walk have he not once be so much of a man that he grow wakeful and attentive in a moment if one but say a word of stone a word of digging and 'twa no long time since but a few year no more ay and in those day folk that be shy of a bit of drain work keep out of he way now he be begin little by little to take such matter more calmly eyah _ herregud _ all thing be change the land itself be different now with broad telegraph road up through the wood that have not be there before and rock blast and sunder up by the water as they have not be before and folk too be change they do not greet come and go as in the old day but nod only or maybe not even that but then -- in the old day there have be no sellanraa but only a turf hut while now there have be no margrave in the old day ay but margrave what be he now a pitiful thing nothing superhuman but old and fading go the way of all flesh what though he have good bowels and could eat well when it give he no strength 'twa sivert have the strength now and a mercy it be so -- but think if isak have have it too a sorry thing to find he work run down he have toil like a man carry load enough for any beast of burden now he could exercise he patience in rest isak be ill-pleased heavy at heart here lie a old hat a old sou ` wester rot on the ground carry there by the gale maybe or maybe the lad have bring it there to the edge of the wood year ago when they be little one it lie there year after year rot and rot away but once it have be a new sou ` wester all yellow and new isak remember the day he come home with it from the store and inger have say it be a fine hat a year or so after he have take it to a painter down in the village and have it black and polish and the brim do in green and when he come home inger think it a finer hat than before inger always think everything be fine ay 'twa a good life those day cut faggot with inger to look on -- he best day and when march and April come inger and he would be wild after each other just like the bird and beast in the wood and when may be come he would sow he corn and plant potato live and thrive from day to dawn work and sleep loving and dream he be like the first big ox and that be a wonder to see big and bright as a king but there be no such may to the year now no such thing isak be sorely despondent for some day dark day they be he feel neither wish nor strength to start work on the fodder loft -- that could be leave for sivert to do some day the thing to be do now be the house for himself -- the last house to build he could not long hide from sivert what he be do he be clear the ground and plain to see what for and one day he tell there be a good bit of stone if we have any use for stonework say he and there be another sivert show no surprise and only say : ay first-rate stone what you might think say he father we have be digging round here now to find that other door-slab piece might almost do to build here i do not know ay ` tis no bad place to build say sivert look round think so 'twas none so bad maybe to have a bit of a place to house folk if any should come along ay a couple of room would be as well you see how 'twa when they swedish gentleman come and no proper place to house they but what you think : a bit of a kitchen as well maybe if 'twa any cooking to be do ay ` twould be a shame to build with never a bit of kitchen say sivert you think so isak say no more but sivert he be a fine lad to grasp thing and get into he head all at once just what be need in a place to put up swedish gentleman that chance to come along never so much as ask a single question but only say : do it my way now you would put up a bit of a shed on the north wall folk come along would be useful to have a shed place to hang up wet clothes and thing and he father agree at once : ay the very thing they work at they stone again in silence then ask isak : eleseus he be not come home i suppose and sivert answer evasively : he 'll be come home soon 'twa that way with eleseus : he be all for stay away live away on journey could not he have write for the goods but he must go round and buy they on the spot get they so much cheaper ay maybe but what about cost of the journey he have he own way of think it seem and then what do he want anyway with more cotton stuff and color ribbon for christen cap and black and white straw hat and long tobacco pipe no one ever buy such thing up in the hill and the village folk they only come up to storborg when they would no money eleseus be clever enough in he way -- only to see he write on a paper or do sum with a bit of chalk ay with a head like yours say folk admire he and that be true enough but he be spend overmuch they village folk never pay they owing and yet even a fellow like brede olsen could come up to storborg that winter and get cotton print and coffee and molasses and paraffin on credit isak have lay out a deal of money already for eleseus and he store and he long journeying about there be not overmuch left now out of the riches from the mine -- and what then how d'you think he be get on eleseus ask isak suddenly get on say sivert to gain time do not seem to be do so well h be he say it 'll go all right you speak to he about it nay but andresen he say so isak thought over this and shake he head nay i doubt it be go ill say he ti a pity for the lad and isak gloomier than ever now for all he would be none too bright before but then sivert flash out a bit of news : there be more folk come to live now how d'you say two new holding they have buy up close by we isak stand still with he crowbar in hand this be news and good news the best that could be that make ten of we here say he and isak learn exactly where the new man have buy he know the country all round in he head and nod ay they have do well there wood for firing in plenty and some big timber here and there ground slope down sou ` west ay settler -- nothing could beat they anyway -- here be new folk come to live the mine have come to nothing but so much the better for the land a desert a die place far from it all about be swarm with life two new man four new hand to work field and meadow and home oh the little green tract in a forest a hut and water child and cattle about corn wave on the moorland where naught but horsetail grow before bluebell nod on the fell and yellow sunlight blaze in the ladyslipper flower outside a house and human being live there move and talk and think and be there with heaven and earth here stand the first of they all the first man in the wild he come that way kneedeep in marsh-growth and heather find a sunny slope and settle there other come after he they tread a path across the waste _ almenn _ other again and the path become a road cart drive there now isak may be content may start with a little thrill of pride he be the founder of a district the pioneer look here we can not go waste time on this bit of a house place if we be to get that fodder loft do this year say he with a new brightness new spirit as it be new courage and life chapter x a woman tramp up along the road a steady summer rain fall wet she but she do not heed it other thing be in she mind -- anxiety barbro it be and no other -- brede 's girl barbro anxious ay not know how the venture will end she have go from service at the lensmand 's and leave the village that be the matter she keep away from all the farm on the road up unwilling to meet with folk easy to see where she be go with a bundle of clothing on she back ay go to maaneland to take service there again ten month she have be at the lensmand 's now and ` tis no little time reckon out in day and night but a eternity reckon in longing and oppression it have be bearable at first fru heyerdahl look after she kindly give she apron and neat thing to wear 'twa a joy to be send on errand to the store with such fine clothes to wear barbro have be in the village as a child she know all the village folk from the day when she have play there go to school there kiss the lad there and join in many game with stone and shell bearable enough for a month or so but then fru heyerdahl have begin to be even more careful about she and when the christmas festivity begin she be strict and what good could ever come of that it be bind to spoil thing barbro could never have endure it but that she have certain hour of the night to herself from two to six in the morning she be more or less safe and have steal pleasure not a few what about cook then for not report she a nice sort of woman she must be oh a ordinary woman enough as the world find they cook go out without leave herself they take it in turn and it be quite a long time before they be find out barbro be by no means so depraved that it show in she face impossible to accuse she of immorality immorality she make all the resistance one could expect when young man ask she to go to a christmas dance she say no once say no twice but the third time she would say : i 'll try and come from two to six just as a decent woman should not try to make herself out worse than she be and make a display of daring she be a servant-girl serve all she time and know no other recreation than fool with man it be all she ask for fru heyerdahl come and lecture she lend she book -- and a fool for she pain barbro have live in bergen and read the papers and be to the theater she be no innocent lamb from the countryside but fru heyerdahl must have grow suspicious at last one day she come up at three in the morning to the maid ' room and call : barbro yes answer cook it be barbro i want be not she there open the door cook open the door and explain as agree upon that barbro have have to run home for a minute about something home for a minute at this time of night fru heyerdahl have a good deal to say about that and in the morning there be a scene brede be send for and fru heyerdahl ask : be barbro at home with you last night -- at three o'clock brede be unprepared but answer : three o'clock yes yes quite right we sit up late there be something we have to talk about say brede the lensmand 's lady then solemnly declare that barbro shall go out no more at night no no say brede not as long as she be in this house no no there you can see barbro i tell you so say she father you can go and see you parent now and then during the day say she mistress but fru heyerdahl be wide awake enough and she suspicion be not go she wait a week and try at four in the morning barbro she call oh but this time 'twa cook 's turn out and barbro be at home the maid ' room be a nest of innocence she mistress have to hit on something in a hurry do you take in the wash last night yes that be a good thing it be blow so hard good-night but it be not so pleasant for fru heyerdahl to get she husband to wake she in the middle of the night and go padding across herself to the servant ' room to see if they be at home they could do as they please she would trouble herself no more and if it have not be for sheer ill-luck barbro might have stay the year out in she place that way but a few day ago the trouble have come it be in the kitchen early one morning barbro have be have some word with cook and no light word either they raise they voice forget all about they mistress cook be a mean thing and a cheat she have sneak off last night out of she turn because it be Sunday and what excuse have she to give go to say good-bye to she favorite sister that be off to america not a bit of it cook have make no excuse at all but simply say that Sunday night be one have be owe to she for a long time oh you have not a atom of truth nor decency in you body say barbro and there be the mistress in the doorway she have come out perhaps with no more thought than that the girl be make too much noise but now she stand look very closely at barbro at barbro 's apron over she breast ay lean forward and look very closely indeed it be a painful moment and suddenly fru heyerdahl scream and draw back to the door what on earth can it be think barbro and look down at herself _ herregud _ a flea nothing more barbro can not help smile and be not unused to act under critical circumstance she flick off the flea at once on the floor cry fru heyerdahl be you mad girl pick it up at once barbro begin look about for it and once more act with presence of mind : she make as if she have catch the creature and drop it realistically into the fire where do you get it ask she mistress angrily where i get it yes that be what i want to know but here barbro make a bad mistake at the store she ought to have say of course -- that would have be quite enough as it be -- she do not know where she have get the creature but have a idea it must have be from cook cook at the height of passion at once : from I you 'll please to keep you flea to yourself so there anyway 'twa you be out last night another mistake -- she should have say nothing about it cook have no longer any reason for keep silence and now she let out the whole thing and tell all about the night barbro have be out fru heyerdahl mightily indignant she care nothing about cook ` tis barbro she be after the girl whose character she have answer for and even then all might have be well if barbro have bow she head like a reed and be cast down with shame and promise all manner of thing for the future -- but no she mistress be force to remind she of all she have do for she and at that if you please barbro fall to answer back ay so foolish be she say impertinent thing or perhaps she be cleverer than might seem try on purpose maybe to bring the matter to a head and get out of the place altogether say she mistress : after i have save you from the clutch of the law as for that answer barbro i would have just as pleased if you have not and that be all the thanks i get say she mistress least say the better perhaps say barbro i would not have get more than a month or two anyway and do with it fru heyerdahl be speechless for a moment ay for a little while she stand say nothing only open and close she mouth the first thing she say be to tell the girl to go she will have no more of she just as you please say barbro for some day after that barbro have be at home with she parent but she could not go on stay there true she mother sell coffee and there come a deal of folk to the house but barbro could not live on that -- and maybe she have other reason of she own for want to get into a settle position again and so today she have take a sack of clothes on she back and start up along the road over the moor question now whether axel ström would take she but she have have the banns put up anyway the Sunday before rain and dirty underfoot but barbro tramp on evening be draw on but not dark yet at that season of the year poor barbro -- she do not spare herself but go on she errand like another she be bind for a place to commence another struggle there she have never spare herself to tell the truth never be of a lazy sort and that be why she have she neat figure now and pretty shape barbro be quick to learn thing and often to she own undoing what else could one expect she have learn to save herself at a pinch to slip from one scrape to another but keep all along some better quality a child 's death be nothing to she but she can still give sweet to a child alive then she have a fine musical ear can strum softly and correctly on a guitar singing hoarsely the while pleasant and slightly mournful to hear spare herself no so little indeed that she have throw herself away altogether and feel no loss now and again she cry and break she heart over this or that in she life -- but that be only natural it go with the song she sing ` tis the poetry and friendly sweetness in she she have fool herself and many another with the same have she be able to bring the guitar with she this evening she could have strum a little for axel when she come she manage so as to arrive late in the evening all be quiet at maaneland when she reach there see axel have already begin haymake the grass be cut near the house and some of the hay already in and then she reckon out that oline be old will be sleep in the little room and axel lie out in the hayshed just as she herself have do she go to the door she know so well breathless as a thief and call softly : axel what be that ask axel all at once nay ` tis only I say barbro and step in you could not house I for the night she say axel look at she and be slow to think and sit there in he underclothes look at she so ` tis you say he and where 'll you be go why depend first of all if you have need of help to the summer work say she axel think over that and say : be not you go to stay where you be then nay i have finish at the lensmand 's i might be need help true enough for the summer say axel but what be it mean anyway you want to come back nay never mind I say barbro put it off i 'll go on again tomorrow go to sellanraa and cross the hill i have a place there you have fix up with some one there ay i might be need summer help myself say axel again barbro be wet through she have other clothes in she sack and must change do not mind about I say axel and move a bit toward the door no more barbro take off she wet clothes they talk the while and axel turn he head pretty often towards she now you would better go out just a bit say she out say he and indeed 'twa no weather to go out in he stand there see she more and more strip ` tis hard to keep he eye away and barbro be so thoughtless she might well have put on dry thing bite by bit as she take oft the wet but no she shift be thin and cling to she she unfasten a button at one shoulder and turn aside ` tis nothing new for she axel dead silent then and he see how she make but a touch or two with she hand and wash the last of she clothes from she 'twa splendidly do to he mind and there she stand so utterly thoughtless of she a while after they lay talk together ay he have need of help for the summer no doubt about that they say something that way say barbro he have begin he mowing and haymaking all alone again barbro could judge for herself how awkward it be for he now -- ay barbro understand -- on the other hand it be barbro herself that have run away and leave he before without a soul to help he he can not forget that and take she ring with she into the bargain and on top of all that shameful as it be the paper that keep on come that bergen newspaper it seem he would never get rid of he have have to go on pay for it a whole year after 'twa shameful mean of they say barbro take he part all the time but see she all submissive and gentle axel himself could not be altogether heartless towards she he agree that barbro might have some reason to be angry with he in return for the way he have take the telegraph business from she father but as for that say he you father can have the telegraph business again for I i 'll have no more of it ` tis but a waste of time ay say barbro axel think for a while then ask straight out : well what about it now would you want to come for the summer and no more nay say barbro let it be as you please you mean that and truly ay just as you please and i 'll be please with the same you have no call to doubt about I any more h be no ` ti true and i have order about the banns h be this be not so bad axel lay think it over a long time if she mean it in earnest this time and not shameful deceit again then he have a woman of he own and help for as long as might be i could get a woman to come from we part say he and she be write say she would come but then i would have to pay she fare from america say barbro : ho she be in america then ay go over last year she do but do not care to stay never mind about she say barbro and what would become of I then say she and begin to be soft and

at thing nothing delicate beyond measure there be thing he be oblige to do and he look to what be useful first of all moreover here be barbro all new and pretty again and nice to he almost sweeter than before like a apple she be and he bit at it the banns be already put up as to the dead child and the trial neither say a word of that but they do speak of oline of how they be to get rid of she ay she must go say barbro we have nothing to thank she for anyway she be naught but tale-bearing and malice but it prove no easy matter to get oline to go the very first morning when barbro appear oline be clear no doubt as to she fate she be trouble at once but try not to show it and bring out a chair they have manage up to then at maaneland axel have carry water and wood and do the heaviest work and oline do the rest and gradually she have come to reckon on stay the rest of she life on the place now come barbro and upset it all if we would only a grain of coffee in the house you should

hard on you this while hard on I axel oh there be no call to turn a old body 's word there be naught but live on and wait for the bless end axel that be be as a father and a messenger from the highest to I day and hour together and gospel truth the same but see i have none of my own folk here and live alone and reject under a stranger 's roof with all my kin over across the hill but for all that oline stay on they could not get rid of she till after they be wed and oline make a deal of reluctance but say yes at last and would stay so long to please they and look to house and cattle while they go down to the church it take two day but when they come back wed and all oline stay on as before she put off go one day she be feel poorly she say the next it look like rain she make up to barbro with smooth word about the food oh there be a mighty difference in the food now at maaneland 'twa different live now and a mighty difference in the coffee now oh she stop at nothing that oline ask barbro 's advice on thing she know better herself what you think now should i milk cow as they stand in they place and order or should i take cow bordelin first you can do as you please ay ` tis as i always say exclaim oline you have be out in the world and live among great folk and fine folk and learn all and everything ` tis different with the likes of I ay oline stop at nothing she be intriguing all day long sit there tell barbro how she herself be friend and on the best of term with barbro 's father with brede olsen ho many a pleasant hour they would have together and a kindly man and rich and grand to boot be brede and never a hard word in he mouth but this could not go on for ever neither axel nor barbro care to have oline there any longer and barbro have take over all she work oline make no complaint but she flash dangerous glance at she young mistress and change she tone ever so little ay great folk ` tis true axel he be in town a while last harvest-time -- you do not meet he there maybe nay that be true you be in bergen that time but he go into town he do 'twa all to buy a mowing-machine and a harrow-machine and what be folk at sellanraa now beside you here nothing to compare she be begin to shoot out little pinprick but even that do not help she now neither of they fear she axel tell she straight out one day that she must go go say oline and how crawl belike no she would not go say by way of excuse that she be poorly and could not move she leg and to make thing bad as could be when once they have take the work off she hand and she have nothing to do at all she collapse and be thoroughly ill she keep about for a week in spite of it axel look furiously at she but she stay on from sheer malice and at last she have to take to she bed and now she lay there not in the least await she bless end but count the hour till she should be up and about again she ask for a doctor a piece of extravagance unheard of in the wild doctor say axel be you out of you sens how d'you mean then say oline quite gently as to something she could not understand ay so gentle and smooth-tongued be she so glad to think she need not be a burden to other she could pay for the doctor herself ho can you say axel why and could not i then say oline and anyway you would not have I lie here and die like a dumb beast in the face of the lord here barbro put in a word and be unwise enough to say : well what you have get to complain of i would like to know when i bring you in you meal and all myself as for coffee i have say you be better without it and mean well be that barbro say oline turn just she eye and no more to look for she ay she be poorly be oline and a pitiful sight with she eye screw round cornerway ay maybe ` tis as you say barbro if a tiny drop of coffee would do I any harm a spoonful and no more if 'twa I in you stead i would be think of other thing than coffee at this hour say barbro ay ` tis as i say answer oline 'twa never you way to wish and desire a fellow-creature 's end but rather they should be convert and live what ay i be lie here and see thing be it with child you be now barbro what be that you say cry barbro furiously and go on again : oh ` twould serve you right if i take and heave you out on the muck-heap for you wicked tongue and at that the invalid be silent for one thoughtful moment she mouth tremble as if try so hard to smile but dare not i hear a some one call last night say she she be out of she sens say axel whisper nay out of my sens that i be not like some one call it be from the wood or maybe from the stream up yonder strange to hear -- as it might be a bit of a child cry out be that barbro go out ay say axel sick of you nonsense and no wonder nonsense you call it and out of my sens and all ah but not so far as you would like to think say oline nay ` tis not the almighty 's will and decree i should come before the throne and before the lamb as yet with all i know of goings-on here at maaneland i 'll be up and about again never fear but you would better be fetch a doctor axel ` tis quicker that way what about that cow you be go to give I cow what cow that cow you promise I be it bordelin maybe you be talk wild say axel you know how you promise I a cow the day i save you life nay that i never know at that oline lift up she head and look at he gray and bald she be a head stand up on a long scraggy neck -- ugly as a witch as a ogress out of a story and axel start at the sight and fumble with a hand behind he back for the latch of the door ho say oline so you be that sort ay well -- say no more of it now i can live without the cow from this day forth and never a word i 'll say nor breathe of it again but well that you have show what sort and manner of man you be this day i know it now ay and i 'll know it another time but oline she die that night -- some time in the night anyway she be cold next morning when they come in oline -- a aged creature bear and die 'twa no sorrow to axel nor barbro to bury she and be quit of she for ever there be less to be on they guard against now they could be at rest barbro be have trouble with she tooth again save for that all be well but that everlasting woollen muffler over she face and shift it aside every time there be a word to say -- 'twa plaguy and troublesome enough and all this toothache be something of a mystery to axel he have notice certainly that she chew she food in a careful sort of way but there be not a tooth miss in she head do not you get new tooth he ask ay so i do and be they ache too ah you with you nonsense say barbro irritably for all that axel have ask innocently enough and in she bitterness she let out what be the matter you can see how ` tis with I surely how 'twa with she axel look closer and fancy she be stouter than need be why you can not be -- ` tis surely not another child again say he why you know it be say she axel stare foolishly at she slow of think as he be he sit there count for a bit : one week two week get on the third week nay how i should know say he but barbro be lose all patience with this debate and burst out cry aloud cry like a deeply injured creature : nay you can take and bury I too in the ground and then you 'll be rid of I strange what odd thing a woman can find to cry for axel have never a thought of bury she in the ground he be a thick-skinned fellow look mainly to what be useful a pathway carpet with flower be beyond he need then you 'll not be fit to work in the field this summer say he not work say barbro all terrify again and then -- strange what odd thing a woman can find to smile for axel take it that way send a flow of hysterical joy through barbro and she burst out : i 'll work for two oh you wait and see axel i 'll do all you set I to and more beyond wear myself to the bone i will and be thankful if only you 'll put up with I so more tear and smile and tenderness after that only the two of they in the wild none to disturb they open door and a humming of fly in the summer heat all so tender and willing be barbro ay he might do as he please with she and she be willing after sunset he stand harness up to the mowing-machine there be a bit he can still get do ready for tomorrow barbro come hurry out as if she be something important and say : axel how ever could you think of get one home from america she could not get here before winter and what use of she then and that be something have just come into she head and she must come run out with it as if 'twa something needful but 'twa no way needful axel have see from the first that take barbro would mean get help for all the year no swaying and swing with axel no thinking with he head among the star now he be a woman of he own to look after the place he can keep on the telegraph business for a bit ` tis a deal of money in the year and good to reckon with as long as he be barely enough for he need from the land and little to sell all sound and work well all good reality and little to fear from brede about the telegraph line see he be son-in-law to brede now ay thing be look well look grand with axel now chapter xi and time go on winter be pass spring come again isak have to go down to the village one day -- and why not what for nay i do not know say he but he get the cart clean up all fine put in the seat and drive off and a deal of victuals and such put in too -- and why not 'twa for eleseus at storborg never a horse go out from sellanraa but there be something take down to eleseus when isak come drive down over the moor 'twa no little event for he come but rarely sivert go most way in he stead at the two farm nearest down folk stand at the door of the hut and tell one another : ` tis isak himself and what 'll he be go down after today and come down as far as to maaneland there be barbro at the glass window with a child in she arm and see he and say : ` tis isak himself he come to storborg and pull up _ ptro _ be eleseus at home eleseus come out ay he be at home not go yet but just go -- off on he spring tour of the town down south here be some thing you mother send down say he father do not know what it be but nothing much i doubt eleseus take the thing and thanks he and ask : there be not a letter i suppose or anything that sort ay say he father feeling in pocket there be ` tis from little rebecca i think they say eleseus take the letter ` tis that he have be wait for feel it all nice and thick and say to he father : well 'twa lucky you come in time -- though ` tis two day before i be off yet if you would like to stay a bit you might take my trunk down isak get down and tie up he horse and go for a stroll over the ground little andresen be no bad worker on the land in eleseus ' service true he have have sivert from sellanraa with horse but he have do a deal of work on he own account drain bog and hire a man himself to set the ditch with stone no need of buy fodder at storborg that year and next like as not eleseus would be keep a horse of he own thanks to andresen and the way he work on the land after a bit of a while eleseus call down that he be ready with he trunk ready to go himself too by the look of it in a fine blue suit white collar galosh and a walking-stick true he will have two day to wait for the boat but no matter he may just as well stay down in the village ` tis all the same if he be here or there and father and son drive off andresen watch they from the door of the shop and wish a pleasant journey isak be all think for he boy and would give he the seat to himself but eleseus will have none of that and ` sit up by he side they come to breidablik and suddenly eleseus have forget something _ ptro _ -- what be it ask he father oh he umbrella eleseus have forget he umbrella but he can not explain all about it and only say : never mind drive on do not you want to turn back no drive on but a nuisance it be how on earth have he come to leave it 'twa all in a hurry through he father be there wait well now he have better buy a new umbrella at trondhjem when he get there 'twa no importance either way if he have one umbrella or two but for all that eleseus be out of humor with himself so much so that he jump down and walk behind they could hardly talk much on the way down after that see isak have to turn round every time and speak over he shoulder say isak : how long you be go to be away and eleseus answer : oh say three week perhaps or a month at the outside he father marvel how folk do not get lose in the big town and never find they way back but eleseus answer as to that he be use to live in town and never get lose never have do in he life isak think it a shame to be sit up there all alone and call out : here you come and drive a bit i be get tired eleseus will not hear of he father get down and get up beside he again but first they must have something to eat -- out of isak 's well-filled pack then they drive on again they come to the two holding farthest down easy to see they be near the village now both the house have white curtain in the little window face toward the road and a flag-pole stick up on top of the hayloft for constitution day ` tis isak himself say folk on the two new farm as the cart go by at last eleseus give over thinking of he own affair and he own precious self enough to ask : what you drive down for today h be say he father 'twa nothing much today but then after all eleseus be go away no harm perhaps in tell he ` tis blacksmith 's girl jensine i be go down for say he father ay he admit so much and you be go down yourself for that could not sivert have go say eleseus ay eleseus know no better nothing better than to think sivert would go down to the smith 's to fetch jensine after she have think so much of herself as to leave sellanraa no 'twa all awry with the haymake the year before inger have put in all she could as she have promise leopoldine do she share too not to speak of have a machine for a horse to rake but the hay be much of it heavy stuff and the field be big sellanraa be a sizeable place now and the woman have other thing to look to besides make hay all the cattle to look to and meal to be get and all in proper time butter and cheese to make and clothes to wash and bake of bread mother and daughter work all they could isak be not go to have another summer like that he decide without any fuss that jensine should come back again if she could be get inger too have no longer a word against it she have come to she sens again and say : ay do as you think best ay inger be grow reasonable now ` tis no little thing to come to one 's sens again after a spell inger be no longer full of heat that must out no longer full of wild blood to be keep in check the winter have cool she nothing beyond the needful warmth in she now she be get stouter grow fine and stately a wonderful woman to keep from fading keep from die off by degree like enough because she have bloom so late in life who can say how thing come about nothing come from a single cause but from many be inger not in the best repute with the smith 's wife what could any smith 's wife say against she with she disfigurement she have be cheat of she spring and later have be set in artificial air to lose six year of she summer with life still in she what wonder she autumn give a errant growth inger be better than blacksmith ' wife -- a little damage a little warped but good by nature clever by nature ay father and son drive down they come to brede olsen 's lodging-house and set the horse in a shed it be evening now they go in themselves brede olsen have rent the house a outbuild it have be belong to the storekeeper but do up now with two sitting-room and two bedroom none so bad and in a good situation the place be well frequent by coffee-drinker and folk from round about the village go by the boat brede seem to have be in luck for once find something suit to he and he may thank he wife for that 'twa brede 's wife have hit on the idea of a coffee-shop and lodging-house the day she sit sell coffee at the auction at breidablik 'twa a pleasant enough thing to be sell something to feel money in she finger ready cash since they have come down here they have manage nicely sell coffee in earnest now and housing a deal of folk with nowhere else to lay they head a blessing to traveller be brede 's wife she have a good helper of course in katrine she daughter a big girl now and clever at wait -- though that be only for the time of course not long before little katrine must have something better than wait on folk in she parent ' house but for the present they be make money fairly well and that be the main thing the start have be decidedly favourable and might have be better if the storekeeper have not run short of cake and sweet biscuit to serve with the coffee here be all the feast-day folk call for cake with they coffee biscuit and cake 'twa a lesson to the storekeeper to lay in a good supply another time the family and brede himself live as best they can on they takings a good many meal be nothing but coffee and stale cake leave over but it keep they alive and give the child a delicate sort of refined appearance ` tis not every one have cake with they coffee say the village folk ay brede be do well it seem they even manage to keep a dog that go round beg among the customer and get bit here and there and grow fat on it a good fat dog about the place be a mighty fine advertisement for a lodging-house it speak for good feeding anywhere brede then be husband and father in the house and apart from that position have get on variously beside he have be once more install as lensmand 's assistant and deputy and have a good deal to do that way for a time unfortunately he daughter barbro have fall out with the lensmand 's wife last autumn about a trifling matter a mere nothing -- indeed to tell the truth a flea and brede himself be somewhat in disfavor there since but brede count it no great loss after all there be other family that find work for he now on purpose to annoy the lensmand 's he be frequently call upon for instance to drive for the doctor and as for the parsonage they would gladly send for brede every time there be a pig to be kill and more -- brede say so himself but for all that there be hard time now and again in brede 's house ` tis not all the family be as fat and flourishing as the dog still heaven be praise brede be not a man to take thing much to heart here be the child grow up day by day say he though for that matter there be always new little one come to take they place the one that be grow up and out in the world can keep themselves and send home a bit now and again there be barbro marry at maaneland and helge out at the herr fishery they send home something in money or money 's worth as often as they can ay even katrine do wait at home manage strangely enough to slip a five - _ krone _ note into she father 's hand last winter when thing be look extra bad there be a girl for you say brede and never ask she where she would get the money or what for ay that be the way child with a heart to think of they parent and help they in time of need brede be not altogether please with he boy helge in that respect he can be hear at time stand in the store with a little group about he develop he theory as to child and they duty toward they parent look you now my boy helge if he smoke tobacco a bit or take a dram now and then i have nothing against that we have all be young in we time but ` tis not right of he to go send one letter home after another and nothing but word and wish in ` tis not right to set he mother cry ` tis the wrong road for a lad in day go by thing be different child be no sooner grown than they go into service and start send home a little to help and quite right too be not it they father and mother have bear they under they breast first of all and sweating blood to keep the life in they all they tender year and then to forget it all it almost seem as if helge have hear that speech of he father 's for there come a letter from he after with money in -- fifty _ krone _ no less and then brede have a great time ay in they endless extravagance they buy both meat and fish for dinner and a lamp all hang about with lustre to hang from the ceiling in the best room they manage somehow and what more could they ask brede they keep alive live from hand to mouth but without great fear what more could they wish for here 's visitor indeed say brede show isak and eleseus into the room with the new lamp and i would never think to see isak you be never go away yourself and all nay only to the smith 's for something ` tis no more ho ` tis eleseus then go off south again eleseus be use to hotel he make himself at hojne hang up he coat and stick on the wall and call for coffee as for something to eat he father have thing in a basket katrine bring the coffee pay i 'll not hear of it say brede i have have many a bite and sup at sellanraa and as for eleseus i be in he book already do not take it katrine but eleseus pay all the same take out he purse and pay out the money and twenty _ ore _ over no nonsense about he isak go across to the smith 's and eleseus stay where he be he say a few word as in duty bind to katrine but no more than be need he would rather talk to she father no eleseus care nothing for woman have be frighten off by they once as it be and take no interest in they now like as not he would never much inclination that way to speak of see he be so completely out of it all now a strange man to live in the wild a gentleman with thin writer 's hand and the sense of a woman for finery for stick and umbrella and galosh frighten off and change incomprehensibly not a marry man even he upper lip decline to put forth any brutal degree of growth yet it might be the lad have start well enough come of good stock but be turn thereafter into a artificial atmosphere and warped transform have he work so hard in a office in a shop that he whole originality be lose thereby ay maybe 'twa so anyway here he be now easy and passionless a little weak a little heedless wander farther and farther off the road he might envy every soul among he fellow in the wild but have not even strength for that katrine be use to jest with she customer and ask he teasingly if he be off to see he sweetheart in the south again i have other thing to think of say eleseus i be out on business -- open up connection no call to be so free with you betters katrine say she father reprovingly oh brede olsen be all respect towards eleseus mighty respectful for he to be and well he may ` tis but wise of he see he owe money up at storborg and here be he creditor before he and eleseus ho all this deference please he and he be kind and gracious in return call brede my dear sir in jest and go on that way he mention that he have forget he umbrella : just as we be pass breidablik i thought of it leave my umbrella behind brede ask : you 'll be go over to we little store this evening belike for a drink say eleseus : ay maybe if 'twa only myself but i have my father here brede make himself pleasant and go on gossip : there be a fellow come in day after tomorrow that be on he way to america be home d'you mean ay he be from up in the village a bit be away for ever so many year and home for the winter he trunk 's come down already by cart -- and a mighty fine trunk i have think of go to america myself once or twice say eleseus frankly you cry brede why there be little need for the likes of you go that way surely well 'twa not go over to stay for ever i be think but i have be travel about so many place now i might just as well make the trip over there ay of course and why not and a heap of money and mean and all so they say in america here be this fellow i speak of before he be pay for more feasting and party than 's easy to count this winter past and come in here and say to I ` let 's have some coffee a potful and all the cake you have get ' like to see he trunk they go out in the passage to look at the trunk a wonder to look at on earth flame all side and corner with metal and clasp and binding and three flap to hold it down not to speak of a lock burglar-proof say brede as if he have try it himself they go back into the room but eleseus be grow thoughtful this american from up in the village have outdo he he be nothing beside such a man go out on journey like any high official ay natural enough that brede should make a fuss of he eleseus order more coffee and try to play the rich man too order cake with he coffee and give they to the dog -- and all the time feeling worthless and dejected what be he trunk beside that wonder out there there it stand black canvas with the corner all rub and wear a handbag nothing more -- ho but wait he would buy a trunk when he get to the town a splendid one it should be only wait ` tis a pity to feed the dog so say brede and eleseus feel better at that and ready to show off again ` tis a marvel how a beast can get so fat say he one think lead to another : eleseus break off he talk with brede and go out into the shed to look at the horse and there he take out a letter from he pocket and open it he have put it away at once never trouble to look what money be in it he have have letter of that sort from home before and always a deal of note inside -- something to help he on the way what be this a big sheet of gray paper scrawl all over little rebecca to she brother eleseus and a few word from he mother what else nothing else no money at all he mother write that she could not ask he father for more money again now for there be none too much left of all they have get for the copper mine that time the money have go to buy storborg and pay for all the goods after and eleseus ' travel about he must try and manage by himself this time for the money that be leave would have to be keep for he brother and sister not to leave they all without and a pleasant journey and you loving mother no money eleseus himself have not enough for he fare he have clean out the cash box at storborg and that be not much oh but he have be a fool to send that money to the dealer in bergen on account no hurry for that he might have let it stand over he ought of course to have open the letter before start out at all he might have save himself that journey down to the village with he miserable trunk and all and here he be he father come back from the smith 's after settle he business there jensine be to go back with he next morning and jensine look you have be nowise contrary and hard to persuade but see at once they want help at sellanraa for the summer and be ready to come a proper way to do again while he father be talk eleseus sit thinking of he own affair he show he the american 's trunk and say : only wish i be where that be come from and he father answer : ay 'twa none so bad maybe next morning isak get ready to start for home again have he food put in the horse and drive round by the smith 's to fetch jensine and she box eleseus stand look after they as they go then when they be lose to sight in the wood he pay he score at the lodging-house again and something over you can leave my trunk here till i come back he tell katrine and off he go eleseus -- go where only one place to go he turn back go back home again so he too take the road up over the hill again take care to keep as near he father and jensine as he can without be see walk on and on begin now to envy every soul of they in the wild ` tis a pity about eleseus so change he be and all be he do no business at storborg such as it be nothing to make a fortune out of there and eleseus be overmuch out and abroad make pleasant journey on business to open up connection and it cost too much he do not travel cheaply do not do to be mean say eleseus and give twenty _ ore _ over where he might save ten the business can not support a man of he taste he must get subsidy from home there be the farm at storborg with potato and corn and hay enough for the place itself but all provision else must come from sellanraa be that all sivert must cart up he brother 's goods from the steamer all for nothing and be that all he mother must get money out of he father to pay for he journey but be that all the worst be to come eleseus manage he business like a fool it flatter he to have folk come up from the village to buy at storborg so that he give they credit as soon as ask and when this be noised abroad there come still more of they to buy the same way the whole thing be go to rack and ruin eleseus be a easy man and let it go the store be empty and the store be fill again all cost money and who pay it he father at first he mother have be a faithful spokesman for he every way eleseus be the clever head of the family they must help he on and give he a start then think how cheaply he have get storborg and say straight out what he would give for it when he father think it be go wrong somehow with the business and naught but foolery she take he up how can you stand there and say such thing ay she reprove he for use such word about he son isak be forget he place it seem to speak so of eleseus for look you he mother have be out in the world herself she understand how hard it be for eleseus to live in the wild be use to better thing and accustom to move in society and with none of he equal near he risk too much in he dealings with folk that be none of the soundest but even so 'twa not do with any evil intent on he part of ruin he parent but sheer goodness of heart and noble nature 'twa he way to help those that be not so fine and grand as himself why be not he the only man in those part to use white handkerchief that be always have to be wash when folk come trustingly to he and ask for credit if he be to say no they might take it amiss it might seem as if he be not the noble fellow they have think after all also he have a certain duty towards he fellow as the town-bred man the genius among they all ay he mother bear all these thing in mind but he father never understand it all in the least open she eye and ear one day and say : look you here here 's all that be leave of the money from that mine that be all say she and what be come of the rest eleseus he be have the rest and she clasp she hand at that and declare it be time eleseus begin to use he wit poor eleseus all set on end and fritter away better maybe if he would work on the land all the time but now he be a man that have learn to write and use letter no grip in he no depth for all that no pitch-black devil of a man not in love not ambitious hardly nothing at all be eleseus not even a bad thing of any great dimension something unfortunate ill-fated about this young man as if something be rot he from within that engineer from the town good man -- better perhaps if he have not discover the lad in he youth and take he up to make something out of he the child have lose he roothold and suffer thereby all that he turn to now lead back to something want in he something dark against the

procession come up to sellanraa something laughable to look at maybe but more than that three man with enormous burden with sack hang down from they shoulder front and back walk one behind the other and call to one another with jest word but heavily laden little andresen chief clerk be head of that procession indeed ` tis he procession he have fit out himself and sivert from sellanraa and one other fredrik ström from breidablik for the expedition a notable little man be andresen he shoulder be weigh down slantwise on one side and he jacket pull all awry at the neck the way he go but he carry he burden on and on storborg and the business eleseus have leave -- well not buy it straight out on the spot perhaps ` tis more than andresen could afford better afford to wait a bit and get the whole maybe for nothing andresen be no fool he have take over the place on lease for the meanwhile and manage the business himself go through the stock in hand and find a deal of unsalable truck in eleseus ' store even to such thing as toothbrush and embroidered table centre ay and stuff bird on spring that squeak when you press in the right place these be the thing he have start out with now go to sell they to the miner on the other side of the hill he know from aronsen 's time that miner with money in they pocket will buy anything on earth only a pity he have to leave behind six rocking-horse that eleseus have order on he last trip to bergen the caravan turn into the yard at sellanraa and set down its load no long wait here they drink a mug of milk and make pretence of try to sell they wares on the spot then shoulder they burden and off again they be not out for pretence off they go trundle southward through the forest they march till noon rest for a meal and on again till evening then they camp and make a fire lie down and sleep a while sivert sleep rest on a boulder that he call a arm-chair oh sivert know what he be about here be the sun be warm that boulder all day till it be a good place to sit and sleep he companion be not so wise and will not take advice they lie down in the heather and wake up feel cold and sneeze then they have breakfast and start off again listen now for any sound of blast about they be hope to come on the mine and meet with folk some time that day the work should have get so far by now a good way up from the water towards sellanraa but never a sound of blast anywhere they march till noon meeting never a soul but here and there they come upon hole in the ground where man have be digging for trial what can this mean means no doubt that the ore must be more than commonly rich at the farther end of the tract they be get out pure heavy copper and keep to that end all the time in the afternoon they come upon several more mine but no miner they march on till evening and already they can make out the sea below march through a wilderness of desert mine and never a sound ` tis all beyond understanding but nothing for it they must camp and sleep out again that night they talk the matter over : can the work have stop should they turn and go back again not a bit of it say andresen next morning a man walk into they camp -- a pale haggard man who look at they frowningly piercingly that you andresen say the man it be aronsen aronsen the trader he do not say no to a cup of hot coffee and something to eat with the caravan and settle down at once i see the smoke of you fire and come up to see what it be say he i say to myself ` sure enough they be come to they sens and start work again ' and 'twa only you after all where you make for then here what be that you have get with you goods goods cry aronsen come up here with goods for sale who be to buy they there be never a soul they leave last Saturday go left who leave

sell goods and money pour in the village round all flourish and use the finest meal and a new schoolhouse and hang lamp and town-made boot and all then suddenly they lordship up at the mine take it into they head that the thing be not pay and close down not pay but it pay they before be not there clean copper there and plain to see at every blast 'twa rank cheating no less and never a thought of what it mean to a man like I ay i doubt it be as they say ` tis that geissler 's at the bottom of it all same as before no sooner he would come up than the work stop 'twa as if he would smell it out somehow geissler be he here then be he not ought to be shoot he ought come up one day by the steamer and say to the engineer : ` well how 's thing go ' -- ` all right as far as i can see ' say the engineer but geissler he just stand there and ask again : ` ho all right be it ' -- ` ay as far as i know ' say the engineer but as true as i be here no sooner the post come up from that same boat geissler have come by than there be letter and telegram both to the engineer that the work be not pay and he be to shut down at once the member of the expedition look at one another but the leader andresen himself have not lose courage yet you may just as well turn back and go home again be aronsen 's advice we be not do that say andresen and pack up the coffee-pot aronsen stare at the three of they in turn you be mad then say he look you andresen he care little now for what he master that be can say he be master himself now leader of a expedition equip at he own expense for a journey to distant part ` twould lose he he prestige to turn back now where he be well where will you go ask aronsen irritably can not say answer andresen but he be a notion of he own all the same no doubt think maybe of the native and come down into the district three man strong with glass bead and finger ring we 'll be get on say he to the rest now aronsen have think like enough to go farther up that morning see he would come so far want maybe to see if all the place be quite desert if it could be true every man on the place be go but see these pedlar-folk so set on go on it hinder he and he tell they again and again they be mad to try aronsen be furious himself march down in front of the caravan turn round and shout at they bark at they try to keep they out of he district and so they come down to the hut in the mining center a little town of hut but empty and desolate most of the tool and implement be house under cover but pole and plank break cart and case and barrel lie all about in disorder here and there a notice on a door declare no admittance there you be cry aronsen what do i say not a soul in the place and he threaten the caravan with disaster -- he will send for the lensmand anyway he be go to follow they every step now and if he can catch they at any unlawful trading ` tis penal servitude and slavery no mistake all at once somebody call out for sivert the place be not altogether dead after all not utterly desert here be a man standing beckon at the corner of a house sivert trundle over with he load and see at once who it be -- geissler funny meeting you here

thank you kindly get up that hayloft yet over the cowshed ay ` tis do well well -- i have a heap of thing to look to almost more than i can manage look at where we be sit now for instance what d'you

workings of fate it all begin when you father pick up some bit of stone up in the hill and give you to play with when you be a child that be how it start i know well enough those bit of stone be worth exactly as much as man would give for they no more well and good i set a price on they myself and buy they then the stone pass from hand to hand and do no end of damage time go on and now a few day ago i come up here again and what for d'you think to buy those stone back again geissler stop for a moment and look at sivert then suddenly he glance at the sack and ask : what be that you be carry goods say sivert we be take they down to the village geissler do not seem interested in the answer have not even hear it like as not he go on : buy they back again -- yes last time i let my son manage the deal he sell they then young fellow about you own age that be all about he he be the lightning in the family i be more a sort of fog know what be the right thing to do but do not do it but he be the lightning -- and he be enter the service of industry for the time be 'twa he sell for I last time i be something and he be not he be only the lightning quick to act modern type but the lightning by itself be a barren thing look at you folk at sellanraa now look up at blue peak every day of you life no new-fangled invention about that but fjeld and rocky peak root deep in the past -- but you have they for companionship there you be live in touch with heaven and earth one with they one with all these wide deep-rooted thing no need of a sword in you hand you go through life bareheaded barehand in the midst of a great kindliness look nature 's there for you and yours to have and enjoy man and nature do not bombard each other but agree they do not compete race one against the other but go together there be you sellanraa folk in all this living there fjeld and forest moor and meadow and sky and star -- oh ` tis not poor and sparingly count out but without measure listen to I sivert : you be content you have everything to live on everything to live for everything to believe in be bear and bring forth you be the needful on earth ` tis not all that be so but you be so needful on earth ` tis you that maintain life generation to generation breeding ever anew and when you die the new stock go on that be the meaning of eternal life what do you get out of it a existence innocently and properly set towards all what you get out of it nothing can put you under order and lord it over you sellanraa folk you have peace and authority and this great kindliness all round that be what you get for it you lie at a mother 's breast and suck and play with a mother 's warm hand there be you father now he be one of the two-and-thirty thousand what be to be say of many another i be something i be the fog as it be here and there float around sometimes come like rain on dry ground but the other there be my son the lightning that be nothing in itself a flash of barrenness he can act my son ay he be the modern type a man of we time he believe honestly enough all the age have teach he all the jew and the yankee have teach he i shake my head at it all but there be nothing mythical about I ` tis only in the family so to speak that i be like a fog sit there shake my head tell the truth -- i have not the power of do thing and not regret it if i have i could be lightning myself now i be a fog suddenly geissler seem to recollect himself and ask : get up that hayloft yet above the cowsh ay that be do and father 's put up a new house new house ` tis in case any one should come he say -- in case geissler he should happen to come along geissler think over this and take he decision : well then i would better come yes i 'll come you can tell you father that but i have a heap of thing to look to come up here and tell the engineer to let he people in sweden know i be ready to buy and we would see what happen all the same to I no hurry you ought to have see that engineer -- here he be be go about and keep it all up with man and horse and money and machine and any amount of fuss think it be all right know no better the more bit of stone he can turn into money the better he think he be do something clever and deserving bring money to the place to the country and everything near disaster more and more and he be none the wiser ` tis not money the country want there be more than enough of it already ` tis man like you father there be not enough of ay turn the means to a end in itself and be proud of it they be mad diseased they do not work they know nothing of the plough only the dice mighty deserving of they be not it work and waste themselves to nothing in they own mad way look at they -- stake everything be not they there be but this much wrong with it all they forget that gambling be not courage ` tis not even foolhardy courage ` tis a horror d'you know what gambling be ` tis fear with the sweat on you brow that be what it be what be wrong with they be they will not keep pace with life but want to go faster -- race on tear on ahead drive themselves into life itself like wedge and then the flank of they say : here stop there be something break find a remedy stop say the flank and then life crush they politely but firmly crush they and then they set to complain about life rage against life each to he own taste some may have ground to complain other not but there be none should rage against life not be stern and strict and just with life but be merciful to it and take its part only think of the gambler life have to bear with geissler recollect himself again and say : well all that be as it may be leave it he be evidently tired begin to breathe in little gasp go down say he ay there be no hurry you owe I a long walk over the hill sivert man remember that i remember it all i remember from the time i be a year and a half stand lean down from the barn bridge at garmo and notice a smell i can smell it again now but all that be as it may be that too but we might have do that trip over the hill now if you have not get that sack what be in it goods ` tis andresen be go to sell they well then i be a man that know what be the right thing to do but do not do it say geissler i be the fog now perhaps i 'll buy that mine back again one of these day it be not impossible but if i do it would not be to go about stare up at the sky and say ` aerial railway south america ' no leave that to the gambler folk hereabout say i must be the devil himself because i know beforehand this be go to break up but there be nothing mystical about I ` tis simple enough the new copper mine in montana that be all the yankee be smarter than we be at that game they be cut we to death in south america -- we ore here be too poor my son 's the lightning he get the news and i come float up here simple be not it i beat those fellow in sweden by a few hour that be all geissler be short of breath again he get on he foot and say : if you be go down let 's get along they go on down together geissler drag behind all tire out the caravan have stop at the quay and fredrik ström cheerful as ever be poke fun at aronsen : i be clean out of tobacco get any tobacco what i 'll give you tobacco say aronsen threateningly fredrik laugh and say comfortingly : nay you have no call to take it all heavy-like and sad aronsen we be just go to sell these thing here before you eye and then we 'll be off home again get away and wash you dirty mouth say aronsen furiously ha ha ha nay you have no call to dance about that way keep still and look like a picture geissler be tired tire out even he smoked glass do not help he now he eye keep close in the glare good-bye sivert man say he all at once no i can not get up to sellanraa this time after all tell you father i have a heap of thing to see to but i 'll come later on -- say that aronsen spit after he and say : ought to be shoot \* \* \* \* \* for three day the caravan peddle its wares sell out the contents of the sack and get good price it be a brilliant piece of business the village folk be still well supply with money after the downfall of the mine and be excellently in form in the way of spend those stuff bird on spring be the very thing they want they set they up on chest of drawer in they parlor and also buy nice paper-knife the very thing for cut the leaf of a almanac aronsen be furious just as if i have not thing every bit as good in my store say he trader aronsen be in a sorry way he have make up he mind to keep with these pedlar and they sack watch they all the time but they go separate way about the village each for himself and aronsen almost tear himself to piece try to follow all at once first he give up fredrik ström who be quickest at say unpleasant thing then sivert because he never say a word but go on sell at last he stick to follow he former clerk and try to set folk against he wherever he go in oh but andresen know he master that be -- know he of old and how little he know of business and unlawful trading ho you mean to say english thread 's not prohibit say aronsen look wise i know it be answer andresen but i be not carry any this way i can sell that elsewhere i have not a reel in my pack look for yourself if you like that be as it may be say aronsen anyway i know what be forbid and i have show you so do not try to teach I aronsen stand it for a whole day then he give up andresen too and go home the pedlar have no one to watch they after that and then thing begin to go swimmingly it be in the day when womenfolk use to wear loose plait in they hair and andresen he be the man to sell loose plait ay at a pinch he could sell fair plait to dark girl and be sorry he would nothing lighter no gray plait for instance for that be the finest of all and every evening the three young salesman meet at a appoint place and go over the day 's trade each borrowing from another anything he have sell out of and andresen would sit down often as not and take out a file and file away the german trade-mark from a sportsman 's whistle or rub out faber on the pen and pencil andresen be a trump and always have be sivert on the other hand be rather a disappointment not that he be any way slack and fail to sell he goods -- 'twa he indeed sell most -- but he do not get enough for they you do not put in enough patter with it say andresen no sivert be no hand at reel off a lot of talk he be a fieldworker sure of what he say and speak calmly when he speak at all what be there to talk about here also sivert be anxious to be do with it and get back home there be work to do in the field ti that jensine 's call he fredrik ström explain fredrik himself by the way have work on he own field to be do that spring and little time to waste but for all that he must look in on aronsen the last day and get up a argument with he i 'll sell he the empty sack say he andresen and sivert stay outside while he go in they hear grand goings-on inside the store both talk at once and fredrik set up a laugh now and again then aronsen throw open the door and show he visitor out oh but fredrik do not come out -- no he take he time and talk a lot more the last thing they hear from outside be fredrik try to sell aronsen a lot of rocking-horse then the caravan go home again -- three young man full of life and health they march and sing sleep a few hour in the open and go on again when they get back to sellanraa on the Monday isak have begin sowing the weather be right for it the air moist with the sun peep out now and again and a mighty rainbow string right across the heaven the caravan break up -- _ farvel farvel _ \* \* \* \* \* isak at he sowing a stump of a man a barge of a man to look at nothing more clad in homespun -- wool from he own sheep boot from the hide of he own cow and calf sowing -- and he walk religiously barehead to that work he head be bald just at the very top but all the rest of he shamefully hairy a fan a wheel of hair and beard stand out from he face ` tis isak the margrave 'twa rarely he know the day of the month -- what need have he of that he have no bill to be meet on a certain date the mark on he almanac be to show the time when each of the cow should bear but he know st olaf 's day in the autumn that by then he hay must be in and he know candlema in spring and that three week after then the bear come out of they winter quarter all seed must be in the earth by then he know what be needful a tiller of the ground body and soul a worker on the land without respite a ghost rise out of the past to point the future a man from the earliest day of cultivation a settler in the wild nine hundred year old and withal a man of the day nay there be nothing leave to he now of the copper mine and its riches -- the money have vanish into air and who have anything left of all that wealth when the work stop and the hill lay dead and desert but the _ almenn _ be there still and ten new holding on that land beckon a hundred more nothing grow there all thing grow there man and beast and fruit of the soil isak sowing he corn the evening sunlight fall on the corn that flash out in a arc from he hand and fall like a drop of gold to the ground here come sivert to the harrowing after that the roller and then the harrow again forest and field look on all be majesty and power -- a sequence and purpose of thing _ kling _ _ ele _ say the cow bell far up on the hillside come nearer and nearer the cattle be come home for the night fifteen head of they and five-and-forty sheep and goat besides threescore in all there go the woman out with they milk-pail carry on yoke from the shoulder : leopoldine jensine and little rebecca all three barefoot the margravine inger herself be not with they

she be home the world be wide swarm with tiny speck -- inger have be one of they all but nothing in all humanity only one speck then come the evening knut hamsun _ by _ ww worster knut hamsun -lrb- footnote : December 1920 -rrb- by ww worster knut hamsun be now sixty for year past he have be regard as the greatest of live norwegian writer but he be still little known in england one or two attempt have be make previously to introduce hamsun 's work into this country but it be not until this year with the publication of _ growth of the soil _ that he achieve any real success or become at all generally know among english reader _ growth of the soil _ -lrb- marken gröde -rrb- be hamsun 's latest work its reception here be one of immediate and unstinted appreciation such as be rarely accord to a translate work by a alien author practically unknown even to the critic a noticeable feature be the frankness with which experienced bookman lay aside stock phrase and deal with this book as in response to a strong personal appeal to the reviewer age with much knowledge harden by much handling of mediocrity it be a relief to meet with a book that can and must be deal with so those reader be perhaps most fortunate who come upon such a book as this without foretaste or preparation to the mind under spell of a aesthetic or emotional appeal the step that go to make it the stage whereby the author pass be as irrelevant as the logarithm that go to build a aeroplane yet it be only by knowledge of such step that the achievement can be fully understand _ growth of the soil _ be very far indeed from hamsun 's earliest beginning : far even from the book of he early middle period which make he name it be the life story of a man in the wild the genesis and gradual development of a homestead the unit of humanity in the unfilled uncleared tract that still remain in the norwegian highland it be a epic of earth the history of a microcosm its dominant note be one of patient strength and simplicity the mainstay of its working be the tacit stern yet loving alliance between nature and the man who face she himself trust to himself and she for the physical means of life and the spiritual contentment with life which she must grant if he be worthy modern man face nature only by proxy or as proxy through other or for other and the intimacy be lose in the wild the contact be direct and immediate it be the foothold upon earth the touch of the soil itself that give strength the story be epic in its magnitude in its calm steady progress and unhurrying rhythm in its vast and intimate humanity the author look upon he character with a great all-tolerant sympathy aloof yet kindly as a god a more objective work of fiction it would be hard to find -- certainly in what use to be call the neurasthenic north and this from the pen of the man who write _ sult _ _ mysterier _ and _ pan _ hamsun 's early work be subjective in the extreme so much so indeed as almost to lie outside the limit of aesthetic composition as a boy he write verse under difficulty -- he be bear in gudbrandsdalen but come as a child to bodö in lofoten and work with a shoemaker there for some year save up money for the publication of he juvenile effort he have little education to speak of and after a period of vary casual occupation mostly of the humblest sort he come to christianium with the object of study there but fail to make he way twice he essay he fortune in america but without success for three year he work as a fisherman on the newfoundland bank he nordland origin be in itself significant it mean a environment of month-long night and concentrate summer in which all feeling be intensify and love and dread and gratitude and longing be nearer and deeper than in milder and more temperate region where elemental opposite be as it be reciprocally dilute in 1890 at the age of thirty hamsun attract attention by the publication of _ sult _ -lrb- hunger -rrb- _ sult _ be a record of week of starvation in a city the semi-delirious confession of a man whose physical and mental faculty have slip beyond control he speak and act irrationally and know it watch himself at he mental antic and take himself to task for the same and he ask himself : be it a sign of madness it might seem so the extraordinary association the weird fancy and bizarre impulse that be here lay bare give a air of convincing verisimilitude to the suppose confession of a starving journalist but as a matter of fact hamsun have no need of extraneous influence to invest he character with originality starve or feed they can be equally erratic this be see in he next book _ mysterier _ here we have action and reaction as fantastic as in _ sult _ though the hero have here no such excuse as in the former case the mystery or mystification of nagel a stranger who come for no particular reason apparent to stay in a little norwegian town arise entirely out of nagel 's own personality _ mysterier _ be one of the most exasperating book that a publisher 's reader or a conscientious reviewer could be give to deal with a analysis of the principal character be a most baffling task one be tempt to call he mad and have do with it but as a matter of fact he be uncompromisingly unrestrainedly human he go about constantly say and do thing that we ordinary and respectable people be train and accustom to refrain from say or do at all he have the self-consciousness of a sensitive child he be for ever think of what people think of he and try to create a impression then with a paradoxical sincerity he confess that the motive of this or that action _ be _ simply to create a impression and thereby destroy the impression sometimes he cap this by wilfully let it appear that the double move be carefully design to produce the reverse impression of the first -- until the person concerned be utterly bewildered and the reader likewise _ mysterier _ appear in 1893 in the following year hamsun astonish he critic with two book _ ny jord _ -lrb- new ground -rrb- and _ redaktör lynge _ both equally unlike he previous work with these he pass at a bind from one-man story portrait study of eccentric character in a remote or restricted environment to group subject choose from centre of life and culture in christianium _ redaktör lynge _ -- _ redaktör _ of course mean editor -- deal largely with political maneuver and intrigue the bitter controversial politics of norway prior to the dissolution of the union with sweden _ ny jord _ give a unflattering picture of the academic literary and artistic youth of the capital idler for the most part arrogant unscrupulous self-important and full of disdain for the mere citizen and merchant whose simple honesty and kindliness be laugh at or exploit by the newly dominant representative of culture both these book be technically superior to the first two inasmuch as they show mastery of a more difficult form but they appeal be not so great there be lack a something that might be inspiration personal sympathy -- some indefinable essential that the author himself have teach we to expect they be less _ hamsunsk _ than most of hamsun 's work hamsun be at he best among the scene and character he love tenderness and sympathy make up so great a part of he charm that he be hardly recognizable in surroundings or society uncongenial to himself it would almost seem as if he realize something of this for in he next work he turn from the capital to the nordland coast revert also in some degree to the subjective keenly sensitive manner of _ sult _ though now with more restraint and concentration _ pan _ -lrb- 1894 -rrb- be probably hamsun 's best-known work it be a love-story but of a extraordinary type and be moreover important from the fact that we be here introduce to some of the character and type that be destine to reappear again and again in he later work nagel the exasperating irresponsible of _ mysterier _ be at he maddest in he behavior towards the woman he love it be natural that this should be so when a man be intoxicate he essential quality be emphasize if he have wit he will be witty if a brutal nature he will be a brute if he be of a melancholy temper he will be dispose to sit upon the ground and tell sad story of the death of king we see this in _ pan _ the love-making of the hero be characterize by the same irrational impulse the same extravagant action as in _ sult _ and _ mysterier _ but they be now less frequent and less involve the book as a whole be tone down so to speak from the bewildering tangle of unrestraint in the first two there be quite sufficient of the erratic and unusual in the character of glahn the hero but the tone be more subdue the madcap youth of genius have realize that the world look frigidly at its vagary and the secretly proud _ au moin _ je sui autre -- more a boast than a confession -- give place to a wistful apologetic admission of the difference as a fault here already we have something of that resignation which come later to its fulness in the story of the wanderer with the mute the love-story in _ pan _ take the form of a conflict it be one of those battle between the sex duel of wit and _ esprit _ such as one find in the play of marivaux but hamsun set he battle in the sign of the heart not of the head it be a _ marivaudage _ of feeling none the less deep for its erratic utterance moreover the scene be lay not in salon and ante-chamber but in a landscape such as hamsun love the forest-clad hill above a little fishing village between the _ höifjeld _ and the sea and interwoven with the story like a eerie breathing from the dark of wood at dusk and dawn be the haunting presence of iselin _ la belle dame sans merci _ otto weininger the author of _ sex and character _ say of _ pan _ that it be perhaps the most beautiful novel ever write weininger of course be a extremist and few would accept he judgment without reserve it be doubtful whether any writer nowadays would venture to make such a claim for any book at all _ pan _ be a book that offend against all sort of rule as a literary product it be eminently calculate to elicit especially in england the olympian this will never do to begin with it be not so much a novel as a _ novelle _ -- a form of art little cultivate in this country but which lend itself excellently to delicate artistic handling and the creation of that subtle influence which hamsun 's countryman call _ stemn _ poorly render by the english atmosphere the epilogue be disproportionately long the portion write as by another hand be all too recognizably in the style of the rest and with all he chivalrous sacrifice and violent end glahn be at best a quixotic hero man as man would think he rather a fool and woman as woman might flush at the thought of a cavalier so embarrassingly unrestrained he be not to be idolize as a cinema star or the literary gymnastic hero of a perennial earl 's court exhibition set to music on the stage he could not be truthfully portray on a flamboyant wrapper as at all seductively masculine in a word he be neither a man 's man nor a woman 's man but he be a human be keenly susceptible to influence which most of we have feel in some degree closely ally to _ pan _ be _ victorium _ likewise a story of conflict between two lover the actual plot can only be describe as hackneyed girl and boy the rich man 's daughter and the poor man 's son playmate in youth then separate by the barrier of social standing -- few but the most harden of best-seller cater for semi-detached suburbia would venture nowadays to handle such a theme yet hamsun dare and so insistently unlike all else be the impress of he personality that the mechanical structure of the story be forget it be intersperse with irrelevant fancy vision and imagining a chain of tie note hear as a undertone through the action on the surface the effect be that of something strain towards a impossible realization a beating of wing in the void a strive for utterance of thing beyond speech _ victorium _ be the swan-song of hamsun 's subjective period already in the three play which appear during the year immediately follow _ pan _ he face the merciless law of change the unrelenting forward which mean leave love thing behind kareno student of life begin he career in resolute opposition to the old man the established authority who stand for compromise and resignation for twenty year he remain obstinately faithful to he creed that the old man must step aside or be thrust aside to make way for the youth that will be serve what have age that youth have not experience experience in all its poor and withered nakedness and what use be they experience to we who must make we own in every single happen of life in _ aftenröde _ the sunset of the trilogy kareno himself desert the cause of youth and ally himself to the party in power and the final scene show he tell a story to a child : there be once a man who never would give way the madness of _ sult _ be excuse as be delirium due to physical suffering nagel in _ mysterier _ be show as a fool a eccentric intolerable in ordinary society though he be disconcertingly human paradoxically sane glahn in _ pan _ apologize for he uncouth straightforwardness by confess that he be more at home in the wood where he can say and do what he please without offence johanne in _ victorium _ be of humble birth which count in extenuation of he unmannerly frankness in early year later he become a poet and as such be exempt in some degree from the conventional restraint impose on those who aspire to polite society all these well-chosen character be make to serve the author 's purpose as channel for poetic utterance that might otherwise seem irrelevant the extent to which this be do may be see from the way in which hamsun let a character in one book enter upon a theme which later become the subject of a independent work by the author himself thus glahn be haunt by vision of diderik and iselin johanne write fragment suppose to be speak by one vendt the monk five year after _ victorium _ hamsun give we the romantic drama of _ munken vendt _ in which diderik and iselin appear throughout these early work hamsun be strive to find expression for he own sensitive personality a form and degree of expression sufficient to relieve he own tension of feeling without fuse the medium adequate to he own need yet understandable and tolerable to ordinary human being to the reader of book the process in effect be simply this : hamsun be a poet with a poet 's deep and unusual feeling and a poet 's need of utterance to gain a hearing he choose figure whom he can conveniently represent as fool secretly he love they for they be himself but to the world he can present they with a polite apology a plea for kindly indulgence it be not infrequent in literature to find the wisest and most poignant utterance thus lay in the mouth of poor man clothe in motley some of the most daring thing in shakespeare the newest heresy of the renaissance be voice by irresponsible of all dramatic figure that of the fool be most suit to the expression of concentrated feeling there be a arrest question in a play of recent year which run something like this : do you think that the thing people make fool of themselves about be any less real and true than the thing they behave sensibly about most of we have at some time or another feel that uncomfortable almost indecently denude question which come to we at rare moment from the stage where some great drama be be play : what be higher what be more real : this or the life we live in that sudden flash the matter of today 's and tomorrow 's reality in we mind appear as vulgar trifle thing of which we be ashamed the feeling last but a moment for a moment we have be something higher than ourselves in the mere desire so to be then we fall back to ourselves once more to the lower level upon which alone we can exist and yet it be by such potential that we judge the highest art by its power to give we if only for a moment something of that which the divinity of we aspiring mind find want in the confines of reality the richness of this quality be one of the most endearing thing in hamsun 's character they sensitiveness be a thing we have be train for self-defence to repress it be well for we no doubt that this be so but we be grateful for they show that such thing _ be _ as we be grateful for kensington garden who can not live where tree be everywhere the figure hamsun set before we as confessedly unsuited to the reality of life he vagabond he failure he fool have power at time to make we question whether we world of comfort luxury success be what we think if it be not well lose in exchange for the power to _ feel _ as they it have be say that life be a comedy to those who think a tragedy to those who feel humanly speak it be one of the greatest merit of hamsun 's work that he show otherwise he attitude towards life be throughout one of feeling yet he make of life no tragedy but a beautiful story i will be young until i die say kareno in _ aftenröde _ the word be not so much a challenge to fate as a denial of fact he be not fight only refuse to acknowledge the power that be already hard upon he kareno be a _ intellectual _ character he be a philosopher a man whose perception and activity lie predominantly in the sphere of think not of feel he attempt to carry the fire of youth beyond the grave of youth end in disaster a unnecessary _ débâcle _ due to he gratuitously attempt the impossible hamsun 's poet-personality the spirit we have see strive for expression through the figure of nagel glahn johanne and the rest be a creature of _ feeling _ and here the development proceed on altogether different line the emotion which fail to find adequate outlet even in such work as _ sult _ _ mysterier _ _ victorium _ and _ pan _ might well seem more of a peril than the quixotic stubbornness of kareno 's philosophy such a flood in its tempestuous unrest might seem to threaten destruction or at best the vain dispersal of its own power into chaos but by some rare guidance it be lead after the storm of _ munken vendt _ into channel of beneficent fertility in 1904 after a interval of short story letter of travel and poem come the story entitle _ svoermere _ the word mean moth it also stand for something else something for which we english as a sensible people have no word something pleasantly futile deliciously unprofitable -- foolish lover hover like moth about a lamp but there be more than this that be untranslatable in the title _ as _ a title it suggest a attitude of gentleness tenderness sympathy toward whomsoever it describe it be a new note in hamsun the opening of a new _ motif _ the main thread of the story bear a certain similarity to that of _ mysterier _ _ viciorium _ and _ pan _ be a love affair of mazy winding a tangled skein of loves-me-loves-me-not but it be pure comedy throughout rolandsen the telegraph operator in love with elsie mack be no poet he have not even any pretension to education or social standing he be a cheerful riotous blade who sport with the girl of the village get drunk at time and serenade the parson 's wife at night with he guitar _ svoermere _ be the slightest of little story in itself but full of delightful vagary and the most winning humor the story of _ benonus _ with its continuation _ rosa _ be in like vein a tenderly humorous portrayal of love below stair the principal character be choose from the class who appear as super in _ pan _ subject or retainer of the all-powerful trader mack it be as if the sub-plot in one of shakespeare 's play have be take out for separate presentment and the clown promote to be hero in a play of he own the cast be increase the _ milieu _ lightly draw in _ pan _ be now show more comprehensively and in detail make we gradually acquaint with a whole little community a village world know little of any world beyond and form a microcosm in itself hamsun have return as it be to the scene of he passionate youth but in altered guise he play no part himself now but be a onlooker a stander-by chronicling as from a cloistered aloofness yet with kindly wisdom always the little thing that matter in the life of those around he wisdom and kindliness sympathy and humor and understand these be the dominant note of the new phase _ svoermere _ end happily -- for it be a story of other people 's life so also with benonus and rosa at the last and so surely have the author establish he foothold on the new ground that he can even bring in edvarda the iselin figure from _ pan _ once more thus link up he brave and lusty comedy of middle age with the romantic tragedy of he youth make a comprehensive pageant-play of large-hearted humanity meantime the effect upon himself be see -- and avowed between _ svoermere _ and _ benonus _ come the frankly first-personal narrative of a vagabond who describe himself upon interrogation as knut pedersen -- which be two-third of knut pedersen hamsund -- and hail from nordland -- which embrace lofoten it do not need any showing of paper however to establish the identity of knut pedersen vagabond with the author of _ pan _ the opening word of the book -lrb- under höststjaernen -rrb- be enough indian summer mild and warm it be many year now since i know such peace twenty or thirty year maybe -- or maybe it be in another life but i have feel it some time surely since i go about now hum a little tune go about rejoice loving every straw and every stone and feeling as if they care for I in return this be the hamsun of _ pan _ but hamsun now be a greater soul than in the day when glahn the solitary dweller in the wood pick up a broken twig from the ground and hold it lovingly because it look poor and forsake or thank the hillock of stone outside he hut because it stand there faithfully as a friend that wait he return he be stronger now but no less delicate he love not nature less but the world more he have learn to love he fellow-men knut pedersen vagabond wander about the country with he tramp-companion grindhusen the painter who can ditch and delve at a pinch or falkenberg farm-labourer in harvest-time and piano-tuner where piano be here be brave comradeship the sharing of adventure the ready wit of jovial vagrant the book be a harmless picaresque a _ geste _ of innocent rogue-errantry its place be with _ lavengro _ and _ the cloister and the hearth _ in that ancient endless order of tale which link up age with age and land with land in the unaltering unfrontiered fellowship of the road that keep the spirit of poetry alive through the dark age the vagabond from nordland have he own adventure he _ bonnes fortune _ there be a touch of sterne about the book not the exaggerated super-sterne of tristram shandy with eighteenth-century-futurist blank and marbled page but the fluent casual follow-your-fancy sterne of the _ sentimental journey _ yet the vagabond himself be unobtrusive ready to step back and be a chronicler the moment other figure enter into constellation he move among youth himself no longer young and among gentlefolk as one make no claim to equal rank both these feature be accentuate further in the story of the wanderer with the mute it be a continuation of _ under höststjaernen _ and form the culmination the acquiescent close of the self-expressional series that begin with _ sult _ the discord of tortured loveliness be now resolve into a ultimate harmony of comely resignation and rich content a wanderer may come to fifty year he play more softly then play with muted string this be the keynote of the book the wanderer be no longer young it be for youth to make the story old man tell tragedy be reserve for those of high estate a wanderer in corduroy such as labourer wear here in the south can tell the story of he chatelaine and she lover with the self-repression of a humbler henry esmond win nothing for himself even at the last yet feel he be still in nature 's debt hamsun 's next work be _ den siste gloede _ -lrb- literally the last joy -rrb- the title as it stand be expressive the substantive be joy -- but it be so qualify by the precede last a word of overwhelming influence in any combination that the total effect be one of sadness and the book itself be a masterly presentment of gloom masterly -- or most natural : it be often hard to say how much of hamsun 's effect be due to superlative technique and how much to the inspired disregard of all technique _ den siste gloede _ be a diary of wearisome day spend for the most part among unattractive insignificant people at a holiday resort the only action in it be a altogether pitiful love affair in which the narrator be involve to the slightest possible degree the writer be throughout despondent he feel himself out of the race he day be past solitude and quiet nature and he own foolish feeling -- these be the last joy leave he now the book might have seem a fitting if pathetic end to the literary career of the author of _ pan _ certainly it hold out no promise of further energy or interest in life or work the closing word amount to a personal farewell then without warn hamsun enter upon a new phase of power _ börn av tilden _ -lrb- child of the age -rrb- be a objective study its main theme be the marriage conflict touch upon in the wanderer story and here develop in a different setting and with fuller individuality hamsun have here move up a step in the social scale from villager of the benonus type to the land-owning class there be the same conflict of temperament that we have see before but less violent now the poet 's late-won calm of mind and the level of culture from which he character now be draw -- perhaps by instinctive selection -- make for restraint still a romantic at heart he become more classic in form _ börn av tilden _ be also the story of segelfoss in its pass from the tranquil dignity of a semi-feudal estate to the complex and ruthless modernity of a industrial center _ segelfoss by _ -lrb- 1915 -rrb- treat of the fortune of the succeed generation and the further development of segelfoss into a township -lrb- by -rrb- then with _ growth of the soil _ hamsun achieve he greatest triumph set aside all that matter most to himself he turn with the experience of a lifetime rich in conflict to the thing that matter to we all deliberately shear of all that make for mere effect isak stand out as a elemental figure the symbol of man at he best face to face with nature and life there be no greater human character -- reverently say -- in the bible itself \* \* \* \* \* these then be the step of hamsun 's progress as a author from the passionate chaos of _ sult _ to the miltonic monumental calm of _ growth of the soil _ the stage in themselves be full of beauty the wistfulness of _ pan _ and _ victorium _ the kindly humor of _ svoermere _ and _ benonus _ the autumn-tinted resignation of the wanderer with the mute -- they follow as the season do each with a charm of its own yet all derive from one source he muse at first be iselin the embodiment of adolescent longing the dream of those whom delight fly because they give she chase the hopelessness of he own pursuit fill he with pity for mortal under the same spell and he step aside to be a brave encouraging chorus or a kindly chronicler of other ' life and he reward be the love of a greater divinity the goddess of field and homestead no will-o ' - the-wisp but a presence of wisdom and calm the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of growth of the soil by knut hamsun
