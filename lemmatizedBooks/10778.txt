high degree the proudest of the proud be he yet train in camp he know the art to win the soldier 's hardy heart boisterous as march yet fresh as may with open hand and brow as free lover of wine and minstrelsy directly opposite rest on he staff stand the palmer the thin dark visage half see half hide by he hood steadily he gaze on marmion who by frown and gesture give evidence that he could ill bear so close a scrutiny as squire and archer look at the stern dark face of the pilgrim they burst of laughter grow less loud less frequent and gradually they mirth decline they whisper one to another : sawest thou ever such a face how pale he cheek how bright he eye he heart must be set only on he soul 's salvation to chase away the gloom gradually steal over the company and to draw from himself the sullen scowl of the palmer marmion call upon he favorite squire : ` fitz-eustace know ' t thou not some lay to speed the linger night away ' the youth make a unhappy choice he have a rich mellow voice and choose the wild sad ballad often sing to marmion by the unfortunate constance de beverley when all be quiet quiveringly the note fall upon the air : song where shall the lover rest whom the fate sever from he true maiden 's breast part forever where early violet die under the willow there through the summer day cool stream be lave there while the tempest sway scarce be bough wave there thy rest shalt thou take never again to awake never o never where shall the traitor rove he the deceiver who could win maiden 's love win and then leave she in the lost battle bear down by the fly where mingles war 's rattle with groan of the die he warm blood the wolf shall lap ere life be part shame and dishonor sit by he grave ever blessing shall hallow it -- never o never the melancholy sound cease the song be sad and bitterly it fall on the false-hearted marmion well he know that at he request the faithful but misguided constance have be take to lindisfarne to be punish for crime commit through she mistaken love for he as if he already see disgrace for himself and death for she he draw he mantle before he face and bent he head upon he hand constance de beverley at that moment be die in she cell the meanest groom in all the train could scarce have wish to exchange place with the proud marmion could he thought have be know control himself and raise he head he say : as you sing it seem that i hear a death knell ring in mine ear what be the meaning of this weird sound then for the first time the palmer break he silence and say in reply : it foretell the death of a loved friend utterance for once fail the haughty marmion whose pride heretofore could scarcely brook a word even from he king he glance fall he brow flush for something familiar in the tone or look of the speaker so strike the false heart that he be speechless before he troubled imagination rise a vision of the lovely constance beautiful and pure as when trust he treacherous word she leave the peaceful wall of she convent he know she be now a captive in convent cell and the strange word of the palmer add to the song of the squire have make he unhappy alas he think would that i have leave she in purity to live in holiness to die twice he be ready to order to horse that he might fly to lindisfarne and command that not one golden ringlet of she fair head be harm and twice he think they dare not i give order that she should be safe though not at large while thus love and repentance strove in the breast of the lord the landlord begin a weird tale suggest by the speech of the palmer as marmion listen he gather from the legend that not far from where they sit a knight might learn of future weal or woe he might perchance meet in the charm ring he deadliest foe in the form of a spectre and with it engage in mortal combat if victorious over this supernatural antagonist the omen be victory in all future undertaking marmion long to prove he chance in charm ring to break a lance the yeoman have drunk deep the ale be strong and at a sign from they master all seek rest on the hostel floor before the now die ember for pillow under each head be quiver or targe the flicker fire throw fitful shadow on the strange group marmion and he squire retire to other quarter where the palmer have disappear none know or care alone fold in he green mantle and nestle in the hay of a waste loft lay fitz-eustace the pale moonlight fall upon he youthful face and form he be dream happy dream of hawk and hound of ring and glove of lady 's eye when suddenly he wake a tall form half in the moonbeam half in the gloom stand beside he but before he could draw he dagger he recognize the voice of marmion who say : fitz-eustace rise and saddle bevi i can not rest the air must cool my brow i fain would ride to view the elfin scene of chivalry of which we hear to-night rouse none from they slumber for i would not have those prate knave know that i could credit so wild a tale as we landlord have tell softly down the step they steal eustace lead forth the steed array for the ride and marmion arm to meet the elfin foe spring into the saddle the young squire listen to the resounding hoof-beat as they grow more and more faint and wonder as he fall asleep that one hold to be so wary so wise so incredulous should ride forth at midnight to meet a ghost in mail and plate the moon be bright and as marmion reach the elfin camp halt he fearlessly blow he bugle a answer come so faint and hollow that it might have be a echo but suddenly he see a distinct form appear a mount champion the sight of the unexpected foe make to tremble with horror he who never have fear knight or noble he hand so shake he could scarce couch spear aright the combat begin the two horseman run they course and in the third attack marmion 's steed could not resist the unearthly shock -- he fall and the flower of england 's chivalry roll in the dust high over the head of the fall foe the suppose spectre shake he sword full on he face fall the moonlight a face never to be mistake it be the wraith of ralph de wilton who have be send by marmion to exile and to death thrice over he victim do the grim ghast spectre shake he blade but when marmion white with terror pray for life the seeming vision dash he sword into its sheath spring lightly to he saddle and vanish as he come the moon sink from sight and the poor shiver wretched english knight lay grovel on the plain could it be he mortal enemy have leave the grave to strike down a living foe and to stare in derisive hatred from a raise visor whether dead or alive the elfin foe have little reason to spare the life of so dastardly a enemy sweetly sleep or patiently listen eustace wait for the return of he knight wait till he hear a horse come spur to its utmost speed the rider hastily throw the rein to he squire but speak not a word in the dim light the youth plainly see that the armor and the falcon crest on he lord 's helmet be cover with clay that the knee and side of the noble charger be in sad plight it be evident the beast and he rider have be overthrow to broken and brief rest eustace return and never do he more gladly welcome the light of day eustace do ne'er so blithely mark the first note of the morning lark chapter iv the lark sing shrill the cock he crew and loudly marmion 's bugle blow and with they light and lively call bring groom and yeoman to the stall light of heart they come but soon they mood be change complaint be hear on every side one declare he armor have be use another that he spear have be take young blount marmion 's second squire find he steed cover with foam though the stable boy swear he have leave the beautiful creature well groom on the previous evening while the impatient squire rage and fume old hubert cry : ho comrade help bevi lie die in he stall to we lord this will bring sorrow indeed who will dare tell he of the horse he love so well fitz-eustace who know of the midnight ride of the condition of horse and rider on they return offer to bear the unwelcome message marmion sit plunge in deep thought receive the tiding unmoved give little attention pass the matter as if it be a mere accident and order the clarion sound to horse young blount be less easily deal with he declare he would pay no fee for food or care man or demon he say have ride he steed all night
