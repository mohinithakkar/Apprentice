the young man 's retreat figure and continue he stroll he own trouble partly forget in the desire to assist he friend it would be a notable feat for the humble steward to be the means of bring the young people together and thereby bring to a end the feud of a dozen year he picture himself eventually as the trust friend and adviser of both family and in one daring flight of fancy saw himself hobnob with the two captain over pipe and whisky neatly dress and carry a small offering of wallflower he set out that afternoon to call on he old master give as he walk the last touch to a little speech of welcome which he have prepare during dinner it be a happy effort albeit a trifle labor but captain nugent 's speech the inspiration of the moment give it no chance he start the moment the
