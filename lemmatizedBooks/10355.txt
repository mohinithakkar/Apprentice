vol i introduction have make a limited tour in the empire of morocco a few year since i be enable to appreciate the information impart to we by the lament richardson and be desirous of add a few observation of my own upon the present state of affair in that part of the african continent the follow work of the indefatigable traveller demand at the present moment a more than ordinary share of public attention in consequence of the momentous event now pass in the strait of gibraltar where the presence of powerful armament entail on the governor of we great rock-fortress a duty of some delicacy situate as he now be in close proximity to three belligerent power all of whom be at peace with great britain but distinguish alike for common sense and professional ability sir william codrington it be to be hope will steer clear of the folly commit by sir robert wilson in 1844 and will command respect for the british name without provoke bitter feeling between ourselves and we french and spanish neighbor it be scarcely possible that either france or spain can contemplate the conquest of the entire empire of morocco as the result of the present impending crisis the superficial extent of the territory be 219420 square mile and the population nearly 8000000 -lrb- 1 -rrb- of which a large proportion live in a state of perpetual warfare occupy inaccessible mountain fastness from whence they only descend to the plain for the sake of plunder the inhabitant may be classify as follow : 4000000 moor and arab 2000000 berber 500000 jew and the remainder be of the negro race the regular army consist of less than thirty thousand man but every arab be a expert irregular horseman and the berber make good foot-soldier these indeed be in ordinary time rarely to be depend on by the emperor but so powerful a incentive be religious fanaticism that be he to raise the standard of the holy war a large army would quickly rally around he deficient perhaps in discipline yet live by plunder and march without the encumbrance of baggage it would prove a formidable opponent let we however suppose that the present action of france and spain should result in the subversion of the atrocious system of government practice in morocco : a guarantee from the conqueror that we exist commercial privilege should be respect would alone be require to ensure the protection of we interest and what a extended field would the facility for penetrate into the interior open to we we must also remember that napoleon iii in heart be a free-trader and should destiny ever appoint he the arbiter of morocco the protectionist pressure of a certain deluded class in france would be impotent against he policy in western barbary a country perhaps more hostile to the european than china sailor and other who have have the misfortune to be cast on the inhospitable shore of northern africa have be send far inland into slavery to drag out a miserable existence and at this moment there be many white christian slave in the southern and eastern province of the empire should the war not result in conquest the least we have a right to expect be that toleration should be force upon the moor and that european capital and labor should be allow a free development throughout they empire a flourish trade would soon spring up nature have bless barbary with a excellent soil and climate besides vast mineral wealth in its mountain lead copper and antimony be find in they the plain produce corn rice and indigo the forest of cedar ilex cork and olive-tree be scatter over a vast extent and contain antelope wild bear and other species of game barbary also possess a excellent breed of horse the principal manufacture be leather shawl and carpet england have but a short time since succeed in emancipate she jewish brethren from they few remain disability a opportunity may now be at hand of ameliorate the condition of those in the empire of morocco who be force to submit to a grind persecution and be merely tolerate because they be useful they supply many want of the moorish population be the best and in many handicraft the only artificer and be much employ by the government in financial occupation they be compel to occupy a distinct quarter of the town they inhabit be permit only to wear black garment be forbid to ride the horse be consider too noble a animal to carry a jew and be force to take off they shoe on pass a mosque even the little moorish boy strike and ill-treat they in various way and the slightest attempt at retaliation be formerly punish with death and would now be visit with the bastinado they be more heavily tax than any other class and special contribution be often levy on they alas why should we respect the national existence of any community of mahometan have we efface from we memory they treachery and inhuman cruelty in indium they utter worthlessness in turkey they neglect in take advantage of the richness with which nature have bless the country in they possession and they conquest from christendom of one of the fairest portion of europe civilization cry aloud for retribution on a race whose religion teach they to regard we as dog surely far from protect and cherish we should hunt they out of the fair land they occupy and force they back on the desert which vomit they forth on we ancestor ten century ago brief period of glory at bagdad cairo and granada should not protect those who be now slave to the lowest vice that degrade human nature no administrative reform be at all practicable they moral malady have attack the vital element the sole cure be conquest and the substitution of christian government in northern africa and turkey in europe and asia russium france austrium greece and spain be weary of the excess of they savage neighbor none can be honestly incline to stay they avenge sword i have in these prefatory remark extract a few particulars from the short chapter on morocco contain in my work on the french in africa and in advocate a crusade against the mahometan race i believe i be record the sentiment of million of european it now only remain for I to give expression to that universal feeling of regret which prevail among my countryman at the untimely fate of poor richardson and to offer my congratulation that he have bequeath to we so please a addition to he former work as the follow narrative of he travels in morocco l trent cave frg author of the french in africa army and navy club November 1859 preface the present unsettled state of affair in morocco in consequence of the war in which she be now engage with she more powerful and ancient enemy -- spain must i conceive render any information regard a region so little known peculiarly acceptable at the present moment in morocco my late husband labor to advance the same object which have previously take he to central africa viz the amelioration of the condition of the strange and remarkable race of man who inhabit that part of the world he aim at the introduction of a legitimate commerce with a view in the first instance to destroy the horrible and revolting trade in slave and thus pave the way for the diffusion of christianity among a benighted people while travel with these high purpose in contemplation he neglect no opportunity of study the geography of the country and of obtain a insight into the manners custom prejudice and sentiment of its inhabitant as well as any other useful information in relation to it i accompany he on he travels in algier tuni and tripolus in which last city he leave I it not be consider advisable that i should proceed with he into the interior of the country we be not destine to meet again in this world my beloved husband die at bornou in central africa whither he be send by she majesty 's government to enter into treaty with the chief of the surround district of the many difficulty and danger which the traveller be likely to encounter in penetrate into the interior of so inhospitable a region the reader may form some idea by a perusal of the the follow extract from my husband 's writings i be very much of opinion that in african travel we should take especial care not to attempt too much at once that we should proceed very slowly feel we way secure ourselves against surprise and reduce and confine we exploration to the record of matter of fact as far as possible or consistently with a due illustration of the narrative but whether we attempt great tour or short journeying we shall soon find by we own sad experience that african travel can only be successfully prosecute piecemeal bite by bit here a little and there a little now a island now a line of coast now a inland province now a patch of desert and slow and painful in all they result whilst few explorer will ever be able to undertake more than two at most three inland journey failure disaster and misadventure may attend we effort of discovery the intrepid explorer may perish as they have so frequently do or be scalp by the indian savage in the american wilderness or stab by the treacherous bedouin of asiatic desert or be stretch stiff in the icy dreary polar circle or succumb to the burning clime of africa leave they bone to bleach upon its arid sandy waste yet these victim of enterprise will add more to a nation 's glory than its hoard heap of gold or the great gain of its commerce or even the valor of its arm nevertheless geographical discovery be not barren ardor or waste enthusiasm it produce substantial fruit the fair port of london with its two parallel forest of mast bear witness to the rich and untold treasure which result from the traffic of we merchant-fleet with the isle and continent discover by the genius and enterprise of the maritime or inland explorer and finally we have always in view the complete regeneration of the world by we law we learning and we religion if every valley be to be raise and every mountain lay low by the spade and axe of industry guide by science the valley or the mountain must first be discover if man be to be civilized they must first be find and if other or the remain tribe of the inhabitable earth be to acknowledge the true god and accept he favor as know to we they also with ourselves must have a opportunity of hear he name pronounce and he will declare my husband would indeed have rejoice have he live to witness the active step now take by oxford and cambridge for send out missionary to central africa to spread the light of the gospel among he unpublished letter i find one address to the christian church entitle project for the establishment of a christian mission at bornou dated October 1849 he write : the christian church have leave central africa now these twelve century in the hand of the mohammedan who in different country have successfully propagate the false doctrine of the impostor of mecca if the christian church wish to vindicate the honor of they religion -- to diffuse its beneficent and heavenly doctrine -- and to remove from themselves the severe censure of have abandon central africa to the false prophet i believe there be now a open _ viâ _ bornou to attempt the establishment of they faith in the heart of africa he end he paper by quote the word of ignatius pallme a bohemian the writer of travels in kordofan who say it be high time for the missionary society in europe to direct they attention to this part of africa -lrb- that be kordofan -rrb- if they delay much longer it will be too late for when the negro have once adopt the koran no power on earth can induce they to change they opinion i have hear through several authentic source that there be few province in the interior of africa where mohammedanism have not already begin to gain a footing it would be a great solace to I should this work be receive favourably and be deem to reflect honor on the memory of my lament husband and in the hope that such may be the case i

exclusion of stranger to look upon all stranger with distrust and suspicion and should they at any time attempt to explore the interior of morocco or any of the adjacent county to thwart and circumvent they enterprise be a veritable feat of statesmanship in the opinion of the shereefian court the assassination of mr davidson some year since be a odious and enduring stigma on the moorish court notwithstanding the various effort which have be make to deny the personal responsibility of the emperor in that transaction the prince de joinville be once go to open morocco as we open china but bullet and shot which he royal highness shower upon tangier and mogador only close faster the approach and route of this well-guarded empire -- only more hermetically seal the capital of fez and morocco against the prying or morbid curiosity of the tourist or the mapping and measuring of the political spy the striking anecdote illustrate the exclusive policy of the maroquine court be familiar to all who have read the history of the moorish sultan of the mugreb year ago a european squadron threaten to bombard tangier unless they demand be instantly satisfied and the then reign sultan send down from fez this imperial message : how much will the enemy give I if i myself burn to ash my well-beloved city of tangier tell the enemy o governor of the mighty city of tangier that i can reduce this self-same city to a heap of smoking ruin at a much cheaper rate than he can with all he ship he warlike machine and he fight man the strength of morocco lie in she internal city she inland population and the natural difficulty of she territory about she coast she care little but the french do not find this out till after they bombardment the unwonted discovery lead they afterwards to boast that they have at length open morocco by the other and opposite system of a pacific mission the party form the mission pretend to have obtain from the emperor permission for european to travel in morocco without let or hindrance whithersoever they will but the opposition press justly ridicule the pretension of the alleged concession as the precarious and barren result of a mission cost several million of franc even a englishman but much more a frenchman -- and the latter be especially hate and dread in all the maroquine province would have considerably hesitate in place confidence in the safe conduct of this jealous court the spirit of the christian west which have invade the most secret council of the eastern world persium turkey and all the country subject to ottoman rule be still exclude by the haughty shereef of the mahometan west there be scarcely any communication between the port and the court of the shereef and the two grand master of orthodox islamism this of the west and that of the east be nearly stranger to each other all that muley errahman have to do with the east appear to be to procure eunuch and abyssinian concubine for he harem from egypt and send forward he most faithful or most rebellious subject -lrb- 2 -rrb- on they pilgrimage to mecca englishman be surprise that the frequent visit and uninterrupted communication between morocco and gibraltar during so long a period should have produce scarcely a perceptible change in the mind of the moor and that western barbary should be a century behind tuni this circumstance certainly do not arise from any inherent inaptitude in the moorish character to entertain friendly relation with european and can only have result from that crouching and subservient policy which the gibraltar authority have always judge it expedient to show towards the maroquine we diplomatic intercourse begin with morocco in the reign of queen elizabeth and though on friendly term more or less ever since englishman have not yet obtain a recognize permission to travel in the interior of the country without first specially apply to its government we own countryman know little of morocco or of its inhabitant custom law and government and though only five or six day sail from england it must be regard as a unknown and unexplored region to the mass of the english nation nevertheless in spite of the maroquine empire be the most conservative and unchangeable of all north african mussulman state and whilst happily for itself it have be allow to pursue its course obscurely and noiselessly without exciting particular attention in europe or be involve in the war and commotion of european nation morocco be not therefore beyond the reach of change and the ravages of time nor exempt from that mutability which be impressed upon all sublunary state the bombardment of tangier and mogador have leave behind they trace not easily to be efface it be no ordinary event for morocco to carry on hostility with a european power the battle of isly have deeply wound the shereefian and incite the mussulman heart to sullen and unquenchable revenge a change have come over the maroquine mind which as to its immediate effect be evidently for the worst towards we christian the distrust of all european which exist before the french hostility be now enlarged to hatred a feeling from which even the english be hardly except up to the last moment the government and people of morocco believe that england would never abandon they to they unscrupulous and ambitious neighbor the citizen and merchant of mogador could not be bring to believe or even to entertain the idea that the british ship of war would quietly look on whilst the french -- the great rival and enemy of the english -- destroy they town and battery most manifest fact and stern reality dissipate in a hour when they little think of it such a fond delusion from that moment the moral influence of england once we boast and not perhaps unreasonably so be no longer feel in morocco and now we have lose almost all hold on the good wish and faith of the mussulman tribe of that immense country as to explore the empire of morocco or make it the way of communication with soudan or central negroland this be now altogether impracticable the difficulty of european travel the maroquine state always great and perilous be now become nearly insuperable this suspicious distrust or ill-feeling have communicate itself contagiously to the tribe of the south as far as the desert and have infect other part of barbary the engleez once the cherish friend of the moor be look upon more or less as the abettor of french aggression in north africa if not as the sharer with they of the spoil in the language of the more plain-spoken moor we always think all christian alike though we often except the english from the number of we enemy now we be certain we be wrong the english be become as much we enemy as the french and the spaniard the future alone can disclose what will be the particular result of this unfavourable feeling both with respect to france and england and to other european nation however we may look forward without misgive islamism will wear itself out -- the crescent must wane in these preliminary observation the commercial system of the maroquine court deserve especial mention the great object of muley abd errahman -lrb- 3 -rrb- be -- nay the pursuit of he whole life have be -- to get the whole of the trade of the empire into he own hand in fact he have by this time virtually succeed though the thing be less ostentatiously do than by the egyptian viceroy that equally celebrate prince-merchant in order to effect this he shereefian majesty seek to involve in debt all the merchant native or foreigner tempting they by the offer of profuse credit as many of they as be needy and speculative this imperial boon be without scruple greedily accept the emperor likewise provide they with commodious house and store give they at once ten or twenty thousand dollar worth of credit and be content to receive in return monthly instalment these instalment never be never can be regularly pay up the debt progressively and indefinitely increase and whilst they live like so many merchant-prince carry on a immense trade they be in reality beggar and slave of the emperor they be however style _ imperial _ merchant and wear they golden chain with ostentatious pride this credit cost he shereetian highness nothing he give no goods advance no money whilst he most effectually impoverish and reduce to servitude the foreign merchant resident in he empire never allow he to visit he native country without the guarantee of leave he wife and family behind as hostage for he return the native merchant be in all case absolutely at the mercy of he imperial lord on the bombardment of mogador all the native and resident trader not except the english merchant be find overwhelm with debt and therefore be not allow to leave the country and they be only save from the pillage and massacre of the ferocious berber tribe by a miracle of good luck since the bombardment of mogador the emperor have more strongly than ever set he face against the establishment of stranger in he dominion now he imperial highness be anxious that all commerce should be transact by he own subject the emperor 's jew be in future to be the principal medium of commerce between morocco and europe which indeed be facilitate by many of the native jew have direct relation with european jew those of london and marseille in this way the maroquine will be relieve from the embarrassment occasion by the presence of european jew or christian under the protection of foreign consul the emperor also have a fair share of trade and get a good return on what he export the balance of commercial transaction be always in he favor i must add a word on the way of treat politically with the court of morocco the mode and maxim of this court not unlike those of the chinese be procrastination plausible delay and voluminous despatch and communication which be carry on through the hand of intermediary and subordinate agent of every rank and degree you can never communicate directly with the emperor as with other barbary prince and pasha this system have admirably and invariably succeed for the last two or three century that be to say the empire of morocco have remain intact by foreign influence while its system of commerce have be a exclusive native monopoly the american however have endeavor to adopt a more expeditious mode of treat with the maroquine court they have something in the style and spirit of lynch law usually make they own demand and they own term by threaten the immediate withdrawal of they consul or the bombardment of port the shereef thus intimidate have yield though with a very bad grace nevertheless the american have receive no favor nor have they obtain a nearer approach to the awful shereefian presence than other people and it be not likely they ever will succeed beyond they neighbor the french and english have always negotiate and correspond correspond and negotiate and be worst once and worst again somehow or other the emperor have in most case have he own way neither the american nor we own european system be the right or dignified course and i be still of opinion that the maroquine court be so far enlighten respect the actual state of the barbarian or christian infidel out of its shereefian land of marabout out of its central orthodox mussulman land of the mugreb as to be accessible to ordinary notion of thing and that it would always concede a just demand if it be rightly and vigorously press and if the religious fanaticism of its people be not involve in the transaction thus far we may do justice to the government of these moorish prince this opinion however do not altogether coincide with that of the late mr hay accord to the report of mr borrow as find in he work the bible of spain the moorish government accord to mr hay be one of the vilest description with which it be next to impossible to hold amicable relation as it invariably act with bad faith and set at nought the most solemn treaty but if the maroquine court have act in this most extraordinary manner surely there would now be no moorish empire of western barbary chapter ii

other i have wait many day at gib -lrb- as we captain call the former place -rrb- before the wind enable we to leave and then we boat be a small transport for cattle and the government contractor want beef for the garrison -- for a englishman or a english soldier can not live in any part of the world without beef -- we be compel to leave with the wind in we tooth and to make a night 's voyage of this four or five hour ' traverse it might be worth while one would think to try a small steam-tug for the conveyance of cattle from tangier to we garrison which besides would be a great convenience for passenger on come on deck in the morning tangier the city protect of the lord appear in all its north african lineament white and bright shine square mass of masonry dome of fair and modest santo and the heaven-pointing minaret here and there a graceful palm a dark olive or the black bushy kharoub and all den sharply and clearly in the goodly prospect but these barbary town have lose much of they freshness or novelty to I and novelty be the greatest ingredient of we pleasure in foreign travel i have also just travel through spain and the south of this country be still as to its aspect

the threshold of the noble remains of moresco-spanish antiquity for the _ diligencium _ be start off to seville to return from my digression i soon find myself at home in tangier amongst my old friend the moor and come from spain could easily recognize many thing connect the one country with the other the success attend the various measure of the bey of tuni for the abolition of slavery in north africa and the favourable manner in which this prince have receive I when i have charge of a memorial from the inhabitant of malta to congratulate he highness on he great work on philanthropy induce the committee of the anti-slavery society to confide to I a address to the emperor of morocco pray he to enfranchise the negro race of he imperial dominion we be fully prepare to encounter the strongest opposition from the shereefian court but at the same time we think there could be no insuperable obstacle in we way the maroquine have the same religion and form of government as the tuniseen and by perseverance in this as well as any other enterprise something might at last be effect even the agitation of the question in the empire of morocco amongst its various tribe be a thing not to be neglect for the agitation of public opinion in a despotic country like morocco as well as in a constitutional state like england admirably prepare the way for great measure of reform and philanthropy and besides the business of a abolitionnist be agitation agitation unceasing agitation in season and out of season on my arrival at tangier i call upon mr drummond hay the british consul-general state to he my object and ask he assistance the english government have instruct the consul to address the emperor on this interesting subject not long before i arrive but it be with the greatest difficulty that any sort of answer could be obtain to the communication mr hay therefore give I but small encouragement and be not a little surprised when i tell he i expect a letter of introduction from she majesty 's government he could not understand this reiterate assault on the shereef for the abolition of slavery not comprehend the absolute necessity of continued agitation on such a difficult matter as exciting from a despotic and semi-barbarous prince fortify by the prejudice of age and generally sanction in he conduct by he religion the emancipation of a degraded and enslaved portion of the human race -lrb- 7 -rrb- however mr hay be polite and set about arrange matter for proceed with a confessedly disagreeable subject for any consul to handle under like circumstance he make a copy of the address of the anti-slavery society and send it to the english government request instruction i expect a address from the institut d'afrique of pari but after wait some time the secretary mr hippolyte de st anthoine write I a letter in which he state that on account of the ill-will manifest by the emperor to the establishment of the french in algerium the institut have come to the painful conclusion of not address he for the abolition of the slave-trade in he imperial state soon after my arrival at tangier the english letter-boat carreo ingle master matteo attalya bring twelve eunuch slave african youth from gibraltar they be a present from the viceroy of egypt to the emperor of morocco the correo be the weekly bearer of letter and despatch to and from morocco the slave be not enter upon the bill of health thus infringe upon the maritime law of gibraltar and tangier the other captain of the little boat could not help remark you english make so much fuss about put down the slave-trade and allow it to be carry on under you own flag even the foreign consul here reprobate the inconsistency of the british government in aid the slave-trade of the mediterranean by they own flag however government order a strict inquiry into this case and take means for prevent the occurrence of a like abuse nevertheless since then the emperor have actually apply to the british consul to allow eunuch to be bring down the mediterranean in english steamer in the same way as these be bring from malta to gibraltar in the prometheus -- as forsooth servant and passenger and on the refusal of we consul to sanction this illicit conveyance of slave by british vessel the emperor apply to the french consul who condescend to hoist the tri-coloured flag for the transport of slave-eunuch this be one way of mitigate the prejudice of the shereefian court against the french occupation of algerium many slave be carry up and down the mediterranean in french vessel the keeper of a hotel related to I with great bitterness that the french officer who come with I from gibraltar have leave tetuan for algerium the officer have order a great many thing of this man promise to pay on he return to tangier he deposit a old hatbox as a security which on be open by the hotel keeper be find to be full of greasy paper at tetuan the officer give himself out as a special envoy of the emperor of the french my good friend the moor continue to speculate upon the progress of the french army in algerium i ask a moorish officer what he think of the rumor french invasion of morocco he put the back of he hand together and lock together he finger to represent the back of a hedgehog he observe emphatically impossible no christian can invade we we country be like a hedgehog no one can touch we tangier christian will never permit the french to invade morocco whatever may be the pretext this be even the opinion of the foreign consul as a specimen of the commercial system of this country i may mention that the monopoly of export leech be sell this week to a jew at the rate of 25000 dollar now the jew refuse to buy leech except at he own price whilst every unfortunate trader be oblige to sell to he and to he only in fact the monopolist fix the price and everybody who bring leech to tangier must accept it this case of leech may be apply to nearly all the monopoly of the country can anything be more ruinous to commerce all the moor of tangier immediately on enter into conversation with I inquire if i be engleez even moorish child ask this question : it appear to

be conclude down run a butcher with a sheep on he back just slaughter and bleed profusely a troop of boy follow quickly at he heel pelt he with stone the butcher run through the town to the seashore and thence to the house of the kady -- the boy still in hot and breathless pursuit hard after he pelt he and the bleeding sheep the moor believe if the man can arrive at the house of the judge before the sheep die that the people of tangier will have good luck but if the sheep should be quite dead and not move a muscle then it will bring they bad luck and the christian be likely to come and take away they country from they the drollest part of the ceremony be that the boy should scamper after the butcher pelt the sheep and try to kill it outright thus endeavor to bring ill-luck upon they city and themselves but how many of we really and knowingly seek we misfortune on the occasion of this annual feast every moor or head of a family kill a sheep the rich give to the poor but the poor usually save up they earnings to be able to purchase a sheep to kill on this day the street be in different part cover with blood make they look like so many slaughter grounds when the bashaw of the province be in tangier thousand of the neighbouring arab come to pay he they respects with the moor the festival of religion be bonâ fide festival it may also be add as characteristic of these north african barbarian that whilst many a poor person in we merry christian england do not and can not get he plum-pudding and roast-beef at christmas there be not a poor man or even a slave in morocco who do not eat he lamb on this great feast of the mussulman it would be a mortal sin for a rich man to refuse a poor man a mouthful of he lamb of course there be a sensation among the native population and even among the consular corps about my mission but i have nothing very particular to record i have many moorish visitor some of whom be officer of the imperial troops i make the acquaintance of one sidus alus with whom i have the follow dialogue : -- traveller -- sidus alus what can i do to impress muley abd errahman in my favor sidus alus -- money traveller -- but will the emir of the shereef accept of money from we christian sidi alus -- money traveller -- what be i to give the minister ben dri to get he favor sidus alus -- money traveller -- can i travel in safety in morocco sidus alus -- money : indeed money seem to be the all and everything in morocco as among we the nation of shopkeeper the emperor himself set the example for he be wholly occupy in amass treasure in mequiney another acquaintance of mine be a little more communicative aged moor -- what can i do for you stranger you be good to I every time i call here you give I tea with plenty of sugar in it what can i do for you in my country traveller -- tell I how to get on in my mission how can i see muley errahman aged moor -- now i be bind to give you my best advice first then take plenty of money with you all love money therefore without money you can do nothing muley abd errahman love money and money he must have and the minister love money and the minister must not be forget the minister be the door to the emperor you can not get into the house but through the door out of the town and city the emperor have no power so that whenever you travel out of these place remember to give the people money i have numberless volunteer to conduct I to fez all come beg for this honor and lucrative employment whatever may be say of the virtue of hospitality i find all the world alike in its determination to make the most of stranger if not to devour they but the emperor be not at fez he be in the southern capital and it be necessary for I to go via mogador to endeavor to obtain a interview with he at that place the dreary monotony of moorish life be one day break in upon by a juvenile stroll singer who attract a crowd of silent and attentive listener it be a grateful sight to see old man with long and silvery beard recline in mute and serious attention young man lounge in the pride and consciousness of animal strength little child intermix but without prattle or merriment -- all fix and fascinate with the charm of vocal song the vocalist himself be a picturesque object he face be burnt black with afric 's sun he bare head be wildly cover with long black matted and curly hair but he eye be soft and serene and as he stretch he throat upward to give compass to he voice he seem as if he would catch inspiration from the prophet in heaven a coarse brown blanket envelop he spare and way-worn body he only clothing and shelter from the heat by day and the cold by night a fold of which fall upon he naked foot the voice of the arab vocalist be extremely plaintive even to the tone and inflection of distress and the burden of he song be of religion and of love -- two sentiment which all pure mind delight to combine when he stop a moment to take breath a murmur of applause vibrate through the still air of the evening not indeed for the youth but for god -lrb- 8 -rrb- for it be a prayer of the artless and enraptured bystander invoke allah to bless the singing lad and also to bless they while ascribe all praise to the deity this devout scene raise the moor greatly in my estimation i think man could not be barbarian or even a jealous or vindictive race who be charm with such simple melody of sound and with sentiment so pure and true to nature the arab youth sing : -- oh there be none but the one god i 'll journey over the desert far to seek my love the fairest of maiden the camel moan loudly to carry I thither gainly be they and fleeter than the swift-legged ostrich oh there be none but the one god what though the desert wind slay I what of it death be from god and woe to I i can not repine but i 'll away to the abode of my love i 'll embrace she with all my strength i 'll bear she back thence and rest she on my couch oh there be none but the one god so sing in plaintive accent the youth until the last ray of the sun linger on the minaret ' top when by the louder and authoritative voice of the muezin call the faithful to prayer this crowd of the worshipper of song and vocal harmony be disperse to meet again and forthwith chant a more solemn strain the poor lad of the street and highway go into the mosque along with he motley group of admirer and all blended they voice and devotion together in prayer and adoration lowly and in profound prostration before the great allah it be my intention in the course of the present narrative to give a brief account of the principal town and city of north africa and i can not do better than begin with tangier this city be very ancient have probably be build by the aboriginal berber and be usually call by the roman taigo on tingi the emperor claudius re-people it and call it julium traducta the moor call it sanjah and relate that benhad sahab el-alem build it also surround it with wall of metal and construct its house of gold and silver in this condition it remain until destroy by some berber king who carry away all its treasure the modern tangier be a small city of the province of hasbat picturesquely place on the eastern slope of a hill which terminate in the west with its port and bay have some analogy to the site of algier it have almost a square form and its rampart be a wall flank here and there with tower this place likewise be most advantageously situate in the narrowest part of the strait of gibraltar at a few mile east of cape spartel and thirty mile wsw of gibraltar and have therefore be covet by all the conqueror of north africa the phoenician roman goth and arab successively effect its conquest and it be long a bone of eager contention between the moor and portuguese in 1471 alonzo king of portugal take it from the moor and in 1662 it come into the hand of the english as a part of the dowry of catherine queen of charle ii so whilst in we possession it be a place of considerable strength but on its evacuation in 1684 by order of the english government who be disgust by the expense of its occupation and the bootless collision with the native the fortification be demolish and only the vestige of they now be visible have the british government continue its occupation for half a century and keep in check the maroquine tribe it be probable that by this time the greater part of morocco would have be under british rule when we might have found a flourishing colony from which all north africa might have receive the element of christian civilization old tangier -lrb- tangier belium -rrb- be situate about four mile east from the present be now a heap of ruin near a little river call khalk or tingium span over by the remains of a once finely-built roman bridge here be likewise a artificial port where the roman galley retire the whole of this part of africa be denominate by the roman mauritanium from the name of this city and during they administration be unite to the government of spain tangier have a population of from four to six thousand grabert estimate the population at 10000 include 2500 jew who live intermix with the moor 1400 negro 300 berber of rif and about 100 christian the consuls-general of the european power reside here and most of they have commodious house the swedish consul have a splendid garden which be throw open to the european resident there be but one good street in the town and the transition from europe to barbary at so short a distance be strike to the stranger tarifa on the opposite side along the coast of spain have however a moorish affinity to this place and the dress of the woman be not very dissimilar in the two town once inhabit by the people of the same religion and now perhaps many of they descendant of the same family tangier though a miserable place compare to most of the city in europe be something considerable in morocco and the great mosque be rather splendid mr borrow justly remark that its minaret look like the offspring of the celebrated giralda of seville the christian have here a convent and a church within it to which be attach half-a-dozen monk there be no protestant church mr hay read service in the british consulate and invite the protestant resident tangier be the only place in the empire where the christian religion be publicly profess the jew have three or four small synagogue usually the synagogue in barbary be nothing more than private house before the bombardment of the french the fortification mount forty piece or so of cannon but of no strength on the contrary go completely to ruin and decay be scarcely strong enough to fire a salute from the bay of tangier be good and spacious but in the course of time will be fill up with sand the shipping be expose to strong westerly wind the safest anchorage however be on the the eastern part about half a mile off the shore in a line with the round tower with a few thousand pound one of the finest -- at least one of the most convenient -- port of the mediterranean could be construct here there be a bashaw of this province who reside at el-araish and a lieutenant-governor who live at tangier with these functionary the representative of european power have principally to transact affair on the north be the castle the residence of the governor eleven consul take up they abode in tangier the british french spanish portuguese american danish swedish sardinian neapolitan austrian and dutch each consular house generally belong to its particular nation the ground to the sultan the consul who have the most interest to guard in morocco be the british french spanish and portuguese up to the bombardment of tangier the danish and swedish government pay to the maroquine court the former 25000 and the latter 20000 dollar per annum to have the privilege of hoist they flag at this port the french hostility against morocco furnish a convenient opportunity for get this odious tribute abolish the american lead the way in get rid of this subservience to the shereefian court and refuse from the first all present and annual donation generally however when new consul be appoint they bring with they present and visit the emperor in person on the occasion of _ fêtes _ they sometimes make present to the governor of district whenever the emperor condescend to come down to tangier three day after he arrival it be the require etiquette for the consul to seek he presence and to make they obeisance to the shereefian lord the consul be accustom to decide upon and control the affair of they own countryman and those place under they protection but when a moor and a european be concern in a transaction it be usually a mixed commission of the consulate and the moorish authority many curious anecdote be current respect the consul and the moorish government a spanish consul once take it into he head to strike he flag and leave tangier whilst he be go the emperor order all the jew to go and take possession of he house and live in it as a degradation the consular house be soon cram with dirty jew whose vermin and filth render the house untenantable until it have undergo a thorough repair and cleanse sometimes the emperor show a great affection for a particular consular family the family of the portuguese consul be great favorite during the war of succession in portugal the portuguese consul contract debt in tangier not be able to get he salary amidst the strife of party the moor complain to the emperor of the consul 's debt muley abd errahman though a thorough miser himself pay the consul 's debt allege as a reason the consul be a friend of my ancestor and he shall be my friend the portuguese government wish to remove this consul on account of he alleged miguelite propensity but the emperor threaten if they do that he would not receive another we government compel the portuguese to gratify the personal feeling of the emperor senhor colaso be a native of morocco as he father be before he and the emperor call they he own child the jewish servant of the consulate be free from the poll-tax and other obnoxious contribution and they moorish servant be also exempt from government conscription at time very serious misunderstanding and dispute occur between the consul and the emperor on the subject of he imperial highness we consul mr hay be shoot at by a fanatic marabout the ball miss he but kill a horse of one of the party this affair be pass over the consul very properly take no notice of a mad saint but i will cite another instance as show the intimate perception which the moor have of the peculiar precept of we religion as well as exhibit they own moral idea in each case represent they to we in a favourable light one of the emperor 's subject have insult the french consul m sourdeau and muley suleiman address to he the follow singular epistle in the name of god the most merciful there be no power or force except with the most high and great god consul of the french nation sourdeau and salutation to he who be in the right way inasmuch as you be we guest under we protection and consul in we country of a great nation so we can not but wish you the greatest consideration and the honor on which account you will perceive that that which have happen to you be to we intolerable and would still be so have it be do by one of we own child or most intimate friend and although we can not put any obstacle to the decree of god yet such a act be not grateful to we even if it be do to the vilest of man or even cattle and certainly we will not fail to show a example of severe justice god willing if you be not christian have a feeling heart and bearing patiently injury after the example of you prophet whom god have in glory jesus the son of mary who in the book which he bring you in the name of god command you that if any person strike you on one cheek turn to he the other also and who -lrb- always bless of god -rrb- also do not defend himself when the jew seek to kill he from whom god take he and in we book it be say by the mouth of we prophet there be no people among whom there be so many dispose to good work as those who call themselves christian and certainly among you there be many priest and holy man who be not proud nevertheless we prophet also say that we can not impute a crime to person of three sort that be to say madman -lrb- until they return to sound sense -rrb- child and person who sleep now this man who have offend you be mad and have no knowledge but we have decree to give you full satisfaction if however you should be please to pardon he you will perform a magnanimous work and the most merciful will abundantly recompense you on the other hand if you absolutely wish he to be punish he be in you hand for in my empire no one shall fear injustice or violence with the assistance of god a whimsical story be current in tangier respect the dealings of the shereefian court with the neapolitan government which characteristically set forth moorish diplomacy or manoeuvring a ship load of sulphur be send to the emperor the moorish authority declare it be very coarse and mixed with dirt with great alacrity the neapolitan government send another load of finer and better quality this be deliver and the consul ask the moorish functionary to allow the coarse sulphur to be convey back these worthy reply oh dear no it be of no consequence the emperor say he will keep the bad and not offend he royal cousin the king of naple by send it back the neapolitan government have no alternative but to submit and thank the chief of the shereef for he extreme condescension in accept two ship-load of sulphur instead of one there be occasional communication between tangier and tarifa in spain but they be very frequent with gibraltar a vast quantity of european merchandize be import here from gibraltar for fez and the north of morocco all the postal and despatch business also come through tangier which have privilege that few or no other maroquine city possess the emperor indeed have be wont to call it the city of christian in the environs there be at time a good deal of game and the european resident go out to shoot as one be wont in other country to talk a walk the principal game be the partridge and hare and the grand sport the wild boar we officer of the gibraltar garrison come over for shooting but quackery and humbug exist in everything a young gentleman have just arrive from gibraltar who have be previously six week on he passage from holland to that place with he leg infix in a pair of three-league boot he say he have come from holland on purpose to sport and hunt in morocco several of the consul when they go out sport metamorphose themselves into veteran numidian sportsman you would imagine they be go to hunt lion for month in the ravine of the atla whereas it be only to shoot a stray partridge or a limp hare or perchance they may meet with a boar and this they do for a couple of day or twenty-four hour sleep during the night very snugly under tent and fed and feast with milk fowl and sheep by the arab morocco like all despotic country furnish some severe example of the degrading of high functionary there be a old man sidi-el-arby-es-said living there who be a marked victim of imperial tyranny some year ago the conqueror despoil he of all he wealth and throw he into prison after he have be twenty year bashaw of this district he be in prison one year with he two son the object of the emperor be to extort the last filse of he money and he entirely succeed the oppressor however relent a little on the death of one of he victim 's son release he from confinement and give the ex-bashaw two house one for himself and the other for he survive son the old captain of the port have be no less than a dozen time in prison under the exhausting pressure of the emperor after the imperial miser have copiously bleed he captain he let he out to fill he skin again the old gentleman be always merry and loyal in spite of the treatment from he imperial taskmaster very funny story be tell by the master of the small craft who transport the bullock from hence to gibraltar the government of that place be only allow to export at a low duty per annum a certain number of bullock the contractor 's agent come over and at the moment of embark the cattle something like the follow dialogue frequently ensue _ agent of contractor _ -- count away _ captain of the port _ -- one two three & c thirty forty ah stop stop too many _ agent of contractor _ -- no you fool there be only thirty _ captain of the port _ -- you lie there be forty _ agent of contractor _ -- only thirty i tell you -lrb- put three or four dollar into he hand -rrb- _ captain of the port _ -- well well there be only thirty and in this way the garrison of gibraltar often get 500 or 1000 head of cattle more than the stipulate number at five dollar per head duty instead of ten who derive the benefit of peculation i be unable to state a anecdote recur to I of old youssef bashaw of tripolus illustrative of the phlebotomize system now under consideration colonel warrington one day seriously represent to the bashaw how he functionary rob he and take the liberty of mention the name of one person yes yes observe the bashaw i know all about he i do not want to catch he yet he be not fat enough when he have gorge a little more i 'll have he head off the emperor of morocco however usually treat he bashaw of the coast with greater consideration than those of the interior city the former be more in contact with european he highness not wish he reputation to suffer in the eye of christian chapter iii the posada -- ingle

visit by moor and jew each invest the depart saint with he own peculiar sanctity so contagious be this species of superstition that romish christian long resident in barbary assist by the inventive monk at last discover the moorish or jewish to be a christian saint the jewess bring we oriental rabbi declare he to know everything and that he garment smell of the holy city benoliel or ben as the english call he protest to I that he do not believe in charm he only allow the rabbi to write they to please the woman but i have find during my travels in the mediterranean many person of education who pretend they do not believe this or that superstition of they church whilst they be at heart great coward have no courage to reject a popular falsehood and quite as superstitious as those who never doubt the excrescent dogma or traditionary fable of they religion the paper amulet however operate favourably on mr benoliel she be deliver of a fine child and receive the congratulation of she

custom-house to grant they they clearance-papers because they be early on the Sunday follow to depart for gibraltar the governor say come to-morrow no reply the jews we can not it be we feast well return the governor you jew have you feast the christian have theirs and we mussulman will have ours i 'll not go down to the custom-house to day for it be my feast these three sunday or feast prevalent through north africa be very inconvenient for business and often make man rebel to they religious persuasion the following be a frenchman 's account of morocco -lrb- 10 -rrb- up to the time of its bombardment the question of algerium can not be confine within the limit of the french possession it embrace morocco a country possess a vast and varied population leo give a marvellous description of fez as the second city of islamism in he time traveller who have seek to explore africa rarely or never take the route viâ morocco formerly monk be station in the interior to purchase captive but since piracy have cease these have leave the country very few person go into the interior for maroquine merchant come out of they country to trade tangier and tetuan be not fair specimen of morocco they form a transition from europe to africa be neither spain nor morocco the ambassador or merchant who now-a-days get a audience with the sultan be allow to see little of the country arise from the jealousy of the government or native merchant davidson be probably murder by the jealousy of the fez merchant all the larger city of morocco be situate upon the coast except three capital of the interior -- fez mikna and morocco to which el-kesar-kebir may be add the other interior place be mostly large village where the tribe of the country collect together the inhabitant of the city make gain they only business and debauchery they only pleasure as to they learning there be a immense difference between a turkish ulema and a moorish doctor from the fall of carthage and rome until the fourteenth century the people of north africa have have relation with europe the independence of the kingdom of fez and morocco fall by internal dissension like the mussulman power in spain after expel the mahometan from spain the christian -lrb- spaniard and portuguese -rrb- pursue they to morocco and build a line of fort on its coast those have all now be abandon except four hold by spain england destroy the fortification and abandon tangier which she have obtain through portugal to blockade tangier at the present time would do more harm to england than morocco by cut off the supply of provision for gibraltar the navy of morocco be never very great it be the audacity and cruelty of its pirate which frighten christendom during the maritime war of the seventeenth and eighteenth century the emperor of morocco remain neutral which be a great benefit to the christian belligerent power spain must be at peace with morocco she must either be a active friend or a enemy the policy of morocco in former time be so well manage that it make all the christian power pay a certain tribute to that country to insure themselves against the piracy of its cruiser the history of the diplomatic relation of europe with morocco present only a chronicle of shameful concession make by the european power to the moorish prince at the end of the eighteenth century the sultan of morocco declare that ` whoever be not he friend be he enemy ' or in other word that ` he would arm he cruiser against every flag which do not float upon a consular house at tangier ' muley abd errahman send he corsair to sea in 1828 to frighten the european power into treaty the plan succeed the first squabble be with austrium from 1830 or better to mark the period since the capture of algier the corsair and they depredation have cease the progress of france in africa have produce a profound impression in morocco but european power have not take they due advantage of this many humiliating act have be perform by different government england possess herself of all the commerce of importance since she have be establish at gibraltar on the whole coast of morocco there be only two mercantile establishment under the french flag french consular agent have no influence with the moorish government morocco and spain have shew themselves neighbor mutual assistance have often be give by morocco and spain in case of national distress particularly in season of famine the sultan of morocco survey from a distance the event of europe and endeavor to arrest they effect on he frontier the residence of the foreign consul be first at rabat then at tangier the object have constantly be to keep the consul as far as possible from he capital and the transaction of he interior in order that they may not see the continual revolt of he tribe and so discover the weakness and disunion of the empire communication between tangier and morocco require at least forty day a system shrewdly lay down by the sultan who be anxious to be as remote as possible from the consul and they influence the state of the army and navy and particularly of the munitions of war be very bad all the coast of morocco be difficult of access and the only two port which would have serve for a naval station be those which have be abandon viz the bay of santa cruz and the ancient mamora between el-araish and rabat the rest be only roadstead m rey thus sum up he observation upon european diplomacy direct towards morocco voluntary humbling of european nation always ready to pander to moorish rapacity even without reap any advantage for it and who submit themselves to be uselessly ransom as to the english they show suppleness and prudence and sacrifice national dignity to the prosperity of commerce the sultan be not backward in take advantage adroitly of a situation so favourable and almost unique such be the picture of the diplomatic relation we have sketch he describe the personal character and habit of the sultan muley abd errahman and give detail of the court a jew be the master-cook of the emperor he imperial highness always eat alone the sultan receive european merchant in a very friendly manner whilst he keep ambassador at a respectful distance a interview with a ambassador do not last more than ten minute the sultan reply in a phraseology which have not be vary for three century the title of the present vizier be not minister but sahab friend or companion the sultan have the soundest judgment of any man in he empire and great tact in the administration of affair he instruct himself by continual question he passion be avarice and he have convert the whole empire into a commercial firm for the accumulation of he gain muley tsmael leave a treasury of 100 million of ducat -lrb- 11 -rrb- and at the death of sidus mohamm this treasury be reduce to two million the constant occupation of muley abd errahmnan be to replenish the imperial treasury commerce which be neglect by he predecessor have all he attention the cruelty of the former sultan be exchange for the avarice of the present the history of these shereefian prince be a chain of unheard-of atrocity the present sultan keep not a single promise when he interest interfere m rey give we this flattering tableau as a social picture of morocco covetous governor be continually succeed one another they be ever eager of enjoy the advantage of they position they thirst for plunder be so much the more intense as they be not allow time to satisfy it so they prey on the people the inhabitant of town and of the country live in rag in miserable hovel what raiment what food mortality be dreadful the child be invalid and the woman especially in the country be condemn to do the work of beast of burden such be the picture of society i have quote these few passage from the mémoire of m rey because he be resident many year in tangier and he account of the country discover talent and intelligence but be of course color with a strong anti-english feeling mr hay write on the back of he mémoire -- all that be say in reference to great britain be false and malicious m rey 's opinion of the moor and the present governor be still more bitter and unjust i have a interview with el-martel-warabah government auctioneer of slave from whom i obtain detail respect the slave-trade in tangier and morocco generally there be no market for slave in tangier the poor creature be lead about the town as cattle particularly in the main street before the door of the principal merchant where they be usually dispose of no jew or christian be permit to buy or hold a slave in this country government possess many slave and people hire they out by the day from the authority the ordinary price of a good slave be eighty dollar boy at the age of nine or ten year sell the best female slave do hot fetch so much as male slave unless of extraordinary beauty slave be import from all the south the sultan levy no duty on the sale or import of slave when one run away from he master and take refuge with another the new master usually write to the former offering to buy he thus slave be often entice away they be

arab of algerium have formerly many slave the chief depôt of slave be morocco the southern capital ten thousand have be import during one year but the average number bring into morocco be perhaps not more than half that amount the maroquine moor before depart for any country under the british flag usually give liberty to they slave on they return however they sell they again as slave or get rid of they some way or other a slave once have taste of liberty can never again be fully reconcile to thraldom moor resident in gibraltar have frequently slave with they a few day ago a slave-boy resident in gibraltar wish to turn christian and be immediately send back to tangier and sell to another master european with whom i have converse in tangier assure I that slave be generally well treat and that case of cruelty be rare nevertheless they eagerly seek they freedom when a opportunity offer in 1833 a man of great power and influence in the gharb -lrb- province of morocco -rrb- name el-haj mohammed ben el-arab on a remonstrance of he slave who state that the english have abolish slavery and that they ought to have they liberty call all he slave together to the number of seventy-two and actually take the bold and generous resolution of liberating they but before release they from bondage he lecture they upon the difficulty of find subsistence in they new state of freedom and then write out they _ atka _ of liberty as might have be expect some return voluntarily to servitude not be able to get a living whilst the greater part obtain a honorable livelihood enjoy the fruit of independent freedom it be mention as a instance of fidelity that a negress be the gaoler of the woman in tangier -lrb- 12 -rrb- at every moorish feast of consequence -lrb- four of which be celebrate here in a year -rrb- the slave of tangier perambulate the street with music and dancing dress in they holiday clothes to beg alms from all class of the population particularly european the money collect be deposit in the hand of they chief to this be add the savings of the whole year in the spring all be spend in a feast which last seven day the slave carry green ear of wheat barley and fresh date about the town the moorish woman kiss the new corn or fruit and give the slave a trifle of money a slave when he be dissatisfy with he master sometimes will ask he to be allow to go about beg

slave and black in morocco keep the same feast with the difference that not be able to get a man to sacrifice they kill a bullock such a barbarous rite may possibly be practice in some part of negroland but certainly not at timbuctoo all these tale about negro cannibal i be incline to believe invention there never yet have be publish a well authenticate case of negro cannibalism the grand cicerone for the english at tangier be benoliel he be a man of about sixty year of age and initiate into the sublimest mystery of the consular politics of the shereef ben be full of anecdote of everybody and everything from the emperor on the shreefian throne down to the mad and ragged dervish in the street we cicerone keep a book in which the name of all he english guest have be from time to time inscribe he visitor have be principally officer from gibraltar who come here for a few day sport on the bombardment of tangier ben leave the country with other fugitive the moorish rabble plunder he house and many valuable which be there conceal pledge by person belong to tangier be carry away ben be therefore ruin some foolish people at gibraltar tell ben that the street of london be

this wicked world but this visit to england convinced he he must begin the world over again we cicerone be very shrewd withal be bless with a good share of common sense be by no means bigote against mahometan or christian and be one of the more respectable of the barbary jew he information on morocco be however so mixed up with the marvellous that only a person well acquaint with north africa can distinguish the probable from the improbable or separate the wheat from the chaff ben have a large family like most of the maroquine jew but the great attraction of he family be a most beautiful

and especially jew bora and bring up under oppressive government ben would sell you to the emperor for a moderate price and so would the jewish consular agent of morocco a traveller in this country must therefore never trust a maroquine jew in a matter of vital importance mr drummond hay we consul at tangier advise I to return to gibraltar and to go by sea to mogador and thence to morocco where the emperor be then reside adopt he advice i leave the same evening for gibraltar i take my passage in a very fine cutter which have formerly be a yacht and have since be engage as a smuggler of spanish goods i confess i be not sorry to hear that the spanish custom-house be often dupe the cutter have be purchase for the gibraltar secret service the anti-slavery society have place at my disposal a few yard of green cloth for a present to the minister of the emperor at the custom-house of havre-de-grace i pay a heavy duty on it but when i get to irun on the spanish frontier -lrb- have determine to come through spain in order to see the country -rrb- the custom-house officer demand a duty nearly double the cost of the cloth in london so that there be no alternative but to leave it in they possession the only satisfaction or revenge which i have be that of call they _ ladrone _ in the presence of a mob of people who to do justice to the spanish populace all take my part when i complain of this conduct at madrid my friend laugh at my simplicity and tell I i be green in spanish and in travel through the land of chivalry and of ingeniósos hildágos ought on the contrary to thank god that i have arrive safe at madrid with a dollar in my pocket whilst they kindly hint if i should really get through the province of andalusium safe to cadiz without be strip of everything i must record it in my journal as a miracle of good luck this be however exaggeration i have no reason to complain of anything else during the time i be in spain my fellow traveller -lrb- all spaniard -rrb- nevertheless rebuke I for want of tact you ought they say to have give a few peseta to the guard of the diligencium who would have take charge of you cloth and keep it from go through the custom-house on reach gibraltar i make the acquaintance of frenerry who for thirty year have be a merchant in morocco mr frenerry have frequent opportunity of personal intercourse with muley abd errahman and have more influence with he than the british consul indeed at all time a merchant be always more welcome to he imperial highness than a diplomatic agent who usually be charge with some disagreeable mission mr frenerry be call par excellence the merchant of the west of course mr frenerry 's opinion must be valuable on maroquine affair he say : -- the morocco moor like the english very much and better than any other european for they know the english to be they best friend at the same time the moor feel they weakness they know also that a day might come when the english would be against they or have dispute with they as in day past the moor be therefore jealous of the english though they consider they they friend and do not like englishman more than any other christian to travel in they country in other respects if well manage and occasionally coax or bribe with a present the moor be very good natured and as tractable as child however i find since the murder of mr davidson both the people and government of morocco have get a bad name in gibraltar and opinion begin to prevail that it be almost impossible for a englishman to travel in the country mr frenerry recommend that a moor should be treat not proudly but with a certain degree of firmness to shew he you will not be trifle with in this way he say you will always continue friend with regard to the present emperor mr frenerry be a great apologist of he system the emperor be oblige to exclude foreigner as much as possible from he country he do not want to tempt the cupidity of european by show they the resource of the empire they be prying about for mine of iron and silver he be oblige to forbid these geological wanderings the subject of he empire be divide in they feeling and interest and have be drive there by every wave of human revolution the emperor do not wish to discover he weakness abroad by let europeans witness the bad faith and disloyalty of he heterogeneous tribe the european consul be much to blame they always carry they head too high if not insolently they then appoint jewish consul along the coast a class of man whom the hereditary prejudice of he mussulman subject will not respect there be certainly something if not a good deal to be say _ for _ the emperor as well as _ against _ he i be oblige to wait some time at gibraltar before i could get a vessel for mogador i miss one excellent opportunity from the want of a note from the gibraltar government a moor offer to allow I to take a passage without any expense in he vessel provide i could obtain a note from we government but the governor of gibraltar require a introduction in form and before i could receive a letter from mr hay to present to he the vessel leave for mogador i therefore lose

change ere they get clear of the obstructive strait many week have they be detain by the westerly gale and we vessel amongst the rest i feel the poignant misery of wait for the wind i know nothing so wearisome when all thing be make ready it be worse than hope defer which sicken and sadden the heart i have lately see some newspaper report that government be prepare a couple of steam-tug to be place at the mouth of the strait to tow ship in and out we may trust it will be do but if government do it not i be sure it would answer the purpose of a private company and i have no doubt such speculation will soon be take up vessel freight with perishable cargo be often oblige to wait week nay month at the mouth of the strait to the great injury of commerce in we day of steam and rapid communication this can not be tolerate -lrb- 13 -rrb- after a voyage of four day we find ourselves off the coast of mogador the wind have be pretty good but we have suffer some delay from a south wind which head we for a short time we pray for a westerly breeze of which we soon get enough from west and north-west the first twelve hour it come gently on but gradually increase till it blow a gale the captain be suddenly call up in the night as though the ship be go to sink or could sink whilst she be run as fast as we would let she before the wind but the real danger lay in miss the coast of mogador or not be able to get within its port from the violence of the breaker near the shore we vessel be a small genoese brig and though the genoese be the best sailor in the mediterranean -- even superior to the greek who rank next -- we captain and he crew begin to quake at daylight the coast-line loom before we immerse in fog and two hour after the tall minaret of the great mosque of mogador shooting erect a dull lofty pyramid stand over the thick haze lie on the lower part of the coast this phenomenon of the higher object and mountain be visible over a dense fog on the shore be frequent on this side of the atlantic wind also prevail here it scarcely ever rain but wind the people have nine month out of the twelve it be a species of trade-wind which commence at the strait or the coast of spain and portugal and sweep down north-west with fury make the entire coast of morocco a mountain-barrier of breaker increase in its course and extend as far as wadnoun cape bajdor cape blanco even to the senegal it do not however extend far out at sea be chiefly confine to the coast range we alarm now be lest we should get within the clutch of this fall swoop for the port once past it would have require we week to bear up again whilst this wind last the atlantic coast of morocco be a indented or wave line and there be only two or three port deserving the name of harbor -- harbor of refuge from these storm unlike the western coast of ireland so finely indented by the atlantic wave this portion of the morocco coast be round off by the ocean we excitement be great the capitano begin yelp like a cowardly school-boy who have be well punch by a lesser and more courageous antagonist immediately i get on deck i produce a english book which mention the port of mogador as a good port per dio santo exclaim we capitano yes for the english it _ be _ a good port -- you dare devil at sea -- for they it _ be _ a good port the open sea with a gale of wind be a good port for the _ maladettus _ english irritated at this extreme politeness to we gallant tar who have so long brave the battle and the breeze i do not trouble farther the dauntless genoese who certainly be not destine to become a columbus now the man begin to snivel and yelp follow the example of they commander we will not go into the port santa virgine we will not go in to be shiver to piece on the rock at this moment we experienced capitano fancy we have get into shoal-water the surf be see run in foam circle as if in a whirlpool now indeed we capitano do yelp now do the crew yelp invoke all the saint of the roman calendar instead of attend to the ship -lrb- 14 -rrb- here be a scene of indescribable confusion we ship be suddenly put round and back my fellow passenger a couple of jew from gibraltar begin swearing at the capitano and he brave man one of they whilst cursing think it just as well at the same time to call upon father abraham we little brig pitch she bow two or three time under water like a storm-bird and do _ not _ ground it be see to be a false alarm the capitano now take courage on see all the flag fly over the fortification it be Friday the mahometan sabbath the silly fellow have hear that the port authority always haul down they color when the entrance to the harbor be unsafe by reason of bad weather see the color he imagine all be right there be two entrance to the port of mogador one from the south which be quite open the other from the north-west which be only a narrow passage with scarcely room to admit a ship-of-the-line the ` suffren ' in which the prince de joinville command the bombardment of the town stand right over this entrance on the northern channel have south-east the isle of mogador and north-west the coast of the continent the prince take up a bold and critical position expose to violent current to ground on a rocky bottom and to many other serious accident -lrb- 15 -rrb- -lrb- illustration -rrb- as we near this difficult entrance we be all in a state of the most feverish excitement expect such be the fury of the breaker to be throw on the rock on either side thus it be a veritable scyllum and charybdi a man from the rigging descry several small vessel moor snugly behind the isle we venture in with breathless agitation a man from one of the fortification guess or see i suppose we timidity and bad seamenship cry out at the top of he lung salvo which be interpret mean the entrance be safe but this be not enough we be to have another trial of patience the foolish captain -- to terrify we to the last -- have to cast he anchor as a matter of course and imagine dear reader we alarm we terror when we hear he scream out the chain be snap we be now to be drive out southwards by the fury of the wind which have become a hurricane no very agreeable prospect happily also this be a false alarm the capitano then come up to I to shake hand apologize and present congratulation on we safe harbour the perspiration of fever and a heated brain be course down he cheek the capitano light a extra candle before the picture of the virgin below and observe to I whilst the man be say they prayer of gratitude for deliverance per un miraculo dellum santissima vergina nous sciamo salvatus -- -lrb- we be save by a miracle of the most holy virgin -rrb- which of course i do not or could not dispute allow as i do all man in such circumstance to indulge freely in they peculiar faith so long as it do not interfere with I or mine it be well that we merchant-vessel have never be reduce to the condition of genoese craft or be man by such chicken-hearted crew i believe the pusillanimity of the latter be traceable in a great measure to the miserable way in which the poor fellow be feed these genoese have no meat whilst i be with they i sail once in a neapolitan vessel a whole month during which time the crew live on horse-bean coarse maccaronus sardinian fish mouldy biscuit and gripe black wine meat they have none how be it possible for man thus feed to fight and wrestle with the billow and terror of the deep we have no ordinary task to get on shore the ocean be without but a sea be within port the wind increase with such fury that we abandon for the day the idea of landing we have however specie on board which it be necessary forthwith to land mr philip captain of the port and a merchant 's clerk therefore come alongside with great difficulty in a moorish boat to take on shore the specie and in it i embark this say barque be the miserable but apt representation of the by-gone formidable maroquine navy which not many century ago push its audacity to such length that the rover of salee cruise off the english coast and defy the british fleet now the whole naval force of the once-dreaded piratic state of barbary can hardly boast of two or three badly-manned brig or frigate as to morocco the emperor have not a single captain who can conduct a vessel from mogador to gibraltar the most skilful _ rai _ he port can furnish make a attempt lately and be blow up and down for month on the coast of spain and portugal be at last drive into the strait by almost miraculous interposition what be this moorish boat in which i go on shore a mere long shell of bad plank and scarcely more ship-shape than the trunk of a tree hollow into a canoe leakily put together it be fill with dirty ragged half-naked sailor whose seamanship do not extend beyond come and go from vessel lie in this little port each of these mogadorian port sailor have a bit of straight pole for a oar the way in which they row be equally characteristic struggle against wind and current with they moorish rai at the helm encourage they labor by cry out first one thing then another as he fancy dictate the crew repeat in chorus all he say : -- khobsah -lrb- a loaf -rrb- cry the rai all the man echo khobsah a loaf you shall have when you return cry the rai a loaf we shall have when we return cry the man pull pull god hear and see you

shall have thank god roar the man all scream and bawl in this unique style after struggle three hour to get three mile over the port we land all of we completely exhaust and drown in spray it be usual for moor particularly negro to sing certain chorus and thus encourage one another in they work what however be remarkable these chorus be mostly on sacred subject be frequently the formulum of they confession there be no god but one god and mahomet be he prophet & c these clownish tar be deeply color and some quite black i find in fact the greatest part of the moorish population of mogador color person we may here easily trace the origin of the epithet black-a-moor and we be not so surprised that shakspeare make he moor black indeed the present emperor muley abd errahman be of very dark complexion though he feature be not at all of the negro cast but he have son quite black and with negro feature who of course be the child of negress one of these be governor of rabat in no country be the color of the human skin so little thought of this be a very important matter in the question of abolition there be no objection to the skin and feature of the negro it be only the luxury of have slave or they usefulness for heavy work which weigh in the scale against abolition as soon as we land we visit the lieutenant-governor who congratulate we on not be carry down to the canary island then he excellency ask in due study form : where do you come from _ traveller _ -- gibraltar _ he excellency _ -- where be you go _ traveller _ -- to see the sultan muley abd errahman _ he excellency _ -- what be you business _ traveller _ -- i will let you excellency know to-morrow i then proceed to the house of mr phillip where i take up my quarter mr willshire we vice-consul be absent have go up to morocco with all the principal merchant of mogador to pay a visit to the emperor the port of mogador have to-day a most wild and desolate appearance which be render still more dreary and hideous by a dark tempest sweep over it on the shore there be no appearance of life much less of trade and shipping all have abandon it save a guard who lay stretch at the gate of the waterport like a grim watch-dog from this place we proceed to the merchant ' quarter of the town which be solitary and immerse in profound gloom altogether my first impression of mogador be most unfavourable i go to bed and dream of wind and sea and struggle with tempest the greater part of the night then i be shipwreck off the canary throw on the coast of wadnoun and make a slave by the wild arab wander in the desert -- i awake mr phillip mine host soon become my right-hand man he extraordinary character and the adventure of he life be worth a brief notice phillip say he be descend from those york jew who

youthful ardor a china figure on the chimney-piece which have be he toy in he boyhood on the occurrence of this little domestic incident the mother passionately embrace she lose prodigal once dead but now alive again phillip come to mogador on a military speculation and offer to take the command of the emperor 's cavalry against all he enemy this audacity of a jew fill the moor with alarm how could a jew who be not a devil propose such a insult to the commander of the faithful as to presume to take the charge of he invincible warrior nevertheless the little fellow weather the storm and get appoint captain of the port of mogador with the liberal salary of about thirty shilling per month but this do not prevent we aide-de-camp now metamorphose into a sea captain from wear _ a admiral 's _ uniform which he obtain in a curious way on a visit to england he meet in the street of london with a acquaintance who pretend to patronize he the gentleman jokingly say well phillips i must give you a uniform since you be appoint captain of the port of mogador the say gentleman receive a few month afterwards when he quondam protégé be safe with he uniform strut about mogador to the amazement of the moor and the delight of he co-religionist a bill of thirty pound or so charge for a suit of admiral 's uniform for mr phillip captain of the port of mogador and find that a joke sometimes have a serious termination phillip on he first arrival in this country enter into a diplomatic contest with the moorish authority demand the privilege of a native british-born jew and he determine to ride a horse in order to vindicate the rights of british jew before the awful presence of the shereefian court about this business the consul-general hay be say to have write eleven long and mr willshire about twenty-one short and pithy despatch but the affair end in smoke phillip with great magnanimity and self-denial consent to relinquish the privilege on the prayer of he brethren native of mogador who be very naturally afraid lest the incensed emperor might visit on they what he dare not inflict on the british-born jew of the achievement of phillip in the way of science -lrb- for he assure he be bear to the high destiny of enlighten both barbarian and civilized nation -rrb- i take the liberty with he permission of mention one phillip bring here a pair of horse-shoe belong to a drayhorse of the firm of truman hanbury buxton and co to astonish the moor by they size who be great connoisseur of horse-flesh the moor protest they unbelief and swear it be a lie -- such shoe never shoe a horse phillip then get a skeleton of a head from england this they also scout as a imposition allege that phillip have get it purposely make to deceive they although they believe in the prophet whom they never see they be still not such fool as to believe in everything which a infidel might bring to they country phillip now give up in despair the attempt to propagate science among the moor we ancient aide-de-camp of bolivar be a liberal english jew and boast that on christmas-day he always have he roast-beef and plum-pudding i sup with he often on a sucking-pig for the christian breed pig in this place to the horror of pious mussulman this amusing adventurer subsequently leave mogador and go to lisbon where he purpose write a memorial to the archbishop of canterbury contain the plan of a new unitarian system of religion by which the jew might be bring within the pale of the christian church for some time i feel the effect of my sea voyage my apartment rock in my brain people speculate about the object of my mission the most absurd rumor be afloat the christian have come to settle the affair of mr darman whom the emperor kill some say other remark the christian have come to buy all the slave of the country in order to liberate they the lieutenant-governor send for phillip to know what i come for who i be and how i pass my time phillip tell he all about my mission and that i be a great taleb when phillip mention to the governor that great britain have pay a hundred million of dollar for the liberation of slave belong to englishmen he excellency strike with astonishment exclaim the english sultan be inspire by god -lrb- illustration -rrb- i visit the burying-place of christian situate on the north-side of the town by the sea-shore a fine tomb be erect here to the memory of mr willshire 's father the ignorant country people come to mogador stop to repeat prayer before it believe it the tomb of some favorite saint the government hearing of this idolatry to a christian begged mr willshire to have the tomb cover with cement when this be do so perverse be these people that they partially divest it of cover and chip off piece of marble for they woman who grind they into powder and dust they face with it to make they fair every six month it be necessary to replaster the tomb this cemetery be the most desolate place the mind of man can conceive there be no green turf here to rest lightly on the bosom of the dead no tree no cypress of mourn no shade or shelter for those who seek to indulge in grief all be a sandy desolation sweep by the wild wind of the solitary shore of the ocean -lrb- illustration -rrb- farther on be the moorish cemetery which i pass through what a spectacle of human corruption here indeed we may learn to despise this world 's poor renown and cease torment ourselves with vain and godless pursuit it be then sunset the moon have rise far up on the fading brow of the depart day casting pale light and fearful shadow over this house of the dead it be time to return or the gate of the city would shut I out amidst the wreck of poor human dust and bone i see move in the doubtful shadow of approach night the grave-digging hyaena it be a ill wind that blow nobody good the wrecker of this coast boldly assert that a shipwreck be a blessing -lrb- _ berkah _ -rrb- send to they by providence the port authority have even the impudence to declare that to erect lighthouse at the mouth of the port would be thwart the decree of divine providence in spite of all this however at the urgent request of mr willshire when on one occasion the weather be very bad the governor of mogador station guard on various part of the coast to preserve the life and property of shipwrecked vessel but i do not think i have hear worse case of moorish wrecker than those which have happen not very many year ago on the french and english coast some of my reader will recollect the case of a indiaman wreck off the coast of france when poor lady in a state of suspend animation have they finger cut off to get possession of they diamond-ring during my stay at mogador a courier arrive from sous bring the news of some christian be wreck off the coast a jew have purchase one poor fellow from the arab for two camel two other be dead they body cast upon the inhospitable beach by the atlantic surge where they lay unburied to be mangled by the wild tribe or to feed the hungry hyaena some of the merchant come hither from the capital amongst the rest mr and mr elton they as well as other bring a favourable account of the emperor and he minister and laud very much the commercial policy of the governor of mogador moderation it be say be the characteristic of the court 's proceedings towards the merchant trade be not very brisk it be the rainy season when the arab be occupy with sowing the ground the busy time be from September to January the produce sell at that time be simply that which be leave of the past season have be keep back with the object of get a better price for it gum be bring in great quantity for exportation a immense quantity of sugar be import a third of which be loaf beet-root sugar bring from marseille mr phillip come to I to beg ten thousand pardon for have only fowl for dinner one morning two bullock be kill by the jew but not accord to the law and the greater part of the jew that day would have to go without meat on these occasion the jew sell they meat to the moor and christian at a reduce price phillip observe i be oblige to eat meat accord to the law or i should have no peace of my life a good many people be affect by cold but the climate of mogador be reckon very good all the year round there be not much variation nw and ne wind bring cold in winter and cool refreshing breeze in summer there be not a single medical man in mogador although there be some fifty european include jew some year ago a clever young man be practise here for one year each european pay he share of salary but alas those whom god bless with good health refuse to pay they quota to the support of a physician for they sickly neighbor consequently every european 's life be in the greatest danger should a serious accident occur to they with regard to money they would prefer a broken leg all they life time to pay five pound to have it set the consul of tangier subscribe for a resident physician -lrb- illustration -rrb- one afternoon i go to see the moorish cavalry playing at powder -lrb- lab elbaroud -rrb- be a stir and novel scene a troop of these haughty cavalier assemble with they chief almost daily on the playa or parade then they divide themselves into party of twenty or thirty proceed with they maneuver the cavalier at first advance slowly in a single line then canter and then gallop spur on the horse to its last gasp meantime stand up erect on they shovel-stirrup and turn from one side to the other look round with a air of defiance they fire off they matchlock throw themselves into various dexterous attitude sometimes let fall the bridle the piece be discharge the horse instantaneously stop the most difficult lesson a barb learn be to halt suddenly in mid career of a full gallop to discharge he matchlock standing on the stirrup while the horse be in full gallop be the great lesson of perfection of the maroquine soldiery the cavalier now wheel out of the way for the next file return reloading and take they place to gallop off and fire again crowd of people attend these equestrian exhibition of which they be passionately fond they squat round the parade in double or treble row muffle up within they bournous in mute admiration occasionally woman be present but female here join in very few out-door amusement when a whole troop of cavalier be thus manoeuver gallop at the utmost stretch of the horse ' muscle the man scream and hallow hah hah hah the dust and sand rise in cloud before the foam fiery barb with the deafening noise and confusion of a simultaneous discharge of firelock the picture represent in vivid color what might be conceive of the wild nubian cavalry of ancient africa -lrb- 16 -rrb- today there be a mishap several cavalier do not keep up the line the chief lead the troops cry out in a rage and with the voice of a senator fool madman be you child or be ye man christian or jew stand too near be frequently push back with

one of the luxury of north africa and be still much use even in tuni and tripolus where the new system of european military dress and tactic have be introduce the horse be the sacred animal of morocco as well as the safeguard of the empire the sultan have no other military defense except the natural difficulty of the country or the hatred of he people to stranger he do not permit the exportation of horse nor of barley on which they be often feed -lrb- 17 -rrb- but the defeat of the emperor 's eldest son sidus mahome at the battle of isly who command upward of forty thousand of these cavalier have throw a shade over the ancient celebrity of this moorish corps and these proud horseman have since become discourage on that fatal day however none of the black bodyguard of the emperor be bring into action these muster some thirty thousand strong this corps or the abeed-sidi-bokharus -lrb- 18 -rrb- be soldier who possess the most cool and undaunted courage retreat with they be never think of unlike the janissary of old they sole ambition be to _ obey _ and not to _ rule _ they sovereign this fidelity to the shereef remain unshaken through all the shock of the empire and to the person of the emperor they be completely devote in a country like morocco of widely distinct race and hostile tribe all naturally detest each other the emperor find in they he only safety i can not withhold the remark that this body-guard place before we the character of the negro in a very favourable light he be at once brave and faithful the two essential ingredient in the formation and development of heroic nature it will i trust not be deem out of place to consider for a moment the warlike propensity and quality of the negro every european who have penetrate africa confess to the bellicose disposition of the negro have see he engage with other in perpetual conflict the choice and retention of a body-guard of black by the moorish emperor also triumphantly prove the martial nature of the negro race but the negro have signally display the military quality of coolness and courage in many instance two or three of which i shall here take the liberty of mention in connexion with the affair of algerium mr lord relate on the authority of the french that when the invade army invest fort de l'empereur and have silence all its gun the dey order the turkish general to retreat to the kasbah and leave three negro to blow up the fort it seem therefore abandon but two red flag float still on its outward line of defense and a third on the angle towards the city the french continue all they effort towards effect a practicable breach three negro be now see calmly walk on the rampart and from time to time look over as if examine the progress of the breach one of they strike by a cannonball fall and the other as if to avenge he death run to a cannon point it and fire three shot at the third the gun turn over and they be unable to replace it they try another and as they be in the act of raise it a shot sweep the leg from under one of they the remain negro gaze for a moment on he comrade draw he a little aside leave he and once more examine the breach he then snatch one of the flag and retire to the interior of the tower in a few minute he re-appear take a second flag and descend the french continue they cannonade and the breach appear almost practicable when suddenly they be astounded by a terrific explosion which shake the whole ground as with a earthquake a immense column of smoke mix with streak of flame burst from the center of the fortress mass of solid masonry be hurl into the air to a amazing height while cannon stone timber projectile and dead body be scatter in every direction what be all this the negro have do he duty -- the fort be blow up in a skirmish near mascara one of abd-el-kader 's negro soldier kill two frenchman with he own hand the emir who be a eye-witness of he bravery reward he on the field of battle by present he with he own sword and the cross of the crescent the only military order in the service and which be never award except fur a very distinguished action colonel scott say the black be present to he and seem as proud of the honor confer on he as if he have be make a kgcb in the strife and dispute for succession that have characterize the history of the barbary prince and redden they annals with blood nothing have be more remarkable than the fidelity of the negro to they respective master and the bravery with which they have defend they to the last hour of they reign or existence when all he partisan have desert a pretender when the soldier of the successful competitor to the throne have be in the act of pounce upon the fall or fall prince a handful of brave follower have rush to the rescue and surround the person of they beloved leader pour out they life-blood in he defense -- and these man be negro to use a vulgar metaphor the negro will defend he master with the savage courage and tenacity of a bull-dog and this be the principal reason which have induce the despotic prince of north africa to cherish the negro of whom they have encourage a continual supply from the interior the history of this imperial guard of negro be interesting as show the inconvenience as well as the advantage of such a corps for these troops have not be always so well conduct as they be at present at one time the shereef claim a species of sovereignty over the city of timbuctbo and the adjacent country in the year 1727 muley ismail determine to re-people he waste district by a colony of negro he secret object be however to form a body guard to keep he own people in check a sort of black swiss regiment so alike be the policy of all tyrant in a few year these troops exceed 100000 man find they number so great and they service so much need by the sultan they become exigeant and rapacious dictate to they royal master muley abdallah be depose six time by they find they yoke intolerable the sultan decimate they by send they to fight in the mountain other be disband for the same reason by sidus mohamm still the effect of this new colonization be beneficially experience throughout the country the moor take the black woman as concubine a mixed race of industrious people spring up and give a impetus to the empire it be questionable however if north africa could he colonize by negro by mix with the caucasian race this experiment partly succeed but in general north africa be too bleak and uncongenial for the negro ' nature during winter the negro race do not increase of itself on this coast they present number be keep up by a continual supply of slave when this be stop color people will begin gradually to disappear it be unnecessary to tell my reader that the shereef be very sensitive on matter of religion but a anecdote or two may amuse they a french writer expatiate in true gallic style call morocco the arrière-garde en afrique of islamism and une de ses armées de réserve indeed the coast and city of morocco be inundate with saint of every description and degree of sanctity morocco in fact be not only the _ classic _ land of marabout but they home and haunt and sphere of agitation there be ten thousand abd-el-kader and bou maza all dispute authority with the high priest who sit on the green throne of the shereef sometimes they assume the character of demagogue and inveigh against the rapacity and corruption of the court and government at other they appear as prophet prophet of ill by preach boldly the holy war the french in africa now furnish they with a everlasting theme of denunciation from morocco they travel eastward fill the sahara and the atla with the odour of they holy reputation so that religious light like that of civilization be now move from the west -- eastward instead of as in time past from the east -- eastward the maroquine mahometan may be cite as a case in point they find too frequently only the form of religion in the east as we do in the eastern church they be begin to assault mecca as we have assault jerusalem now for a anecdote or two illustrative of the high state of orthodoxy profess by the shereef some time ago a number of handkerchief be bring or rather smuggle into mogador have print upon they passage from the koran one of they get into the hand of the emperor who think the christian be ridicule the sacred book order instanter all the city of the coast to be search to discover the offender who introduce they happily for the merchant he be not find out he highness command that all the handkerchief which be collect should be destroy when mr davidson be at morocco he prescribe some seidlitz water for the use of the sultan and place on the side of two bottle contain the beverage arabic verse from the koran the sultan be exceedingly exasperated at this compliment to he religion and have it privately intimate to mr davidson not to desecrate the holy book in that abominable manner the latter then very prudently give up to the minister all the print verse he have bring with he which be conceal from public view but if some of these emperor be so rigid and scrupulous there be other more liberal and tolerant muley suleiman be a great admirer of the european character and be much attach to a mr leyton a english merchant this merchant be one day ride out of the city of mogador when a old woman rush at he seize the bridle of he horse and demand alms the merchant push she away with he whip the ancient dame see herself so rudely nonsuited go off scream revenge and although she have not have a tooth in she head for twenty long year she noise about town that mr leyton have knock two of she tooth out and importune the governor to obtain she some pecuniary indemnification he excellency advise mr leyton to comply and get rid of the annoyance of the old woman he resolutely refuse and the governor be oblige to report the case to the emperor as the old lady have make so many partisan in mogador as to threaten a disturbance he imperial highness write a letter to the merchant condescendingly beg he to supply the old woman with two silver tooth mean thereby to give she a trifling present in money mr leyton be as obstinate as ever be order to appear before the emperor at morocco here the resolute merchant declare that he have not knock the tooth out of the old woman 's head she have have none for year and he would not be malign even in so small a matter the emperor be at he wit ' end and endeavor to smooth down the contumacious leyton to save he capital from insurrection implore he to comply with the lex talioni -lrb- 19 -rrb- and have two of he tooth draw if he be inflexibly determine not to pay the poor emperor be in hourly dread of a revolution about this tooth business and at the same time he know the merchant have speak the truth strange to say mr leyton at last consent to lose he tooth rather than he money however on the merchant 's return from the capital to mogador to he surprise and no doubt to he satisfaction he find that two ship-load of grain have be order to be deliver to he by the emperor in compensation for the two tooth which he have have punch out to satisfy the exigency of the empire chapter v several visit from the moor they idea on soldier and payment of public functionary -- mr cohen and he opinion on maroquine affair -- phlebotomising of governor and ministerial responsibility -- border travels of the shedma and hhaha tribe -- how the emperor enrich himself by the quarrel of he subject -- message from the emperor respect the anti-slavery address -- difficulty of travel through or reside in the interior -- use of knife and fork and chair be sign of social progress -- account of the periodic visit of the mogador merchant to the emperor in the southern capital i receive several visit from the moor as a class of man they be far superior in civility and kindness to the moorish population of tangier so much for the foolish and absurd story about the place which tell we that it be the only city of the empire in which christian can live with safety and comparative comfort these tale must have be invent to please the tangier diplomatist the contrary be the fact for whilst the moor of tangier consist of camel driver and soldier there be a good number of very respectable native merchant in mogador nevertheless a large portion of the population be in the pay of government as militia to keep in check the tribe of the neighbouring province but they pay be very small and most of they do a little business many be artizun and common labourer as a specimen of they ordinary conversation take the follow _ moor _ -- all the people of morocco be soldier what can the foreigner do against they morocco be one camp we sultan be one we have one prophet and one god _ traveller _ -- in we country we do not care to have so many soldier we have fewer than france and many other country but we soldier do not work like yours they be always soldier and fight bravely _ moor _ -- we do not understand how wonderful the french must conquer you with more soldier _ traveller _ -- we have more ship and we principal country be a island the sea surround we and defend we _ moor _ -- how much pay have the governor of gibraltar _ traveller _ -- about 20000 dollar per annum _ moor _ -- too much why the koed of mogador be oblige instead of receive money to send the emperor at a day 's notice 20 or 30000 dollar or if he do not pay he be send to prison at once he head be not the value of a slave 's it appear that the old governor -lrb- who be now in morocco -rrb- positively refuse any salary or present he excellency be a man of some small property and find this plan answer best he will not be fatten and bleed as the emperor treat other governor he politely hint this to the emperor when he accept office since then he have resolutely refuse all present from the merchant so that the emperor have no excuse whatever for bleed he under the pretext that he be afflict with a plethora from he exaction on the people the money refer to by the moor be the custom due which be collect by a separate department and transmit direct to the emperor whilst reside at mogador mr cohen arrive from morocco where he have be with the merchant he be the english jew who assist mr davidson in he travels through morocco he experience in maroquine affair be considerable and i shall offer he conclusion concern the present state of the empire i prefer indeed give the opinion of various resident or native of the country to we own mr cohen 's idea will be find to differ exceedingly from that of the -lrb- imperial -rrb- merchant who in point of fact be not free man and can not be trustworthy witness as mr elton justly observe the european be so much involve with the emperor that they be almost oblige to consent publicly to the violent death of the unfortunate jew dorman although he be under the french protection and likewise a kind of vice-consul mr cohen say -- the people of morocco be tire of they government tire of be pillage of they property tire of the insecurity and uncertainty of they possession that be to say of the few thing which still remain in they hand mr cohen go so far as to say -- that be a strong european power to be establish on the coast the entire population would flock to its support he give the follow instance of the style and manner in which the emperor bleed the governor of province a few year ago a governor of mogador present himself to the sultan of fez he be receive with all due honor the governor then beg leave to return to morocco he be dismiss with great demonstration of friendship he arrive at morocco and the governor of that city immediately inform he that he be he prisoner the sultan have a claim against he of 40000 dollar at length the poor dupe of royal favor obtain permission to go back to mogador and to sell all he have in order to make up the sum of 40000 dollar this be the way in which thing be manage there of maroquine policy mr cohen say that when the sultan find himself in a scrape he give way though slightly dilatory at first so long as he see that he do not commit himself or be not detect he do what he like with he own and other people 's likewise to the fullest extent of he power but on any mishap befall he muley abd errahman whenever he can always shift the responsibility upon he minister and if one of they give he advice and the course take therein do not succeed woe be to the unhappy functionary some year ago a number of troops rebel against the emperor at the instance of the prime minister ben dri they be pardon but instead of receive gratefully this imperial mercy the troops break out afresh in rebellion which with great difficulty be quell by the sultan this however be accomplish he call the prime minister before he and thus address the amaze vizier now sir receive four hundred bastinado for you pain and pay I 30000 ducat you will then take care in future how you give I advice nevertheless ben dri still remain vizier and continue so till he death bastinado a minister in morocco be however much the same as a forced resignation or the dismissal of a minister in europe doubtless ben dri think himself surprisingly lucky that the emperor do not cut off he head it be the late mr hay 's opinion that muley abd errahman be a good man but surround with bad adviser the probability seem rather that he take all the credit of the good act of he adviser and fling on they the odium of all the bad act commit by himself as many other despotic sovereign have often do before he with regard to the disaffection of the people as allege by mr cohen its verification be of great importance to we and we appreciation of it equally so we might be count upon the resistance of the maroquine against a invasion of the french and find to we astonishment the invader receive as deliverer from the exaction and tyranny of the shereefian oppressor the fact be morocco will never be able to resist the progress of nation any more than china especially since she have get the most restless people in the world for she neighbor besides during the last thirty year many of the maroquine have visit europe and they eye be become open the film of moorish fanaticism have fall off even on they aggressive neighbor they see the exercise of a government less rapacious than they own and more security of life and property still the emperor will use every means to build up a barrier against innovation just at this time a _ reko _ -lrb- courier -rrb- arrive from mr willshire -lrb- now at morocco -rrb- bring letter in answer to those which i have address to he touch my visit to the emperor he write that he have already receive order from he imperial majesty respect the object of my mission which word give I uneasiness as they be evidently unfavourable to it and consequently to my journey to morocco there be a misunderstanding between the province of shed ma and hhaha these district adjoin mogador the city belong to hhaha shedma be mostly lowland and plain and hhaha highland and mountain which form a portion of the south-western atla and strike down into the sea at santa cruz there seem to be no other reason for those frequent obstinate hostility on both side except the nature of the country it be lamentable to think because a narrow frith divide two people or because one life in the mountain and the other in the plain that therefore they should be enemy for ever strange infatuation of poor human nature here the feud legend babble of revenge and say that in the time of muley suleiman one day when the hhaha people be at prayer at mogador during broad day light the shedma people come down upon they and slaughter they and whilst in the sacred and inviolable act of devotion enter the mosque and pillage they house this produce implacable hatred between they which be likely to survive many generation but the story be tell I by a hhaha man and not improbably the people of shedma have some plausible reason for make this barbarous attack even before this piece of treachery of one mussulman towards another at the hour of prayer the feud seem to have exist it be a remarkable circumstance in the history of islamism that many of the most treacherous and sanguinary action of mahometan have be commit within the sacred enclosure of the mosque and at the hour of prayer one of the caliph have be assassinate in a mosque seem to have be the precedent for all the murder of the kind which have follow and indelibly disgrace the mussulman annals these hhaha and shedma people be also borderer and fight with the accustomed ferocity of border tribe they conflict be very desultory be carry on by two and three or six and seven and with stick and stone and other weapon if they can not get knife or matchlock meanwhile the emperor fold he arm and look on superbly and serenely when the two party be exhaust or have have enough of it for the present he imperial highness then interfere and punish both by fine indeed it pay he better to pursue this course for instead of spend money in the suppression of factious insurrection he gain by mulct both party the sultan in fact not only aggrandize himself by the quarrel of he own subject but he profit by the dispute between the foreign consul and he governor the imbroglio which take place some year since between the governor of mogador and the french consul m delaporte be sufficiently characteristic a algerine mussulman who be of course a french subject behave himself very indecent by set all the usual rule of mahometan worship at defiance this be a great scandal to the faithful the governor of mogador in defiance of religion take upon himself to punish a french mussulman the french consul remonstrate strongly in presence of the governor almost insulting he before he people the sultan approve the conduct of he governor the consul general decide that both party ought to be remove and the french government recall they vice-consul the sultan promise but do not dismiss he governor or rather the governor himself would not be dismiss the french reiterate they complaint which be support by a small squadron send down to mogador the governor be now cashier and be besides oblige to pay the emperor a fine of thirteen thousand dollar upon the pretext of appease the offended majesty of he royal master so the sultan always make money by the misadventure of he subject to indemnify the poor governor for he fine he receive soon after another appointment on he return from morocco have wait upon mr wiltshire regard the presentation of the petition of the anti-slavery society the vice-consul explain the great difficulty the emperor have in receive a petition which call for a organic change in the social condition of the country and that indeed the abolition of slavery be contrary to he religion i then represent to mr willshire the propriety at least of wait for the arrival of the governor of mogador from morocco in order to have a personal interview with he to which the vice-consul accede the difficulty of travel through morocco and of reside in the inland town have be already mention in further proof mr elton related that whilst the merchant visit the emperor in the southern capital a watch-maker a european and a christian asked permission of the minister to dwell in the quarter of the moor instead of that of the jew in which latter the european usually reside the minister reply you may live there if you like but you must have ten soldier to guard you such a reply from the minister and whilst the merchant be protect by the presence of the emperor himself be all conclusive as to the insecurity attach to european in the interior town morocco itself be a city of profound gloom where the moor indulge to the utmost he taciturn disposition and melancholy fatalism it be therefore not a enchanting abode for european who whilst there wait on the emperor be oblige constantly to ride about to preserve they health or they would die of the suffocating stench in the jew 's millah or quarter but in take this equestrian exercise they be not unfrequently insult a ungallant cavalier deliberately stop mr elton by ride up against she the lady spur she horse and catch with she foot a portion of he light burnouse drag it away he be only prevent ride after and cut she down by one of the emperor 's secretary who be pass by at the time mr elton have a fine black horse to ride upon the populace be so savage at see a infidel mount upon so splendid a animal that they hoot : curse you infidel dismount you dog these instance shew the sauciness of the vulgar and be a fair example of the conduct of the moor i be tell by barbary jew it would be next to impossible for a christian to walk without disguise in broad daylight at fez not so much from the hostility of the populace as from they indecent and vehement curiosity however in these case i be oblige to give the testimony of other mr cohen when travel through the interior assume the character of a quack doctor the best passport in all these country practise as he go he manage to get enough to bear he charge on the way oliver goldsmith pipe but in morocco the traveller and stranger physics he way to european mr cohen give this advice -- never to stay more than one night at any place mr davidson he say stop so long at wadnoun that all the desert as far as timbuctoo hear of he project and travels and be determine to waylay and plunder he but on the contrary with respect to my own experience in the desert the people appear equally hostile or offend at my take they by surprise desert travel after all be mostly a affair of luck six traveller might be send to timbuctoo and three return and three be murder and yet the three who be murder might have be as prudent and as skilful as the three who be successful the maroquine government often shew a perfect chinese jealousy of european travel in the interior when doctor willshire brother of the consul return from morocco the government give order that he should be take directly to mogador and not be allow to turn to the right hand or to the leave to collect old stone or herb this lynx-eyed government imagine they see in doctor willshire 's botanical and mineralogical ramble a design of spy out the power and resource of the country the consentaneous progress of morocco in the universal movement of the age be argue by the merchant from a increase use of chair and knife and fork some year ago scarcely a knife and fork or a chair be to be find in this part of morocco now almost every house in the jewish quarter have they the jew of barbary can use they with less scruple than the orthodox tory moor who set he face like flint against all change because he european brethren adopt they many innovation of this domestic sort be introduce from europe into north africa through the instrumentality of native jew tea have become a article of universal consumption it be indeed the wine of the maroquine mussulman -lrb- 20 -rrb- even in remote province amongst beber and bedouin the most miserable look and live of people the finest green tea be to be find you enter a miserable look hut when you be amaze by the hostess unlock a old box and take out a choice tea service cup saucer tea-pot and tea-tray often of white china with gilt edge these after use be always keep lock up as object of most precious value the sugar be put in the tea-pot and the moor and jew usually drink they tea so sweet that it may be call syrup but if any lady try the plan of melt the sugar while the tea be brewing in the tea-pot she will find the tea so prepared have acquire a different and not disagreeable flavor morocco have its fashion and mania as well as europe house building be now the rage they say it be not so easy for the sultan to fleece the people of they property when it consist of house almost every distinguish moor in the interior have build or be build himself a spacious house this mania be happily a useful one and must advance the comfort and sanitary improvement of the people it be as good as a health of town bill for they the merchant have all return from morocco i shall give some account of they visit to the emperor the ancient rule of imperial residence be that the sultan should sojourn six month in fez and six month in morocco the former the northern and the latter the southern capital this be not adhere to strictly the emperor take up he abode at one capital or the other and sometimes at mickno accord to he caprice he never fail however to visit morocco once a year on account of its neighborhood to mogador he much loved and beautiful commercial city the emperor himself before he accession to the throne be the administrator of the customhouse of this city where he have acquire he commercial taste and habit of business which he have cultivate from the very commencement of he reign when the emperor reside in the south he receive visit from the merchant of mogador these visit be imperative on the merchant if they be he imperial debtor or even if they wish to maintain a friendly feeling with he government upon a average the visit or deputation of merchant take place every three or four year more frequently they can not well be because they cost the merchant immense sum in present each often give to the value of three or four thousand dollar in return they receive additional and prolonged credit the number of imperial merchant be about twenty three of whom be englishmen messr willshire elton and robertson most of the rest be barbary jew -lrb- 21 -rrb- there be a belgian merchant who do not go with these this gentleman owe nothing to the emperor prefer to pay duty on ship he merchandize on which by payment of ready money he get 25 per cent discount this plan however do not enable he to compete with the imperial merchant whose duty accumulate till they be year and year in arrear and when these arrears have go on increase till there be no chance of payment the emperor in order to keep up he firm of enslaved merchant will rather remit half or more of the debt in consideration of a handsome present than encourage merchant to make ready money payment the largest debt owing by a single firm be that of a native jew viz 250000 dollar the amount of the debt of the unite mogador merchant be more than one million and a half of dollar the usual course of the merchant be to pay the debt off by monthly instalment as a instance of the emperor 's strain a point to keep solvent one of he mercantile firm on the occasion of the visit of the merchant to morocco he imperial highness lend the house of hasan joseph -lrb- jew -rrb- 10000 dollar in hard cash which to my knowledge be pay to they out of the coffer of the mogador custom-house this be certainly a instance of magnanimous generosity on the part of muley abd errahman but the emperor 's genius be mercantile and he be determine to support he imperial trader and he conduct after all be only the calculation of a raiser it must be mention however to the honor of mr elton that on the bombardment of mogador he and he lady be allow to leave at once have pay up all they government debt indeed the governor of that place be always accustom to say to the collector of the return of the monthly payment of instalment : now go first to mr elton she will be sure to have the money ready for you and we must have money to-day from some of the merchant on another occasion he excellency call the lady of mr elton the best man amongst the merchant mr elton be a vivacious energetic lady be often call the woman of the christian the following be the station at which the merchant stop from mogador to morocco to visit the emperor 1st emperor 's garden five hour from mcgador where be some fine fig tree and a spring 2nd aïn oma 3rd seeshouar 4th wad enfe the country for the first two day be beautifully rural scatter over with noble argan forest on the third and fourth day the journey be through plain and a open country on the second day after leave mogador you obtain a distinct view of the great atlas range at the back of morocco on the fifth as you approach the capital the country be overspread with wild date-palm palmetto or dwarf palm the view of tower atla that support the sky now stand forth vaster and more magnificent as you approach the capital and be the only feature of surpass interest on the journey but it suffice to absorb all the attention of the traveller as he gaze on the giant mountain which seem to support with its huge rocky arm the frame-work of the sky its head cover with everlasting snow he forget the fatigue of he painful route under a african sun and lose in pious musing adore the omnipotent be who lay the foundation of this solid buttress halfway be call the neck of the camel where there be a well in the midst of a scene extremely desert and dreary here all the donkey of the party of merchant die from want of water the water of this well be not permit to be drunk by animal in obedience to the solemn testament of the saint who dig it the poor horse and mule be tie close up to the well look wistfully at the water when draw for the biped animal and snuff the scent but they be not allow to taste a drop two horse break loose and fight they combat be aggravate by thirst see cry the moor to the merchant the saint be angry with you for have wish to give he water to horse we merchant however in defiance of the saint -lrb- this invisible enemy of the lower creation -rrb- and of he supporter get a supply of water which during the night and en marche the next day they distribute to they steed the accommodation on the way and at the capital be very bad even the waiting-room near the palace appropriate to the christian be but a old dilapidated shed with one of its side knock out or never fill in everything say we merchant be go to rack and ruin in the capital the emperor will not even repair he palace or the jealousy in which he keep he woman money be he only pursuit and he god they residence in the capital be very disagreeable all be coop up in the jew ' quarter and oblige to subsist on victuals cook by these people which make certain of they unwell for some of the barbary jew 's food be very indigestible the presentation of the merchant to the emperor be conduct as follow : at nine in the morning they be admit into a garden in presence of about two thousand imperial guard all draw up in file look extremely fierce pass these bearded warrior they be conduct into a large square line with building where after wait about five minute the gate of the palace be suddenly throw open and the emperor ride out superbly mount on a white horse follow on foot by a group of courtier he imperial highness be attend by the governor of mogador who walk by he side the first person present to the shereefian lord be the official of mogador who be introduce by the governor of that city afterwards come some moorish grandee then the christian be present and finally the jewish merchant the latter be introduce by the governor of mogador the jews take off they shoe as they pass before the emperor one pass at a time with he cadeau behind he carry by a attendant jew as the merchant move on he imperial highness ask they name and condescend to thank each of they separately for he offer the merchant carry in they hand a invoice of they respective present and give it to the governor for the article on they delivery be not expose before the eye of the sultan to open the budget would be a breach of good breeding and would shock the imperial modesty fifteen merchant be introduce and the ceremony of presentation last about twenty minute this being conclude the merchant be permit to perambulate the garden of the emperor and to pluck a little fruit they be afterwards delay a fortnight wait to present a _ cadeau _ to the emperor 's eldest son such be the detail of this journey which i get from the merchant themselves mr willshire be a consul and great customer of he imperial highness also receive a gift of a horse in exchange the unite value of the present to the emperor on this occasion be fifty thousand dollar which amply indemnify he for he money-lending and the credit that he give they consist principally of article of european manufacture he imperial highness afterwards sell they to he subject on he own account of course amongst this mass of present there be many nice thing such as tea sugar spice essence & c for he personal comfort and luxury as well as for he harem besides article of dress and ornament it will not be out of place here to give a brief account of the commerce of morocco in do so we must take into consideration the prodigious quantity of import and export of which there be no statistics in the imperial custom-house and no consular return let we estimate the population of morocco at its general compensation of eight million and suppose that each spend a dollar per annum in the purchase of european manufacture this will raise the value of import at once to eight million of dollar per annum it be notorious that the contraband trade of tangier and tetuan and the northern coast generally double or treble the commerce that pass through the customhouse but the legal trade be not well ascertain mr hay once send i believe to the agent of mogador a list of question to be answer by the consular department the gentleman who be a unsalaried vice-consul appal at the number of interrogatory immediately reply that he have he own business to attend to he could not sit down to compose consular return which would require week of labor and if it be consider part of he duty to answer such question he beg to resign at once he vice-consulship as to the barbary jew who have charge of some of the vice-consulate they be necessarily incapacitate by reason of they want of education for such a employment it be therefore hopeless to attempt to give any accurate account of the commerce of morocco i can only annex a few detail of those thing of which we be actually cognizant whatever may be say of the indolent habit of the moor they be once and still be a commercial people spain the neighbor of morocco still feel the loss of the moor they be the really industrious class settle in spain the merchant the artist the operative and agriculturist unfortunately have leave behind they few inherit they habit of perseverance little indeed can be expect in spain where the maxim be adopt that nobility may lie dormant in a servant but become extinct in a merchant spain lose upward of three million of intelligent and industrious moor a shock she will never recover the bombardment of a commercial city of this country would not do the injury which be commonly imagine the port be numerous though not very good a single house or shed on the beach of mogador or tangier be a sufficient custom-house for the moor there be no great deposit of goods on the coast for as soon as the camel bring they load of export these be ship and the camel immediately return to the interior laden with import goods or manufacture mogador be the great commercial depôt of the atlantic coast and therefore the beautiful ishweira the beloved town of muley abd errahman its trade be principally however with the south the province of sous and wadnoun and the western sahara mogador be also the bona-fide port of the southern capital of morocco two-third of the commerce of mogador be carry on with england the rest be divide among the other nation of europe but of this third i should think france have one half the port of mogador have usually some half-a-dozen vessel lie in it but from twenty to thirty have be see there they be usually sixty day discharge and take in cargo each vessel pay forty dollar port-due which must press very heavily upon small vessel but it be seldom that a vessel of less than one hundred ton be see at mogador the grand staple export be only two gum and almond upon the sale of these the commercial activity of this city entirely depend english vessel come directly from london the french from marseille but so badly be this commerce manage that at the present time morocco produce be higher in mogador than it be in london or marseille for instance morocco almond be cheaper in london than mogador mazagan and some few other port export produce direct to europe but tangier be the next commercial port of the empire there be a important trade in manufacture and provision carry on between tangier and gibraltar the fez merchant have resident agent in gibraltar curious story be tell of maroquine adventurer leave tangier and fez as camel-driver and town-porter and then assume the character and style of merchant in gibraltar throw over they shoulder a splendid woollen burnouse and folding round they head a thoroughly orthodox turban in large swell fold of milk-white purity in this way they will walk through the store of gibraltar and obtain thousand of dollar ' worth of credit the merchant-emperor find it necessary to put a stop to this and promulgate a decree to the effect that he would not for the future be responsible for the debt of any of he subject contract out of he dominion this be aim at these trading adventurer and the decree be transmit to the british consul who have it publish in the gibraltar gazette while i be stay in that city up to this time the emperor singularly enough have make himself responsible for all the debt of he subject trade with gibraltar the trade in provision at tangier be most active bullock sheep butcher 's meat fowl egg game and pigeon grain and flour & c be daily ship from tangier to gibraltar the garrison and population of gibraltar draw more than two-third of they provision from this and other northern part of morocco this government speculate in and carry on commerce and like most african and asiatic government have have its established monopoly from time immemorial of some of which it dispose whilst it reserve other for itself as those of tobacco sulphur and cochineal all the high functionary engage in commerce and this occupation of trade and barter be consider the most honorable in the empire sanction as it be by the emperor himself who may be consider as the chief of merchant the monopoly be sell by public auction at so much per annum on its own monopoly government as a rule exact a profit of cent per cent the follow be a list of the monopoly which the emperor sell either to he own employer or to native and foreign merchant 1 leech -- this be one of the most

millet and other small seed -- this monopoly at tangier be sell for five hundred dollar the price vary in other place accord to circumstance 6 cattle -- the cattle export from tetuan tangier and

five dollar per head export duty the ordinary tax be ten it be estimate however that some three or four thousand head of cattle be annually export from morocco for we garrison the gibraltar commissariat contractor complain and with reason that the maroquine monopolist supply the british government with the very worst cattle of all western barbary these monopoly do not interfere with the

be permit biped or jew and jewess he imperial highness have absolute need of jew to carry on the commerce of the country no male adult jew or child can leave the port of morocco without pay four dollar custom duty a jewess must pay a hundred dollar the reason of there be such a excessive export-duty on woman be to keep they in the country as a sort of pledge for the return of they husband brother or father in the event of they leave for commercial or other purpose slave be not export from morocco besides the payment of special impost on exportation wool pay a duty of three dollar per quintal and two pound of powder when dirty and double when wash a bullock pay export duty ten dollar and a sheep one sheepskin eight dollar the hundred bullock-skin three dollar per quintal and

mr frenerry be commission by we government to purchase of the emperor five hundred horse for portugal he imperial highness call together he governor of city and shiek of province and after a long debate it be unanimously decide that so large a number of horse could not be sell to the christian without danger to the empire whilst also the transaction would be contrary to the principle of islamism should a individual wish to export a single horse he would have to pay sixty dollar a duty which entirely amount to a prohibition many of the boast beast not be worth twenty dollar a mule pay forty and a ass five dollar mule be much dearer in morocco and in other part of barbary than horse camel be rarely export and have no fixed import the queen of spain some time ago solicit the sultan for four camel and he imperial highness have the gallantry to grant the export free of duty there be several export which be not monopoly these be principally from the south the follow be some of they ostrich feather -- these be of three quality the first of which pay three dollar per pound the second quality one and a half dollar and the third three-quarter of a dollar many feather merchant be now

pomegranate peel sarsaparilla snuff sponge walnut garbanyo gasoul and mineral soap gingelane and commin seed & c be export in various quantity -lrb- 22 -rrb- it be report in the mercantile circle that representation would be make to the emperor to place the trade of the country upon a regular and more stable footing all nation indeed would benefit by a change which could not but be for the better but i question whether he imperial highness will give up he old and darling system of be the sovereign-merchant of the empire it be not the interest of great britain to annoy he for we have always to look at gibraltar but it would be desirable if christian merchant could be find to undertake the duty to have all the vice-consul of the coast christian in preference to jew by have jewish consul we place ourselves in a false position with the emperor who be oblige to submit to the prejudice of he people against hebrew british merchant ought to be allow to visit they own vessel whilst in port to superintend or what not the stowing or landing of they goods as they be entitle to do by treaty spanish dollar be the chief currency in morocco but there be also doubloon and smaller gold coin this currency the merchant manage very badly a doubloon lose sixteen penny or four maroquine ounce in exchange at mogador whilst at the capital of morocco three day ' journey from this it pass for the same value it bear in spain and gibraltar as to the revenue of the government of morocco we means of information be still more uncertain and conjectural than those we possess regard commerce a french writer assert that the tithe upon land assign by the koran and the capitation tax on the jew produce from twenty to thirty million franc -lrb- or say about one million pound sterling -rrb- per annum this perhaps be too large a sum about a century ago the revenue of moocco be estimate at only # 200000 sterling per annum but if muley abd errahman have fifty million of dollar or ten million sterling in the vault of mequinez he may be consider as the richest monarch in africa nay in all europe it be positively state that muley ismail leave this amount or one hundred million of ducat in the imperial treasury which sidus mahom reduce to two million it may have be the great object of the life of the present sultan to restore this enormous hoard no country be rich or safe without a vast capital in hand as a reserve for time of trouble war or famine but it be not necessary that such reserve should be in the hand of a government this a maroquine prince can not comprehend and he decide as to the riches and poverty of he country by the amount he possess in he royal vault in treat of trade and compare its export with the peculiar product and manufacture of the city and town hereafter to be enumerate we may approximate to a idea of the resource of the maroquine empire but everything be more or less deteriorated in this naturally rich country cattle and sheep grain and fruit be of inferior quality owe to the want of proper culture no spontaneous growth be equal to culture for such be the ordinance of divine providence half of this country be desert the iron hand of despotic government press heavily upon all industry if we add to this defective state of culture the miserably moral condition of the people we have the unpleasant picture of a inferiority civilized race of mankind scatter over a badly cultivate region not all the magnificence of the glorious atla can reconcile such a prospect to the imagination but unhappily morocco do not constitute a very striking exception to the progress of civilization along the shore and in the isle of the mediterranean many country in southern europe be in a state little superior and the moorish civilization be almost on a par with that of the grecian sicilian or maltese and quite equal to turkish advancement in the art and science of the nineteenth century the only real advantage of the turk over the moor consist in the improvement the former have make in the organization of the army whoever travel through morocco and will but open he eye to survey its rich valley and fertile plain will be impress with the conviction that this country cultivate by a industrious population and foster by a paternal government be capable of produce all the agricultural wealth of the north and the south of europe as well as the tropics and of maintain its inhabitant in happiness and plenty chapter vi influence of french consul -- arrival of the governor of mogador from the capital he bring a order to imprison the late governor he character and mode of administer affair -- statue of a negress at the bottom of a well -- spanish renegade -- various wedding festival of jew -- frequent fete and feasting amongst the jewish population of morocco -- scripture illustration behold the bridegroom cometh -- jewish renegade -- how far woman have soul -- infrequency of suicide notwithstanding the sarcasm of a french journalist that the french and other european consul be consul des jusifs et pour la protection des jusifs the french consul both here and at tangier have real power and influence with the government the governor of mogador sidi haj el-arby arrive from morocco he excellency fear a attack from the shedma and the hhaha people and be oblige to have a strong escort not long ago the sultan himself have a narrow escape from fall into the hand of a band of insurgent they object be to make they lord-paramount a prisoner and extort concession as the price of he liberty this will help we to form a opinion of the want of sympathy between potentate and subject in morocco he excellency bring a order from the imperial despot to imprison the late governor if the balance of 6000 dollar be not instantly forthcoming he have only pay nine out of the 15000 demand the late governor be confine in he house instead of in the common prison it be say he be worth 30000 dollar but that he be afraid to make too prompt a payment of the demand of the emperor lest he should be call upon for more however he furniture horse and mule be sell in the public street a melancholy spectacle be the degradation of a former governor of this city -lrb- 23 -rrb- the moor look upon these thing as matter of course or with indifference quietly ejaculate it be destiny who can resist but the moor nevertheless can clearly discern that wealth be a crime in the eye of they sovereign i be not surprise at the present governor absolutely reject all present and make the people call he by the _ soubriquet _ of the governor of _ no _ present a short time after he appointment a merchant have leave he excellency a present during he absence from home be immediately summon before he when the follow dialogue ensue : -- _ he excellency _ -- sir how dare you leave a present at my house _ the merchant _ -- other governor before you excellency have receive present _ he excellency _ -- i be a governor of no present how much do you owe the sultan my master _ the merchant _ -- i -- i -- i -- do not know -lrb- hesitate and tremble -rrb- _ he excellency _ -- very well when you owe the sultan nothing bring I a present and take this away and make know to everybody that haj el-arby receive _ no _ present the fact be the governor know what he be about be he excellency to receive 16000 dollar per annum as present from the merchant of mogador the sultan would demand of he 15999 besides there be not a merchant who make a present that do not demand its value a _ quid pro quo _ in the remission of custom-duty sidi-el-arby be also a thorough diplomatist so far as report go he promise anybody anything he keep all on the tiptoe of most bless expectation and so make friend of everybody to he friend cohen he say i 'll take you back to my country with I and make you rich we be of the same country to phillip you shall have a ship of you own soon to the merchant the sultan shall lend you money whenever you want it to the moor in general you shall have you tax reduce in this way he excellency promise and flatter all but take very good care to compromise himself with none the frequent as well as the unfrequented spot be centre of superstition in the sahara by a lonely well in the midst of boundless sterility where the curse on earth seem to have burnt blackest a camel pass every night groan piteously and wander about in search of its murder master so the tale be tell I now about two day 's journey from mogador there be also a well contain within its dank and dark hollow a perpetual apparition at its bottom be see the motionless statue of a negress with a variety of wear material place beside she all make of fine burnish gold and so bright that the dreary cavern of the deep well be illuminate whoever presume to look down the well at she and covet she shine property be instantaneously seize with thirst and fever and if he do not expire at once he never recover from the fatal effect of he combined curiosity and avarice people draw water daily from this well but no one dare look down it truth may be in this well since there be a sad want of it on this as on other part of the world i be introduce to a spanish renegade a great many make they escape from the presidio of the north on get away from these convict establishment they adopt the mahometan religion be pretty well receive by the maroquine and generally pass the rest of they day tranquilly among the moor i imagine the better sort of they remain christian at heart notwithstanding they public assumption of islamism this renegade be a stonemason whom i find at work and he be not at all distinguishable by stranger from the moor be dress precisely in the same fashion i have some conversation with he which be characteristic of conceit feeling and honor _ traveller _ -- how long have you escape _ renegade _ -- more than twenty year _ traveller _ -- do you like this country and the moor _ renegade _ -- better be marruécos than spain _ traveller _ -- shall you ever attempt to return to spain _ renegade _ -- why here i have all i want besides they would stretch my neck for send a fellow out of the world without he previously have have a interview with he confessor _ traveller _ -- be you not conscience-stricken have commit such a crime how can you mention it _ renegade _ -- pooh conscience pooh corazor many of those wretched man have indeed lose they corazor or it be sear with a red-hot iron some hundred of these spanish convict be scatter over the country but they soon lose they nationality it be probable that from some knowledge of they the emperor presume lately to call the spaniard the vilest of nation and yet at various time the maroquine have show great sympathy for the spaniard some of these renegade be find at the battle of isly in charge of field-piece where accord to the french report they display great devotion to the cause of the emperor when the governor of the convict settlement find too many on he hand or the prison too full they let a number of they best conduct escape to the interior the presence of those cut-throat in morocco may have something to do with such broil as the following of which i be a witness two fellow quarrel violently and be on the point of stick one another with they knife when up step a third party and cry out what do you intend to act like christian and kill one another at the talismanic word of eusara -lrb- christian or nazareen -rrb- they instantly desist and become friend the term christian or nazareen be one of the most oppobrious name with which the people of mogador can abuse one another the wedding and attendant feast of the jew be the more remarkable when we consider the circumstance of the social state of this oppressed race in morocco they precarious condition and the numberless insult and oppression inflict on they by both the government and the people i be present at several of these wedding and shall give the reader a glimpse of they i have read and hear a great deal about the persecution of the jew in morocco and be therefore not a little surprised to meet with these continual feast and festival among a people so much talk about as victim of mussulman oppression i find two sentence in my note contain the pith of the whole the jew continue they feast about a third of they time be spend in feast again -- amidst all they degradation the jew we see to-day recreate themselves to the utmost extent of they capacity of enjoyment it appear that during the time i be at mogador there be a unusual number of wedding and then follow the feast of the passover i think whilst i be at tangier wedding or celebration of wedding be go on every night it may be safely assert that no people in barbary enjoy themselves more than the jew or more pamper and gratify they appetite what with wedding feast and obligatory festival they existence be one round of eating and drinking these feast besides do not take place in a corner nor be they barricade from public or envious or inquisitorial view but be open to all be attend by christian moor and arab these wedding-feast be substantial thing here be the entry in my journal of a account of they : a bullock be kill at the house of the bridegroom tea and cake and spirit be freely nay universally distribute there the company afterwards go off with the bridegroom to the house of the bride where another distribution of the same kind take place whilst half of the bullock be bring for the bride 's friend here the bridegroom in true oriental style mount upon a couch of damask and gold the bride laden with bridal ornament of gold and jewel and cover with a gauze veil be lead out by the woman and place by he side she be then leave alone to sit in state as queen of the feast whilst the company regale themselves with every imaginable luxury of eating and drink she future husband now produce as a present for he bride a splendid pair of jewelled ear-ring which be hold up amidst the scream approbation of the guest the jewess present be weigh down under the dead weight of a profusion of jewel and gold tiara of pearl necklace of coral and gem armlet wristlet and leget of silver gold and jet with gold and silver braided gown skirt and petticoat this fiesta be keep up for seven day astonish at the profusion of jewel worn by the various guest i receive a solution by a question i ask touch this mavellous circumstance the greater part of the jewel wear on these occasion be borrow from friend and neighbor they must belong to some of the jewish family and they quantity shew the great wealth possess by the jew live under this despotic government i assist at the celebration of the nuptials of a portion of the family of the feather merchant a rich and powerful firm establish in the south for the purchase of ostrich-feather this be a wedding of great _ éclat _ all the native jewish aristocracy of mogador be invite to it the festivity begin at noon i first enter the apartment where the bride be sit in state she be elevated on a radiant throne of gold and crimson cushion amidst a group of woman she hire flatterer who keep singing and bawl out she praise as beautiful as the moon be rachel say one fairer than the jessamine exclaim another sweeter than honey in the honey-comb ejaculate a third she eye be shut it be deem immodest to look on the company and the feature of she face motionless as death which make she look like a paint corpse to describe the dress of the bride would be tedious as she be carry away every hour and redress go through and exhibit to public view with the greatest patience the whole of she bridal wardrobe she face be artistically paint cheek vermillion lip brown with a odoriferous composition eye-lash blacken with antimony and on the forehead and tip of the chin little blue star the palm of the hand and nail be stain with henna or brown-red and she foot be naked with the toe-nail and sole henna-stained she be very young perhaps not more than thirteen and hugely corpulent have be feed on paste and oil these last six month for the occasion the bridegroom on the contrary be a man of three time she age tall lank and bony very thin and of sinister aspect the woman be a little lump of fat and flesh apparently without intelligence whilst the man be a barbary type of dickens ' fagan the lady have now arrange themselves in tier one above the other and most gorgeous be the sight most of they wear tiara all flame with gem and jewel they be literally cover from head to foot with gold and precious stone as each lady have but ten finger it be necessary to tie some score of ring on they hair the beauty of the female form in these woman be quite destroy by this excessive quantity of jewellery these jewel be chiefly pearl brilliant ruby and emerald they be amass and descend as heir-loom in family from mother to daughter some of the jewel be very ancient they constitute the riches of many family in reverse of fortune they be pledge or turn into money to relieve immediate necessity the upper tier of lady be the youngest and least adorn and consequently the prettiest the ancient dowager sit below as so many queen enthrone challenging scrutiny and admiration they be mostly of enormous corpulency spread out they naked foot and trousered leg of a enormous expanse several dowager seem scarcely to be able to breathe from heat and the plethora of they own well-fed and pampered flesh we have now music and several attempt be make to get up the indecent moorish dance which however be forbid as too vulgar for such fashionable jew and honor by the presence of european not much pleased with this spectacle i look out of the window into the patio or court-yard where i see a couple of butcher ' boy slaughter a bullock for the evening carousal a number of boy be dip they hand in the blood and make with it the representation of a outspread hand on the door post and wall for the purpose of keep off the evil eye -lrb- _ el ojo maligno _ -rrb- and so ensure good luck to the new married couple i then mount the house-top to see a game play by the young man here on the flat roof be assemble a court with a sultan sit in the midst various prisoner be try and condemn two or three of the greatest culprit be then secure and drag down to the lady the officer of justice inform they that if no one step forward to rescue they it be the sultan 's order that they should be imprison several young jewess now clamourously demand they release it be understand that these compassionate maiden who on such occasion step forward to the rescue and take one of the young man by the hand be willing to accept of the same when it may hereafter be offer to they in marriage so the contagion of wedding-feast spread and one marriage make many i now proceed to the supper-table of the man where the party eat and drink to gluttonous satiety several rabbi be hire to chant over the supper-table prayer compose of portion of scripture and legend of the talmud the dinning noise of bad music and horrible scream call singing with the surfeit of the feast lay I up for two day afterwards the man sup by themselves and the woman of course be also apart my host anxious that i should see all insist upon my go to have a peep at the lady whilst they be sup unlike we man who sit up round a table because there be several european among we the woman lay sprawl and roll on carpet and couch in they own allotted apartment these gorgeous daughter of israel look still more huge and enormous feast almost to repletion like so many princess of the royal orgy of belshazzar but this be a native wedding and of course when we consider the education of these barbary woman we must expect when they have drink like the man white spirit for protracted hour until midnight the propriety of society be easily dispense with happily the class of woman who so keep up the feast be all say to be marry the maiden have go home with the bride very different indeed be another distinguish wedding at which i have the honor of assist and which all the european consul and they family attend with the _ élite _ of the society of mogador this be the marriage of m bittern of gibraltar with miss amram melek the bridegroom be the portuguese consul the bride the daughter of the greatest jewish merchant of the south and consequently the emperor 's greatest and most honor debtor the celebration of this wedding last fourteen day on the grand day a ball and supper be give all the moor of the town come to see the christian and they lady dance we musician or fiddler keep away from some petty pique and we be accordingly reduce to the hard necessity of make use of a drum and whistle both to keep up we spirit and serve up the quadrille we have however some good singing to make up for the disappointment he excellency the governor intend to have honor we with he presence but he give way to the remonstrance of a inflexible marabout who declare it a deadly sin to attend the marriage of jew and christian the marriage guest be of three or four several set and sort there be the european coterie the choicest and most select grace by the presence of the bride then the native aristocrat and here be the gorgeous sultana and fezan spouse then the lesser star and the still more diminish finally the blind the lame and the halt surround the door of the house in which the marriage-feast be hold receive a portion of the good thing of this life the whole number of guest be not more than two hundred plenty of european jewess shine as bewitching star at this wedding but all _ param _ to we poor christian indeed there be as little as no lovemaking and match-making amongst the isolate nazarene for out of a population of some fifty european family there be only two marriageable christian lady the bride be frequently fetch by the bridegroom at midnight when there be a cry make behold the bridegroom cometh go ye forth to meet he -lrb- matt xxv -- 6 -rrb- this ancient custom prevail most among the moor once whilst at nabal in tunis i be rouse from my sleep at the dead of the night by wild cry and the discharging of fire-arm attend with a blaze of torch the bridegroom be convey he bride to he home a crowd of the friend of the newly-married couple follow the camel which carry the precious burden all be admit to the feast in the court-yard and the door be shut for the night at the wedding of the lower class of the jew after dancing and music there be always a collection make for the bride or the musician on these occasion the master of the ceremony call out the name of the donor as they contribute to the support of the festivity i be somewhat take by surprise to hear my name call out bashador inglez -lrb- english ambassador -rrb- when i attend one of the wedding but the fellow make the announcement attract my attention more than he flattering compliment he be dress in moorish costume with a immense white turban fold round he head i could not conceive the reason of a moor take such interest in feast of the jew the secret soon transpire he be a renegade who have apostatize for the sake of marry a pretty girl he heart be always with he brethren and the authority good-naturedly allow he to be master of the ceremony at these and other feast to preserve order or rather to prevent the jew from be insult by the mahometan there be always a few jewish renegade in large moorish town just enough i imagine to convince the mahometan of the superiority of they religion to that of other nation for whilst they obtain convert from both jew and christian and make proselyte of score of black they never hear of apostate from islamism the manner however in which these renegade abandon they religion be no very evident proof of the divine authority of the prophet of mecca here be a instance a boy of this town run away from he father and prostrate himself before the governor implore he to make he a mussulman the governor actuate by the most rational and proper feeling remark to the boy you be a child you have not arrive at year of discretion you have not intellect enough to make a choice between two religion the boy be keep confine one night then beat and send home in the morning another case happen like this when the boy be admit within the pale of islamism jewish boy will often cry out when they father be correct they i will turn mussulman a respectable jew who relate this to I observe be i to hear any of my son cry out in this manner i would immediately give they a dose of poison and finish they i could not bear to see my child form into mussulman devil it really seem the vulgar opinion among the jew and moor of this place that female have no soul i ask many woman themselves about the matter they reply we do not care if we have no soul a rabbi observe if woman bear child make good wife and live virtuously and chastely they will go to heaven and enjoy a immortal existence if not after death they will suffer annihilation this appear to be the opinion of all the well-educated but a jewish lady who hear my conversation with the rabbi retort with spirit : whether i bear child or not if my husband or any man have a soul i have one likewise for be not all man bear of we woman all however be well satisfy with this life whatever may happen in the next male and female jew and mussulman hold on they mutual career with the greatest tenacity i make inquiry about suicide and be tell there be never any person so foolish as to kill themselves we leave it to the emperor to take away a man 's life if such be the will of god and yet the moor be habitually a grave dreamy and melancholy people no doubt the light buoyant atmosphere keep they from fall into such a state of mental prostration as to induce suicide i now find that many people look upon I in the language of the jewish renegade as a ambassador and some go so far as to say i can make war with the emperor if i like other persist in say i be go in search of the murder davidson a man take the liberty of tell mr elton a very mysterious christian have arrive from the sultan of the english the governor hearing that he have order a pair of moorish shoe send word to the shoemaker to be as long about they as possible this nazarene be go to disguise himself as one of we in order to spy out we country the moor be certainly a timid and suspicious race they feel they weakness and they be frightened of any christian who do not come to they country on commercial pursuit as a sportsman or in some directly intelligible character chapter vii interview with the governor of mogador on the address of the anti-slavery society -- day and night side of the mission

be place encumber with great liability to he highness ' custom-house i already abandon all hope of success and even think myself fortunate in be able to obtain a interview with the governor of this

the message of the sultan allude to be in substance to give up the attempt of abolish slavery in morocco and not to think of go to the south but to return at once to england the governor be greatly please with the sound of he own voice and the skill of he argumentation and have the character of be a loquacious and reasoning diplomatist this be the public or day side of the mission there be also the night side for where the curiosity of the moor be excite it must be gratify by fair or other mean it be not surprising therefore that the wily shereef should wish to know what this address of a english society be or could be and if possible to obtain a copy although for the sake of the people it be find necessary to repudiate altogether its acceptance accordingly the next day cohen tell I a friend of the emperor 's be anxious to have some conversation with I and he beg I to take with I the address it be past ten at night when alone with my moorish guide i find myself tread the long narrow street of mogador the wind howl and the watch-dog bark it be so dark that we could scarcely grope we way no human being be about we go up one street and down another steal along we way as if on some house-breaking expedition and i begin to feel suspicious fear a trap might be lay for I still i have confidence in the honor of the moor i say to my guide when shall we reach you master 's _ guide _ -- god know be quiet we continue go through street after street it be now bitter cold and a few drop of rain fall from the cut wing of the north wind to my guide again where be the house _ guide _ -- follow I do not talk after we have pass other street be this the street _ guide _ -- eskut -lrb- hold you tongue -rrb- we now enter a low dilapidated gateway with a broken panelled door groan on its hinge again i question my guide who live here _ guide _ -- mahboul ingleez -lrb- mad englishman -rrb- hold you tongue do you think we mussulman will eat you we pass through several court-yard by the aid of a lantern which the guide find in a corner and then enter a corridor here he grasp I by the arm in such wise as make I believe i be about to have my head thrust through a bowstring i ejaculate allah akbar mercy upon we blend arabic and english in my fright and struggle fall with the guide against the door at the end of the passage with a considerable crash a voice be hear from within _ ashbeek _ -lrb- what be the matter -rrb- my guide return _ hale _ -lrb- open -rrb- a huge negro now lay hold of I and pull I up a pair of narrow stair which lead to a species of loft in a detach portion of the house the case contain the address fall out of my hand and be pick up by the guide another apartment within the loft be now open shew through a dim and indistinct light a venerable old moor sit in the midst of heap of papers and book like a midnight astrologer or a secret magician on we entrance the solitary moor raise he eye quietly and say faintly where be it my guide now rush in begin talk volubly and make this harangue think however i could not understand he from the rapidity with which he declaim sidus he say this christian be a frightened fool -- and a _ baheen _ -lrb- ass -rrb- -- i have the greatest trouble to get he here -- he be frighten out of himself -- and now allah allah i have to take he back again i receive the compliment in silence and endeavor to recover my tranquillity but i could not help remark the contrast between my noisy and agitate guide and the grave manner and immoveable quietness of the recluse the guide then hand he the address and the cid open the box or case with extreme caution as if it have contain some mysterious spell the cid now look up for a moment at the big negro who decamp instantly and return with a teapot and two cup the two cup be then fill with tea one of which be present to I but i have some hesitation about drink it the cid look up at I with a quiet smile and gently mutter _ eshrub _ -lrb- drink -rrb- i drink the tea and then wait anxiously to know what be come next the cid continue to unroll the address when this be do he roll it up and again unroll it and stare at its roman character he eye the seal and ejaculate _ haram _ to himself allude i suppose to the figure of the slave in chain it be prohibit to make figure the cid now pause a moment then look at I again and finally turn to the guide say _ imshee el-ghudwah _ -lrb- go to-morrow i 'll see -rrb- the guide now grasp I again by the hand scarcely allow I to bow a good night to the cid and lead I back to my lodgings where i arrive at midnight when i awake in the morning i really imagine i have be dream a ugly dream until one of the english jew call and say he be make a translation of the address to be dispatch to the emperor at morocco and afterwards he would bring the address back the address be return to I about a week afterwards but whether a arabic translation be ever send to the sultan i know no more than the reader mr phillip have apply to the british vice-consul to know whether in case of he go up to morocco to carry a present for the belgium merchant here phillip be a jew will be oblige to pull off he shoe which would be deprive he of the rights of british-born subject who stand with they shoe on in the shereefian presence the consul say he can not answer the question and must send a dispatch to mr hay mr willshire compliment phillip : ah phillip you be always propose to I some knotty question you profoundly perplex the mind of mr consul-general hay this lead I to notice the affect case of the israelite darmon at one time the french vice-consul at mazagran this young darmon be fond of moorish woman and always intriguing with they hay mousa governor of mazagran report he to the emperor and he highness send order to have he decapitate it be say afterwards by the maroquine government that the order be merely to bring he to morocco and that when be convey as prisoner and after attempt to run away the soldier of he escort shoot he the moorish government also pretend that darmon attempt first to shoot the guard who shoot he in self-defence with regard to he be a french consul it be say by the french government that he be not they consul at the time have resign it appear besides that member of he family be french and other moorish subject indeed these mauro-european jew give great trouble to the consul the various person of a single family be often under the protection of three or four consul it will thus be see how full of difficulty be this darmon affair and what a door it open to tedious moorish diplomacy the french government arrange ultimately with the sultan a compromise a sum of money be pay to the murder man 's family and the governor of mazagran be dismiss when young darmon fall into disgrace he father one of the imperial merchant be at morocco the father inquire of the minister whether the sultan would receive he present now he son have fall into disgrace the cruelly avaricious tyrant deign to accept it of the father it be say at the very moment when the order to decapitate he son have be send to mazagran no doubt it be a barbarous action but the extreme imprudence of the young man provoke the government to extremity the court be so irritated at the time that it even issue a order to place all jew native foreigner or european upon the same level of exposure to moorish insult and oppression speaking to mr willshire about this order he smilingly observe : say nothing it will soon be forget the government never intend to carry it out year ago the emperor give order that jew come from european country should be place on the same footing as native jew but the imperial edict be unnoticed a curious order be give about smoke some time ago in this city it be represent to the governor that during ramadan kafer-nazarene go about smoking occasion the faithful to sniff up the smoke and so break the holy fast the christian be likewise accuse of go near the mosque to fill they with filthy smoke the governor in a circular begged of the consul to prohibit they countryman or subject from smoking in the street the french consul consider this a police regulation summon together the french subject and beg of they to comply with the non-smoking order mr willshire take no notice of the affair know it would soon pass over mr willshire be a veteran in morocco and understand the genius of its government he consider the _ laissez faire _ system the very best and this be all very well provide the sultan respect the head of she majesty 's subject haj mousa governor of mazagran who be mix up with the darmon affair deserve notice from he brutal ferocity towards european with great difficulty and damage to they life european reside in mazagran and it be not therefore surprising that the imprudent darmon fall into the clutch of this provincial tyrant who probably ensnare he as a prey up to the time of this affair haj mousa have be a irremoveable governor the sultan himself never attempt to displace he although he have commit from time to time the greatest enormity other governor have be bleed fleece and impale over and over again but the caitiff haj always remain in possession of the fruit of he tyranny the reason for this tolerant conduct of the emperor towards he be that when muley abd errahman be in difficulty and oblige to fly for he life in the convulsion previous to he reign haj mousa send the young prince a mule and thirty ducat with this the prince be enable to escape and he save he life to be afterwards proclaimed meer-el-moumeneen on receive the mule and money he exclaim in a transport of gratitude to the governor of mazagran i will never forget you it be unfortunate the good faith of the emperor 's word have be so deplorably abuse by this tyrant for it be consider certain that though temporarily remove from mazagran he will return or be make governor of another city a sous jew call upon I one day who be well acquaint with the shelouh or berber of the south on ask if he would make a translation of the book of genesis from hebrew into shelouh he reply : no i can not in the first place the emperor would cut off my head for do such a thing and again it would be a sin to convert the holy hebrew character into such a language of infidel we continue we discussion on a more practical subject _ traveller _ -lrb- to the jew -rrb- -- i be tell that among you jew of morocco it be a merit to rob we christian and the moor you young child be even praise by they mother if they commit a theft without be find out : -lrb- 27 -rrb- be this right _ the jew _ -- you be all _ goyeem _ -lrb- 28 -rrb- -lrb- gentile -rrb- but it be not true that we rob you christian if we rob mussulman it be because they rob we first the case really be the jew be literally be rob every day by the moor one way or the other and if the people do not rob they the constitute authority continue to make exaction under every pretence i be inclined nevertheless to think without prejudice that it be a receive maxim with _ all native _ barbary jew to rob unbeliever moor and christian when you can do so _ safely _ this be the opinion which a very respectable european jew resident in tuni entertain of he brethren at the same time ihere be numerous exception many of the lower class of moor likewise think there be little or no harm in rob jew and black that be all who be infidel and christian i may mention in connection with the above the system of false-weight which be a enormous scandal to this great commercial city it appear that almost every tradesman and every imperial merchant have two set of weight one to buy and another to sell with a merchant once have the impudence to cry out to he clerk when weigh oh you be wrong these be my _ sell _ weight bring I my _ buy _ weight be i not buy a jew once purchase oil from a poor arab carry he villainy so far as actually to make he tare and tret weigh more than the skin-bag when full of oil and coolly tell the amaze arab he have no money to give he for the value receive give I back my oil cry the arab at this the audacious jew retort there be none a european merchant interfere and save the jew from the bastinado he so richly deserve a kady hearing of these abomination take upon himself to begin a reform and go about examine weight for he honest pain and in the midst of he work of reform the officious functionary receive a order from the sultan enjoin he to cease he interference and condemn he as a punishment for he over-righteousness _ to teach twelve little boy to read every day and not to sit at he own door for the space of one year _ so unthankful so odious be the task of reform in morocco and many other country this account of the abominable system of two kind of weight i derive from most unquestionable authority otherwise i could not have give credit to the statement there be incessant rumor of war from the north the emperor have get himself into difficulty with spain and france order have be send down to reinforce this garrison and that of aghadir the day before the governor call he troops before he do not shew he usual good sense and prudence he thus harangue they : -- now let those who want new arm come and take they and bring back the old one let all have courage and fear not the christian fear not woman and child the movement of troops be part of a general measure extend to all the coast and be in fact a review _ en masse _ of the disposable force throughout the empire eighty thousand man be expect in this city or the suburb the sultan be report to be on the march towards the north with a army of 200000 man the sultan do not expect to make use of he new levy but the policy of the thing be good he highness be evidently a pacific ruler he have but few regular troops and he pay they badly he predecessor have a large army and pay they well great discontent prevail among the soldier and the emperor never feel himself secure on he throne this apparent crusade against the infidel have no doubt tend to make he popular and to consolidate he power true it excite the tribe of the interior against the christian but it be better to inflame they against the christian than to lose he own throne the french consul wait upon the governor for explanation about the movement of the troops he excellency observe i be order by my sultan to defend this city against all assailant and i shall do so till i be bury beneath its ruin though all the coast-city be capture mogador should never be surrender some of the credulous moor say the shereef will come from tafilet lead on by we lord mahomet and destroy all the curse nazarene the sheeref will fire against the french leaden ball and silver ball another observe to I if a fleet should come here it will be immediately sink because we sultan have order every ball to hit and none to miss this be not unlike what a turk of tripolus once say to I about the grand signor and he late reform the turk will soon be civilized because the sultan have give a order for all the turk to be civilized the large gun of the fort be practice and the gun of the grand battery load the infantry continue to practice on the beach of the port : they maneuver be very uncouth and disorderly they merely move backwards and forwards in line of two deep the french consul monsieur jorelle discontinue he usual promenade to prevent he be insult and so to avoid the the painful necessity of demand satisfaction mr willshire be well know to the mogador population have not so much to fear here be the advantage of a long residence in a country the french government lose by the frequent change of they consul still m jorelle be right in not expose himself to the mob or the wild levy who have come from they mountain the fault of the governor be in exciting the warlike fanaticism of the tribe of the interior against the christian which he ought to have know the city authority might have extreme difficulty in keep within bound no european could pass the gate of the city without be spat upon and curse by the barbarous berber i pay a visit to m authori the belgium merchant and the only european trader carry on business independently of the emperor he represent the commerce of the country to be in a most deplorable condition there be now nothing to buy or sell on which there be a gain of one per cent the improvidence of the people be so great that should one harvest fail inevitable famine would be the result there not be a single bushel of grain more in the country than be require for daily consumption nor will the people avail themselves of any opportunity of purchase a thing cheap when it be cheap they simply provide for they hourly want they act in the literal sense of ` take no thought for the morrow but let the morrow take care of itself ' as to the jews they feast one day and fast the next with regard to the excitement then exist m authori observe this government on hearing rumor of spanish and french expedition against the country must naturally make use of what power it have the holy war power to excite the people in they own defense the moor can not discriminate gazette intelligence when a worthless newspaper mention a expedition be fit out against morocco the emperor immediately see a fleet of ship within sight of he port and hear the report of bombard cannon the raw levy of shedmah and hhaha continue to enter the town but only a small number at a time lest they should alarm the inhabitant they go about peep into house and wherever a door be open they would walk in stare with a wild curiosity i have some conversation with my moorish friend respect the abolition of slavery a old doctor observe the english be not more humane than other nation but god have decree that they should destroy the slave-trade among the christian this however be no praise to they for they could not resist act accord to the will and mind of god as for the mussulman what they do be for the benefit of slave especially female who one and all be doom to death -lrb- 29 -rrb- but when purchase by the slave-dealer they life be spare and they be make true believer still the mussulman would assist the english in destroy the ship which carry slave -lrb- as if the moor have any fleet -rrb- the number of slave in this city be from eight hundred to one thousand it be difficult to ascertain any thing like the exact number the opulent moor have many negress slave with whom they live in a state of concubinage young rich and fashionable moor i be tell for the first time in a mahommedan country have become disgusted with the old habit of managing and take a wife early and adopt the immoral practice of buy female slave by which they avoid as they say the trouble and expense of marry female of they own rank in moorish society a good mussulman must however marry once in he life slave be import viâ wadnoun from timbuctoo and soudan and even from the western coast negro of the timbuctoo market be more esteemed than those of guinea be a stronger and more laborious race the common price of a slave in mogador be from 60 to 90 ducat one day a beautiful african girl freshly export from the interior be sell for 160 ducat or about # 20 sterling this be consider a extraordinary high price slave be sell by crier about the street in morocco and most town and not in bazaar as in the east but the most remarkable feature of slavery in this part of the world be the christian or european slavery carry further south in the region extend on the line of coast below wadnoun and the adjacent sahara something like a regular system of christian slavery be there go on whilst its head-quarter be not more than five or six day ' journey from this residence of the european consul this white slavery consist in seize shipwrecked sailor number be fisherman from the canary island we know little about these poor captive although we be so near wadnoun and be continually trade with sous and this country mr davidson casually mention they in he journal it be a settle and religious practice of merchant to keep european ignorant of the south and the desert we only hear of these captive now and then when one escape and after be buy and sell by a hundred different master be fortunate enough to be redeem of he companion in shipwreck the escape captive rarely know anything they be go : they be either drown near the coast plunder and massacre or carry far away into the desert and perhaps for ever formerly vessel navigate through the channel -lrb- if it may be so call -rrb- of the canary island and the wadnoun coast by which they often get on shoal water and be cast away in this manner whites be enslave happily now master of vessel have become acquaint with this dangerous coast they pass to the east of the canary and fewer vessel be shipwreck hereabouts the spanish fisherman of the canary be chiefly now make captive these poor people be either seize when becalm near the coast or capture on be cast on shore by the furious trade-wind which sweep these desolate shore -lrb- often nine month out of twelve -rrb- and carry utter destruction with they the wild and wander bedouin in bad weather with the true storm scent of the wrecker patiently watch the coast pounce on they prey with the voracity of the vulture as it be throw up from the deep along the inhospitable shore have get the shipwrecked man in they possession they act with the cunning and avarice of slave-dealer and be aid by the still craftier jew who always render it very difficult for the consular agent to redeem these unhappy captive for although a jew by the mahometan law can not purchase slave yet by buy them-through mussulman who share in the profit from the arab who first seize the captive the slave be frequently keep back month in the desert be part from one another before they can be ransom sometimes the arab alluringly question they captive to see if they understand any mechanical art which be greatly esteem be very useful in these almost tenantless region and should they discover that they do they carry they away into hopeless captivity through the wild of the desert refuse to sell they at any price or offer of ransom but those who can not or will not make themselves useful be generally redeem by the mogador consul should they escape be massacre in the quarrel of the arab for the booty when they be first capture there be at the present time a spanish fisherman near wadnoun wait to be redeem the arab sheikh who hold he demand two hundred dollar for he redemption mr wiltshire object to the price as be too much besides this he be afraid to advance any money for a spanish captive 's release lest it should never be refund the spanish government represent a people so chivalrous in bygone time and so proud of they ancient exploit over the moor of this very country be not now-a-days over zealous in redeem they countryman hold in bondage by these people mr willshire ransom a spanish boy and wait several year before he could get this imbecile government to refund the money espartero at last however interfere authoritatively for the repayment to we generous consul in the present case of the poor fisherman the captive spaniard linger between hope and fear he only protection be the avarice of he master who like all slave-dealer be willing to take care of he as he take care of he horse he be one out of four the other three have be massacre by the arab or perish on the coast but at present we know nothing certain of this although but a few day ' journey from the scene where the disaster take place -- so miserable be we means of information for enable we to put a end to this system of christian slavery certainly some representation should be make to the emperor who pretend to have jurisdiction over wadnoun and the adjacent country that these captive may be deliver up to the consul of mogador a fair remuneration might be give to the person bring they safely to this town i be tell the ironmonger ' company of london have at they disposal fund for the liberation of such british captive as be enslave in southern morocco this money be leave by a merchant who himself be make a slave there and since that time owe to the few british captive redeem it have increase to a enormous amount not know what to do with the money the company it be say be about to petition parliament to build a school with a portion but i should suggest that it would be more in accordance with the original object and declare intention of the benevolent donor be this large surplus fund devote to the redemption of all other christian captive of whatever nation or country because two hundred dollar be not forthcoming which could easily be supply from the ironmonger ' company 's fund a poor spaniard be condemn to a cruel and hopeless slavery wander in the wild of the great african wilderness it be impossible to tell the number of christian slave who perish in the south of morocco many of the consular agent of this city be as ignorant of the country as person reside in london this subject absolutely demand the attention of the government of europe we humanity and civilization be in question the opinion of the jew here be the same as those of american slave-holder with this slight difference that they consider it right to make slave of white man and european as well as of black man negro and african in which idea they be more consistent than they yankee men-selling brethren as there be many barbary jew at mogador more or less under british protection i take the liberty of remind they of they liability as british subject by circulate among they copy of lord brougham 's act i have some conversation with rabbi-el melek and other jew about the question of abolition _ traveller _ -- what be the opinion of the jew of this country on the matter of slavery _ rabbi-el-melek _ -- i will show you -lrb- take the hebrew bible he read -rrb- ` curse be canaan a servant of servant shall he be unto he brethren ' _ traveller _ -- admit the curse pronounce here be right that ham and canaan be the progenitor of the african negro and that the curse be to be extend to all generation of africa -- be these reason why the all-merciful deity will hold man guiltless who enslave and maltreat poor african now the jew have be disperse all over the world and maltreat if not enslave by both christian and mahometan -lrb- as now -rrb- accord to prophecy but will god hold we guiltless for persecute or maltreat you jew _ the rabbi _ -- but we be the slave of god not of you christian and besides we be command to treat well we slave in the scripture here he quote many passage from the pentateuch then follow a desultory conversation some assert that inasmuch as the slavery of the whites be permit by god how much more right have they to enslave black who be the servant of servant other even add if we be sovereign of morocco we should make slave of both mahometan and christian this indeed be the genuine feeling of barbary jew oppression beget oppression and wrong beget revenge another observe if you ask I what i think as a british subject and not as a jew i will give you my opinion against slavery such distinction in moral be not easily admissable but the jew there be acute enough to make they and be as good jesuit as those of rome some cite the cavtivity of joseph we as a reason for carry on the slave-trade on another occasion i have a conversation with hassan yousef the high priest or archbishop as captain phillip call he the chief priest acknowledge that he who steal a man whether white or black be condemn to death accord to the fair interpretation of the mosaic law he and all jew be much astonished at the tenor of lord brougham 's act and get not a little frightened for all the merchant of mogador christian and jew more or less aid and abet the slave-trade all have connection with slave-dealer at length we jewish archbishop opine well well it be better now since the christian have put down slavery in most of they country that we jew should follow they example it would be useful and might subserve the cause of civilization be the jew of europe to take some means of enlighten they brethren of north africa on the question of slavery the israelite who have suffer so much from slavery and oppression after become free themselves should endeavor to emancipate those who be still in the chain of bondage the hhaha levy be about to return to they country the disposable force of this province be about 70000 the troops from shedma be to come in after the departure of those of hhaha government be afraid to bring both together lest they should fight among themselves allude to the quarrel of they sultan with the french these hostile tribe mutter to each other we must kill we own french first that be to say they own hereditary enemy i go out to see the two levy these tribe have a singularly wild and savage aspect with only a blanket to cover they which they wrap round and round they body have neither cap on they head nor shoe on they foot they be greatly excite against the christian owe to the foolish conduct of the moorish authority the lawless band spat at I and every european passing by they scream with threatening gesture god curse you infidel these semi-savage call out for the defense of the empire be merely arm with a bad gun or matchlock some have only knife and club such levy be certainly more fit to pillage the emperor 's coast-town than to defend he territory against the foreign enemy these poor tribe bring they own provision a little barley meal and olive or argan-oil or liquid butter on this be exhaust they could stay no longer for government supply they with nothing but bad matchlock they be loud in they complaint on not receive any nation and threaten to join the french nazarene when they arrive he excellency the governor be very anxious to get rid of they which be not at all surprising so avaricious be the emperor that when he can he make the rich moor supply arm for they poorer brethren instead of furnish they from government depôts and this he insist upon as a point of religion the governor call upon rich moor to supply the poor with arm a friend of mine who understand shelouh as well as arabic overheard a characteristic quarrel between a shedma man and a hhaha man the shedma people or inhabitant of the plain mostly speak arabic those of the mountain shelouh which difference of language embitter they quarrel and alienate they from one another shedma man -- dog you have put you hand of the devil into my bag of barley hhaha man -- dog and jew you lie shedma man -- jew and frenchman there be some one now in you wife 's tent hhaha man -- religion of the frenchman you mother have be dishonour a thousand time the maternal honor be the dearest of thing amongst these semi-barbarian at the mention of this libel on he mother the shedma fellow rush at the hhaha man seize he by the throat and unsheathe a dirk to plunge into he bowels the scuffle fortunately excite the instant attention of a group of arab close by who secure both carry they before the shiekh who without hear the subject of the quarrel bastinado they both with he own hand but he be the hhaha sheikh and the shedma sheikh complain to the governor of he man have be bastinado by the other sheikh the governor dismiss they each threaten the other with due vengeance it be time to give some account of mogador we sometimes spell the name with a e mogadore the inhabitant call they town _ shweerah _ square -lrb- 30 -rrb- in allusion to its beauty for it be the only town construct altogether on geometrical principle throughout morocco its form however be really a triangle mogador be a modern city have be build in the year 1760 of we era by the sultan sidus mohamm under the direction of a french engineer of the name of cornut who be assist by spanish renegade the object of sidus mahommed be to find a central emporium of the commerce of the empire and a port for the southern capital

sixty state prisoner some of whom have be bashaw or minister of this and former reign the isle however be finely situate off the atlantic fan and sweep by healthy gale and the prisoner suffer only seclusion from the continent the exile never attempt to escape but quietly submit to they destiny in the port there be only ten or twelve foot of water at ebb tide so that large vessel can not enter but must lie at anchor a mile and a half off the western battery which extend along the north-western side of the port such vessel do not lie there except in the summer month and then with extreme caution be as they be right off in the atlantic on one of its most dangerous coast there be some tolerable battery but they can not long resist a european bombardment which be demonstrate by the french colonel keating say as far as parapet rampart embrasure cavalier battery and casemate constitute a fortress this town be one but the wall be flimsy the cavalier do not command the battery do not flash and the casemate be not bomb-proof the embrasure be so close that not one in three upon the rampart could be work if they be mount which they be not all they gun which have be only twelve month here be already in very bad order from exposure to the climate and surf the casemate be so damp that they interior be cover constantly with a thick nitrous incrustation nevertheless the moor

perseverance have be plant in the sand of the sea-shore this be a remarkable instance of human culture turn the most hopelessly sterile portion of the world to account these sand of mogador be only a portion of a vast and almost interminable link which girdle the north-western coast of the african continent and be only break in upon at short interval from morocco to senegal like a shift heaving and ever-varying rampart against the aggression of the ocean both wind and sea have probably equally contribute to the formation of this vast belt of shift sand the distance from tangier to mogador by ordinary courier be twelve day but no traveller could be expect to perform the journey in less than twenty day other courier distance be as follow : tangier to rabat 4 day rabat to fez 2 day fez to

say the population of aghadir be forty-seven mohammedan and sixty-two jew at fonte the port be about two hundred moor be any european power to conquer morocco aghadir would certainy be re-establish as the center of the commerce in the south to a maritime nation like england the repair and re-opening of its fine port would be the 6rst consideration and doubtless a lucrative and extensive commerce could be establish between aghadir and timbuctoo the city be seven league south of cape gheer in latitude 30 ° 35 ' i shall now give some further detail illustrative of the state of negro slavery the fniperor have a entire quarter of the city of morocco appropriate for he own slave the number of whom in different part of the empire amount to upward of sixty thousand this be he the lion 's share he imperial highness who be accept present from various governor lately receive five hundred slave from the sheikh of taradant the trading moor believe I to be send by the british government to purchase and liberate all they slave have calculate the whole of the slave in morocco to be worth twenty-seven million of dollar a moor observe i hope to see any calamity befall the country rather than that of the slave be liberate he observe : god shew he approbation of slavery by not permit slave to rise against they master or the free negro to invade morocco who be infinitely more numerous the reason why the english abolish slavery be because the queen of england have a good heart but mussulman treat they slave well and do not fear the anger of god when i mention that the bey of tuni and the imaum of muscat have enter into treaty for the suppression of slavery the trader observe amongst the mohammetan be four sect but the only orthodox sect be that of morocco there be however one class of abolitionist in this country -- the woman or mooress the rumor that a christian have come to purchase all the slave of mogador soon penetrate the harem the wife of one of the most distinguished moor of mogador inform a jewess of she acquaintance that she be very happy to hear a christian be come to purchase all she husband 's slave for she be tire of she life with they the truth be respectable moorish female detest this system of domestic slavery and wish to see it abolish notwithstanding that they be breed in it and be themselves little better than slave they see themselves gradually abandon by the husband of they youth for the most ignorant and degraded negress slave whom they husband purchase one after another as they caprice or passion excite they until they house be fill with these slave the artful negress absorb all the affection of she master whilst the legitimate wife be leave as a widow and be oblige to wait upon these pampered slave whose insolence know no bound the negress slave besides when they bear son be treat with great respect they child be free by the law and can not be dispose of although the moor do sell they when hard press for money yet even these negress be begin to chatter and clatter about the anti-slavery mission express they satisfaction to we jewish neighbor a negress slave on hearing that a person have come from england to liberate all the slave jump up and call on god to bless the english nation this excitement in the domestic circle of mogador raise the bile of the slave-dealer a fellow of this sort beckon I to come to he as i be pass in the street and thus begin : christian if you dare attempt to go to the south we shall cut you up into ten thousand little piece traveller -- you will not lay a finger upon I nor throw a handful of sand in my face unless it please god slave-dealer -- -lrb- take aback at this reply he draw in he horn -rrb- well how much will you give we apiece for we slave _ traveller _ -- i shall give you nothing you have no right to sell a man a brother like yourself _ slave-dealer _ -- it be we religion _ traveller _ -- it be not you religion to sell mussulman you sell the child of you own slave bear in you house and who be mussulman the slave-dealer puzzle and angry be silent a few minute and then say ah well all 's right all 's from god i receive a visit from a hajee under peculiar circumstance pass through tuni on he return from mecca last year he slave hearing that all the slave be liberate in the country run away in vain he master attempt to catch he there be no christian in the country of the mecca impostor who keep _ manhunt hound _ this be the peculiar glory of christian land tuni be not so go a-head as yankee freedom-land the consequence be the pilgrim leave without he slave he then strange to say apply to I to procure he back he slave think this a good opportunity to agitate the authority here or the question i recommend he to apply to the governor who should write to the emperor and also to the bey of tuni and so forth i have visitor daily who ask I when i should be ready to purchase the slave and liberate they arab from the remotest district come to I and i be tell that there be not a town or district of the empire but have hear of the english go to liberate all the slave of morocco i have studiously avoid give detail of the cruelty and hard bondage of slavery in and around morocco on the contrary i have state it to be the opinion of the european and consul in tangier that slave be well treat in this country such a opinion ought to weigh with all -lrb- 31 -rrb- at the same time in self-defence as a abolitionist and occupy with a mission for the extinction of slavery in this country i must partly uplift the veil however disgust it may be to my reader a portion of the dark side of the picture must be exhibit of the march of slave-caravan over the sahara i shall say nothing -- that be fully report in my previous publication when the slave arrive in morocco they be inarch about in different direction of the country for sale during they passage through a populous district like this where the female be expose to the brutal violence of ten thousand casual visitor or agent of police and government it be the ordinary and revolting practice to adopt means one can not describe for the purpose of preserve they honor private punishment be frequent to my certain knowledge a female slave be tie up by the heelum head downward and after be cruelly flagellate be leave for dead by she pitiless master she be at last cut down at the intercession of she mistress whose humanity get the better of she hatred and jealousy while i be at mogador a negress have two of she child tear away from she to be sell at morocco to pay the debt of she master who be a moor the child be son of the man who sell they into bondage the mother be inconsolable run about distract and probably will never recover from the blow these fact be enough and with any human man they will out-weigh all other instance however numerous of alleged good treatment on the part of moorish slave master -lrb- 32 -rrb- i take a ride with mr elton on the sandy beach there be a fort in ruin at about half a hour 's distance illustrate most emphatically the parable of the man who build he house upon the sand this fort which be to command the southern entrance of the harbor be suppose to be of spanish construction and build about the same time as the city it be once of considerable size and height but be now a fall and ruin mass its foundation upon the sand have give way storm along this shore be often terribly destructive we pass a portion of the hulk of a vessel completely bury in the sand -lrb- 33 -rrb- notwithstanding the sober and taciturn character of the moor he can sometimes indulge himself in pleasantry and caricature the moor have make caricature of the three last emperor assist by some spanish renegade artist : these prince be yezid suleiman and abd errahman yezid be represent as throw away money with one hand and cut off head with the other depict he ferocity in destroy he enemy and he generosity in heap favor on he friend suleiman be represent as read the koran in the character of a devout and good man the present sultan be hit off capitally with one hand hold a bag of money behind he and with the other stretch out before he beg for more h b could not have better caricature the three shereefian sultan the moor affirm that muley abd errahman will keep faith with no one where he avarice be concerned and when he can he will sell a monopoly twice or thrice receive money from each party of he meanness and avarice i adduce two anecdote four year ago muley-abd errahman order some blond for he harem from mr willshire just when i be leave mogador he imperial highness graciously return it to we merchant with the message -- it be too dear not long before a man be murder upon the neutral land of two adjacent province and a thousand dollar be take from he baggage in such case the governor of the district be mulct both for the murder and robbery the emperor claim two thousand dollar from one of the province for the father of the murder man this province escape upon the plea that the murder have not be commit within its territory the other province refuse to satisfy the demand for the same reason he imperial highness then make both province pay 2000 dollar each keep one two thousand for himself for the trouble he have of enforce payment the people of sous not long ago have a quarrel which the emperor foment its sheikh fight he imperial highness send troops to turn the balance of the fray and to pacify the country then he make the belligerent pay each 40000 dollar as pacification-money the value of which he levy on slave in this politic way the imperial miser replenish he coffer and eat up he loving subject i make the acquaintance of mr treppass the austrian consul and chancellor of the french consulate mr treppass have be upward of twenty year in this country and be himself once a imperial merchant but sell he business prefer a small stipend and he liberty to be a vassal of the emperor feed in luxury and lodge in a fine house we have a long conversation upon the various topic connect with this country mr treppass say the present system of the court be resistance to all innovation to all stranger but the pressure of the french on the algerine frontier be agitate the internal state of this country money which in other country go a long way will almost do every thing with the government of morocco it will also effect much with the people some fifty year ago a geneose merchant resident in mogador have the two province of hhaha and shedma under he control and could have make himself sultan over they this he effect solely by the distribution of money the sultan of the time be in open war with a pretender he imperial highness beg for the assistance of the all-powerful merchant the merchant buy the affection and allegiance of the people and firmly establish the sultan on he throne the influence of the merchant be now prodigious and the sultan himself become alarmed not be able to rest and be in hourly dread of the genoese the sultan order he officer to seize the merchant secretly and put he on board a vessel then weigh anchor for europe when the merchant be place on board this message be deliver to he -- we sultan be extremely oblige to you sir for the great service you render he by establish he on he throne but we sultan say ` if you could place he on the throne you could also pull he off again ' therefore you must leave we country we sultan graciously give you a portion of you wealth to carry away with you the officer then ship several chest of money jewel and other valuable to be place to the account of the merchant and the sultan-making genoese quit morocco for ever the moor report to I that the french be build some factory with a fort upon some unclaimed land along the coast equidistant between aghadir and wadnoun it be probably near fort hillsboro of the map and which mr davidson call isgueder a moor be accuse by the authority of mogador of be mix up with the transaction and immediately send to the south where he have not be hear of since another report be that the french be only build a factory the spot of land have near it a small port and a good spring of water quantity of brick and lime have be deposit there french vessel of war from the senegal have be coast and survey up and down touch at the place the new port be call yedoueesai i inquire particularly respect this project but mr treppass state positively that the french have wholly abandon the idea of establish commercial relation with the sheikh of wadnoun or any tribe thereabout whatever might have be they original intention vessel of war have frequently visit the coast of wadnoun finding it the worst in all africa they however now maintain friendly relation with the sheikh in the event of shipwreck or other disaster happen to french vessel nevertheless it be at the particular request of the french consul of mogador that he government break off all communication with the sheikh the emperor have repeatedly complain to the consul against this intercourse assume a commercial or diplomatic character -lrb- 34 -rrb- the whole coast from the port of mogador to the river senegal have be within the last few year survey by the french vessel of war particularly by captain e bouet and there be sufficient evidence in the report of the people and the remonstrance of the maroquine government to prove that the french do attempt a settlement on the part of the coast above state but that it fail the french take the idea of the undertaking from davidson who propose to lord palmerston to enter into communication with the sheikh of wadnoun and establish a factory on the coast somewhere about the river noun just below cape noun a british vessel of war be send down with present for the sheikh and to ascertain the whereabout of the fine harbor report to exist there by the sheikh and he people this attempt of we government be as fruitless as that of the french afterwards indeed at the very time a english brig of war be search about for this port and seek a interview with the sheikh of wadnoun on the coast davidson be murder on the southern frontier just as he be penetrate the sahara it be not improbable however that the knowledge of this recommendation of davidson which from the sheikh 's people themselves would naturally reach the court of morocco might have excite that jealous court to compass in some way he death or at any rate thwart he expedition to timbuctoo for the emperor be exceedingly jealous of any european hold communication with the south the sheikh barook be in spite of all this very anxious to begin a intercourse with european and not long ago a messenger arrive with a bag of money for the jew cohen tell he to take some out of it and to go to the sheikh who wish to see he but cohen would not expose himself to the displeasure of the emperor although he have english protection wadnoun be a quasi-independent sheikhdom of the empire the sheikh of wadnoun pay no tithe nor other impost and only send a annual present as a mark of vassal-homage to the emperor sous which adjoin this province be more immediately under the power of the sultan of the shereef but the tithe be not so easily collect in the south as in the north much depend on the ability of the governor who rule the whole of the district in the name of the emperor the imperial authority be maintain principally by prompt disunion amongst the sheikh sous be divide into numerous district each district have a independent sheikh by confusion and division among themselves the emperor rule all as paramount-lord when will people learn to be unite so that by union they may win they freedom and independence alas never wadnoun be treat however very tenderly for if the emperor be to attempt the subjugation of this country the malcontent of sous would join the sheikh and he authority would probably be overthrow in all the south sous be the richest of these province and equal to any other of the northern district its trade in date ostrich feather wax wool and hide particularly in gum almond and slave be very great all the saharan caravan must pass through this country except those proceed _ viâ _ tafilett to fez teroudant its capital be a very ancient city and be build by the ancient berber it have a circumference of wall capable of contain eighty thousand people but the actual population do not exceed twenty thousand its inhabitant be very industrious and the moor excel in the art of dye noun or wadnoun as this country and its capital be sometimes call mr davidson briefly describe as a large district have many cluster of inhabitant the town where the sheikh reside be of good size and have a millah or jew 's quarter besides a good market it stand on the river -lrb- such as it be -rrb- distant twenty two mile from the sea the river noun rise in the mountain above souk aisa or assa and be there call wad-el-aisa and pass through the district of wadnoun it take the name of assaka the ancient name of this river be daradus the territory around be not very fertile on account of the neighborhood of the desert but produce gum wax and ostrich feather in abundance the inhabitant be mostly arab with a sprinkling of shelouh estimate by gräberg -lrb- 35 -rrb- at 2000 the population be somewhat thickly scatter there be at least twenty village between the district of stuka and wadnoun the annex be a sketch of wadnoun after the design leave by mr davidson -lrb- illustration -rrb- wadnoun be a important rendezvous of caravan many timbuctoo caravan break up here and some saharan several saharan merchant come no further north dispose of they slave and goods to maroquine merchant who meet they in this place it be safe travel through these country provide no extraordinary plot be lay for take away a traveller 's life as in the case of european explorer attempt to penetrate the interior mr treppass think that notwithstanding the ill-will of the moorish government davidson could have succeed in he attempted journey to timbuctoo have he be more circumspect he give out to all person whom he meet that he be go to timbuctoo this insure he be stop and murder _ en route _ by some party or other more especially as he at last abandonod the idea of protect himself by a caravan-party and start alone but i be not altogether of this opinion too much publicity be certainly injurious to a journey of discovery and far and near awaken attention and suspicion but a too sudden and unexpected appearance in the town of the desert equally excite distrust and suspicion if not hostile feeling mr robertson whilst at morocco hear one of the numerous version of the death of mr davidson he be say to have be kill by the mere freak of a young arab who wish to have the pleasure of kill a christian and who call out to he companion come let we go and have a shot at the christian the party of arab to whom this mischievous young man belong be afterwards extremely grieve at what have be do one of the arab in plunder the baggage lose he hand by break a bottle contain aqua forti the glass cut a large gash and the aqua forti enter immediately consume the hand the people cry out the devil of the christian be in the water from all i have hear the great fault of davidson appear to have be he wish to travel as like a fine gentleman this prejudice all he travelling-companion against he and could not fail to render he unpopular wherever he go it be of no use for a man to cry out in the desert i be a englishman he must exclaim i be a arab and will do and suffer like a arab if any one be to ask I what would carry a roan to timbuctoo through the desert be it courage or money or prudence i would reply the first thing be suffer the second be suffer and the last be suffer -lrb- 36 -rrb- i consult a old man on this journey to timbuctoo he could not undertake a voyage be too old he mention name of place _ en route _ and say they travel by the star which star-travelling be all stuff he recommend go by sea as much nearer very little satisfactory information can be obtain from maroquine moor who would rather mislead than direct you i endeavor to open a correspondence with the south on the anti-slavery question at first i thought of go to wadnoun on receive a invitation from the sheikh but when i propose this to mr wiltshire he insist on my relinquish such a project inasmuch as have place myself at the direction of the consul-general as recommend by the earl of aberdeen i be not at liberty to differ from the advice which mr hay and himself might tender I i see there be some reason in this and submit though with great reluctance however i write two letter to sheikh barook of wadnoun state the view and object of the anti-slavery society i have some difficulty in find a courier who would undertake the delicate mission of convey the letter but mr treppass and the french consul m jorelle feel themselves more at liberty in the matter than we consul and determine to assist I m jorelle very justly observe we will sow the seed of liberty if we can do nothing more indeed i be greatly oblige to that gentleman for the interest he take in my mission and the assistance he render I on this and other occasion after my return to england i receive two letter from the sheikh in answer to those i have write to he the sheikh afraid lest he letter might fall into the hand of government after many compliment beg I to get the emperor first to move in the question add what he make free we will make free for he say in another place we act as he act accord to the _ treek _ -lrb- ordinance -rrb- of god and he prophet sheikh barook also protest that he have but little power in these matter live as he do in the desert as i do not seek for any thing beyond a answer to my letter and be only anxious that he should know the sentiment of the anti-slavery society i be not all disappointed i know too much of the pro-slavery feeling once exist in a strong party in england and the mighty struggle which we have pass through to obtain british abolition to expect anything more than a respectful answer to antislavery letter from a prince of the desert whose revenue be raise chiefly from the duty levy upon slave-caravan pass through he territory i only attempt to scatter the seed of liberty over the slave-track of the desert leave the bud forth and the growth to the irrigating influence of that merciful and wise god who have make all man of one flesh and blood i visit the family of jewish merchant during the passover in company with mr and mr elton christian here visit the jew twice a year at the feast of the passover and tabernacle in return jew visit christian on new year 's day this laudable practice promote social harmony between the jew and christian in the house of one of we jewish friend -lrb- mr levus 's -rrb- i assist at the celebration of the evening of the passover there be nothing very particular in this ceremony except a great deal of read the drinking of the four cup -lrb- 37 -rrb- of wine and the eating of the bitter herb emblem of the joy and the sorrow attend the deliverance from egyptian bondage be the more difficult part of the ceremony the child naturally feel most the disagreeableness of eat the bitter herb and several time as soon as they put they into they mouth they spit they out again under the table the drinking of a excessive quantity of wine be also attend with not a little inconvenience and one would think bacchus be the deity worship and not the god of the jew and christian when will mankind learn that violation of the physical economy of they nature can never be acceptable to the great creator i do not say that european israelite indulge so much in these excess as barbary jew but i imagine that the germ of the debauch be find in the talmudical religion of both class but since i should be very sorry be a jew to hold up to I the mummery of popery or of the greek church as the mirror of my own religion i be not dispose to animadvert upon the generally decorous worship of european israelite it require three full day to get through this business of visit in truth it be a very serious affair for we be oblige to eat cake and sip sherbet or white brandy at every house we go to otherwise we should confer a affront upon we friend at all time a great quantity of white brandy which the jew distil themselves be drunk but especially on these occasion the governor of mogador give order not long ago that no mussulman should enter the jewish quarter to prevent the faithful from be seduce into drinking this insidious spirit i shall just mention what a christian be oblige to conform to whilst visit the barbary jew on these high day and holiday 1st you must eat a piece of cake at least of _ one _ sort if not of several kind and drink a little brandy wine somet or boil juice of the grape or sherbet in many of the house they give nothing but brandy which be tastefully place out on small round table as at a pastrycook 's shop 2nd you must admire the new dress of the lady who be radiantly and sumptuously attire in flame purple and refulgent gold they ornament likewise of gold silver and all manner of precious stone for the daughter of israel be as on bridal day all begemmed bejewelled and diamonded stick over with gem as thick as star see in the galaxy or milky-way on these festival it be absolutely a matter of orthodox observance that the jew and jewess should wear something new some have entirely new dress 3rd any thing new or remarkable in the house or household furniture must be notice or admire 4th you must carry with you in you memorandum-book or at the tip of you tongue a good assortment of first-rate compliment of the season if these be spice with a little scandal of you neighbor or the party you have just leave so much the better they be more relish now you be oblige to visit twenty or thirty family per diem and you be literally pass through door square-court and corridor cross patio and quadrangle walk up and down stair get up and sit down from morning to night during these three mortal day it will be see then that these passover and tabernacle visit be tremendous affair and require herculean strength to get through they polite duty they may be day of jovial festivity to jew but certainly they be day of labor and annoyance to gentile but i must now give a account of one or two remarkable personage whom we visit the first be madame bousac a jewess of this country she father be a grandee at court in the day of former emperor and the greatest merchant of he time and she represent as a aristocrat among she people a modern esther standing and plead between the sultan and she nation this lady be the only native woman in the country mooress or jewess who have tact or courage enough to go and speak to the emperor and state she request with a unfaltering voice beneath the awful shadow of the shereefian presence madame bousac accompany the merchant to morocco to pay she respects to the emperor among other modest or confidential demand which the lady make on the imperial benevolence be that of a advance to she husband of ten thousand dollar he imperial highness be immediately oblige to give a formal assent before he court she then visit the harem and feel herself quite at home all the lady wife or concubine of the emperor wait upon she and serve she with tea and bread and butter the presentation of bread and butter and cup of tea be say to be the highest honor confer on visitor but why or wherefore i have not hear madame bousac give we some account of the morocco harem which we may suppose be like that of fez and mikna the number of these lady be some two hundred they be all attired alike except the four wife who dress a little more in the style of sultana i be sorry to be oblige to disabuse the reader of the romance and oriental coloring attach to we idea of the harem by give madame bousac 's simile of those angelic houry this lady say they be like a string of charity-school girl go to church on a Sunday morning they penurious lord keep down they pin-money to the lowest point and be not more liberal to he lady than to he other subject former sultan be accustom to allow they lady half a dollar a day but these have but twopence or at least fourpence muley abd errahman even traffic in he beauty and will now and then make a present of one to a governor in consideration of receive a adequate return of money or present sometimes the moor pay they shereefian sultan a similar compliment by present he with slave from they harem -lrb- 38 -rrb- madame bousac be of course a perfect lady accord to moorish idea but she fascination on the mind of the emperor arise more from she wit and ability than she feminine grace and delicacy she be anything but a beauty accord to we idea be of a dark complexion of middle height of large and powerful muscular proportion very upright as if bend backwards and with a hoarse and masculine voice like most woman in this part of the world she be marry to a man old enough to be she father or even grandfather be even more than double she age she herself may be about thirty at which age the beauty of barbary woman be go for ever such be the court-dame who have courage enough to speak to the emperor of morocco in public she converse with we about she affair tell we the emperor have not yet advance to she husband the loan of 10000 dollar as promise nor do she expect it for she know he avarice rather would he sell one of he sultana but he have send she a present of four haik which she shew we they be extremely
