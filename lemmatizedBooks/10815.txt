bend and place in a tomb overlook the ohio river inaugural address call from a retirement which i have suppose be to continue for the residue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation i appear before you fellow-citizen to take the oath which the constitution prescribe as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duty and in obedience to a custom coeval with we government and what i believe to be you expectation i proceed to present to you a summary of the principle which will govern I in the discharge of the duty which i shall be call upon to perform it be the remark of a roman consul in a early period of that celebrated republic that a most striking contrast be observable in the conduct of candidate for office of power and trust before and after obtain they they seldom carry out in the latter case the pledge and promise make in the former however much the world may have improve in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand year since the remark be make by the virtuous and indignant roman i fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective government would develop similar instance of violate confidence although the fiat of the people have go forth proclaim I the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon they part remain to be do it may be think that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be suppose to have act in relation to my principle and opinion and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepare to condemn those i shall now deliver or approve they to doubt the sincerity with which they be now utter but the lapse of a few month will confirm or dispel they fear the outline of principle to govern and measure to be adopt by a administration not yet begin will soon be exchange for immutable history and i shall stand either exonerate by my countryman or class with the mass of those who promise that they might deceive and flatter with the intention to betray however strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectation of a magnanimous and confide people i too well understand the dangerous temptation to which i shall be expose from the magnitude of the power which it have be the pleasure of the people to commit to my hand not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty power which have hitherto protect I and enable I to bring to favorable issue other important but still greatly inferior trust heretofore confide to I by my country the broad foundation upon which we constitution rest be the people -- a breath of theirs have make as a breath can unmake change or modify it -- it can be assign to none of the great division of government but to that of democracy if such be its theory those who be call upon to administer it must recognize as its lead principle the duty of shape they measure so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number but with these broad admission if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledge to exist in the mass of we people with the power claim by other sovereignty even by those which have be consider most purely democratic we shall find a most essential difference all other lay claim to power limit only by they own will the majority of we citizen on the contrary possess a sovereignty with a amount of power precisely equal to that which have be grant to they by the party to the national compact and nothing beyond we admit of no government by divine right believe that so far as power be concern the beneficent creator have make no distinction amongst man that all be upon a equality and that the only legitimate right to govern be a express grant of power from the govern the constitution of the united state be the instrument contain this grant of power to the several department compose the government on a examination of that instrument it will be find to contain declaration of power grant and of power withhold the latter be also susceptible of division into power which the majority have the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to they agent and that which they could not have grant not be possess by themselves in other word there be certain rights possess by each individual american citizen which in he compact with the other he have never surrender some of they indeed he be unable to surrender be in the language of we system unalienable the boast privilege of a roman citizen be to he a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athen would console himself under a sentence of death for a suppose violation of the national faith -- which no one understand and which at time be the subject of the mockery of all -- or the banishment from he home he family and he country with or without a alleged cause that it be the act not of a single tyrant or hate aristocracy but of he assemble countryman far different be the power of we sovereignty it can interfere with no one 's faith prescribe form of worship for no one 's observance inflict no punishment but after well-ascertained guilt the result of investigation under rule prescribe by the constitution itself these precious privilege and those scarcely less important of give expression to he thought and opinion either by write or speak unrestrained but by the liability for injury to other and that of a full participation in all the advantage which flow from the government the acknowledged property of all the american citizen derive from no charter grant by he fellow-man he claim they because he be himself a man fashion by the same almighty hand as the rest of he species and entitle to a full share of the blessing with which he have endow they notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possess by the people of the united state and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopt enough have be give to accomplish all the object for which it be create it have be find powerful in war and hitherto justice have be administer a intimate union effect domestic tranquillity preserved and personal liberty secure to the citizen as be to be expect however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution be write dispute have arise as to the amount of power which it have actually grant or be intend to grant this be more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treat of the legislative branch and not only as regard the exercise of power claim under a general clause give that body the authority to pass all law necessary to carry into effect the specify power but in relation to the latter also it be however consolatory to reflect that _ most _ of the instance of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately receive the sanction of a majority of the people and the fact that many of we statesman most distinguish for talent and patriotism have be at one time or other of they political career on both side of each of the most warmly dispute question force upon we the inference that the error if error there be be attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instance of ascertain the intention of the framer of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive but the great danger to we institution do not appear to I to be in a usurpation by the government of power not grant by the people but by the accumulation in one of the department of that which be assign to other limit as be the power which have be grant still enough have be grant to constitute a despotism if concentrate in one of the department this danger be greatly heighten as it have be always observable that man be less jealous of encroachment of one department upon another than upon they own reserved rights when the constitution of the united state first come from the hand of the convention which form it many of the sternest republican of the day be alarm at the extent of the power which have be grant to the federal government and more particularly of that portion which have be assign to the executive branch there be in it feature which appear not to be in harmony with they idea of a simple representative democracy or republic and know the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercise by a single individual prediction be make that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy it would not become I to say that the fear of these patriot have be already realize but as i sincerely believe that the tendency of measure and of man 's opinion for some year past have be in that direction it be i conceive strictly proper that i should take this occasion to repeat the assurance i have heretofore give of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exist and restore the government to its pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effect by any legitimate exercise of the power place in my hand i proceed to state in as summary a manner as i can my opinion of the source of the evil which have be so extensively complain of and the corrective which may be apply some of the former be unquestionably to be find in the defect of the constitution other in my judgment be attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provision of the former be the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency the sagacious mind of mr jefferson early saw and lament this error and attempt have be make hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the state to its correction as however one mode of correction be in the power of every president and consequently in mine it would be useless and perhaps invidious to enumerate the evil of which in the opinion of many of we fellow-citizen this error of the sage who frame the constitution may have be the source and the bitter fruit which we be still to gather from it if it continue to disfigure we system it may be observe however as a general remark that republic can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in they system of government which may be calculate to create or increase the love of power in the bosom of those to whom necessity oblige they to commit the management of they affair and surely nothing be more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of a office of high trust nothing can be more corrupt nothing more destructive of all those noble feeling which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot when this corrupt passion once take possession of the human mind like the love of gold it become insatiable it be the never-dying worm in he bosom grow with he growth and strengthen with the decline year of its victim if this be true it be the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she have intrust the management of she foreign relation the execution of she law and the command of she army and navy to a period so short as to prevent he forget that he be the accountable agent not the principal the servant not the master until a amendment of the constitution can be effect public opinion may secure the desire object i give my aid to it by renew the pledge heretofore give that under no circumstance will i consent to serve a second term but if there be danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defect of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hand there be i apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regard the power actually give i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provision would be find to constitute the president a part of the legislative power it can not be claim from the power to recommend since although enjoin as a duty upon he it be a privilege which he hold in common with every other citizen and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measure recommend in the one case than in the other in the obligation of ultimate decision there can be no difference in the language of the constitution all the legislative power which it grant be vest in the congress of the united state it would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these be not include in the whole it may be say indeed that the constitution have give to the executive the power to annul the act of the legislative body by refuse to they he assent so a similar power have necessarily result from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary form no part of the legislature there be it be true this difference between these grant of power : the executive can put he negative upon the act of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument but the decision of the judiciary be final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive be apply it may be overcome by a vote of two-third of both house of congress the negative upon the act of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hand of one individual would seem to be a incongruity in we system like some other of a similar character however it appear to be highly expedient and if use only with the forbearance and in the spirit which be intend by its author it may be productive of great good and be find one of the best safeguard to the union at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle do not appear to have enjoy much favor in the state government it exist but in two and in one of these there be a plural executive if we would search for the motive which operate upon the purely patriotic and enlighten assembly which frame the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the lead democratic principle that the majority should govern we must reject the idea that they anticipate from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation they know too well the high degree of intelligence which exist among the people and the enlighten character of the state legislature not to have the fullest confidence that the two body elect by they would be worthy representative of such constituent and of course that they would require no aid in conceive and mature the measure which the circumstance of the country might require and it be preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have be entertain that the president place at the capital in the center of the country could better understand the want and wish of the people than they own immediate representative who spend a part of every year among they live with they often labor with they and bind to they by the triple tie of interest duty and affection to assist or control congress then in its ordinary legislation could not i conceive have be the motive for confer the veto power on the president this argument acquire additional force from the fact of its never have be thus use by the first six president -- and two of they be member of the convention one preside over its deliberation and the other bear a larger share in consummate the labor of that August body than any other person but if bill be never return to congress by either of the president above refer to upon the ground of they be inexpedient or not as well adapt as they might be to the want of the people the veto be apply upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because error have be commit from a too hasty enactment there be another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which have probably more influence in recommend it to the convention than any other i refer to the security which it give to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all part of the union it could not but have occur to the convention that in a country so extensive embrace so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of product and which from the same cause must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various section call for a great diversity in the employment of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interest of the minority and that act of this character might be pass under a express grant by the word of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlighten and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the member of congress might be and however largely partaking in the general of the liberal feeling of the people it be impossible to expect that body so constitute should not sometimes be control by local interest and sectional feeling it be proper therefore to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influence might be expect such a one be afford by the executive department constitute by the constitution a person elect to that high office have he constituent in every section state and subdivision of the union must consider himself bind by the most solemn sanction to guard protect and defend the rights of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest i consider the veto power therefore give by the constitution to the executive of the united state solely as a conservative power to be use only first to protect the constitution from violation secondly the people from the effect of hasty legislation where they will have be probably disregard or not well understand and thirdly to prevent the effect of combination violative of the rights of minority in reference to the second of these object i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed point of the constitution arise from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the power expressly give and i believe with mr madison that repeat recognition under varied circumstance in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as afford to the president sufficient authority for he consider such dispute point as settle upward of half a century have elapse since the adoption of the present form of government it would be a object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesman if its precise situation could be ascertain a fair exhibit make of the operation of each of its department of the power which they respectively claim and exercise of the collision which have occur between they or between the whole government and those of the state or either of they we could then compare we actual condition after fifty year ' trial of we system with what it be in the commencement of its operation and ascertain whether the prediction of the patriot who oppose its adoption or the confident hope of its advocate have be best realize the great dread of the former seem to have be that the reserved power of the state would be absorb by those of the federal government and a consolidated power establish leave to the state the shadow only of that independent action for which they have so zealously contend and on the preservation of which they rely as the last hope of liberty without deny that the result to which they look with so much apprehension be in the way of be realize it be obvious that they do not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government have seize upon none of the reserved rights of the state as far as any open warfare may have go the state authority have amply maintain they rights to a casual observer we system present no appearance of discord between the different member which compose it even the addition of many new one have produce no jarring they move in they respective orbit in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other but there be still a undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably check the worst apprehension of we anti-federal patriot will be realize and not only will the state authority be overshadow by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government but the character of that government if not its designation be essentially and radically change this state of thing have be in part effect by cause inherent in the constitution and in part by the never-failing tendency of political power to increase itself by make the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framer of the constitution do not appear to have anticipate at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operation of the state government of trifling importance at first it have early in mr jefferson 's administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in control the freedom of the elective franchise if such could have then be the effect of its influence how much greater must be the danger at this time quadruple in amount as it certainly be and more completely under the control of the executive will than they construction of they power allow or the forbearing character of all the early president permit they to make but it be not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department have become dangerous but by the use which it appear may be make of the appoint power to bring under its control the whole revenue of the country the constitution have declare it to be the duty of the president to see that the law be execute and it make he the commander in chief of the army and navy of the united state if the opinion of the most approved writer upon that species of mixed government which in modern europe be term _ monarchy _ in contradistinction to _ despotism _ be correct there be want no other addition to the power of we chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on we government but the control of the public finances and to I it appear strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possess over the officer who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause do for all mischievous purpose at least virtually subject the treasure also to he disposal the first roman emperor in he attempt to seize the sacred treasure silence the opposition of the officer to whose charge it have be commit by a significant allusion to he sword by a selection of political instrument for the care of the public money a reference to they commission by a president would be quite as effectual a argument as that of caesar to the roman knight i be not insensible of the great difficulty that exist in draw a proper plan for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public revenue and i know the importance which have be attach by man of great ability and patriotism to the divorce as it be call of the treasury from the banking institution it be not the divorce which be complain of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which have create such extensive alarm to this danger to we republican institution and that create by the influence give to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officer i propose to apply all the remedy which may be at my command it be certainly a great error in the framer of the constitution not to have make the officer at the head of the treasury department entirely independent of the executive he should at least have be removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature i have determine never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicate all the circumstance attend such removal to both house of congress the influence of the executive in control the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officer can be effectually check by renew the prohibition publish by mr jefferson forbid they interference in election further than give they own vote and they own independence secure by a assurance of perfect immunity in exercise this sacred privilege of freeman under the dictate of they own unbiased judgment never with my consent shall a officer of the people compensate for he service out of they pocket become the pliant instrument of executive will there be no part of the means place in the hand of the executive which might be use with greater effect for unhallowed purpose than the control of the public press the maxim which we ancestor derive from the mother country that the freedom of the press be the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty be one of the most precious legacy which they have leave we we have learn too from we own as well as the experience of other country that golden shackle by whomsoever or by whatever pretense impose be as fatal to it as the iron bond of despotism the press in the necessary employment of the government should never be use to clear the guilty or to varnish crime a decent and manly examination of the act of the government should be not only tolerate but encourage upon another occasion i have give my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congress -- that the article in the constitution make it the duty of the president to communicate information and authorize he to recommend measure be not intend to make he the source in legislation and in particular that he should never be look to for scheme of finance it would be very strange indeed that the constitution should have strictly forbid one branch of the legislature from interfere in the origination of such bill and that it should be consider proper that a altogether different department of the government should be permit to do so some of we best political maxim and opinion have be draw from we parent isle there be other however which can not be introduce in we system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this i conceive to be one no matter in which of the house of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduce -- a minister or a member of the opposition -- by the fiction of law or rather of constitutional principle the sovereign be suppose to have prepare it agreeably to he will and then submit it to parliament for they advice and consent now the very reverse be the case here not only with regard to the principle but the form prescribe by the constitution the principle certainly assign to the only body constitute by the constitution -lrb- the legislative body -rrb- the power to make law and the form even direct that the enactment should be ascribe to they the senate in relation to revenue bill have the right to propose amendment and so have the executive by the power give he to return they to the house of representative with he objection it be in he power also to propose amendment in the exist revenue law suggest by he observation upon they defective or injurious operation but the delicate duty of devise scheme of revenue should be leave where the constitution have place it -- with the immediate representative of the people for similar reason the mode of keep the public treasure should be prescribe by they and the further remove it may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle connect with this subject be the character of the currency the idea of make it exclusively metallic however well intend appear to I to be fraught with more fatal consequence than any other scheme have no relation to the personal rights of the citizen that have ever be devise if any single scheme could produce the effect of arrest at once that mutation of condition by which thousand of we most indigent fellow-citizen by they industry and enterprise be raise to the possession of wealth that be the one if there be one measure better calculate than another to produce that state of thing so much deprecate by all true republican by which the rich be daily add to they hoard and the poor sinking deeper into penury it be a exclusive metallic currency or if there be a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroy by the great increase and necessary toleration of usury it be a exclusive metallic currency amongst the other duty of a delicate character which the president be call upon to perform be the supervision of the government of the territory of the united state those of they which be destine to become member of we great political family be compensate by they rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of they political rights it be in this district only where american citizen be to be find who under a settle policy be deprive of many important political privilege without any inspiring hope as to the future they only consolation under circumstance of such deprivation be that of the devoted exterior guard of a camp -- that they suffering secure tranquillity and safety within be there any of they countryman who would subject they to greater sacrifice to any other humiliation than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they be thus separate from they fellow-citizen be they rights alone not to be guarantee by the application of those great principle upon which all we constitution be found we be tell by the greatest of british orator and statesman that at the commencement of the war of the revolution the most stupid man in england speak of they american subject be there indeed citizen of any of we state who have dream _ of they subject _ in the district of columbium such dream can never be realize by any agency of mine the people of the district of columbium be not the subject of the people of the state but free american citizen be in the latter condition when the constitution be form no word use in that instrument could have be intend to deprive they of that character if there be anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insist upon in we declaration of independence they could neither make nor the united state accept a surrender of they liberty and become the _ subject _ -- in other word the slave -- of they former fellow-citizen if this be true -- and it will scarcely be deny by anyone who have a correct idea of he own rights as a american citizen -- the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbium can be interpret so far as respects the aggregate people of the united state as mean nothing more than to allow to congress the control power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the function assign to the general government by the constitution in all other respects the legislation of congress should be adapt to they peculiar position and want and be conformable with they deliberate opinion of they own interest i have speak of the necessity of keep the respective department of the government as well as all the other authority of we country within they appropriate orbit this be a matter of difficulty in some case as the power which they respectively claim be often not define by any distinct line mischievous however in they tendency as collision of this kind may be those which arise between the respective community which for certain purpose compose one nation be much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feeling of confidence and affection which be the effective bond to union between free and confederated state strong as be the tie of interest it have be often find ineffectual man blind by they passion have be know to adopt measure for they country in direct opposition to all the suggestion of policy the alternative then be to destroy or keep down a bad passion by create and foster a good one and this seem to be the corner stone upon which we american political architect have rear the fabric of we government the cement which be to bind it and perpetuate its existence be the affectionate attachment between all its member to insure the continuance of this feeling produce at first by a community of danger of suffering and of interest the advantage of each be make accessible to all no participation in any good possess by any member of we extensive confederacy except in domestic government be withhold from the citizen of any other member by a process attend with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole the line too separate power to be exercise by the citizen of one state from those of another seem to be so distinctly draw as to leave no room for misunderstand the citizen of each state unite in they person all the privilege which that character confer and all that they may claim as citizen of the united state but in no case can the same person at the same time act as the citizen of two separate state and _ he be therefore positively preclude from any interference with the reserved power of any state but that of which he be for the time be a citizen _ he may indeed offer to the citizen of other state he advice as to they management and the form in which it be tender be leave to he own discretion and sense of propriety it may be observe however that organize association of citizen require compliance with they wish too much resemble the _ recommendation _ of athen to she ally support by a armed and powerful fleet it be indeed to the ambition of the leading state of greece to control the domestic concern of the other that the destruction of that celebrated confederacy and subsequently of all its member be mainly to be attribute and it be owe to the absence of that spirit that the helvetic confederacy have for so many year be preserve never have there be see in the institution of the separate member of any confederacy more element of discord in the principle and form of government and religion as well as in the circumstance of the several canton so mark a discrepancy be observable as to promise anything but harmony in they intercourse or permanency in they alliance and yet for age neither have be interrupted content with the positive benefit which they union produce with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secure these sagacious people respect the institution of each other however repugnant to they own principle and prejudice we confederacy fellow-citizen can only be preserve by the same forbearance we citizen must be content with the exercise of the power with which the constitution clothes they the attempt of those of one state to control the domestic institution of another can only result in feeling of distrust and jealousy the certain harbinger of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of we free institution we confederacy be perfectly illustrate by the term and principle govern a common copartnership there be a fund of power to be exercise under the direction of the joint council of the ally member but that which have be reserve by the individual member be intangible by the common government or the individual member compose it to attempt it find no support in the principle of we constitution it should be we constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various part of we confederacy experience have abundantly teach we that the agitation by citizen of one part of the union of a subject not confide to the general government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authority be productive of no other consequence than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which be intend to be advance of all the great interest which appertain to we country that of union -- cordial confide fraternal union -- be by far the most important since it be the only true and sure guaranty of all other in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the state may meet with difficulty in they financial concern however deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagement into which state have enter for purpose of they own it do not become we to disparage the state government nor to discourage they from make proper effort for they own relief on the contrary it be we duty to encourage they to the extent of we constitutional authority to apply they best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifice and submit to all necessary burden to fulfill they engagement and maintain they credit for the character and credit of the several state form a part of the character and credit of the whole country the resource of the country be abundant the enterprise and activity of we people proverbial and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective government each act within its own sphere will restore former prosperity unpleasant and even dangerous as collision may sometimes be between the constitute authority of the citizen of we country in relation to the line which separate they respective jurisdiction the result can be of no vital injury to we institution if that ardent patriotism that devoted attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which we countryman be once distinguish continue to be cherish if this continue to be the ruling passion of we soul the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be correct the utopian dream of the scheming politician dissipate and the complicated intrigue of the demagogue render harmless the spirit of liberty be the sovereign balm for every injury which we institution may receive on the contrary no care that can be use in the construction of we government no division of power no distribution of check in its several department will prove effectual to keep we a free people if this spirit be suffer to decay and decay it will without constant nurture to the neglect of this duty the best historian agree in attribute the ruin of all the republic with whose existence and fall they writings have make we acquaint the same cause will ever produce the same effect and as long as the love of power be a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understanding of man can be warped and they affection change by operation upon they passion and prejudice so long will the liberty of a people depend on they own constant attention to its preservation the danger to all well-established free government arise from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of design man divert they attention from the quarter whence it approach to a source from which it can never come this be the old trick of those who would usurp the government of they country in the name of democracy they speak warn the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy history ancient and modern be full of such example caesar become the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of support the democratic claim of the former against the aristocracy of the latter cromwell in the character of protector of the liberty of the people become the dictator of england and bolivar possess himself of unlimited power with the title of he country 's liberator there be on the contrary no instance on record of a extensive and well-established republic be change into a aristocracy the tendency of all such government in they decline be to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there be the spirit of faction -- a spirit which assume the character and in time of great excitement impose itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false christ whose come be foretell by the savior seek to and be it possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciple of liberty it be in period like this that it behoove the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrust power and although there be at time much difficulty in distinguish the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of its operation as the result that be produce the true spirit of liberty although devoted persevere bold and uncompromising in principle that secure be mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the mean it employ whilst the spirit of party assume to be that of liberty be harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the ally which it bring to the aid of its cause when the genuine spirit of liberty animate the body of a people to a thorough examination of they affair it lead to the excision of every excrescence which may have fasten itself upon any of the department of the government and restore the system to its pristine health and beauty but the reign of a intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fail to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduce and establish amidst unusual profession of devotion to democracy the foregoing remark relate almost exclusively to matter connect with we domestic concern it may be proper however that i should give some indication to my fellow-citizen of my propose course of conduct in the management of we foreign relation i assure they therefore that it be my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsist with every foreign nation and that although of course not well inform as to the state of pend negotiation with any of they i see in the personal character of the sovereign as well as in the mutual interest of we own and of the government with which we relation be most intimate a please guaranty that the harmony so important to the interest of they subject as well as of we citizen will not be interrupt by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon they part to which we honor would not permit we to yield long the defender of my country 's rights in the field i trust that my fellow-citizen will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign power any indication that they rights will ever be sacrifice or the honor of the nation tarnish by any admission on the part of they chief magistrate unworthy of they former glory in we intercourse with we aboriginal neighbor the same liberality and justice which mark the course prescribe to I by two of my illustrious predecessor when act under they direction in the discharge of the duty of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observe i can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate a impartial and common creator than a rigid adherence to the principle of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transaction with a weaker and uncivilized people whom circumstance have place at its disposal before conclude fellow-citizen i must say something to you on the subject of the party at this time exist in we country to I it appear perfectly clear that the interest of that country require that the violence of the spirit by which those party be at this time govern must be greatly mitigate if not entirely extinguish or consequence will ensue which be appalling to be think of if party in a republic be necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionary within the bound of law and duty at that point they usefulness end beyond that they become destructive of public virtue the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty and eventually its inevitable conqueror we have example of republic where the love of country and of liberty at one time be the dominant passion of the whole mass of citizen and yet with the continuance of the name and form of free government not a vestige of these quality remain in the bosom of any one of its citizen it be the beautiful remark of a distinguished english writer that in the roman senate octavius have a party and antony a party but the commonwealth have none yet the senate continue to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the commonwealth and gaze at the statue of the elder brutus and of the curtius and decius and the people assemble in the forum not as in the day of camillus and the scipio to cast they free vote for annual magistrate or pass upon the act of the senate but to receive from the hand of the leader of the respective party they share of the spoil and to shout for one or the other as those collect in gaul or egypt and the lesser asia would furnish the larger dividend the spirit of liberty have flee and avoid the abode of civilized man have seek protection in the wild of scythium or scandinavium and so under the operation of the same cause and influence it will fly from we capitol and we forum a calamity so awful not only to we country but to the world must be deprecate by every patriot and every tendency to a state of thing likely to produce it immediately check such a tendency have exist -- do exist always the friend of my countryman never they flatterer it become my duty to say to they from this high place to which they partiality have exalt I that there exist in the land a spirit hostile to they best interest -- hostile to liberty itself it be a spirit contract in its view selfish in its object it look to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interest of the whole the entire remedy be with the people something however may be effect by the means which they have place in my hand it be union that we want not of a party for the sake of that party but a union of the whole country for the sake of the whole country for the defense of its interest and its honor against foreign aggression for the defense of those principle for which we ancestor so gloriously contend as far as it depend upon I it shall be accomplish all the influence that i possess shall be exert to prevent the formation at least of a executive party in the hall of the legislative body i wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that do not satisfy he judgment and he sense of duty to those from whom he hold he appointment nor any confidence in advance from the people but that ask for by mr jefferson to give firmness and effect to the legal administration of they affair i deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify I in express to my fellow-citizen a profound reverence for the christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound moral religious liberty and a just sense of religious responsibility be essentially connect with all true and lasting happiness and to that good being who have bless we by the gift of civil and religious freedom who watch over and prosper the labor of we father and have hitherto preserve to we institution far exceed in excellence those of any other people let we unite in fervently commend every interest of we beloved country in all future time fellow-citizen be fully invest with that high office to which the partiality of my countryman have call I i now take
