remarkable directness and condensation it will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary man 's collect papers as i publish the case in this volume simply to interest the laity i shall forestall the intelligent lady who relate it in nothing and after due consideration i have determine therefore to abstain from present any précis of the learn doctor 's reasoning or extract from he

correspondence commence by doctor hesselius so many year before with a person so clever and careful as he informant seem to have be much to my regret however i find that she have die in the interval she probably could have add little to the narrative _ which she communicate in the follow page with so far as i can pronounce such conscientious particularity _ i _ a early fright _ in styrium we though by no means magnificent people inhabit a castle or schloss a small income in that part of the world go a great way eight or nine hundred a year do wonder scantily enough ours would have answer among wealthy people at home my father be english and i bear a english name although i never see england but here in this lonely and primitive place where everything be so marvelously cheap i really do not see how ever so much more money would at all materially add to we comfort or even luxury my father be in the austrian service and retire upon a pension and he patrimony and purchase this feudal residence and the small estate on which it stand a bargain nothing can be more picturesque or solitary it stand on a slight eminence in a forest the road very old and narrow pass in front of its drawbridge never raise in my time and its moat stock with perch and sail over by many swan and float on its surface white fleet of water lily over all this the schloss show its many-windowed front its tower and its gothic chapel the forest open in a irregular and very picturesque glade before its gate and at the right a steep gothic bridge carry the road over a stream that wind in deep shadow through the wood i have say that this be a very lonely place judge whether i say truth look from the hall door towards the road the forest in which we castle stand extend fifteen mile to the right and twelve to the leave the nearest inhabit village be about seven of you english mile to the leave the nearest inhabit schloss of any historic association be that of old general spielsdorf nearly twenty mile away to the right i have say the nearest _ inhabit _ village because there be only three mile westward that be to say in the direction of general spielsdorf 's schloss a ruin village with its quaint little church now roofless in the aisle of which be the moldering tomb of the proud family of karnstein now extinct who once own the equally desolate chateau which in the thick of the forest overlook the silent ruin of the town respect the cause of the desertion of this striking and melancholy spot there be a legend which i shall relate to you another time i must tell you now how very small be the party who constitute the inhabitant of we castle i do not include servant or those dependent who occupy room in the building attach to the schloss listen and wonder my father who be the kindest man on earth but grow old and i at the date of my story only nineteen eight year have pass since then i and my father constitute the family at the schloss my mother a styrian lady die in my infancy but i have a good-natured governess who have be with I from i might almost say my infancy i could not remember the time when she fat benignant face be not a familiar picture in my memory this be madame perrodon a native of berne whose care and good nature now in part supply to I the loss of my mother whom i do not even remember so early i lose she she make a third at we little dinner party there be a fourth mademoiselle de lafontaine a lady such as you term i believe a finish governess she speak french and german madame perrodon french and broken english to which my father and i add english which partly to prevent its become a lose language among we and partly from patriotic motive we speak every day the consequence be a babel at which stranger use to laugh and which i shall make no attempt to reproduce in this narrative and there be two or three young lady friend besides pretty nearly of my own age who be occasional visitor for longer or shorter term and these visit i sometimes return these be we regular social resource but of course there be chance visit from neighbor of only five or six league distance my life be notwithstanding rather a solitary one i can assure you my gouvernante have just so much control over I as you might conjecture such sage person would have in the case of a rather spoil girl whose only parent allow she pretty nearly she own way in everything the first occurrence in my existence which produce a terrible impression upon my mind which in fact never have be efface be one of the very earliest incident of my life which i can recollect some people will think it so trifling that it should not be record here you will see however by-and-by why i mention it the nursery as it be call though i have it all to myself be a large room in the upper story of the castle with a steep oak roof i can not have be more than six year old when one night i awake and look round the room from my bed fail to see the nursery maid neither be my nurse there and i think myself alone i be not frighten for i be one of those happy child who be studiously keep in ignorance of ghost story of fairy tale and of all such lore as make we cover up we head when the door crack suddenly or the flicker of a expire candle make the shadow of a bedpost dance upon the wall nearer to we face i be vex and insult at find myself as i conceive neglect and i begin to whimper preparatory to a hearty bout of roar when to my surprise i see a solemn but very pretty face look at I from the side of the bed it be that of a young lady who be kneel with she hand under the coverlet i look at she with a kind of pleased wonder and cease whimper she caress I with she hand and lay down beside I on the bed and draw I towards she smile i feel immediately delightfully soothed and fall asleep again i be waken by a sensation as if two needle run into my breast very deep at the same moment and i cry loudly the lady start back with she eye fix on I and then slip down upon the floor and as i think hide herself under the bed i be now for the first time frightened and i yell with all my might and main nurse nursery maid housekeeper all come run in and hear my story they make light of it soothing I all they could meanwhile but child as i be i could perceive that they face be pale with a unwonted look of anxiety and i see they look under the bed and about the room and peep under table and pluck open cupboard and the housekeeper whisper to the nurse : lay you hand along that hollow in the bed someone _ do _ lie there so sure as you do not the place be still warm i remember the nursery maid petting I and all three examine my chest where i tell they i feel the puncture and pronounce that there be no sign visible that any such thing have happen to I the housekeeper and the two other servant who be in charge of the nursery remain sit up all night and from that time a servant always sit up in the nursery until i be about fourteen i be very nervous for a long time after this a doctor be call in he be pallid and elderly how well i remember he long saturnine face slightly pit with smallpox and he chestnut wig for a good while every second day he come and give I medicine which of course i hate the morning after i see this apparition i be in a state of terror and could not bear to be leave alone daylight though it be for a moment i remember my father come up and stand at the bedside and talk cheerfully and ask the nurse a number of question and laugh very heartily at one of the answer and pat I on the shoulder and kiss I and tell I not to be frighten that it be nothing but a dream and could not hurt I but i be not comfort for i know the visit of the strange woman be _ not _ a dream and i be _ awfully _ frightened i be a little console by the nursery maid 's assure I that it be she who have come and look at I and lie down beside I in the bed and that i must have be half-dreaming not to have know she face but this though support by the nurse do not quite satisfy I i remember in the course of that day a venerable old man in a black cassock come into the room with the nurse and housekeeper and talk a little to they and very kindly to I he face be very sweet and gentle and he tell I they be go to pray and join my hand together and desire I to say softly while they be pray lord hear all good prayer for we for jesus ' sake i think these be the very word for i often repeat they to myself and my nurse use for year to make I say they in my prayer i remember so well the thoughtful sweet face of that white-haired old man in he black cassock as he stand in that rude lofty brown room with the clumsy furniture of a fashion three hundred year old about he and the scanty light enter its shadowy atmosphere through the small lattice he kneel and the three woman with he and he pray aloud with a earnest quavering voice for what appear to I a long time i forget all my life precede that event and for some time after it be all obscure also but the scene i have just describe stand out vivid as the isolate picture of the phantasmagoria surround by darkness ii _ a guest _ i be now go to tell you something so strange that it will require all you faith in my veracity to believe my story it be not only true nevertheless but truth of which i have be a eyewitness it be a sweet summer evening and my father ask I as he sometimes do to take a little ramble with he along that beautiful forest vista which i have mention as lie in front of the schloss general spielsdorf can not come to we so soon as i have hope say my father as we pursue we walk he be to have pay we a visit of some week and we have expect he arrival next day he be to have bring with he a young lady he niece and ward mademoiselle rheinfeldt whom i have never see but whom i have hear describe as a very charming girl and in whose society i have promise myself many happy day i be more disappointed than a young lady

not for two month i dare say he answer and i be very glad now dear that you never know mademoiselle rheinfeldt and why i ask both mortified and curious because the poor young lady be dead he reply i quite forget i have not tell you but you be not in the room when i receive the general 's letter this evening i be very much shocked general spielsdorf have mention in he first letter six or seven week before that she be not so well as he would wish she but there be nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion of danger here be the general 's letter he say hand it to I i be afraid he be in great affliction the letter appear to I to have be write very nearly in distraction we sit down on a rude bench under a group of magnificent lime tree the sun be set with all its melancholy splendor behind the sylvan horizon and the stream that flow beside we home and pass under the steep old bridge i have mention wound through many a group of noble tree almost at we foot reflect in its current the fading crimson of the sky general spielsdorf 's letter be so extraordinary so vehement and in some place so self-contradictory that i read it twice over -- the second time aloud to my father -- and be still unable to account for it except by suppose that grief have unsettle he mind it say i have lose my darling daughter for as such i love she during the last day of dear bertha 's illness i be not able to write to you before then i have no idea of she danger i have lose she and now learn _ all _ too late she die in the peace of innocence and in the glorious hope of a bless futurity the fiend who betray we infatuated hospitality have do it all i think i be receive into my house innocence gaiety a charming companion for my lose bertha heaven what a fool have i be i thank god my child die without a suspicion of the cause of she suffering she be go without so much as conjecture the nature of she illness and the accursed passion of the agent of all this misery i devote my remain day to tracking and extinguish a monster i be tell i may hope to accomplish my righteous and merciful purpose at present there be scarcely a gleam of light to guide I i curse my conceited incredulity my despicable affectation of superiority my blindness my obstinacy -- all -- too late i can not write or talk collectedly now i be distract so soon as i shall have a little recovered i mean to devote myself for a time to enquiry which may possibly lead I as far as vienna some time in the autumn two month hence or earlier if i live i will see you -- that be if you permit I i will then tell you all that i scarce dare put upon paper now farewell pray for I dear friend in these term end this strange letter though i have never see bertha rheinfeldt my eye fill with tear at the sudden intelligence i be startle as well as profoundly disappoint the sun have now set and it be twilight by the time i have return the general 's letter to my father it be a soft clear evening and we loiter speculate upon the possible meaning of the violent and incoherent sentence which i have just be read we have nearly a mile to walk before reach the road that pass the schloss in front and by that time the moon be shine brilliantly at the drawbridge we meet madame perrodon and mademoiselle de lafontaine who have come out without they bonnet to enjoy the exquisite moonlight we hear they voice gabble in animated dialogue as we approach we join they at the drawbridge and turn about to admire with they the beautiful scene the glade through which we have just walk lay before we at we leave the narrow road wound away under clump of lordly tree and be lose to sight amid the thickening forest at the right the same road cross the steep and picturesque bridge near which stand a ruin tower which once guard that pass and beyond the bridge a abrupt eminence rise cover with tree and show in the shadow some gray ivy-clustered rock over the sward and low grounds a thin film of mist be steal like smoke mark the distance with a transparent veil and here and there we could see the river faintly flash in the moonlight no softer sweeter scene could be imagine the news i have just hear make it melancholy but nothing could disturb its character of profound serenity and the enchanted glory and vagueness of the prospect my father who enjoy the picturesque and i stand look in silence over the expanse beneath we the two good governess stand a little way behind we discourse upon the scene and be eloquent upon the moon madame perrodon be fat middle-aged and romantic and talk and sigh poetically mademoiselle de lafontaine -- in right of she father who be a german assume to be psychological metaphysical and something of a mystic -- now declare that when the moon shone with a light so intense it be well know that it indicate a special spiritual activity the effect of the full moon in such a state of brilliancy be manifold it act on dream it act on lunacy it act on nervous people it have marvelous physical influence connect with life mademoiselle related that she cousin who be mate of a merchant ship have take a nap on deck on such a night lie on he back with he face full in the light on the moon have waken after a dream of a old woman claw he by the cheek with he feature horribly draw to one side and he countenance have never quite recover its equilibrium the moon this night she say be full of idyllic and magnetic influence -- and see when you look behind you at the front of the schloss how all its window flash and twinkle with that silvery splendor as if unseen hand have light up the room to receive fairy guest there be indolent style of the spirit in which indispose to talk ourselves the talk of other be pleasant to we listless ear and i gaze on pleased with the tinkle of the lady ' conversation i have get into one of my mope mood tonight say my father after a silence and quote shakespeare whom by way of keep up we english he use to read aloud he say : ` in truth i know not why i be so sad it weary I : you say it weary you but how i get it -- come by it ' i forget the rest but i feel as if some great misfortune be hang over we i suppose the poor general 's afflict letter have have something to do with it at this moment the unwonted sound of carriage wheel and many hoof upon the road arrest we attention they seem to be approach from the high ground overlook the bridge and very soon the equipage emerge from that point two horseman first cross the bridge then come a carriage draw by four horse and two man ride behind it seem to be the travel carriage of a person of rank and we be all immediately absorb in watch that very unusual spectacle it become in a few moment greatly more interesting for just as the carriage have pass the summit of the steep bridge one of the leader take fright communicate he panic to the rest and after a plunge or two the whole team break into a wild gallop together and dash between the horseman who ride in front come thunder along the road towards we with the speed of a hurricane the excitement of the scene be make more painful by the clear long-drawn scream of a female voice from the carriage window we all advance in curiosity and horror I rather in silence the rest with various ejaculation of terror we suspense do not last long just before you reach the castle drawbridge on the route they be come there stand by the roadside a magnificent lime tree on the other stand a ancient stone cross at sight of which the horse now go at a pace that be perfectly frightful swerve so as to bring the wheel over the project root of the tree i know what be come i cover my eye unable to see it out and turn my head away at the same moment i hear a cry from my lady friend who have go on a little curiosity open my eye and i see a scene of utter confusion two of the horse be on the ground the carriage lay upon its side with two wheel in the air the man be busy remove the trace and a lady with a commanding air and figure have get out and stand with clasped hand raise the handkerchief that be in they every now and then to she eye through the carriage door be now lift a young lady who appear to be lifeless my dear old father be already beside the elder lady with he hat in he hand evidently tender he aid and the resource of he schloss the lady do not appear to hear he or to have eye for anything but the slender girl who be be place against the slope of the bank i approach the young lady be apparently stunned but she be certainly not dead my father who pique himself on be something of a physician have just have he finger on she wrist and assure the lady who declare herself she mother that she pulse though faint and irregular be undoubtedly still distinguishable the lady clasp she hand and look upward as if in a momentary transport of gratitude but immediately she break out again in that theatrical way which be i believe natural to some people she be what be call a fine look woman for she time of life and must have be handsome she be tall but not thin and dress in black velvet and look rather pale but with a proud and commanding countenance though now agitate strangely who be ever be so bear to calamity i hear she say with clasped hand as i come up here be i on a journey of life and death in prosecute which to lose a hour be possibly to lose all my child will not have recover sufficiently to resume she route for who can say how long i must leave she : i can not dare not delay how far on sir can you tell be the nearest village i must leave she there and shall not see my darling or even hear of she till my return three month hence i plucked my father by the coat and whisper earnestly in he ear : oh papa pray ask she to let she stay with we -- it would be so delightful do pray if madame will entrust she child to the care of my daughter and of she good gouvernante madame perrodon and permit she to remain as we guest under my charge until she return it will confer a distinction and a obligation upon we and we shall treat she with all the care and devotion which so sacred a trust deserve i can not do that sir it would be to task you kindness and chivalry too cruelly say the lady distractedly it would on the contrary be to confer on we a very great kindness at the moment when we most need it my daughter have just be disappoint by a cruel misfortune in a visit from which she have long anticipate a great deal of happiness if you confide this young lady to we care it will be she best consolation the nearest village on you route be distant and afford no such inn as you could think of place you daughter at you can not allow she to continue she journey for any considerable distance without danger if as you say you can not suspend you journey you must part with she tonight and nowhere could you do so with more honest assurance of care and tenderness than here there be something in this lady 's air and appearance so distinguished and even impose and in she manner so engaging as to impress one quite apart from the dignity of she equipage with a conviction that she be a person of consequence by this time the carriage be replace in its upright position and the horse quite tractable in the trace again the lady throw on she daughter a glance which i fancied be not quite so affectionate as one might have anticipate from the beginning of the scene then she beckon slightly to my father and withdraw two or three step with he out of hearing and talk to he with a fix and stern countenance not at all like that with which she have hitherto speak i be fill with wonder that my father do not seem to perceive the change and also unspeakably curious to learn what it could be that she be speak almost in he ear with so much earnestness and rapidity two or three minute at most i think she remain thus employ then she turn and a few step bring she to where she daughter lay support by madame perrodon she kneel beside she for a moment and whisper as madame suppose a little benediction in she ear then hastily kiss she she step into she carriage the door be close the footman in stately livery jump up behind the outrider spur on the postilion crack they whip the horse plunge and break suddenly into a furious canter that threaten soon again to become a gallop and the carriage whirl away follow at the same rapid pace by the two horseman in the rear iii _ we compare note _ we follow the _ cortege _ with we eye until it be swiftly lose to sight in the misty wood and the very sound of the hoof and the wheel die away in the silent night air nothing remain to assure we that the adventure have not be a illusion of a moment but the young lady who just at that moment open she eye i could not see for she face be turn from I but she raise she head evidently look about she and i hear a very sweet voice ask complainingly where be mamma we good madame perrodon answer tenderly and add some comfortable assurance i then hear she ask : where be i what be this place and after that she say i do not see the carriage and matska where be she madame answer all she question in so far as she understand they and gradually the young lady remember how the misadventure come about and be glad to hear that no one in or in attendance on the carriage be hurt and on learn that she mamma have leave she here till she return in about three month she weep i be go to add my consolation to those of madame perrodon when mademoiselle de lafontaine place she hand upon my arm say : do not approach one at a time be as much as she can at present converse with a very little excitement would possibly overpower she now as soon as she be comfortably in bed i think i will run up to she room and see she my father in the meantime have send a servant on horseback for the physician who live about two league away and a bedroom be be prepare for the young lady 's reception the stranger now rise and lean on madame 's arm walk slowly over the drawbridge and into the castle gate in the hall servant wait to receive she and she be conduct forthwith to she room the room we usually sit in as we draw room be long have four window that look over the moat and drawbridge upon the forest scene i have just describe it be furnish in old carve oak with large carve cabinet and the chair be cushion with crimson utrecht velvet the wall be cover with tapestry and surround with great gold frame the figure be as large as life in ancient and very curious costume and the subject represent be hunting hawk and generally festive it be not too stately to be extremely comfortable and here we have we tea for with he usual patriotic leaning he insist that the national beverage should make its appearance regularly with we coffee and chocolate we sit here this night and with candle light be talk over the adventure of the evening madame perrodon and mademoiselle de lafontaine be both of we party the young stranger have hardly lie down in she bed when she sink into a deep sleep and those lady have leave she in the care of a servant how do you like we guest i ask as soon as madame enter tell I all about she i like she extremely answer madame she be i almost think the prettiest creature i ever see about you age and so gentle and nice she be absolutely beautiful throw in mademoiselle who have peep for a moment into the stranger 's room and such a sweet voice add madame perrodon do you remark a woman in the carriage after it be set up again who do not get out inquire mademoiselle but only look from the window no we have not see she then she describe a hideous black woman with a sort of color turban on she head and who be gaze all the time from the carriage window nodding and grin derisively towards the lady with gleaming eye and large white eyeball and she tooth set as if in fury do you remark what a ill-looking pack of man the servant be ask madame yes say my father who have just come in ugly hang-dog look fellow as ever i beheld in my life i hope they may not rob the poor lady in the forest they be clever rogue however they get everything to rights in a minute i dare say they be wear out with too long travel say madame besides look wicked they face be so strangely lean and dark and sullen i be very curious i own but i dare say the young lady will tell you all about it tomorrow if she be sufficiently recover i do not think she will say my father with a mysterious smile and a little nod of he head as if he know more about it than he care to tell we this make we all the more inquisitive as to what have pass between he and the lady in the black velvet in the brief but earnest interview that have immediately precede she departure we be scarcely alone when i entreated he to tell I he do not need much press there be no particular reason why i should not tell you she express a reluctance to trouble we with the care of she daughter say she be in delicate health and nervous but not subject to any kind of seizure -- she volunteer that -- nor to any illusion be in fact perfectly sane how very odd to say all that i interpolated it be so unnecessary at all event it _ be _ say he laugh and as you wish to know all that pass which be indeed very little i tell you she then say ' i be make a long journey of _ vital _ importance -- she emphasize the word -- rapid and secret i shall return for my child in three month in the meantime she will be silent as to who we be whence we come and whither we be travel ' that be all she say she speak very pure french when she say the word ` secret ' she pause for a few seconds look sternly she eye fix on mine i fancy she make a great point of that you see how quickly she be go i hope i have not do a very foolish thing in take charge of the young lady for my part i be delighted i be longing to see and talk to she and only wait till the doctor should give I leave you who live in town can have no idea how great a event the introduction of a new friend be in such a solitude as surround we the doctor do not arrive till nearly one o'clock but i could no more have go to my bed and sleep than i could have overtake on foot the carriage in which the princess in black velvet have drive away when the physician come down to the drawing room it be to report very favorably upon he patient she be now sit up she pulse quite regular apparently perfectly well she have sustain no injury and the little shock to she nerve have pass away quite harmlessly there could be no harm certainly in my see she if we both wish it and with this permission i send forthwith to know whether she would allow I to visit she for a few minute in she room the servant return immediately to say that she desire nothing more you may be sure i be not long in avail myself of this permission we visitor lay in one of the handsomest room in the schloss it be perhaps a little stately there be a somber piece of tapestry opposite the foot of the bed represent cleopatra with the asp to she bosom and other solemn classic scene be display a little fade upon the other wall but there be gold carve and rich and vary color enough in the other decoration of the room to more than redeem the gloom of the old tapestry there be candle at the bedside she be sit up she slender pretty figure envelop in the soft silk dress gown embroider with flower and line with thick quilted silk which she mother have throw over she foot as she lay upon the ground what be it that as i reach the bedside and have just begin my little greet strike I dumb in a moment and make I recoil a step or two from before she i will tell you i see the very face which have visit I in my childhood at night which remain so fix in my memory and on which i have for so many year so often ruminate with horror when no one suspect of what i be think it be pretty even beautiful and when i first behold it wear the same melancholy expression but this almost instantly light into a strange fixed smile of recognition there be a silence of fully a minute and then at length she speak i could not how wonderful she exclaim twelve year ago i see you face in a dream and it have haunt I ever since wonderful indeed i repeat overcome with a effort the horror that have for a time suspend my utterance twelve year ago in vision or reality i certainly see you i could not forget you face it have remain before my eye ever since she smile have soften whatever i have fancy strange in it be go and it and she dimpling cheek be now delightfully pretty and intelligent i feel reassure and continue more in the vein which hospitality indicate to bid she welcome and to tell she how much pleasure she accidental arrival have give we all and especially what a happiness it be to I i take she hand as i speak i be a little shy as lonely people be but the situation make I eloquent and even bold she press my hand she lay hers upon it and she eye glow as look hastily into mine she smile again and blush she answer my welcome very prettily i sit down beside she still wonder and she say : i must tell you my vision about you it be so very strange that you and i should have have each of the other so vivid a dream that each should have see i you and you I look as we do now when of course we both be mere child i be a child about six year old and i awake from a confused and troubled dream and find myself in a room unlike my nursery wainscote clumsily in some dark wood and with cupboard and bedstead and chair and bench place about it the bed be i think all empty and the room itself without anyone but myself in it and i after look about I for some time and admiring especially a iron candlestick with two branch which i should certainly know again creep under one of the bed to reach the window but as i get from under the bed i hear someone cry and look up while i be still upon my knee i see you -- most assuredly you -- as i see you now a beautiful young lady with golden hair and large blue eye and lip -- you lip -- you as you be here you look win I i climb on the bed and put my arm about you and i think we both fall asleep i be arouse by a scream you be sit up scream i be frightened and slip down upon the ground and it seem to I lose consciousness for a moment and when i come to myself i be again in my nursery at home you face i have never forget since i could not be mislead by mere resemblance _ you be _ the lady whom i see then it be now my turn to relate my corresponding vision which i do to the undisguised wonder of my new acquaintance i do not know which should be most afraid of the other she say again smile -- if you be less pretty i think i should be very much afraid of you but be as you be and you and i both so young i feel only that i have make you acquaintance twelve year ago and have already a right to you intimacy at all event it do seem as if we be destine from we earliest childhood to be friend i wonder whether you feel as strangely draw towards I as i do to you i have never have a friend -- shall i find one now she sigh and she fine dark eye gaze passionately on I now the truth be i feel rather unaccountably towards the beautiful stranger i do feel as she say draw towards she but there be also something of repulsion in this ambiguous feeling however the sense of attraction immensely prevail she interested and win I she be so beautiful and so indescribably engaging i perceive now something of languor and exhaustion stealing over she and hasten to bid she good night the doctor think i add that you ought to have a maid to sit up with you tonight one of ours be wait and you will find she a very useful and quiet creature how kind of you but i could not sleep i never could with a attendant in the room i sha not require any assistance -- and shall i confess my weakness i be haunt with a terror of robber we house be rob once and two servant murder so i always lock my door it have become a habit -- and you look so kind i know you will forgive I i see there be a key in the lock she hold I close in she pretty arm for a moment and whisper in my ear good night darling it be very hard to part with you but good night tomorrow but not early i shall see you again she sink back on the pillow with a sigh and she fine eye follow I with a fond and melancholy gaze and she murmur again good night dear friend young people like and even love on impulse i be flatter by the evident though as yet undeserved fondness she show I i like the confidence with which she at once receive I she be determine that we should be very near friend next day come and we meet again i be delighted with my companion that be to say in many respects she look lose nothing in daylight -- she be certainly the most beautiful creature i have ever see and the unpleasant remembrance of the face present in my early dream have lose the effect of the first unexpected recognition she confess that she have experience a similar shock on see I and precisely the same faint antipathy that have mingle with my admiration of she we now laugh together over we momentary horror iv _ she habit -- a saunter _ i tell you that i be charm with she in most particulars there be some that do not please I so well she be above the middle height of woman i shall begin by describe she she be slender and wonderfully graceful except that she movement be languid -- very languid -- indeed there be nothing in she appearance to indicate a invalid she complexion be rich and brilliant she feature be small and beautifully form she eye large dark and lustrous she hair be quite wonderful i never see hair so magnificently thick and long when it be down about she shoulder i have often place my hand under it and laugh with wonder at its weight it be exquisitely fine and soft and in color a rich very dark brown with something of gold i love to let it down tumble with its own weight as in she room she lay back in she chair talk in she sweet low voice i use to fold and braid it and spread it out and play with it heaven if i have but know all i say there be particulars which do not please I i have tell you that she confidence win I the first night i see she but i find that she exercise with respect to herself she mother she history everything in fact connect with she life plan and people a ever wakeful reserve i dare say i be unreasonable perhaps i be wrong i dare say i ought to have respect the solemn injunction lay upon my father by the stately lady in black velvet but curiosity be a restless and unscrupulous passion and no one girl can endure with patience that hers should be baffle by another what harm could it do anyone to tell I what i so ardently desire to know have she no trust in my good sense or honor why would she not believe I when i assure she so solemnly that i would not divulge one syllable of what she tell I to any mortal breathing there be a coldness it seem to I beyond she year in she smile melancholy persistent refusal to afford I the least ray of light i can not say we quarrel upon this point for she would not quarrel upon any it be of course very unfair of I to press she very ill-bred but i really could not help it and i might just as well have let it alone what she do tell I amount in my unconscionable estimation -- to nothing it be all sum up in three very vague disclosure : first -- she name be carmilla second -- she family be very ancient and noble third -- she home lay in the direction of the west she would not tell I the name of she family nor they armorial bearing nor the name of they estate nor even that of the country they live in you be not to suppose that i worried she incessantly on these subject i watch opportunity and rather insinuate than urge my inquiry once or twice indeed i do attack she more directly but no matter what my tactic utter failure be invariably the result reproach and caress be all lose upon she but i must add this that she evasion be conduct with so pretty a melancholy and deprecation with so many and even passionate declaration of she liking for I and trust in my honor and with so many promise that i should at last know all that i could not find it in my heart long to be offend with she she use to place she pretty arm about my neck draw I to she and lay she cheek to mine murmur with she lip near my ear dearest you little heart be wound think I not cruel because i obey the irresistible law of my strength and weakness if you dear heart be wound my wild heart bleed with yours in the rapture of my enormous humiliation i live in you warm life and you shall die -- die sweetly die -- into mine i can not help it as i draw near to you you in you turn will draw near to other and learn the rapture of that cruelty which yet be love so for a while seek to know no more of I and mine but trust I with all you loving spirit and when she have speak such a rhapsody she would press I more closely in she tremble embrace and she lip in soft kiss gently glow upon my cheek she agitation and she language be unintelligible to I from these foolish embrace which be not of very frequent occurrence i must allow i use to wish to extricate myself but my energy seem to fail I she murmured word sound like a lullaby in my ear and soothe my resistance into a trance from which i only seem to recover myself when she withdraw she arm in these mysterious mood i do not like she i experience a strange tumultuous excitement that be pleasurable ever and anon mingle with a vague sense of fear and disgust i have no distinct thought about she while such scene last but i be conscious of a love grow into adoration and also of abhorrence this i know be paradox but i can make no other attempt to explain the feeling i now write after a interval of more than ten year with a tremble hand with a confused and horrible recollection of certain occurrence and situation in the ordeal through which i be unconsciously pass though with a vivid and very sharp remembrance of the main current of my story but i suspect in all life there be certain emotional scene those in which we passion have be most wildly and terribly rouse that be of all other the most vaguely and dimly remember sometimes after a hour of apathy my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure renew again and again blush softly gaze in my face with languid and burn eye and breathing so fast that she dress rise and fall with the tumultuous respiration it be like the ardor of a lover it embarrass I it be hateful and yet over-powering and with gloat eye she draw I to she and she hot lip travel along my cheek in kiss and she would whisper almost in sob you be mine you _ shall _ be mine you and i be one for ever then she have throw herself back in she chair with she small hand over she eye leave I tremble be we related i use to ask what can you mean by all this i remind you perhaps of someone whom you love but you must not i hate it i do not know you -- i do not know myself when you look so and talk so she use to sigh at my vehemence then turn away and drop my hand respect these very extraordinary manifestation i strove in vain to form any satisfactory theory -- i could not refer they to affectation or trick it be unmistakably the momentary break out of suppress instinct and emotion be she notwithstanding she mother 's volunteer denial subject to brief visitation of insanity or be there here a disguise and a romance i have read in old storybook of such thing what if a boyish lover have find he way into the house and seek to prosecute he suit in masquerade with the assistance of a clever old adventuress but there be many thing against this hypothesis highly interesting as it be to my vanity i could boast of no little attention such as masculine gallantry delight to offer between these passionate moment there be long interval of commonplace of gaiety of brooding melancholy during which except that i detect she eye so full of melancholy fire follow I at time i might have be as nothing to she except in these brief period of mysterious excitement she way be girlish and there be always a languor about she quite incompatible with a masculine system in a state of health in some respects she habit be odd perhaps not so singular in the opinion of a town lady like you as they appear to we rustic people she use to come down very late generally not till one o'clock she would then take a cup of chocolate but eat nothing we then go out for a walk which be a mere saunter and she seem almost immediately exhaust and either return to the schloss or sit on one of the bench that be place here and there among the tree this be a bodily languor in which she mind do not sympathize she be always a animated talker and very intelligent she sometimes allude for a moment to she own home or mention a adventure or situation or a early recollection which indicate a people of strange manners and describe custom of which we know nothing i gather from these chance hint that she native country be much more remote than i have at first fancy as we sit thus one afternoon under the tree a funeral pass we by it be that of a pretty young girl whom i have often see the daughter of one of the ranger of the forest the poor man be walk behind the coffin of he darling she be he only child and he look quite heartbroken peasant walk two-and-two come behind they be sing a funeral hymn i rise to mark my respect as they pass and join in the hymn they be very sweetly singing my companion shake I a little roughly and i turn surprised she say brusquely do not you perceive how discordant that be i think it very sweet on the contrary i answer vex at the interruption and very uncomfortable lest the people who compose the little procession should observe and resent what be pass i resume therefore instantly and be again interrupted you pierce my ear say carmillum almost angrily and stop she ear with she tiny finger besides how can you tell that you religion and mine be the same you form wind I and i hate funeral what a fuss why you must die -- _ everyone _ must die and all be happier when they do come home my father have go on with the clergyman to the churchyard i think you know she be to be bury today she i do not trouble my head about peasant i do not know who she be answer carmillum with a flash from she fine eye she be the poor girl who fancy she see a ghost a fortnight ago and have be die ever since till yesterday when she expire tell I nothing about ghost i sha not sleep tonight if you do i hope there be no plague or fever come all this look very like it i continue the swineherd 's young wife die only a week ago and she think something seize she by the throat as she lay in she bed and nearly strangle she papa say such horrible fancy do accompany some form of fever she be quite well the day before she sink afterwards and die before a week well _ she _ funeral be over i hope and _ she _ hymn sing and we ear sha not be tortured with that discord and jargon it have make I nervous sit down here beside I sit close hold my hand press it hard-hard-harder we have move a little back and have come to another seat she sit down she face undergo a change that alarm and even terrify I for a moment it darken and become horribly livid she tooth and hand be clench and she frown and compress she lip while she stare down upon the ground at she foot and tremble all over with a continued shudder as irrepressible as ague all she energy seem strain to suppress a fit with which she be then breathlessly tug and at length a low convulsive cry of suffer break from she and gradually the hysteria subside there that come of strangle people with hymn she say at last hold I hold I still it be pass away and so gradually it do and perhaps to dissipate the somber impression which the spectacle have leave upon I she become unusually animated and chatty and so we get home this be the first time i have see she exhibit any definable symptom of that delicacy of health which she mother have speak of it be the first time also i have see she exhibit anything like temper both pass away like a summer cloud and never but once afterwards do i witness on she part a momentary sign of anger i will tell you how it happen she and i be look out of one of the long drawing room window when there enter the courtyard over the drawbridge a figure of a wanderer whom i know very well he use to visit the schloss generally twice a year it be the figure of a hunchback with the sharp lean feature that generally accompany deformity he wear a pointed black beard and he be smile from ear to ear show he white fang he be dress in buff black and scarlet and cross with more strap and belt than i could

and mask attach to he belt several other mysterious case dangle about he and a black staff with copper ferrule in he hand he companion be a rough spare dog that follow at he heel but stop short suspiciously at the drawbridge and in a little while begin to howl dismally in the meantime the mountebank standing in the midst of the courtyard raise he grotesque hat and make we a very ceremonious bow pay he compliment very volubly in execrable french and german not much better then disengage he fiddle he begin to scrape a lively air to which he sing with a merry discord dancing with ludicrous air and activity that make I laugh in spite of the dog 's howling then he advance to the window with many smile and salutation and he hat in he left hand he fiddle under he arm and with a fluency that never take breath he gabble a long advertisement of all he accomplishment and the resource of the various art which he place at we service and the curiosity and entertainment which it be in he power

wretch tie up to the pump and flog with a cart whip and burnt to the bone with the cattle brand she retire from the window a step or two and sit down and have hardly lose sight of the offender when she wrath subside as suddenly as it have rise and she gradually recover she usual tone and seem to forget the little hunchback and he folly my father be out of spirit that evening on come in he tell we that there have be another case very similar to the two fatal one which have lately occur the sister of a young peasant on he estate only a mile away be very ill have be as she describe it attack very nearly in the same way and be now slowly but steadily sink all this say my father be strictly referable to natural cause these poor people infect one another with they superstition and so repeat in imagination the image of terror that have infested they neighbor but that very circumstance frighten one horribly say carmillum how so inquire my father i be so afraid of fancy i see such thing i think it would be as bad as reality we be in god 's hand : nothing can happen without he permission and all will end well for those who love he he be we faithful creator he have make we all and will take care of we creator _ nature _ say the young lady in answer to my gentle father and this disease that invade the country be natural nature all thing proceed from nature -- do not they all thing in the heaven in the earth and under the earth act and live as nature ordain i think so the doctor say he would come here today say my father after a silence i want to know what he think about it and what he think we have better do doctor never do I any good say carmillum then you have be ill i ask more ill than ever you be she answer long ago yes a long time i suffer from this very illness but i

my eye and pass she arm round my waist lovingly and lead I out of the room my father be busy over some papers near the window why do you papa like to frighten we say the pretty girl with a sigh and a little shudder he do not dear carmilla it be the very furthest thing from he mind be you afraid dearest i should be very much if i fancied there be any real danger of my be attack as those poor people be you be afraid to die yes every one be but to die as lover may -- to die together so that they may live together girl be caterpillar while they live in the world to be finally butterfly when the summer come but in the meantime there be grub and larva do not you see -- each with they peculiar propensity necessity and structure so say monsieur buffon in he big book in the next room later in the day the doctor come and be closet with papa for some time he be a skilful man of sixty and upward he wear powder and shave he pale face as smooth as a pumpkin he and papa emerge from the room together and i hear papa laugh and say as they come out : well i do wonder at a wise man like you what do you say to hippogriff and dragon the doctor be smile and make answer shake he head -- nevertheless life and death be mysterious state and we know little of the resource of either and so they walk on and i hear no more i do not then know what the doctor have be broach but i think i guess it now v _ a wonderful likeness _ this evening there arrive from gratz the grave dark-faced son of the picture cleaner with a horse and cart laden with two large packing case have many picture in each it be a journey of ten league and whenever a messenger arrive at the schloss from we little capital of gratz we use to crowd about he in the hall to hear the news this arrival create in we secluded quarter quite a sensation the case remain in the hall and the messenger be take charge of by the servant till he have eat he supper then with assistant and arm with hammer rip chisel and turnscrew he meet we in the hall where we have assemble to witness the unpacking of the case carmillum sit look listlessly on while one after the other the old picture nearly all portrait which have undergo the process of renovation be bring to light my mother be of a old hungarian family and most of these picture which be about to be restore to they place have come to we through she my father have a list in he hand from which he read as the artist rummage out the corresponding number i do not know that the picture be very good but they be undoubtedly very old and some of they very curious also they have for the most part the merit of be now see by I i may say for the first time for the smoke and dust of time have all but obliterate they there be a picture that i have not see yet say my father in one corner at the top of it be the name as well as i could read ` marcia karnstein ' and the date ' 1698 ' and i be curious to see how it have turn out i remember it it be a small picture about a foot and a half high and nearly square without a frame but it be so blacken by age that i could not make it out the artist now produce it with evident pride it be quite beautiful it be startling it seem to live it be the effigy of carmillum carmillum dear here be a absolute miracle here you be live smile ready to speak in this picture be not it beautiful papa and see even the little mole on she throat my father laugh and say certainly it be a wonderful likeness but he look away and to my surprise seem but little strike by it and go on talk to the picture cleaner who be also something of a artist and discourse with intelligence about the portrait or other work which he art have just bring into light and color while i be more and more lose in wonder the more i look at the picture will you let I hang this picture in my room papa i ask certainly dear say he smile i be very glad you think it so like it must be prettier even than i think it if it be the young lady do not acknowledge this pretty speech do not seem to hear it she be lean back in she seat she fine eye under they long lash gaze on I in contemplation and she smile in a kind of rapture and now you can read quite plainly the name that be write in the corner it be not marcia it look as if it be do in gold the name be mircalla countess karnstein and this be a little coronet over and underneath ad 1698 i be descend from the karnstein that be mamma be ah say the lady languidly so be i i think a very long descent very ancient be there any karnstein live now none who bear the name i believe the family be ruin i believe in some civil war long ago but the ruin of the castle be only about three mile away how interesting she say languidly but see what beautiful moonlight she glance through the hall door which stand a little open suppose you take a little ramble round the court and look down at the road and river it be so like the night you come to we i say she sigh smile she rise and each with she arm about the other 's waist we walk out upon the pavement in silence slowly we walk down to the drawbridge where the beautiful landscape open before we and so you be think of the night i come here she almost whisper be you glad i come delighted dear carmilla i answer and you ask for the picture you think like I to hang in you room she murmur with a sigh as she draw she arm closer about my waist and let she pretty head sink upon my shoulder how romantic you be carmillum i say whenever you tell I you story it will be make up chiefly of some one great romance she kiss I silently i be sure carmillum you have be in love that there be at this moment a affair of the heart go on i have be in love with no one and never shall she whisper unless it should be with you how beautiful she look in the moonlight shy and strange be the look with which she quickly hide she face in my neck and hair with tumultuous sigh that seem almost to sob and press in mine a hand that tremble she soft cheek be glowing against mine darling darling she murmur i live in you and you would die for I i love you so i start from she she be gaze on I with eye from which all fire all meaning have fly and a face colorless and apathetic be there a chill in the air dear she say drowsily i almost shiver have i be dream let we come in come come come in you look ill carmillum a little faint you certainly must take some wine i say yes i will i be better now i shall be quite well in a few minute yes do give I a little wine answer carmillum as we approach the door let we look again for a moment it be the last time perhaps i shall see the moonlight with you how do you feel now dear carmillum be you really better i ask i be begin to take alarm lest she should have be stricken with the strange epidemic that they say have invade the country about we papa would be grieve beyond measure i add if he think you be ever so little ill without immediately let we know we have a very skilful doctor near we the physician who be with papa today i be sure he be i know how kind you all be but dear child i be quite well again there be nothing ever wrong with I but a little weakness people say i be languid i be incapable of exertion i can scarcely walk as far as a child of three year old : and every now and then the little strength i have falter and i become as you have just see I but after all i be very easily set up again in a moment i be perfectly myself see how i have recover so indeed she have and she and i talk a great deal and very animated she be and the remainder of that evening pass without any recurrence of what i call she infatuation i mean she crazy talk and look which embarrassed and even frighten I but there occur that night a event which give my thought quite a new turn and seem to startle even carmillum 's languid nature into momentary energy vi _ a very strange agony _ when we get into the draw room and have sit down to we coffee and chocolate although carmillum do not take any she seem quite herself again and madame and mademoiselle de lafontaine join we and make a little card party in the course of which papa come in for what he call he dish of tea when the game be over he sit down beside carmillum on the sofa and ask she a little anxiously whether she have hear from she mother since she arrival she answer no he then ask whether she know where a letter would reach she at present i can not tell she answer ambiguously but i have be think of leave you you have be already too hospitable and too kind to I i have give you a infinity of trouble and i should wish to take a carriage tomorrow and post in pursuit of she i know where i shall ultimately find she although i dare not yet tell you but you must not dream of any such thing exclaim my father to my great relief we can not afford to lose you so and i will not consent to you leave we except under the care of you mother who be so good as to consent to you remain with we till she should herself return i should be quite happy if i know that you hear from she : but this evening the account of the progress of the mysterious disease that have invade we neighborhood grow even more alarming and my beautiful guest i do feel the responsibility unaided by advice from you mother very much but i shall do my best and one thing be certain that you must not think of leave we without she distinct direction to that effect we should suffer too much in parting from you to consent to it easily thank you sir a thousand time for you hospitality she answer smile bashfully you have all be too kind to I i have seldom be so happy in all my life before as in you beautiful chateau under you care and in the society of you dear daughter so he gallantly in he old-fashioned way kiss she hand smile and please at she little speech i accompany carmillum as usual to she room and sit and chat with she while she be prepare for bed do you think i say at length that you will ever confide fully in I she turn round smile but make no answer only continue to smile on I you will not answer that i say you can not answer pleasantly i ought not to have ask you you be quite right to ask I that or anything you do not know how dear you be to I or you could not think any confidence too great to look for but i be under vow no nun half so awfully and i dare not tell my story yet even to you the time be very near when you shall know everything you will think I cruel very selfish but love be always selfish the more ardent the more selfish how jealous i be you can not know you must come with I loving I to death or else hate I and still come with I and _ hate _ I through death and after there be no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature now carmilla you be go to talk you wild nonsense again i say hastily not i silly little fool as i be and full of whim and fancy for you sake i 'll talk like a sage be you ever at a ball no how you do run on what be it like how charming it must be i almost forget it be year ago i laugh you be not so old you first ball can hardly be forget yet i remember everything about it -- with a effort i see it all as diver see what be go on above they through a medium dense ripple but transparent there occur that night what have confuse the picture and make its color faint i be all but assassinate in my bed wound here she touch she breast and never be the same since be you near die yes very -- a cruel love -- strange love that would have take my life love will have its sacrifice no sacrifice without blood let we go to sleep now i feel so lazy how can i get up just now and lock my door she be lie with she tiny hand bury in she rich wavy hair under she cheek she little head upon the pillow and she glittering eye follow I wherever i move with a kind of shy smile that i could not decipher i bid she good night and creep from the room with a uncomfortable sensation i often wonder whether we pretty guest ever say she prayer i certainly have never see she upon she knee in the morning she never come down until long after we family prayer be over and at night she never leave the drawing room to attend we brief evening prayer in the hall if it have not be that it have casually come out in one of we careless talk that she have be baptise i should have doubt she be a christian religion be a subject on which i have never hear she speak a word if i have know the world better this particular neglect or antipathy would not have so much surprised I the precaution of nervous people be infectious and person of a like temperament be pretty sure after a time to imitate they i have adopt carmillum 's habit of lock she bedroom door have take into my head all she whimsical alarm about midnight invader and prowl assassin i have also adopt she precaution of make a brief search through she room to satisfy herself that no lurk assassin or robber be ensconce these wise measure take i get into my bed and fall asleep a light be burn in my room this be a old habit of very early date and which nothing could have tempt I to dispense with thus fortify i might take my rest in peace but dream come through stone wall light up dark room or darken light one and they person make they exit and they entrance as they please and laugh at locksmith i have a dream that night that be the beginning of a very strange agony i can not call it a nightmare for i be quite conscious of be asleep but i be equally conscious of be in my room and lie in bed precisely as i actually be i see or fancy i see the room and its furniture just as i have see it last except that it be very dark and i see something move round the foot of the bed which at first i could not accurately distinguish but i soon see that it be a sooty-black animal that resemble a monstrous cat it appear to I about four or five foot long for it measure fully the length of the hearthrug as it pass over it and it continue to-ing and fro-ing with the lithe sinister restlessness of a beast in a cage i could not cry out although as you may suppose i be terrify its pace be grow faster and the room rapidly darker and darker and at length so dark that i could no longer see anything of it but its eye i feel it spring lightly on the bed the two broad eye approach my face and suddenly i feel a stinging pain as if two large needle dart a inch or two apart deep into my breast i wake with a scream the room be light by the candle that burn there all through the night and i see a female figure standing at the foot of the bed a little at the right side it be in a dark loose dress and its hair be down and cover its shoulder a block of stone could not have be more still there be not the slightest stir of respiration as i stare at it the figure appear to have change its place and be now nearer the door then close to it the door open and it pass out i be now relieved and able to breathe and move my first thought be that carmillum have be play I a trick and that i have forget to secure my door i hasten to it and find it lock as usual on the inside i be afraid to open it -- i be horrify i spring into my bed and cover my head up in the bedclothes and lay there more dead than alive till morning vii _ descend _ it would be vain my attempt to tell you the horror with which even now i recall the occurrence of that night it be no such transitory terror as a dream leave behind it it seem to deepen by time and communicate itself to the room and the very furniture that have encompass the apparition i could not bear next day to be alone for a moment i should have tell papa but for two opposite reason at one time i think he would laugh at my story and i could not bear its be treat as a jest and at another i think he might fancy that i have be attack by the mysterious complaint which have invade we neighborhood i have myself no misgiving of the kind and as he have be rather a invalid for some time i be afraid of alarming he i be comfortable enough with my good-natured companion madame perrodon and the vivacious mademoiselle lafontaine they both perceive that i be out of spirit and nervous and at length i tell they what lay so heavy at my heart mademoiselle laugh but i fancy that madame perrodon look anxious by-the-by say mademoiselle laugh the long lime tree walk behind carmillum 's bedroom window be haunt nonsense exclaim madame who probably think the theme rather inopportune and who tell that story my dear martin say that he come up twice when the old yard gate be be repair before sunrise and twice see the same female figure walk down the lime tree avenue so he well might as long as there be cow to milk in the river field say madame i daresay but martin choose to be frightened and never do i see fool more frightened you must not say a word about it to carmillum because she can see down that walk from she room window i interpose and she be if possible a greater coward than i carmilla come down rather later than usual that day i be so frightened last night she say so soon as be together and i be sure i should have see something dreadful if it have not be for that charm i buy from the poor little hunchback whom i call such hard name i have a dream of something black come round my bed and i awake in a perfect horror and i really think for some seconds i see a dark figure near the chimney-piece but i feel under my pillow for my charm and the moment my finger touch it the figure disappear and i feel quite certain only that i have it by I that something frightful would have make its appearance and perhaps throttle I as it do those poor people we hear of well listen to I i begin and recount my adventure at the recital of which she appear horrified and have you the charm near you she ask earnestly no i have drop it into a china vase in the draw room but i shall certainly take it with I tonight as you have so much faith in it at this distance of time i can not tell you or even understand how i overcome my horror so effectually as to lie alone in my room that night i remember distinctly that i pin the charm to my pillow i fall asleep almost immediately and sleep even more soundly than usual all night next night i pass as well my sleep be delightfully deep and dreamless but i waken with a sense of lassitude and melancholy which however do not exceed a degree that be almost luxurious well i tell you so say carmillum when i describe my quiet sleep i have such delightful sleep myself last night i pin the charm to the breast of my nightdress it be too far away the night before i be quite sure it be all fancy except the dream i use to think that evil spirit make dream but we doctor tell I it be no such thing only a fever passing by or some other malady as they often do he say knock at the door and not be able to get in pass on with that alarm and what do you think the charm be say i it have be fumigate or immerse in some drug and be a antidote against the malaria she answer then it act only on the body certainly you do not suppose that evil spirit be frighten by bit of ribbon or the perfume of a druggist 's shop no these complaint wander in the air begin by try the nerve and so infect the brain but before they can seize upon you the antidote repel they that i be sure be what the charm have do for we it be nothing magical it be simply natural i should have be happier if i could have quite agree with carmillum but i do my best and the impression be a little lose its force for some night i sleep profoundly but still every morning i feel the same lassitude and a languor weigh upon I all day i feel myself a change girl a strange melancholy be steal over I a melancholy that i would not have interrupt dim thought of death begin to open and a idea that i be slowly sink take gentle and somehow not unwelcome possession of I if it be sad the tone of mind which this induce be also sweet whatever it might be my soul acquiesce in it i would not admit that i be ill i would not consent to tell my papa or to have the doctor send for carmillum become more devoted to I than ever and she strange paroxysm of languid adoration more frequent she use to gloat on I with increase ardor the more my strength and spirit wane this always shock I like a momentary glare of insanity without know it i be now in a pretty advanced stage of the strangest illness under which mortal ever suffer there be a unaccountable fascination in its earlier symptom that more than reconcile I to the incapacitating effect of that stage of the malady this fascination increase for a time until it reach a certain point when gradually a sense of the horrible mingled itself with it deepen as you shall hear until it discolor and pervert the whole state of my life the first change i experience be rather agreeable it be very near the turn point from which begin the descent of avernus certain vague and strange sensation visit I in my sleep the prevail one be of that pleasant peculiar cold thrill which we feel in bathing when we move against the current of a river this be soon accompany by dream that seem interminable and be so vague that i could never recollect they scenery and person or any one connected portion of they action but they leave a awful impression and a sense of exhaustion as if i have pass through a long period of great mental exertion and danger after all these dream there remain on wake a remembrance of have be in a place very nearly dark and of have speak to people whom i could not see and especially of one clear voice of a female 's very deep that speak as if at a distance slowly and produce always the same sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear sometimes there come a sensation as if a hand be draw softly along my cheek and neck sometimes it be as if warm lip kiss I and longer and longer and more lovingly as they reach my throat but there the caress fix itself my heart beat faster my breathing rise and fall rapidly and full draw a sob that rise into a sense of strangulation supervene and turn into a dreadful convulsion in which my sens leave I and i become unconscious it be now three week since the commencement of this unaccountable state my suffering have during the last week tell upon my appearance i have grow pale my eye be dilate and darken underneath and the languor which i have long feel begin to display itself in my countenance my father ask I often whether i be ill but with a obstinacy which now seem to I unaccountable i persist in assure he that i be quite well in a sense this be true i have no pain i could complain of no bodily derangement my complaint seem to be one of the imagination or the nerve and horrible as my suffering be i keep they with a morbid reserve very nearly to myself it could not be that terrible complaint which the peasant call the oupire for i have now be suffer for three week and they be seldom ill for much more than three day when death put a end to they misery carmillum complain of dream and feverish sensation but by no means of so alarming a kind as mine i say that mine be extremely alarming have i be capable of comprehend my condition i would have invoke aid and advice on my knee the narcotic of a unsuspected influence be act upon I and my perception be benumb i be go to tell you now of a dream that lead immediately to a odd discovery one night instead of the voice i be accustom to hear in the dark i hear one sweet and tender and at the same time terrible which say you mother warn you to beware of the assassin at the same time a light unexpectedly spring up and i see carmillum standing near the foot of my bed in she white nightdress bath from she chin to she foot in one great stain of blood i waken with a shriek possess with the one idea that carmillum be be murder i remember spring from my bed and my next recollection be that of standing on the lobby cry for help madame and mademoiselle come scurry out of they room in alarm a lamp burn always on the lobby and see I they soon learn the cause of my terror i insist on we knock at carmillum 's door we knock be unanswered it soon become a pound and a uproar we shriek she name but all be vain we all grow frightened for the door be lock we hurry back in panic to my room there we ring the bell long and furiously if my father 's room have be at that side of the house we would have call he up at once to we aid but alas he be quite out of hearing and to reach he involve a excursion for which we none of we have courage servant however soon come run up the stair i have get on my dress gown and slipper meanwhile and my companion be already similarly furnished recognize the voice of the servant on the lobby we sally out together and have renew as fruitlessly we summons at carmillum 's door i order the man to force the lock they do so and we stand hold we light aloft in the doorway and so stare into the room we call she by name but there be still no reply we look round the room everything be undisturbed it be exactly in the state in which i have leave it on bid she good night but carmillum be go viii _ search _ at sight of the room perfectly undisturbed except for we violent entrance we begin to cool a little and soon recover we sens sufficiently to dismiss the man it have strike mademoiselle that possibly carmillum have be waken by the uproar at she door and in she first panic have jump from she bed and hide herself in a press or behind a curtain from which she could not of course emerge until the majordomo and he myrmidon have withdraw we now recommence we search and begin to call she name again it be all to no purpose we perplexity and agitation increase we examine the window but they be secure i implored of carmillum if she have conceal herself to play this cruel trick no longer -- to come out and to end we anxiety it be all useless i be by this time convinced that she be not in the room nor in the dress room the door of which be still lock on this side she could not have pass it i be utterly puzzle have carmillum discover one of those secret passage which the old housekeeper say be know to exist in the schloss although the tradition of they exact situation have be lose a little time would no doubt explain all -- utterly perplexed as for the present we be it be past four o'clock and i prefer pass the remain hour of darkness in madame 's room daylight bring no solution of the difficulty the whole household with my father at its head be in a state of agitation next morning every part of the chateau be search the grounds be explore no trace of the miss lady could be discover the stream be about to be drag my father be in distraction what a tale to have to tell the poor girl 's mother on she return i too be almost beside myself though my grief be quite of a different kind the morning be pass in alarm and excitement it be now one o'clock and still no tiding i run up to carmillum 's room and find she standing at she dress table i be astounded i could not believe my eye she beckon I to she with she pretty finger in silence she face express extreme fear i run to she in a ecstasy of joy i kiss and embrace she again and again i run to the bell and ring it vehemently to bring other to the spot who might at once relieve my father 's anxiety dear carmilla what have become of you all this time we have be in agony of anxiety about you i exclaimed where have you be how do you come back last night have be a night of wonder she say for mercy 's sake explain all you can it be past two last night she say when i go to sleep as usual in my bed with my door lock that of the dress room and that open upon the gallery my sleep be uninterrupted and so far as i know dreamless but i wake just now on the sofa in the dress room there and i find the door between the room open and the other door force how could all this have happen without my be waken it must have be accompany with a great deal of noise and i be particularly easily waken and how could i have be carry out of my bed without my sleep have be interrupted i whom the slightest stir startle by this time madame mademoiselle my father and a number of the servant be in the room carmillum be of course overwhelm with inquiry congratulation and welcome she have but one story to tell and seem the least able of all the party to suggest any way of accounting for what have happen my father take a turn up and down the room think i see carmillum 's eye follow he for a moment with a sly dark glance when my father have send the servant away mademoiselle have go in search of a little bottle of valerian and salvolatile and there be no one now in the room with carmillum except my father madame and myself he come to she thoughtfully take she hand very kindly lead she to the sofa and sit down beside she will you forgive I my dear if i risk a conjecture and ask a question who can have a better right she say ask what you please and i will tell you everything but my story be simply one of bewilderment and darkness i know absolutely nothing put any question you please but you know of course the limitation mamma have place I under perfectly my dear child i need not approach the topic on which she desire we silence now the marvel of last night consist in you have be remove from you bed and you room without be waken and this removal have occur apparently while the window be still secure and the two door lock upon the inside i will tell you my theory and ask you a question carmillum be lean on she hand dejectedly madame and i be listen breathlessly now my question be this have you ever be suspect of walk in you sleep never since i be very young indeed but you do walk in you sleep when you be young yes i know i do i have be tell so often by my old nurse my father smile and nod well what have happen be this you get up in you sleep unlock the door not leave the key as usual in the lock but take it out and lock it on the outside you again take the key out and carry it away with you to some one of the five-and-twenty room on this floor or perhaps upstairs or downstairs there be so many room and closet so much heavy furniture and such accumulation of lumber that it would require a week to search this old house thoroughly do you see now what i mean i do but not all she answer and how papa do you account for she finding herself on the sofa in the dress room which we have search so carefully she come there after you have search it still in she sleep and at last awake spontaneously and be as much surprised to find herself where she be as any one else i wish all mystery be as easily and innocently explain as yours carmillum he say laughing and so we may congratulate ourselves on the certainty that the most natural explanation of the occurrence be one that involve no drug no tamper with lock no burglar or poisoner or witch -- nothing that need alarm carmillum or anyone else for we safety carmillum be look charmingly nothing could be more beautiful than she tint she beauty be i think enhance by that graceful languor that be peculiar to she i think my father be silently contrast she look with mine for he say : i wish my poor laura be look more like herself and he sigh so we alarm be happily end and carmillum restore to she friend ix _ the doctor _ as carmillum would not hear of a attendant sleeping in she room my father arrange that a servant should sleep outside she door so that she would not attempt to make another such excursion without be arrest at she own door that night pass quietly and next morning early the doctor whom my father have send for without tell I a word about it arrive to see I madame accompany I to the library and there the grave little doctor with white hair and spectacles whom i mention before be wait to receive I i tell he my story and as i proceed he grow graver and graver we be stand he and i in the recess of one of the window face one another when my statement be over he lean with he shoulder against the wall and with he eye fix on I earnestly with a interest in which be a dash of horror after a minute 's reflection he ask madame if he could see my father he be send for accordingly and as he enter smile he say : i dare say doctor you be go to tell I that i be a old fool for have bring you here i hope i be but he smile fade into shadow as the doctor with a very grave face beckon he to he he and the doctor talk for some time in the same recess where i have just confer with the physician it seem a earnest and argumentative conversation the room be very large and i and madame stand together burn with curiosity at the farther end not a word could we hear however for they speak in a very low tone and the deep recess of the window quite conceal the doctor from view and very nearly my father whose foot arm and shoulder only could we see and the voice be i suppose all the less audible for the sort of closet which the thick wall and window form after a time my father 's face look into the room it be pale thoughtful and i fancied agitate laura dear come here for a moment madame we sha not trouble you the doctor say at present accordingly i approach for the first time a little alarmed for although i feel very weak i do not feel ill and strength one always fancy be a thing that may be pick up when we please my father hold out he hand to I as i draw near but he be look at the doctor and he say : it certainly be very odd i do not understand it quite laura come here dear now attend to doctor spielsberg and recollect yourself you mention a sensation like that of two needle pierce the skin somewhere about you neck on the night when you experience you first horrible dream be there still any soreness none at all i answer can you indicate with you finger about the point at which you think this occur very little below my throat -- here i answer i wear a morning dress which cover the place i point to now you can satisfy yourself say the doctor you will not mind you papa 's lower you dress a very little it be necessary to detect a symptom of the complaint under which you have be suffer i acquiesce it be only a inch or two below the edge of my collar god bless I -- so it be exclaim my father grow pale you see it now with you own eye say the doctor with a gloomy triumph what be it i exclaimed begin to be frightened nothing my dear young lady but a small blue spot about the size of the tip of you little finger and now he continue turn to papa the question be what be best to be do be there any danger i urge in great trepidation i trust not my dear answer the doctor i do not see why you should not recover i do not see why you should not begin immediately to get better that be the point at which the sense of strangulation begin yes i answer and -- recollect as well as you can -- the same point be a kind of center of that thrill which you describe just now like the current of a cold stream run against you it may have be i think it be ay you see he add turn to my father shall i say a word to madame certainly say my father he call madame to he and say : i find my young friend here far from well it will not be of any great consequence i hope but it will be necessary that some step be take which i will explain by-and-by but in the meantime madame you will be so good as not to let miss laura be alone for one moment that be the only direction i need give for the present it be indispensable we may rely upon you kindness madame i know add my father madame satisfied he eagerly and you dear laura i know you will observe the doctor 's direction i shall have to ask you opinion upon another patient whose symptom slightly resemble those of my daughter that have just be detail to you -- very much milder in degree but i believe quite of the same sort she be a young lady -- we guest but as you say you will be pass this way again this evening you can not do better than take you supper here and you can then see she she do not come down till the afternoon i thank you say the doctor i shall be with you then at about seven this evening and then they repeat they direction to I and to madame and with this parting charge my father leave we and walk out with the doctor and i see they pacing together up and down between the road and the moat on the grassy platform in front of the castle evidently absorb in earnest conversation the doctor do not return i see he mount he horse there take he leave and ride away eastward through the forest nearly at the same time i see the man arrive from dranfield with the letter and dismount and hand the bag to my father in the meantime madame and i be both busy lose in conjecture as to the reason of the singular and earnest direction which the doctor and my father have concur in impose madame as she afterwards tell I be afraid the doctor apprehend a sudden seizure and that without prompt assistance i might either lose my life in a fit or at least be seriously hurt the interpretation do not strike I and i fancy perhaps luckily for my nerve that the arrangement be prescribe simply to secure a companion who would prevent my take too much exercise or eat unripe fruit or do any of the fifty foolish thing to which young people be suppose to be prone about half a hour after my father come in -- he have a letter in he hand -- and say : this letter have be delay it be from general spielsdorf he might have be here yesterday he may not come till tomorrow or he may be here today he put the open letter into my hand but he do not look pleased as he use when a guest especially one so much loved as the general be come on the contrary he look as if he wish he at the bottom of the red sea there be plainly something on he mind which he do not choose to divulge papa darling will you tell I this say i suddenly lay my hand on he arm and look i be sure imploringly in he face perhaps he answer smooth my hair caressingly over my eye do the doctor think I very ill no dear he think if right step be take you will be quite well again at least on the high road to a complete recovery in a day or two he answer a little dryly i wish we good friend the general have choose any other time that be i wish you have be perfectly well to receive he but do tell I papa i insist what do he think be the matter with I nothing you must not plague I with question he answer with more irritation than i ever remember he to have display before and see that i look wound i suppose he kiss I and add you shall know all about it in a day or two that be all that i know in the meantime you be not to trouble you head about it he turn and leave the room but come back before i have do wonder and puzzling over the oddity of all this it be merely to say that he be go to karnstein and have order the carriage to be ready at twelve and that i and madame should accompany he he be go to see the priest who live near those picturesque grounds upon business and as carmillum have never see they she could follow when she come down with mademoiselle who would bring material for what you call a picnic which might be lay for we in the ruin castle at twelve o'clock accordingly i be ready and not long after my father madame and i set out upon we project drive pass the drawbridge we turn to the right and follow the road over the steep gothic bridge westward to reach the desert village and ruin castle of karnstein no sylvan drive can be fancy prettier the ground break into gentle hill and hollow all clothe with beautiful wood totally destitute of the comparative formality which artificial planting and early culture and pruning impart the irregularity of the ground often lead the road out of its course and cause it to wind beautifully round the side of broken hollow and the steeper side of the hill among variety of ground almost inexhaustible turn one of these point we suddenly encounter we old friend the general ride towards we attend by a mount servant he portmanteau be follow in a hire wagon such as we term a cart the general dismount as we pull up and after the usual greeting be easily persuade to accept the vacant seat in the carriage and send he horse on with he servant to the schloss x _ bereave _ it be about ten month since we have last see he : but that time have suffice to make a alteration of year in he appearance he have grow thinner something of gloom and anxiety have take the place of that cordial serenity which use to characterize he feature he dark blue eye always penetrate now gleam with a sterner light from under he shaggy gray eyebrow it be not such a change as grief alone usually induce and angrier passion seem to have have they share in bring it about we have not long resume we drive when the general begin to talk with he usual soldierly directness of the bereavement as he term it which he have sustain in the death of he beloved niece and ward and he then break out in a tone of intense bitterness and fury inveigh against the hellish art to which she have fall a victim and express with more exasperation than piety he wonder that heaven should tolerate so monstrous a indulgence of the lust and malignity of hell my father who see at once that something very extraordinary have befall ask he if not too painful to he to detail the circumstance which he think justified the strong term in which he express himself i should tell you all with pleasure say the general but you would not believe I why should i not he ask because he answer testily you believe in nothing but what consist with you own prejudice and illusion i remember when i be like you but i have learn better try I say my father i be not such a dogmatist as you suppose besides which i very well know that you generally require proof for what you believe and be therefore very strongly predispose to respect you conclusion you be right in suppose that i have not be lead lightly into a belief in the marvelous -- for what i have experience be marvelous -- and i have be force by extraordinary evidence to credit that which run counter diametrically to all my theory i have be make the dupe of a preternatural conspiracy notwithstanding he profession of confidence in the general 's penetration i see my father at this point glance at the general with as i think a marked suspicion of he sanity the general do not see it luckily he be look gloomily and curiously into the glade and vista of the wood that be open before we you be go to the ruin of karnstein he say yes it be a lucky coincidence do you know i be go to ask you to bring I there to inspect they i have a special object in explore there be a ruin chapel be not there with a great many tomb of that extinct family so there be -- highly interesting say my father i hope you be think of claim the title and estate my father say this gaily but the general do not recollect the laugh or even the smile which courtesy exact for a friend 's joke on the contrary he look grave and even fierce ruminate on a matter that stir he anger and horror something very different he say gruffly i mean to unearth some of those fine people i hope by god 's blessing to accomplish a pious sacrilege here which will relieve we earth of certain monster and enable honest people to sleep in they bed without be assail by murderer i have strange thing to tell you my dear friend such as i myself would have scout as incredible a few month since my father look at he again but this time not with a glance of suspicion -- with a eye rather of keen intelligence and alarm the house of karnstein he say have be long extinct : a hundred year at least my dear wife be maternally descend from the karnstein but the name and title have long cease to exist the castle be a ruin the very village be desert it be fifty year since the smoke of a chimney be see there not a roof leave quite true i have hear a great deal about that since i last saw you a great deal that will astonish you but i have better relate everything in the order in which it occur say the general you see my dear ward -- my child i may call she no creature could have be more beautiful and only three month ago none more bloom yes poor thing when i see she last she certainly be quite lovely say my father i be grieve and shock more than i can tell you my dear friend i know what a blow it be to you he take the general 's hand and they exchange a kind pressure tear gather in the old soldier 's eye he do not seek to conceal they he say : we have be very old friend i know you would feel for I childless as i be she have become a object of very near interest to I and repay my care by a affection that cheer my home and make my life happy that be all go the year that remain to I on earth may not be very long but by god 's mercy i hope to accomplish a service to mankind before i die and to subserve the vengeance of heaven upon the fiend who have murder my poor child in the spring of she hope and beauty you say just now that you intend relate everything as it occur say my father pray do i assure you that it be not mere curiosity that prompt I by this time we have reach the point at which the drunstall road by which the general have come diverge from the road which we be travel to karnstein how far be it to the ruin inquire the general look anxiously forward about half a league answer my father pray let we hear the story you be so good as to promise xi _ the story _ with all my heart say the general with a effort and after a short pause in which to arrange he subject he commence one of the strangest narrative i ever hear my dear child be look forward with great pleasure to the visit you have be so good as to arrange for she to you charming daughter here he make I a gallant but melancholy bow in the meantime we have a invitation to my old friend the count carlsfeld whose schloss be about six league to the other side of karnstein it be to attend the series of fete which you remember be give by he in honor of he illustrious visitor the grand duke charle yes and very splendid i believe they be say my father princely but then he hospitality be quite regal he have aladdin 's lamp the night from which my sorrow date be devote to a magnificent masquerade the grounds be throw open the tree hang with color lamp there be such a display of firework as pari itself have never witness and such music -- music you know be my weakness -- such ravishing music the finest instrumental band perhaps in the world and the finest singer who could be collect from all the great opera in europe as you wander through these fantastically illuminated grounds the moon-lighted chateau throw a rosy light from its long row of window you would suddenly hear these ravishing voice steal from the silence of some grove or rise from boat upon the lake i feel myself as i look and listen carry back into the romance and poetry of my early youth when the firework be end and the ball beginning we return to the noble suite of room that be throw open to the dancer a mask ball you know be a beautiful sight but so brilliant a spectacle of the kind i never see before it be a very aristocratic assembly i be myself almost the only ` nobody ' present my dear child be look quite beautiful she wear no mask she excitement and delight add a unspeakable charm to she feature always lovely i remark a young lady dress magnificently but wear a mask who appear to I to be observe my ward with extraordinary interest i have see she earlier in the evening in the great hall and again for a few minute walk near we on the terrace under the castle window similarly employ a lady also mask richly and gravely dress and with a stately air like a person of rank accompany she as a chaperon have the young lady not wear a mask i could of course have be much more certain upon the question whether she be really watch my poor darling i be now well assure that she be we be now in one of the salon my poor dear child have be dance and be rest a little in one of the chair near the door i be stand near the two lady i have mention have approach and the younger take the chair next my ward while she companion stand beside I and for a little time address herself in a low tone to she charge avail herself of the privilege of she mask she turn to I and in the tone of a old friend and call I by my name open a conversation with I which pique my curiosity a good deal she refer to many scene where she have meet I -- at court and at distinguished house she allude to little incident which i have long cease to think of but which i find have only lain in abeyance in my memory for they instantly start into life at she touch i become more and more curious to ascertain who she be every moment she parry my attempt to discover very adroitly and pleasantly the knowledge she show of many passage in my life seem to I all but unaccountable and she appear to take a not unnatural pleasure in foil my curiosity and in see I flounder in my eager perplexity from one conjecture to another in the meantime the young lady whom she mother call by the odd name of millarca when she once or twice address she have with the same ease and grace get into conversation with my ward she introduce herself by say that she mother be a very old acquaintance of mine she speak of the agreeable audacity which a mask render practicable she talk like a friend she admire she dress and insinuate very prettily she admiration of she beauty she amuse she with laugh criticism upon the people who crowd the ballroom and laugh at my poor child 's fun she be very witty and lively when she please and after a time they have grow very good friend and the young stranger lower she mask display a remarkably beautiful face i have never see it before neither have my dear child but though it be new to we the feature be so engaging as well as lovely that it be impossible not to feel the attraction powerfully my poor girl do so i never see anyone more take with another at first sight unless indeed it be the stranger herself who seem quite to have lose she heart to she in the meantime avail myself of the license of a masquerade i put not a few question to the elder lady ` you have puzzle I utterly ' i say laughing ` be that not enough will not you now consent to stand on equal term and do I the kindness to remove you mask ' ` can any request be more unreasonable ' she reply ` ask a lady to yield a advantage beside how do you know you should recognize I year make change ' ` as you see ' i say with a bow and i suppose a rather melancholy little laugh ` as philosopher tell we ' she say ` and how do you know that a sight of my face would help you ' ' i should take chance for that ' i answer ` it be vain try to make yourself out a old woman you figure betray you ' ` year nevertheless have pass since i see you rather since you see I for that be what i be consider millarca there be my daughter i can not then be young even in the opinion of people whom time have teach to be indulgent and i may not like to be compare with what you remember I you have no mask to remove you can offer I nothing in exchange ' ` my petition be to you pity to remove it ' ` and mine to yours to let it stay where it be ' she reply ` well then at least you will tell I whether you be french or german you speak both language so perfectly ' ' i do not think i shall tell you that general you intend a surprise and be meditate the particular point of attack ' ` at all event you will not deny this ' i say ` that be honor by you permission to converse i ought to know how to address you shall i say madame la comtesse ' she laugh and she would no doubt have meet I with another evasion -- if indeed i can treat any occurrence in a interview every circumstance of which be prearrange as i now believe with the profoundest cunning as liable to be modify by accident ` as to that ' she begin but she be interrupted almost as she open she lip by a gentleman dress in black who look particularly elegant and distinguish with this drawback that he face be the most deadly pale i ever see except in death he be in no masquerade -- in the plain evening dress of a gentleman and he say without a smile but with a courtly and unusually low bow : -- ` will madame la comtesse permit I to say a very few word which may interest she ' the lady turn quickly to he and touch she lip in token of silence she then say to I ` keep my place for I general i shall return when i have say a few word ' and with this injunction playfully give she walk a little aside with the gentleman in black and talk for some minute apparently very earnestly they then walk away slowly together in the crowd and i lose they for some minute i spend the interval in cudgel my brain for a conjecture as to the identity of the lady who seem to remember I so kindly and i be think of turn about and join in the conversation between my pretty ward and the countess 's daughter and try whether by the time she return i might not have a surprise in store for she by have she name title chateau and estate at my finger ' end but at this moment she return accompany by the pale man in black who say : ' i shall return and inform madame la comtesse when she carriage be at the door ' he withdraw with a bow xii _ a petition _ ` then we be to lose madame la comtesse but i hope only for a few hour ' i say with a low bow ` it may be that only or it may be a few week it be very unlucky he speak to I just now as he do do you now know I ' i assure she i do not ` you shall know I ' she say ` but not at present we be older and better friend than perhaps you suspect i can not yet declare myself i shall in three week pass you beautiful schloss about which i have be make enquiry i shall then look in upon you for a hour or two and renew a friendship which i never think of without a thousand pleasant recollection this moment a piece of news have reach I like a thunderbolt i must set out now and travel by a devious route nearly a hundred mile with all the dispatch i can possibly make my perplexity multiply i be only deter by the compulsory reserve i practice as to my name from make a very singular request of you my poor child have not quite recover she strength she horse fall with she at a hunt which she have ride out to witness she nerve have not yet recover the shock and we physician say that she must on no account exert herself for some time to come we come here in consequence by very easy stage -- hardly six league a day i must now travel day and night on a mission of life and death -- a mission the critical and momentous nature of which i shall be able to explain to you when we meet as i hope we shall in a few week without the necessity of any concealment ' she go on to make she petition and it be in the tone of a person from whom such a request amount to confer rather than seek a favor this be only in manner and as it seem quite unconsciously than the term in which it be express nothing could be more deprecatory it be simply that i would consent to take charge of she daughter during she absence this be all thing consider a strange not to say a audacious request she in some sort disarm I by state and admit everything that could be urge against it and throw herself entirely upon my chivalry at the same moment by a fatality that seem to have predetermine all that happen my poor child come to my side and in a undertone besought I to invite she new friend millarca to pay we a visit she have just be sound she and think if she mamma would allow she she would like it extremely at another time i should have tell she to wait a little until at least we know who they be but i have not a moment to think in the two lady assail I together and i must confess the refine and beautiful face of the young lady about which there be something extremely engage as well as the elegance and fire of high birth determine I and quite overpower i submit and undertake too easily the care of the young lady whom she mother call millarca the countess beckon to she daughter who listen with grave attention while she tell she in general term how suddenly and peremptorily she have be summon and also of the arrangement she have make for she under my care add that i be one of she earliest and most value friend i make of course such speech as the case seem to call for and find myself on reflection in a position which i do not half like the gentleman in black return and very ceremoniously conduct the lady from the room the demeanor of this gentleman be such as to impress I with the conviction that the countess be a lady of very much more importance than she modest title alone might have lead I to assume she last charge to I be that no attempt be to be make to learn more about she than i might have already guess until she return we distinguished host whose guest she be know she reason ` but here ' she say ` neither i nor my daughter could safely remain for more than a day i remove my mask imprudently for a moment about a hour ago and too late i fancied you see I so i resolve to seek a opportunity of talk a little to you have i find that you have see I i would have throw myself on you high sense of honor to keep my secret some week as it be i be satisfied that you do not see I but if you now suspect or on reflection should suspect who i be i commit myself in like manner entirely to you honor my daughter will observe the same secrecy and i well know that you will from time to time remind she lest she should thoughtlessly disclose it ' she whisper a few word to she daughter kiss she hurriedly twice and go away accompany by the pale gentleman in black and disappear in the crowd ` in the next room ' say millarca ` there be a window that look upon the hall door i should like to see the last of mamma and to kiss my hand to she ' we assent of course and accompany she to the window we look out and see a handsome old-fashioned carriage with a troop of courier and footman we see the slim figure of the pale gentleman in black as he hold a thick velvet cloak and place it about she shoulder and throw the hood over she head she nod to he and just touch he hand with hers he bow low repeatedly as the door close and the carriage begin to move ` she be go ' say millarca with a sigh ` she be go ' i repeat to myself for the first time -- in the hurry moment that have elapse since my consent -- reflect upon the folly of my act ` she do not look up ' say the young lady plaintively ` the countess have take off she mask perhaps and do not care to show she face ' i say ` and she could not know that you be in the window ' she sigh and look in my face she be so beautiful that i relent i be sorry i have for a moment repent of my hospitality and i determine to make she amends for the unavowed churlishness of my reception the young lady replace she mask join my ward in persuade I to return to the grounds where the concert be soon to be renew we do so and walk up and down the terrace that lie under the castle window millarca become very intimate with we and amuse we with lively description and story of most of the great people whom we see upon the terrace i like she more and more every minute she gossip without be ill-natured be extremely divert to I who have be so long out of the great world i think what life she would give to we sometimes lonely evening at home this ball be not over until the morning sun have almost reach the horizon it please the grand duke to dance till then so loyal people could not go away or think of bed we have just get through a crowded saloon when my ward ask I what have become of millarca i think she have be by she side and she fancy she be by mine the fact be we have lose she all my effort to find she be vain i fear that she have mistake in the confusion of a momentary separation from we other people for she new friend and have possibly pursued and lose they in the extensive grounds which be throw open to we now in its full force i recognize a new folly in my have undertake the charge of a young lady without so much as know she name and fetter as i be by promise of the reason for impose which i know nothing i could not even point my inquiry by say that the miss young lady be the daughter of the countess who have take she departure a few hour before morning break it be clear daylight before i give up my search it be not till near two o'clock next day that we hear anything of my miss charge at about that time a servant knock at my niece 's door to say that he have be earnestly request by a young lady who appear to be in great distress to make out where she could find the general baron spielsdorf and the young lady he daughter in whose charge she have be leave by she mother there could be no doubt notwithstanding the slight inaccuracy that we young friend have turn up and so she have would to heaven we have lose she she tell my poor child a story to account for she have fail to recover we for so long very late she say she have get to the housekeeper 's bedroom in despair of find we and have then fall into a deep sleep which long as it be have hardly suffice to recruit she strength after the fatigue of the ball that day millarca come home with we i be only too happy after all to have secure so charming a companion for my dear girl xiii _ the woodman _ there soon however appear some drawback in the first place millarca complain of extreme languor -- the weakness that remain after she late illness -- and she never emerge from she room till the afternoon be pretty far advance in the next place it be accidentally discover although she always lock she door on the inside and never disturb the key from its place till she admit the maid to assist at she toilet that she be undoubtedly sometimes absent from she room in the very early morning and at various time later in the day before she wish it to be understand that she be stir she be repeatedly see from the window of the schloss in the first faint gray of the morning walk through the tree in a easterly direction and look like a person in a trance this convinced I that she walk in she sleep but this hypothesis do not solve the puzzle how do she pass out from she room leave the door lock on the inside how do she escape from the house without unbar door or window in the midst of my perplexity a anxiety of a far more urgent kind present itself my dear child begin to lose she look and health and that in a manner so mysterious and even horrible that i become thoroughly frightened she be at first visit by appalling dream then as she fancy by a specter sometimes resemble millarca sometimes in the shape of a beast indistinctly see walk round the foot of she bed from side to side lastly come sensation one not unpleasant but very peculiar she say resemble the flow of a icy stream against she breast at a later time she feel something like a pair of large needle pierce she a little below the throat with a very sharp pain a few night after follow a gradual and convulsive sense of strangulation then come unconsciousness i could hear distinctly every word the kind old general be say because by this time we be drive upon the short grass that spread on either side of the road as you approach the roofless village which have not show the smoke of a chimney for more than half a century you may guess how strangely i feel as i hear my own symptom so exactly describe in those which have be experience by the poor girl who but for the catastrophe which follow would have be at that moment a visitor at my father 's chateau you may suppose also how i feel as i hear he detail habit and mysterious peculiarity which be in fact those of we beautiful guest carmillum a vista open in the forest we be on a sudden under the chimney and gable of the ruin village and the tower and battlements of the dismantle castle round which gigantic tree be group overhang we from a slight eminence in a frightened dream i get down from the carriage and in silence for we have each abundant matter for think we soon mount the ascent and be among the spacious chamber wind stair and dark corridor of the castle and this be once the palatial residence of the karnstein say the old general at length as from a great window he look out across the village and see the wide undulating expanse of forest it be a bad family and here its bloodstained annals be write he continue it be hard that they should after death continue to plague the human race with they atrocious lust that be the chapel of the karnstein down there he point down to the gray wall of the gothic building partly visible through the foliage a little way down the steep and i hear the axe of a woodman he add busy among the tree that surround it he possibly may give we the information of which i be in search and point out the grave of mircallum countess of karnstein these rustic preserve the local tradition of great family whose story die out among the rich and title so soon as the family themselves become extinct we have a portrait at home of mircallum the countess karnstein should you like to see it ask my father time enough dear friend reply the general i believe that i have see the original and one motive which have lead I to you earlier than i at first intend be to explore the chapel which we be now approach what see the countess mircallum exclaim my father why she have be dead more than a century not so dead as you fancy i be tell answer the general i confess general you puzzle I utterly reply my father look at he i fancy for a moment with a return of the suspicion i detect before but although there be anger and detestation at time in the old general 's manner there be nothing flighty there remain to I he say as we pass under the heavy arch of the gothic church -- for its dimension would have justify its be so style -- but one object which can interest I during the few year that remain to I on earth and that be to wreak on she the vengeance which i thank god may still be accomplish by a mortal arm what vengeance can you mean asked my father in increase amazement i mean to decapitate the monster he answer with a fierce flush and a stamp that echo mournfully through the hollow ruin and he clenched hand be at the same moment raise as if it grasp the handle of a axe while he shake it ferociously in the air what exclaim my father more than ever bewilder to strike she head off cut she head off aye with a hatchet with a spade or with anything that can cleave through she murderous throat you shall hear he answer tremble with rage and hurry forward he say : that beam will answer for a seat you dear child be fatigue let she be seat and i will in a few sentence close my dreadful story the square block of wood which lay on the grass-grown pavement of the chapel form a bench on which i be very glad to seat myself and in the meantime the general call to the woodman who have be remove some bough which lean upon the old wall and axe in hand the hardy old fellow stand before we he could not tell we anything of these monument but there be a old man he say a ranger of this forest at present sojourning in the house of the priest about two mile away who could point out every monument of the old karnstein family and for a trifle he undertake to bring he back with he if we would lend he one of we horse in little more than half a hour have you be long employ about this forest ask my father of the old man i have be a woodman here he answer in he patois under the forester all my day so have my father before I and so on as many generation as i can count up i could show you the very house in the village here in which my ancestor live how come the village to be desert ask the general it be trouble by revenant sir several be track to they grave there detect by the usual test and extinguish in the usual way by decapitation by the stake and by burn but not until many of the villager be kill but after all these proceedings accord to law he continue -- so many grave open and so many vampire deprive of they horrible animation -- the village be not relieved but a moravian nobleman who happen to be travel this way hear how matter be and be skilled -- as many people be in he country -- in such affair he offer to deliver the village from its tormentor he do so thus : there be a bright moon that night he ascend shortly after sunset the tower of the chapel here from whence he could distinctly see the churchyard beneath he you can see it from that window from this point he watch until he see the vampire come out of he grave and place near it the linen clothes in which he have be fold and then glide away towards the village to plague its inhabitant the stranger have see all this come down from the steeple take the linen wrapping of the vampire and carry they up to the top of the tower which he again mount when the vampire return from he prowling and miss he clothes he cry furiously to the moravian whom he see at the summit of the tower and who in reply beckon he to ascend and take they whereupon the vampire accept he invitation begin to climb the steeple and so soon as he have reach the battlements the moravian with a stroke of he sword cleave he skull in twain hurl he down to the churchyard whither descend by the wind stair the stranger follow and cut he head off and next day deliver it and the body to the villager who duly impale and burn they this moravian nobleman have authority from the then head of the family to remove the tomb of mircallum countess karnstein which he do effectually so that in a little while its site be quite forget can you point out where it stand ask the general eagerly the forester shake he head and smile not a soul living could tell you that now he say besides they say she body be remove but no one be sure of that either have thus speak as time press he drop he axe and depart leave we to hear the remainder of the general 's strange story xiv _ the meeting _ my beloved child he resume be now grow rapidly worse the physician who attend she have fail to produce the slightest impression on she disease for such i then suppose it to be he see my alarm and suggest a consultation i call in a abler physician from gratz several day elapse before he arrive he be a good and pious as well as a learn man have see my poor ward together they withdraw to my library to confer and discuss i from the adjoining room where i await they summons hear these two gentleman 's voice raise in something sharper than a strictly philosophical discussion i knock at the door and enter i find the old physician from gratz maintain he theory he rival be combate it with undisguised ridicule accompany with burst of laughter this unseemly manifestation subside and the altercation end on my entrance ` sir ' say my first physician ` my learn brother seem to think that you want a conjuror and not a doctor ' ` pardon I ' say the old physician from gratz look displeased ' i shall state my own view of the case in my own way another time i grieve monsieur le general that by my skill and science i can be of no use before i go i shall do myself the honor to suggest something to you ' he seem thoughtful and sit down at a table and begin to write profoundly disappointed i make my bow and as i turn to go the other doctor point over he shoulder to he companion who be write and then with a shrug significantly touch he forehead this consultation then leave I precisely where i be i walk out into the grounds all but distract the doctor from gratz in ten or fifteen minute overtake I he apologize for have follow I but say that he could not conscientiously take he leave without a few word more he tell I that he could not be mistaken no natural disease exhibit the same symptom and that death be already very near there remain however a day or possibly two of life if the fatal seizure be at once arrest with great care and skill she strength might possibly return but all hang now upon the confines of the irrevocable one more assault might extinguish the last spark of vitality which be every moment ready to die ` and what be the nature of the seizure you speak of ' i entreated ' i have state all fully in this note which i place in you hand upon the distinct condition that you send for the nearest clergyman and open my letter in he presence and on no account read it till he be with you you would despise it else and it be a matter of life and death should the priest fail you then indeed you may read it ' he ask I before take he leave finally whether i would wish to see a man curiously learn upon the very subject which after i have read he letter would probably interest I above all other and he urge I earnestly to invite he to visit he there and so take he leave the ecclesiastic be absent and i read the letter by myself at another time or in another case it might have excite my ridicule but into what quackery will not people rush for a last chance where all accustomed means have fail and the life of a beloved object be at stake nothing you will say could be more absurd than the learn man 's letter it be monstrous enough to have consign he to a madhouse he say that the patient be suffer from the visit of a vampire the puncture which she describe as have occur near the throat be he insist the insertion of those two long thin and sharp tooth which it be well know be peculiar to vampire and there could be no doubt he add as to the well-defined presence of the small livid mark which all concur in describe as that induce by the demon 's lip and every symptom describe by the sufferer be in exact conformity with those record in every case of a similar visitation be myself wholly skeptical as to the existence of any such portent as the vampire the supernatural theory of the good doctor furnish in my opinion but another instance of learning and intelligence oddly associate with some one hallucination i be so miserable however that rather than try nothing i act upon the instruction of the letter i conceal myself in the dark dress room that open upon the poor patient 's room in which a candle be burn and watch there till she be fast asleep i stand at the door peep through the small crevice my sword lay on the table beside I as my direction prescribe until a little after one i see a large black object very ill-defined crawl as it seem to I over the foot of the bed and swiftly spread itself up to the poor girl 's throat where it swell in a moment into a great palpitating mass for a few moment i have stand petrified i now spring forward with my sword in my hand the black creature suddenly contract towards the foot of the bed glide over it and stand on the floor about a yard below the foot of the bed with a glare of skulk ferocity and horror fix on I i see millarca speculate i know not what i strike at she instantly with my sword but i see she standing near the door unscathed horrify i pursued and strike again she be go and my sword fly to shiver against the door i can not describe to you all that pass on that horrible night the whole house be up and stir the specter millarca be go but she victim be sink fast and before the morning dawn she die the old general be agitate we do not speak to he my father walk to some little distance and begin read the inscription on the tombstone and thus occupy he stroll into the door of a side chapel to prosecute he research the general lean against the wall dry he eye and sigh heavily i be relieve on hear the voice of carmillum and madame who be at that moment approach the voice die away in this solitude have just listen to so strange a story connect as it be with the great and title dead whose monument be molder among the dust and ivy round we and every incident of which bear so awfully upon my own mysterious case -- in this haunt spot darken by the towering foliage that rise on every side dense and high above its noiseless wall -- a horror begin to steal over I and my heart sink as i think that my friend be after all not about to enter and disturb this triste and ominous scene the old general 's eye be fix on the ground as he lean with he hand upon the basement of a shatter monument under a narrow arched doorway surmount by one of those demoniacal grotesque in which the cynical and ghastly fancy of old gothic carve delight i see very gladly the beautiful face and figure of carmillum enter the shadowy chapel i be just about to rise and speak and nod smile in answer to she peculiarly engaging smile when with a cry the old man by my side catch up the woodman 's hatchet and start forward on see he a brutalized change come over she feature it be a instantaneous and horrible transformation as she make a crouching step backwards before i could utter a scream he strike at she with all he force but she dive under he blow and unscathed catch he in she tiny grasp by the wrist he struggle for a moment to release he arm but he hand open the axe fall to the ground and the girl be go he stagger against the wall he gray hair stand upon he head and a moisture shone over he face as if he be at the point of death the frightful scene have pass in a moment the first thing i recollect after be madame standing before I and impatiently repeat again and again the question where be mademoiselle carmillum i answer at length i do not know -- i can not tell -- she go there and i point to the door through which madame have just enter only a minute or two since but i have be stand there in the passage ever since mademoiselle carmillum enter and she do not return she then begin to call carmillum through every door and passage and from the window but no answer come she call herself carmillum ask the general still agitate carmillum yes i answer aye he say that be millarca that be the same person who long ago be call mircalla countess karnstein depart from this accursed ground my poor child as quickly as you can drive to the clergyman 's house and stay there till we come begone may you never behold carmillum more you will not find she here xv _ ordeal and execution _ as he speak one of the strangest look man i ever beheld enter the chapel at the door through which carmillum have make she entrance and she exit he be tall narrow-chested stoop with high shoulder and dress in black he face be brown and dry in with deep furrow he wear a oddly-shaped hat with a broad leaf he hair long and grizzled hang on he shoulder he wear a pair of gold spectacles and walk slowly with a odd shambling gait with he face sometimes turn up to the sky and sometimes bow down towards the ground seem to wear a perpetual smile he long thin arm be swing and he lank hand in old black glove ever so much too wide for they wave and gesticulate in utter abstraction the very man exclaim the general advance with manifest delight my dear baron how happy i be to see you i have no hope of meeting you so soon he sign to my father who have by this time return and lead the fantastic old gentleman whom he call the baron to meet he he introduce he formally and they at once enter into earnest conversation the stranger take a roll of paper from he pocket and spread it on the worn surface of a tomb that stand by he have a pencil case in he finger with which he trace imaginary line from point to point on the paper which from they often glance from it together at certain point of the building i conclude to be a plan of the chapel he accompany what i may term he lecture with occasional reading from a dirty little book whose yellow leaf be closely write over they saunter together down the side aisle opposite to the spot where i be stand converse as they go then they begin measure distance by pace and finally they all stand together face a piece of the sidewall which they begin to examine with great minuteness pull off the ivy that cling over it and rap the plaster with the end of they stick scrape here and knock there at length they ascertain the existence of a broad marble tablet with letter carve in relief upon it with the assistance of the woodman who soon return a monumental inscription and carve escutcheon be disclose they prove to be those of the long lose monument of mircallum countess karnstein the old general though not i fear give to the pray mood raise he hand and eye to heaven in mute thanksgiving for some moment tomorrow i hear he say the commissioner will be here and the inquisition will be hold accord to law then turn to the old man with the gold spectacles whom i have describe he shake he warmly by both hand and say : baron how can i thank you how can we all thank you you will have deliver this region from a plague that have scourge its inhabitant for more than a century the horrible enemy thank god be at last track my father lead the stranger aside and the general follow i know that he have lead they out of hearing that he might relate my case and i see they glance often quickly at I as the discussion proceed my father come to I kiss I again and again and lead I from the chapel say : it be time to return but before we go home we must add to we party the good priest who live but a little way from this and persuade he to accompany we to the schloss in this quest we be successful : and i be glad be unspeakably fatigue when we reach home but my satisfaction be change to dismay on discover that there be no tiding of carmillum of the scene that have occur in the ruin chapel no explanation be offer to I and it be clear that it be a secret which my father for the present determine to keep from I the sinister absence of carmillum make the remembrance of the scene more horrible to I the arrangement for the night be singular two servant and madame be to sit up in my room that night and the ecclesiastic with my father keep watch in the adjoining dress room the priest have perform certain solemn rite that night the purport of which i do not understand any more than i comprehend the reason of this extraordinary precaution take for my safety during sleep i see all clearly a few day later the disappearance of carmillum be follow by the discontinuance of my nightly suffering you have hear no doubt of the appalling superstition that prevail in upper and lower styrium in moravium silesium in turkish serbium in poland even in russium the superstition so we must call it of the vampire if human testimony take with every care and solemnity judicially before commission innumerable each consist of many member all choose for integrity and intelligence and constitute report more voluminous perhaps than exist upon any one other class of case be worth anything it be difficult to deny or even to doubt the existence of such a phenomenon as the vampire for my part i have hear no theory by which to explain what i myself have witness and experience other than that supply by the ancient and well-attested belief of the country the next day the formal proceedings take place in the chapel of karnstein the grave of the countess mircallum be open and the general and my father recognize each he perfidious and beautiful guest in the face now disclose to view the feature though a hundred and fifty year have pass since she funeral be tint with the warmth of life she eye be open no cadaverous smell exhale from the coffin the two medical man one officially present the other on the part of the promoter of the inquiry attest the marvelous fact that there be a faint but appreciable respiration and a corresponding action of the heart the limb be perfectly flexible the flesh elastic and the leaden coffin float with blood in which to a depth of seven inch the body lay immerse here then be all the admit sign and proof of vampirism the body therefore in accordance with the ancient practice be raise and a sharp stake drive through the heart of the vampire who utter a pierce shriek at the moment in all respects such as might escape from a live person in the last agony then the head be strike off and a torrent of blood flow from the sever neck the body and head be next place on a pile of wood and reduce to ash which be throw upon the river and bear away and that territory have never since be plague by the visit of a vampire my father have a copy of the report of the imperial commission with the signature of all who be present at these proceedings attach in verification of the statement it be from this official paper that i have summarize my account of this last shocking scene xvi _ conclusion _ i write all this you suppose with composure but far from it i can not think of it without agitation nothing but you earnest desire so repeatedly express could have induce I to sit down to a task that have unstrung my nerve for month to come and reinduce a shadow of the unspeakable horror which year after my deliverance continue to make my day and night dreadful and solitude insupportably terrific let I add a word or two about that quaint baron vordenburg to whose curious lore we be indebted for the discovery of the countess mircallum 's grave he have take up he abode in gratz where live upon a mere pittance which be all that remain to he of the once princely estate of he family in upper styrium he devote himself to the minute and laborious investigation of the marvelously authenticate tradition of vampirism he have at he finger ' end all the great and little work upon the subject magia posthuma phlegon de mirabilibus augustinus de cura pro mortuis philosophicae et christianae cogitationes de vampiris by john christofer herenberg and a thousand other among which i remember only a few of those which he lend to my father he have a voluminous digest of all the judicial case from which he have extract a system of principle that appear to govern -- some always and other occasionally only -- the condition of the vampire i may mention in pass that the deadly pallor attribute to that sort of revenant be a mere melodramatic fiction they present in the grave and when they show themselves in human society the appearance of healthy life when disclose to light in they coffin they exhibit all the symptom that be enumerate as those which prove the vampire-life of the long-dead countess karnstein how they escape from they grave and return to they for certain hour every day without displace the clay or leave any trace of disturbance in the state of the coffin or the cerement have always be admit to be utterly inexplicable the amphibious existence of the vampire be sustain by daily renew slumber in the grave its horrible lust for live blood supply the vigor of its wake existence the vampire be prone to be fascinate with a engrossing vehemence resemble the passion of love by particular person in pursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem for access to a particular object may be obstruct in a hundred way it will never desist until it have satiate its passion and drain the very life of its coveted victim but it will in these case husband and protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of a epicure and heighten it by the gradual approach of a artful courtship in these case it seem to yearn for something like sympathy and consent in ordinary one it go direct to its object overpower with violence and strangle and exhaust often at a single feast the vampire be apparently subject in certain situation to special condition in the particular instance of which i have give you a relation mircallum seem to be limit to a name which if not she real one should at least reproduce without the omission or addition of a single letter those as we say anagrammatically which compose it carmillum do this so do millarca my father related to the baron vordenburg who remain with we for two or three week after the expulsion of carmillum the story about the moravian nobleman and the vampire at karnstein churchyard and then he ask the baron how he have discover the exact position of the long-concealed tomb of the countess mircallum the baron 's grotesque feature pucker up into a mysterious smile he look down still smile on he worn spectacle case and fumble with it then look up he say : i have many journal and other papers write by that remarkable man the most curious among they be one treat of the visit of which you speak to karnstein the tradition of course discolor and distort a little he might have be term a moravian nobleman for he have change he abode to that territory and be beside a noble but he be in truth a native of upper styrium it be enough to say that in very early youth he have be a passionate and favored lover of the beautiful mircallum countess karnstein she early death plunge he into inconsolable grief it be the nature of vampire to increase and multiply but accord to a ascertain and ghostly law assume at start a territory perfectly free from that pest how do it begin and how do it multiply itself i will tell you a person more or less wicked put a end to himself a suicide under certain circumstance become a vampire that specter visit live people in they slumber they die and almost invariably in the grave develop into vampire this happen in the case of the beautiful mircallum who be haunt by one of those demon my ancestor vordenburg whose title i still bear soon discover this and in the course of the study to which he devote himself learn a great deal more among other thing he conclude that suspicion of vampirism would probably fall sooner or later upon the dead countess who in life have be he idol he conceive a horror be she what she might of she remains be profane by the outrage of a posthumous execution he have leave a curious paper to prove that the vampire on its expulsion from its amphibious existence be project into a far more horrible life and he resolve to save he once beloved mircallum from this he adopt the stratagem of a journey here a pretended removal of she remains and a real obliteration of she monument when age have steal upon he and from the vale of year he look back on the scene he be leave he consider in a different spirit what he have do and a horror take possession of he he make the tracing and note which have guide I to the very spot and draw up a confession of the deception that he have practice if he have intend any further action in this matter death prevent he and the hand of a remote descendant have too late for many direct the pursuit to the lair of the beast we talk a little more and among other thing he say be this : one sign of the vampire be the power of the hand the slender hand of mircallum close like a vice of steel on the general 's wrist when he raise the hatchet to strike but its power be not confine to its grasp it leave a numbness in the limb it seize which be slowly if ever recover from the follow spring my father take I a tour through italy we remain away for more than a year it be long before the terror of recent event subside and to this hour the image of carmillum return to memory with ambiguous alternation -- sometimes the playful languid beautiful girl sometimes the writhe fiend i saw in the ruin church and often from a reverie i have start fancy i hear the light step of carmillum at the draw room door
