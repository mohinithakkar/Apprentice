communication have be separately interweave in many part of this work very few article of this collection be commit to write by himself he not have that habit which he regret and which those who know the numerous opportunity he have of gather the rich fruit of _ johnsonian _ wit and wisdom must ever regret i however find in conversation with he that a good store of _ johnsoniana _ treasured in he mind -lrb- 2 -rrb- and i compare it to herculaneum or some old roman field which when dig fully reward the labor employ the authenticity of every article be unquestionable for the expression i who write they down in he presence be partly answerable ` theocritus be not deserving of very high respect as a writer as to the pastoral part virgil be very evidently superior he write when there have be a larger influx of knowledge into the world than when theocritus live theocritus do not abound in description though live in a beautiful country : the manners paint be coarse and gross virgil have much more description more sentiment more of nature and more of art some of the most excellent part of theocritus be where castor and pollux go with the other argonaut land on the bebrycian coast and there fall into a dispute with amycus the king of that country which be as well conduct as euripide could have do it and the battle be well related afterwards they carry off a woman whose two brother come to recover she and expostulate with castor and pollux on they injustice but they pay no regard to the brother and a battle ensue where castor and he brother be triumphant theocritus seem not to have see that the brother have the advantage in they argument over he argonaut hero _ the sicilian gossip _ be a piece of merit ' ` callimachus be a writer of little excellence the chief thing to be learn from he be he account of rite and mythology which though desirable to be know for the sake of understand other part of ancient author be the least pleasing or valuable part of they writings ' ` mattaire 's account of the stephanus -lrb- 3 -rrb- be a heavy book he seem to have be a puzzle-headed man with a large share of scholarship but with little geometry or logick in he head without method and possess of little genius he write latin verse from time to time and publish a set in he old age which he call ' _ senilium _ ' in which he shew so little learning or taste in write as to make _ carteret _ a dactyl -lrb- 4 -rrb- in matter of genealogy it be necessary to give the bare name as they be but in poetry and in prose of any elegance in the write they require to have inflection give to they he book of the dialect -lrb- 5 -rrb- be a sad heap of confusion the only way to write on they be to tabulate they with note add at the bottom of the page and reference ' ` it may be question whether there be not some mistake as to the method of employ the poor seemingly on a supposition that there be a certain portion of work leave undo for want of person to do it but if that be otherwise

what people say of it tell he that among other animadversion it be object that he cite authority which be beneath the dignity of such a work and mention richardson nay -lrb- say johnson -rrb- i have do worse than that : i have cite _ thee _ david -lrb- 11 -rrb- ' ` talking of expence he observe with what munificence a great merchant will spend he money both from he have it at command and from he

if there be a wrong twist it may be set right it be not probable that two people can be wrong the same way ' ` of the preface to capel 's _ shakspeare _ he say if the man would have come to I i would have endeavor to endow he purpose with word for as it be he doth gabble monstrously -lrb- 15 -rrb- ' ` he relate that he have once in a dream a contest of wit with some other person and that he be very much mortify by imagine that he opponent have the better of he now -lrb- say he -rrb- one may mark here the effect of sleep in weaken the power of reflection for have not my judgement fail I i should have see that the wit of this suppose antagonist by whose superiority i feel myself depress be as much furnish by I as that which i think i have be utter in my own character ' ` one evening in company a ingenious and learn gentleman read to he a letter of compliment which he have receive from one of the professor of a foreign university johnson in a irritable fit think there be too much ostentation say i never receive any of these tribute of applause from abroad one instance i recollect of a foreign publication in which mention be make of _ l'illustre lockman _ -lrb- 16 -rrb- ' ` of sir joshua reynold he say sir i know no man who have pass through life with more observation than reynold ' ` he repeat to mr langton with great energy in the greek we savior 's gracious expression

exceedingly affect ' ` he thus define the difference between physical and moral truth physical truth be when you tell a thing as it actually be moral truth be when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appear to you i say such a one walk across the street if he really do so i tell a physical truth if i think so though i should have be mistaken i tell a moral truth ' ` huggin the translator of ariosto and mr thoma warton in the early part of he literary life have a dispute concern that poet of whom mr warton in he _ observation on spenser 's fairy queen _ give some account which huggin attempt to answer with violence and say i will _ militate _ no longer against he _ nescience _ huggin be master of the subject but want expression mr warton 's knowledge of it be then imperfect but he manner lively and elegant -lrb- 18 -rrb- johnson say it appear to I that huggin have ball without powder and warton powder without ball ' ` talking of the farce of _ high life below stair _ -lrb- 19 -rrb- he say here be a farce which be really very divert when you see it act and yet one may read it and not know that one have be read any thing at all ' ` he use at one time to go occasionally to the green room of drury-lane theater -lrb- 20 -rrb- where he be much regard by the player and be very easy and facetious with they he have a very high opinion of mr clive 's comick power and converse more with she than with any of they he say clive sir be a good thing to sit by she always understand what you say -lrb- 21 -rrb- and she say of he i love to sit by dr johnson he always entertain I one night when _ the recruit officer _ be act he say to mr holland -lrb- 22 -rrb- who have be express a apprehension that dr johnson would disdain the work of farquhar no sir i think farquhar a man whose writings have considerable merit ' ` he friend garrick be so busy in conduct the drama that they could not have so much intercourse as mr garrick use to profess a anxious wish that there should be -lrb- 23 -rrb- there might indeed be something in the contemptuous severity as to the merit of act which he old preceptor nourish in himself that would mortify garrick after the great applause which he receive from the audience for though johnson say of he sir a man who have a nation to admire he every night may well be expect to be somewhat elated -lrb- 24 -rrb- yet he would treat theatrical matter with a ludicrous slight he mention one evening i meet david come off the stage drest in a woman 's riding-hood when he act in _ the wonder _ -lrb- 25 -rrb- i come full upon he and i believe he be not pleased ' ` once he ask tom davies whom he see drest in a fine suit of clothes and what art thou to-night tom answer the thane of ross -lrb- 26 -rrb- -lrb- which it will be recollect be a very inconsiderable character -rrb- o brave say johnson ' ` of mr longley at rochester a gentleman of very considerable learning whom dr johnson meet there he say my heart warm towards he i be surprise to find in he such a nice acquaintance with the metre in the learn language though i be somewhat mortified that i have it not so much to myself as i should have think -lrb- 27 -rrb- ' ` talking of the minuteness with which people will record the saying of eminent person a story be tell that when pope be on a visit to spence -lrb- 28 -rrb- at oxford as they look from the window they see a gentleman commoner who be just come in from ride amusing himself with whipping at a post pope take occasion to say that young gentleman seem to have little to do mr beauclerk observe then to be sure spence turn round and write that down and go on to say to dr johnson pope sir would have say the same of you if he have see you distil -lrb- 29 -rrb- johnson sir if pope have tell I of my distil i would have tell he of he grotto -lrb- 30 -rrb- ' ` he would allow no settle indulgence of idleness upon principle and always repel every attempt to urge excuse for it a friend one day suggest that it be not wholesome to study soon after dinner johnson ah sir do not give way to such a fancy at one time of my life i have take it into my head that it be not wholesome to study between breakfast and dinner -lrb- 31 -rrb- ' ` mr beauclerk one day repeat to dr johnson pope 's line let modest foster if he will excel ten metropolitan in preach well : -lrb- 32 -rrb- then ask the doctor why do pope say this johnson ` sir he hope it would vex somebody ' ` dr goldsmith upon occasion of mr lennox 's bring out a play -lrb- 33 -rrb- say to dr johnson at the club that a person have advise he to go and hiss it because she have attack shakspeare in she book call _ shakspeare illustrate _ -lrb- 34 -rrb- johnson and do not you tell he he be a rascal -lrb- 35 -rrb- goldsmith no sir i do not perhaps he might not mean what he say johnson nay sir if he lie it be a different thing colman slily say -lrb- but it be believe dr johnson do not hear he -rrb- then the proper expression should have be -- sir if you do not lie you be a rascal ' ` he affection for topham beauclerk be so great that when beauclerk be labor under that severe illness which at last occasion he death johnson say -lrb- with a voice faulter with emotion -rrb- sir i would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save beauclerk -lrb- 36 -rrb- ' ` one night at the club he produce a translation of a epitaph which lord elibank have write in english for he lady and request of johnson to turn into latin for he have read _ domina de north et gray _ he say to dyer you see sir what barbarism we be compel to make use of when modern title be to be specifically mention in latin inscription when he have read it once aloud and there have be a general approbation express by the company he address himself to mr dyer in particular and say sir i beg to have you judgement for i know you nicety -lrb- 37 -rrb- dyer then very properly desire to read it over again which have do he point out a incongruity in one of the sentence johnson immediately assent to the observation and say sir this be owe to a alteration of a part of the sentence from the form in which i have first write it and i believe sir you may have remark that the make a partial change without a due regard to the general structure of the sentence be a very frequent cause of error in composition ' ` johnson be well acquaint with mr dossie author of a treatise on agriculture -lrb- 38 -rrb- and say of he sir of the object which the society of art have chiefly in view the chymical effect of body operate upon other body he know more than almost any man johnson in order to give mr dossie he vote to be a member of this society pay up a arrear which have run on for two year on this occasion he mention a circumstance as characteristick of the scotch one of that nation -lrb- say he -rrb- who have be a candidate against whom i have vote come up to I with a civil salutation now sir this be they way a englishman would have stomach it and be sulky and never have take further notice of you but a scotchman sir though you vote nineteen time against he will accost you with equal complaisance after each time and the twentieth time sir he will get you vote ' ` talk on the subject of toleration one day when some friend be with he in he study he make he usual remark that the state have a right to regulate the religion of the people who be the child of the state -lrb- 39 -rrb- a clergyman have readily acquiesce in this johnson who love discussion observe but sir you must go round to other state than we own you do not know what a bramin have to say for himself -lrb- 40 -rrb- in short sir i have get no further than this : every man have a right to utter what he think truth and every other man have a right to knock he down for it martyrdom be the test -lrb- 41 -rrb- ' ' a man he observe should begin to write soon for if he wait till he judgement be mature he inability through want of practice to express he conception will make the disproportion so great between what he see and what he can attain that he will probably be discourage from write at all -lrb- 42 -rrb- as a proof of the justness of this remark we may instance what be related of the great lord granville -lrb- 43 -rrb- that after he have write he letter give a account of the battle of dettingen he say here be a letter express in term not good enough for a tallow-chandler to have use ' ` talking of a court-martial that be sit upon a very momentous publick occasion he express much doubt of a enlighten decision and say that perhaps there be not a member of it who in the whole course of he life have ever spend a hour by himself in balance probability -lrb- 44 -rrb- ' ` goldsmith one day bring to the club a print ode which he with other have be hear read by its author in a publick room at the rate of five shilling each for admission -lrb- 45 -rrb- one of the company have read it aloud dr johnson say bolder word and more timorous meaning i think never be bring together ' ` talking of gray 's _ ode _ he say they be force plant raise in a hot-bed -lrb- 46 -rrb- and they be poor plant they be but cucumber after all a gentleman present who have be run down ode-writing in general as a bad species of poetry unluckily say have they be literally cucumber they have be better thing than ode -- yes sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- for a _ hog _ ' ` he distinction of the different degree of attainment of learning be thus mark upon two occasion of queen elizabeth he say she have learn enough to have give dignity to a bishop and of mr thoma davy he say sir davy have learn enough to give credit to a clergyman -lrb- 47 -rrb- ' ` he use to quote with great warmth the say of aristotle record by diogene laertius -lrb- 48 -rrb- that there be the same difference between one learn and unlearn as between the living and the dead ' ` it be very remarkable that he retain in he memory very slight and trivial as well as important thing -lrb- 49 -rrb- as a instance of this it seem that a inferior domestick of the duke of leed have attempt to celebrate he grace 's marriage in such homely rhime as he could make and this curious composition have be sing to dr johnson he get it by heart and use to repeat it in a very pleasant manner two of the stanza be these : -- when the duke of leed shall marry be to a fine young lady of high quality how happy will that gentlewoman be in he grace of leed 's good company she shall have all that be fine and fair and the best of silk and sattin shall wear and ride in a coach to take the air and have a house in st jame 's - square -lrb- 50 -rrb- to hear a man of the weight and dignity of johnson repeat such humble attempt at poetry have a very amusing effect he however seriously observe of the last stanza repeat by he that it nearly comprize all the advantage that wealth can give ' ` a eminent foreigner when he be shewn the british museum be very troublesome with many absurd inquiry now there sir -lrb- say he -rrb- be the difference between a englishman and a frenchman a frenchman must be always talk whether he know any thing of the matter or not a englishman be content to say nothing when he have nothing to say ' ` he unjust contempt for foreigner be indeed extreme one evening at old slaughter 's coffee-house -lrb- 51 -rrb- when a number of they be talk loud about little matter he say do not this confirm old meynell 's -lrb- 52 -rrb- observation -- _ for any thing i see foreigner be fool _ -lrb- 53 -rrb- ' ` he say that once when he have a violent tooth-ach a frenchman accost he thus : -- _ ah monsieur vous etudiez trop _ -lrb- 54 -rrb- ' ` have spend a evening at mr langton 's with the reverend dr parr he be much pleased with the conversation of that learn gentleman and after he be go say to mr langton sir i be oblige to you for have ask I this evening parr be a fair man i do not know when i have have a occasion of such free controversy it be remarkable how much of a man 's life may pass without meeting with any instance of this kind of open discussion -lrb- 55 -rrb- ' ` we may fairly institute a criticism between shakspeare and corneille -lrb- 56 -rrb- as they both have though in a different degree the light of a latter age it be not so just between the greek dramatick writer and shakspeare it may be reply to what be say by one of the remarker on shakspeare that though darius 's shade -lrb- 57 -rrb- have _ prescience _ it do not necessarily follow that he have all _ past _ particulars reveal to he ' ` spanish play be wildly and improbably farcical would please child here as child be entertain with story full of prodigy they experience not be sufficient to cause they to be so readily startle at deviation from the natural course of life -lrb- 58 -rrb- the machinery of the pagan be uninteresting to we -lrb- 59 -rrb- : when a goddess appear in homer or virgil we grow weary still more so in the grecian tragedy as in that kind of composition a nearer approach to nature be intend yet there be good reason for read romance as -- the fertility of invention the beauty of style and expression the curiosity of see with what kind of performance the age and country in which they be write be delighted : for it be to be apprehend that at the time when very wild improbable tale be well receive the people be in a barbarous state and so on the footing of child as have be explain ' ` it be evident enough that no one who write now can use the pagan deity and mythology the only machinery therefore seem that of minister spirit the ghost of the depart witch -lrb- 60 -rrb- and fairy though these latter as the vulgar superstition concern they -lrb- which while in its force infected at least the imagination of those that have more advantage in education though they reason set they free from it -rrb- be every day wear out seem likely to be of little further assistance in the machinery of poetry as i recollect hammond introduce a hag or witch into one of he love elegy where the effect be unmeaning and disgusting -lrb- 61 -rrb- ' ` the man who use he talent of ridicule in create or grossly exaggerate the instance he give who impute absurdity that do not happen or when a man be a little ridiculous describe he as have be very much so abuse he talent greatly the great use of delineate absurdity be that we may know how far human folly can go the account therefore ought of absolute necessity to be faithful a certain character -lrb- name the person -rrb- as to the general cast of it be well describe by garrick but a great deal of the phraseology he use in it be quite he own particularly in the proverbial comparison obstinate as a pig & c but i do not know whether it might not be true of lord ------ -lrb- 62 -rrb- that from a too great eagerness of praise and popularity and a politeness carry to a ridiculous excess he be likely after assert a thing in general to give it up again in part for instance if he have say reynold be the first of painter he be capable enough of give up as objection might happen to be severally make first he outline -- then the grace in form -- then the color -- and lastly to have own that he be such a mannerist that the disposition of he picture be all alike ' ` for hospitality as formerly practice there be no longer the same reason heretofore the poorer people be more numerous and from want of commerce they means of get a livelihood more difficult therefore the support they be a act of great benevolence now that the poor can find maintenance for themselves and they labor be want a general undiscerning hospitality tend to ill by withdraw they from they work to idleness and drunkenness then formerly rent be receive in kind so that there be a great abundance of provision in possession of the owner of the land which since the plenty of money afford by commerce be no longer the case ' ` hospitality to stranger and foreigner in we country be now almost at a end since from the increase of they that come to we there have be a sufficient number of people that have find a interest in provide inn and proper accommodation which be in general a more expedient method for the entertainment of traveller where the traveller and stranger be few more of that hospitality subsist as it have not be worth while to provide place of accommodation in ireland there be still hospitality to stranger in some degree in hungary and poland probably more ' ` colman in a note on he translation of _ terence _ talking of shakspeare 's learning ask what say farmer to this what say johnson -lrb- 63 -rrb- upon this he observe sir let farmer answer for himself : _ i _ never engage in this controversy i always say shakspeare have latin enough to grammaticise he english -lrb- 64 -rrb- ' ' a clergyman whom he characterise as one who love to say little oddity be affect one day at a bishop 's table a sort of slyness and freedom not in character and repeat as if part of _ the old man wish _ a song by dr walter pope a verse border on licentiousness johnson rebuke he in the finest manner by first shew he that he do not know the passage he be aim at and thus humbling he : sir that be not the song : it be thus and he give it right then look stedfastly on he sir there be a part of that song which i should wish to exemplify in my own life : -- may i govern my passion with absolute sway -lrb- 65 -rrb- ' ` be ask if barne know a good deal of greek he answer i doubt sir he be _ unoculus inter caeco -lrb- 66 -rrb- _ ' ` he use frequently to observe that man might be very eminent in a profession without we perceive any particular power of mind in they in conversation it seem strange -lrb- say he -rrb- that a man should see so far to the right who see so short a way to the left burke be the only man whose common conversation correspond with the general fame which he have in the world take up whatever topick you please he be ready to meet you -lrb- 67 -rrb- ' ' a gentleman by no means deficient in literature have discover less acquaintance with one of the classick than johnson expect when the gentleman leave the room he observe you see now how little any body read mr langton happen to mention he have read a good deal in clenardus 's _ greek grammar _ why sir -lrb- say he -rrb- who be there in this town who know any thing of clenardus but you and i and upon mr langton 's mention that he have take the pain to learn by heart the epistle of st basil which be give in that grammar as a praxis sir -lrb- say he -rrb- i never make such a effort to attain greek

extreme impatience to be read to as it go on he turn he face to the back of he chair and put himself into various attitude which mark he uneasiness at the end of a act however he say come let 's have some more let 's go into the slaughter-house again lanky but i be afraid there be more blood than brain yet he afterwards say when i hear you read it i think higher of its power of language : when i read it myself i be more sensible of its pathetick effect and then he pay it a compliment which many will think very extravagant sir -lrb- say he -rrb- if otway have write this play no other of he piece would have be remembered dodsley himself upon this be repeat to he say it be too much : it must be remember that johnson always appear not to be sufficiently sensible of the merit of otway -lrb- 71 -rrb- ' ` snatch of reading -lrb- say he -rrb- will not make a bentley or a clarke they be however in a certain degree advantageous i would put a child into a library -lrb- where no unfit book be

_ paradise lose _ -lrb- 144 -rrb- : ` fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper milton survey the silent progress of he work and mark he reputation steal its way in a kind of subterraneous current through fear and silence i can not but conceive he calm and confident little disappointed not at all dejected rely on he own merit with steady consciousness and wait without impatience the vicissitude of opinion and the impartiality of a future generation -lrb- 145 -rrb- ' indeed even dr tower who may be consider as one of the warmest zealot of _ the revolution society _ -lrb- 146 -rrb- itself allow that ` johnson have speak in the highest term of the ability of that great poet and have bestow on he principal poetical composition the most honorable encomium -lrb- 147 -rrb- ' that a man who venerate the church and monarchy as johnson do should speak with a just abhorrence of milton as a politician or rather as a daring foe to good polity be surely to be expect and to those who censure he i would recommend he commentary on milton 's celebrated complaint of he situation when by the lenity of charle the second ' a lenity of which -lrb- as johnson well observe -rrb- the world have have perhaps no other example he who have write in justification of the murder of he sovereign be safe under a act of oblivion -lrb- 148 -rrb- ' ` no sooner be he safe than he find himself in danger _ fall on evil day and evil tongue _ -lrb- and -rrb- _ with darkness and with danger compass round _ -lrb- 149 -rrb- this darkness have he eye be better employ have undoubtedly deserve compassion but to add the mention of danger be ungrateful and unjust he be fall indeed on _ evil day _ the time be come in which regicide could no longer boast they wickedness but of _ evil tongue _ for milton to complain require impudence at least equal to he other power milton whose warmest advocate must allow that he never spare any asperity of reproach or brutality of insolence -lrb- 150 -rrb- ' i have indeed often wonder how milton ` a acrimonious and surly republican -lrb- 151 -rrb- ' -- ' a man who in he domestick relation be so severe and arbitrary -lrb- 152 -rrb- ' and whose head be fill with the hardest and most dismal tenet of calvinism -lrb- 153 -rrb- should have be such a poet should not only have write with sublimity but with beauty and even gaiety should have exquisitely paint the sweetest sensation of which we nature be capable image the delicate rapture of connubial love nay seem to be animated with all the spirit of revelry it be a proof that in the human mind the department of judgement and imagination perception and temper may sometimes be divide by strong partition and that the light and shade in the same character may be keep so distinct as never to be blended -lrb- 154 -rrb- in the life of milton johnson take occasion to maintain he own and the general opinion of the excellence of rhyme over blank verse in english poetry -lrb- 155 -rrb- and quote this apposite illustration of it by ` a ingenious critick ' that _ it seem to be verse only to the eye _ -lrb- 156 -rrb- the gentleman whom he thus characterise be -lrb- as he tell mr seward

himself much impressed and to whose virtue a common friend who have know he long and be not much addict to flattery give the highest testimony _ various reading in the life of _ milton ' i can not find any meaning but this which -lrb- he most bigotted advocate -rrb- _ even kindness and reverence _ can give ' -lrb- perhaps no -rrb- _ scarcely any _ man ever write so much and praise so few ' a

the masterly execution of the life of dryden which we have see -lrb- 158 -rrb- be one of johnson 's literary project at a early period and which it be remarkable that after desist from it from a suppose scantiness of material he should at a advanced age have exhibit so amply he defense -lrb- 159 -rrb- of that great poet against the illiberal attack upon he as if he embrace the roman catholick communion have be a time-serving measure be a piece of reasoning at once able and candid indeed dryden himself in he _ hind and panther _ have give such a picture of he mind that they who know the anxiety for repose as to the aweful subject of we state beyond the grave though they may think he opinion ill-founded must think charitably of he sentiment : -- ` but gracious god how well dost thou provide for err judgement a unerring guide thy throne be darkness in the abyss of light a blaze of glory that forbid the sight o teach I to believe thee thus conceal would and search no farther than

my doubt be do what more could shock -lrb- 160 -rrb- my faith than three in one ' in draw dryden 's character johnson have give though i suppose unintentionally some touch of he own thus : -- ` the power that predominate in he intellectual operation be rather strong reason than quick sensibility upon all occasion that be present he study rather than feel and produce sentiment not such as nature enforce but meditation supplies with the simple and elemental passion as they spring separate in the mind he seem not much acquaint he be therefore with all he variety of excellence not often pathetick and have so little sensibility of the power of effusion purely natural that he do not esteem they in other -lrb- 161 -rrb- ' it may indeed be observe that in all the numerous writings of johnson whether in prose or verse and even in he tragedy of which the subject be the distress of a unfortunate princess there be not a single passage that ever draw a tear -lrb- 162 -rrb- _ various reading in the life of _ dryden ` the reason of this general perusal addison have attempt to -lrb- find in -rrb- _ derive from _ the delight which the mind feel in the investigation of secret ` he

from the early possession which that writer have take of he mind and from the pleasure which he must have feel in for ever silence all attempt to lessen he poetical fame by demonstrate he excellence and pronounce the follow triumphant eulogium -lrb- 164 -rrb- : -- ` after all this it be surely superfluous to answer the question that have once be ask whether pope be a poet otherwise than by ask in return if pope be not a poet where be poetry to be find to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only shew the narrowness of the definer though a definition which shall exclude pope will not easily be make let we look round upon the present time and back upon the past let we enquire to whom the voice of mankind have decree the wreath of poetry let they production be examine and they claim state and the pretension of pope will be no more dispute ' i remember once to have hear johnson say ` sir a thousand year may elapse before there shall appear another man with a power of versification equal to that of pope ' that power must undoubtedly be allow its due share in enhance the value of he captivating composition johnson who have do liberal justice to warburton in he edition of _ shakspeare _

degree of intimacy but be almost personally unacquainted but such instance though we must wonder at they be not rare if i be rightly inform after a careful enquiry they never meet but once which be at the house of mr french in london well know for she elegant assembly and bring eminent character together the interview prove to be mutually agreeable -lrb- 168 -rrb- i be well inform that warburton

last man who have write with a mind full of reading and reflection -lrb- 170 -rrb- ' it be remarkable that in the life of broome -lrb- 171 -rrb- johnson take notice of dr warburton use a mode of

the _ thing be not so as tell _ though the relator do not _ mean _ to deceive when he think there be intentional falsehood in the relator he expression be ` he _ lie _ and he _ know _ he _ lie _ ' speaking of pope 's not have be know to excel in conversation johnson observe that ` traditional memory retain no sally of raillery or -lrb- 173 -rrb- sentence of observation nothing either pointed or

_ -lrb- 176 -rrb- ' the answer which pope make be ` the young lion be harmless and even playful but when he claw be full grow he become cruel dreadful and mischievous ' but although we have no collection of pope 's saying it be not therefore to be conclude that he be not agreeable in social intercourse for johnson have be hear to say that ` the happiest conversation be that of which nothing be distinctly remembered but a general effect of please impression ' the late lord somerville -lrb- 177 -rrb- who see much both of great and brilliant life tell I that he have dine in company with

common occurrence that be then pass which appear somewhat remarkable in a man of such intellectual store of such a advanced age and who have retire from life with declare disappointment in he

weight of solid sentiment and he point the sharpness of resistless truth ' -lrb- 210 -rrb- but i be most anxious concern johnson 's decision upon _ night thought _ which i esteem as a mass of the grandest and richest poetry that human genius have ever produce and be delighted to find this character of that work : ` in he _ night thought _ he have exhibit a very wide display of original poetry variegate with deep reflection and striking allusion a wilderness of think in which the fertility of fancy scatter flower of every hue and of every odour this be one of the few poem in which blank verse could not be change for rhime but with disadvantage ' -lrb- 211 -rrb- and afterwards ` particular line be not to be regard the power be in the whole and in the whole there be a magnificence like that ascribe to chinese plantation -lrb- 212 -rrb- the magnificence of vast extent and endless diversity ' but there be in this poem not only all that johnson so well bring in view but a power of the _ pathetick _ beyond almost any example that i have see he who do not feel he nerve shake and he heart pierce by many passage in this extraordinary work particularly by that most affect one which describe the gradual torment suffer by the contemplation of a object of affectionate attachment visibly and certainly decay into dissolution must be of a hard and obstinate frame -lrb- 213 -rrb- to all the other excellency of _ night thought _ let I add the great and peculiar one that they contain not only the noblest sentiment of virtue and contemplation on immortality but the _ christian sacrifice _ the _ divine propitiation _ with all its interesting circumstance and consolation to ' a wounded spirit -lrb- 214 -rrb- ' solemnly and poetically display in such imagery and language as can not fail to exalt animate and soothe the truly pious no book whatever can be recommend to young person with better hope of season they mind with _ vital religion _ than young 's _ night thought _ in the life of swift it appear to I that johnson have a certain degree of prejudice against that extraordinary man of which i have elsewhere have occasion to speak -lrb- 215 -rrb- mr thoma sheridan imputed it to a suppose apprehension in johnson that swift have not be sufficiently active in obtain for he a irish degree when it be solicit -lrb- 216 -rrb- but of this there be not sufficient evidence and let I not presume to charge johnson with injustice because he do not think so highly of the writings of this author as i have do from my youth upward yet that he have a unfavourable bias be evident be it only from that passage in which he speak of swift 's practice of save as ` first ridiculous and at last detestable ' and yet after some examination of circumstance find himself oblige to own that ` it will perhaps appear that he only like one mode of expence better than another and save merely that he might have something to give -lrb- 217 -rrb- ' one observation which johnson make in swift 's life should be often inculcate : -- ` it may be justly suppose that there be in he conversation what appear so frequently in he letter a affectation of familiarity with the great a ambition of momentary equality seek and enjoy by the neglect of those ceremony which custom have establish as the barrier between one order of society and another this transgression of regularity be

affectionately ` sam johnson ' march 14 1781 on Monday march 19 i arrive in london and on Tuesday the 20th meet he in fleet-street walking or rather indeed move along for he peculiar march be thus describe in a very just and picturesque manner in a short life -lrb- 238 -rrb- of he publish very soon after he death : -- ` when he walk the street what with the constant roll of he head and the concomitant motion of he body he appear to make he way by that motion independent of he foot ' that he be often much stare at while he advance in this manner may easily be believe but it be not safe to make sport of one so robust as he be mr langton see he one day in a fit of absence by a sudden start drive the load off a porter 's back and walk forward briskly without be conscious of what he have do the porter be very angry but stand still and eye the huge figure with much earnestness till he be satisfy that he wisest course be to be quiet and take up he burthen again we accidental meeting in the street after a long separation be a please surprize to we both he step aside with I into falcon-court and make kind inquiry about my family and as we be in a hurry go different way i promise to call on he next day he say he be engage to go out in the morning ` early sir ' say i johnson : ` why sir a london morning do not go with the sun ' i wait on he next evening and he give I a great portion of he original manuscript of he _ life of the poet _ which he have preserve for I i find on visit he friend mr thrale that he be now very ill and have remove i suppose by the solicitation of mr thrale to a house in grosvenor-square -lrb- 239 -rrb- i be sorry to see he sadly change in he appearance he tell I i might now have the pleasure to see dr johnson drink wine again for he have lately return to it when i mention this to johnson he say ' i drink it now sometimes but not socially ' the first evening that i be with he at thrale 's i observe he pour a large quantity of it into a glass and swallow it greedily every thing about he character and manners be forcible and violent there never be any moderation many a day do he fast many a year do he refrain from wine but when he do eat it be voraciously when he do drink wine it be copiously he could practice abstinence but not temperance -lrb- 240 -rrb- mr thrale and i have a dispute whether shakspeare or milton have draw the most admirable picture of a man -lrb- 241 -rrb- i be for shakspeare mr thrale for milton and after a fair hearing johnson decide for my opinion i tell he of one of mr burke 's playful sally upon dean marlay -lrb- 242 -rrb- : ' i do not like the deanery of _ fern _ it sound so like a _ barren _ title ' -- ` dr heath should have it ' say i johnson laugh and condescend to trifle in the same mode of conceit suggest dr _ moss _ -lrb- 243 -rrb- he say ` mr montagu have dropt I now sir there be people whom one should like very well to drop but would not wish to be drop by -lrb- 244 -rrb- ' he certainly be vain of the society of lady and could make himself very agreeable to they when he choose it sir joshua reynold agree with I that he could mr gibbon with he usual sneer controvert it perhaps in resentment of johnson 's have talk with some disgust of he ugliness -lrb- 245 -rrb- which one would think a _ philosopher _ would not mind dean marlay wittily observe ' a lady may be vain when she can turn a wolf-dog into a lap-dog ' the election for ayrshire my own county be this spring try upon a petition before a committee of the house of common i be one of the counsel for the sit member and take the liberty of previously state different point to johnson who never fail to see they clearly and to supply I with some good hint he dictate to I the follow note upon the registration of deed : -- ` all law be make for the convenience of the community : what be legally do should be legally record that the state of thing may be know and that wherever evidence be requisite evidence may be have for this reason the obligation to frame and establish a legal register be enforce by a legal penalty which penalty be the want of that perfection and plentitude of right which a register would give thence it follow that this be not a objection merely legal : for the reason on which the law stand be equitable make it a equitable objection ' ` this -lrb- say he -rrb- you must enlarge on when speak to the committee you must not argue there as if you be argue in the school -lrb- 246 -rrb- close reasoning will not fix they attention you must say the same thing over and over again in different word if you say it but once they miss it in a moment of inattention it be unjust sir to censure lawyer for multiply word when they argue it be often necessary for they to multiply word -lrb- 247 -rrb- ' he notion of the duty of a member of parliament sit upon a election-committee -lrb- 248 -rrb- be very high and when he be tell of a gentleman upon one of those committee who read the newspaper part of the time and sleep the rest while the merit of a vote be examine by the counsel and as a excuse when challenge by the chairman for such behavior bluntly answer ' i have make up my mind upon that case ' -- johnson with a indignant contempt say ` if he be such a rogue as to make up he mind upon a case without hear it he should not have be such a fool as to tell it ' ' i think -lrb- say mr dudley long -lrb- 249 -rrb- now north -rrb- the doctor have pretty plainly make he out to be both rogue and fool ' johnson 's profound reverence for the hierarchy -lrb- 250 -rrb- make he expect from bishop the highest degree of decorum he be offend even at they go to tavern ' a bishop -lrb- say he -rrb- have nothing to do at a tippling-house it be not indeed immoral in he to go to a tavern neither would it be immoral in he to whip a top in grosvenor-square but if he do i hope the boy would fall upon he and apply the whip to _ he _ there be gradation in conduct there be morality -- decency -- propriety none of these should be violate by a bishop a bishop should not go to a house where he may meet a young fellow lead out a wench ' boswell ` but sir every tavern do not admit woman ' johnson ` depend upon it sir any tavern will admit a well-drest man and a well-drest woman they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they see every night walk by they door in the street but a well-drest man may lead in a well-drest woman to any tavern in london tavern sell meat and drink and will sell they to any body who can eat and can drink you may as well say that a mercer will not sell silk to a woman of the town ' he also disapprove of bishop go to rout at least of they staying at they longer than they presence command respect he mention a particular bishop ` poh -lrb- say mr thrale -rrb- the bishop of -- -lrb- 251 -rrb- be never mind at a rout ' boswell ` when a bishop place himself in a situation where he have no distinct character and be of no consequence he degrade the dignity of he order ' johnson ` mr boswell madam have say it as correctly as it could be ' nor be it only in the dignitary of the church that johnson require a particular decorum and delicacy of behavior he justly consider that the clergy as person set apart for the sacred office of serve at the altar and impress the mind of man with the aweful concern of a future state should be somewhat more serious than the generality of mankind and have a suitable composure of manners a due sense of the dignity of they profession independent of higher motive will ever prevent they from lose they distinction in a indiscriminate sociality and do such as affect this know how much it lessen they in the eye of those whom they think to please by it they would feel themselves much mortify johnson and he friend beauclerk be once together in company with several clergyman who think that they should appear to advantage by assume the lax jollity of _ man of the world _ which as it may be observe in similar case they carry to noisy excess johnson who they expect would be _ entertain _ sit grave and silent for some time at last turn to beauclerk he say by no means in a whisper ` this merriment of parson be mighty offensive ' even the dress of a clergyman should be in character and nothing can be more despicable than conceited attempt at avoid the appearance of the clerical order attempt which be as ineffectual as they be pitiful dr porteus now bishop of london in he excellent charge when preside over the diocese of chester justly animadvert upon this subject and observe of a reverend fop that he ` can be but _ half a beau _ -lrb- 252 -rrb- ' addison in _ the spectator _ -lrb- 253 -rrb- have give we a fine portrait of a clergyman who be suppose to be a member of he _ club _ and johnson have exhibit a model in the character of mr mudge -lrb- 254 -rrb- which have escape the collector of he work but which he own to I and which indeed he shew to sir joshua reynold at the time when it be write it bear the genuine mark of johnson 's best manner and be as follow -lrb- 255 -rrb- : -- ` the reverend mr _ zacariah mudge _ prebendary of exeter and vicar of st andrew 's in plymouth a man equally eminent for he virtue and ability and at once beloved as a companion and reverence as a pastor he have that general curiosity to which no kind of knowledge be indifferent or superfluous and that general benevolence by which no order of man be hate or despise he principle both of thought and action be great and comprehensive by a solicitous examination of objection and judicious comparison of opposite argument he attain what enquiry never give but to industry and perspicuity a firm and unshaken settlement of conviction but he firmness be without asperity for know with how much difficulty truth be sometimes find he do not wonder that many miss it the general course of he life be determine by he profession he study the sacred volume in the original language with what diligence and success he _ note upon the psalm _ give sufficient evidence he once endeavor to add the knowledge of arabick to that of hebrew but find he thought too much divert from other study after some time desist from he purpose he discharge of parochial duty be exemplary how he _ sermon _ -lrb- 256 -rrb- be compose may be learn from the excellent volume which he have give to the publick but how they be deliver can be know only to those that hear they for as he appear in the pulpit word will not easily describe he he delivery though unconstrained be not negligent and though forcible be not turbulent disdain anxious nicety of emphasis and labor artifice of action it captivate the hearer by its natural dignity it rouse the sluggish and fix the volatile and detain the mind upon the subject without direct it to the speaker the grandeur and solemnity of the preacher do not intrude upon he general behavior at the table of he friend he be a companion communicative and attentive of unaffected manners of manly cheerfulness willing to please and easy to be pleased he acquaintance be universally solicit and he presence obstruct no enjoyment which religion do not forbid though studious he be popular though argumentative he be modest though inflexible he be candid and though metaphysical yet orthodox -lrb- 257 -rrb- ' on Friday march 30 i dine with he at sir joshua reynold 's with the earl of charlemont sir annesley stewart mr eliot of port-eliot mr burke dean marlay mr langton a most agreeable day of which i regret that every circumstance be not preserved but it be unreasonable to require such a multiplication of felicity mr eliot with whom dr walter harte have travel -lrb- 258 -rrb- talk to we of he _ history of gustavus adolphus _ which he say be a very good book in the german translation johnson ` harte be excessively vain he put copy of he book in manuscript into the hand of lord chesterfield and lord granville that they might revise it now how absurd be it to suppose that two such nobleman would revise so big a manuscript poor man he leave london the day of the publication of he book that he might be out of the way of the great praise he be to receive and he be ashamed to return when he find how ill he book have succeed it be unlucky in come out on the same day with robertson 's _ history of scotland _ -lrb- 259 -rrb- he husbandry -lrb- 260 -rrb- however be good ' boswell ` so he be fitter for that than for heroick history : he do well when he turn he sword into a plough-share ' mr eliot mention a curious liquor peculiar to he country which the cornish fisherman drink they call it _ mahogany _ and it be make of two part gin and one part treacle well beat together i begged to have some of it make which be do with proper skill by mr eliot i think it very good liquor and say it be a counterpart of what be call _ athol porridge _ in the highland of scotland which be a mixture of whisky and honey johnson say ` that must be a better liquor than the cornish for both its component part be better ' he also observe ' _ mahogany _ must be a modern name for it be not long since the wood call mahogany be know in this country ' i mention he scale of liquor -lrb- 261 -rrb- -- claret for boy -- port for man -- brandy for hero ` then -lrb- say mr burke -rrb- let I have claret : i love to be a boy to have the careless gaiety of boyish day ' johnson ' i should drink claret too if it would give I that but it do not : it neither make boy man nor man boy you 'll be drown by it before it have any effect upon you ' i venture to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the newspaper that dr johnson be learn to dance of vestri -lrb- 262 -rrb- lord charlemont wish to excite he to talk propose in a whisper that he should be ask whether it be true ` shall i ask he ' say he lordship we be by a great majority clear for the experiment upon which he lordship very gravely and with a courteous air say ` pray sir be it true that you be take lesson of vestri ' this be risk a good deal and require the boldness of a general of irish volunteer to make the attempt johnson be at first startled and in some heat answer ` how can you lordship ask so simple a question ' but immediately recover himself whether from unwillingness to be deceive or to appear deceive or whether from real good humor he keep up the joke : ` nay but if any body be to answer the paragraph and contradict it i would have a reply and would say that he who contradict it be no friend either to vestri or I for why should not dr -lrb- 263 -rrb- johnson add to he other power a little corporeal agility socrate learn to dance at a advanced age and cato learn greek at a advanced age then it might proceed to say that this johnson not content with dancing on the ground might dance on the rope and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope a nobleman -lrb- 264 -rrb- write a play call _ love in a hollow tree _ he find out that it be a bad one and therefore wish to buy up all the copy and burn they the duchess of marlborough have keep one and when he be against she at a election she have a new edition of it print and prefix to it as a frontispiece a elephant dancing on a rope to shew that he lordship 's write comedy be as aukward as a elephant dancing on a rope -lrb- 265 -rrb- ' on Sunday April 1 i dine with he at mr thrale 's with sir philip jennings clerk and mr perkin -lrb- 266 -rrb- who have the superintendence of mr thrale 's brewery with a salary of five hundred pound a year sir philip have the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family well advance in life he wear he own white hair in a bag of goodly size a black velvet coat with a embroidered waistcoat and very rich lace ruffle which mr thrale say be old fashion but which for that reason i think the more respectable more like a tory yet sir philip be then in opposition in parliament -lrb- 267 -rrb- ` ah sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- ancient ruffle and modern principle do not agree ' sir philip defend the opposition to the american war ably and with temper and i join he he say the majority of the nation be against the ministry johnson ' _ i _ sir be against the ministry -lrb- 268 -rrb- but it be for have too little of that of which opposition think they have too much be i minister if any man wag he finger against I he should be turn out -lrb- 269 -rrb- for that which it be in the power of government to give at pleasure to one or to another should be give to the supporter of government if you will not oppose at the expence of lose you place you opposition will not be honest you will feel no serious grievance and the present opposition be only a contest to get what other have sir robert walpole act as i would do as to the american war the _ sense _ of the nation be _ with _ the ministry the majority of those who can _ understand _ be with it the majority of those who can only _ hear _ be against it and as those who can only hear be more numerous than those who can understand and opposition be always loudest a majority of the rabble will be for opposition ' this boisterous vivacity entertain we but the truth in my opinion be that those who could understand the best be against the american war as almost every man now be when the question have be coolly consider mr thrale give high praise to mr dudley long -lrb- now north -rrb- johnson ` nay my dear lady do not talk so mr long 's character be very _ short _ it be nothing he fill a chair he be a man of genteel appearance and that be all -lrb- 270 -rrb- i know nobody who blast by praise as you do : for whenever there be exaggerated praise every body be set against a character they be provoke to attack it now there be pepy -lrb- 271 -rrb- you praise that man with such disproportion that i be incite to lessen he perhaps more than he deserve -lrb- 272 -rrb- he blood be upon you head -lrb- 273 -rrb- by the same principle you malice defeat itself for you censure be too violent and yet -lrb- look to she with a leering smile -rrb- she be the first woman in the world could she but restrain that wicked tongue of hers -- she would be the only woman could she but command that little whirligig -lrb- 274 -rrb- ' upon the subject of exaggerated praise i take the liberty to say that i think there might be very high praise give to a known character which deserve it and therefore it would not be exaggerated thus one might say of mr edmund burke he be a very wonderful man johnson ` no sir you would not be safe if another man have a mind perversely to contradict he might answer where be all the wonder burke be to be sure a man of uncommon ability with a great quantity of matter in he mind and a great fluency of language in he mouth but we be not to be stunned and astonished by he so you see sir even burke would suffer not from any fault of he own but from you folly ' mr thrale mention a gentleman who have acquire a fortune of four thousand a year in trade but be absolutely miserable because he could not talk in company so miserable that he be impel to lament he situation in the street to -- -lrb- 275 -rrb- whom he hate and who he know despise he ' i be a most unhappy man -lrb- say he -rrb- i be invite to conversation i go to conversation but alas i have no conversation ' johnson ` man commonly can not be successful in different way this gentleman have spend in get four thousand pound a year the time in which he might have learn to talk and now he can not talk ' mr perkin make a shrewd and droll remark : ` if he have get he four thousand a year as a mountebank he might have learn to talk at the same time that he be get he fortune ' some other gentleman come in the conversation concern the person whose character dr johnson have treat so slightingly as he do not know he merit be resume mr thrale say ` you think so of he sir because he be quiet and do not exert himself with force you 'll be say the same thing of mr -- there who sit as quiet -- ' this be not well-bred and johnson do not let it pass without correction ` nay madam what right have you to talk thus both mr -- and i have reason to take it ill _ you _ may talk so of mr -- but why do you make _ I _ do it have i say anything against mr -- you have _ set _ he that i might shoot he : but i have not shoot he ' one of the gentleman say he have see three folio volume of dr johnson 's saying collect by I ' i must put you right sir -lrb- say i -rrb- for i be very exact in authenticity you could not see folio volume for i have none : you might have see some in quarto and octavo this be inattention which one should guard against ' johnson ` sir it be a want of concern about veracity he do not know that he see _ any _ volume if he have see they he could have remember they size -lrb- 276 -rrb- ' mr thrale appear very lethargick to-day i see he again on Monday evening at which time he be not think to be in immediate danger but early in the morning of Wednesday the 4th -lrb- 277 -rrb- he expire -lrb- 278 -rrb- johnson be in the house and thus mention the event : ' i feel almost the last flutter of he pulse and look for the last time upon the face that for fifteen year have never be turn upon I but with respect and benignity -lrb- 279 -rrb- ' upon that day there be a call of the literary club but johnson apologise for he absence by the follow note : -- ` mr johnson know that sir joshua reynold and the other gentleman will excuse he incompliance with the call when they be tell that mr thrale die this morning ' Wednesday ' mr thrale 's death be a very essential loss to johnson -lrb- 280 -rrb- who although he do not foresee all that afterwards happen be sufficiently convince that the comfort which mr thrale 's family afford he would now in a great measure cease he however continue to shew a kind attention to he widow and child as long as it be acceptable and he take upon he with a very earnest concern the office of one of he executor the importance of which seem greater than usual to he from he circumstance have be always such that he have scarcely any share in the real business of life -lrb- 281 -rrb- he friend of the club be in hope that mr thrale might have make a liberal provision for he for he life which as mr thrale leave no son and a very large fortune it would have be highly to he honor to have do and consider dr johnson 's age could not have be of long duration but he bequeath he only two hundred pound which be the legacy give to each of he executor -lrb- 282 -rrb- i could not but be somewhat divert by hear johnson talk in a pompous manner of he new office and particularly of the concern of the brewery which it be at last resolve should be sell -lrb- 283 -rrb- lord lucan -lrb- 284 -rrb- tell a very good story which if not precisely exact be certainly characteristic : that when the sale of thrale 's brewery be go forward johnson appear bustling about with a ink-horn and pen in he button-hole like a excise-man and on be ask what he really consider to be the value of the property which be to be dispose of answer ` we be not here to sell a parcel of boiler and vat but the potentiality of grow rich beyond the dream of avarice -lrb- 285 -rrb- ' on Friday April 6 he carry I to dine at a club which at he desire have be lately form at the queen 's arm in st paul 's church-yard he tell mr hoole that he wish to have a _ city club _ and ask he to collect one but say he ` do not let they be _ patriot _ -lrb- 286 -rrb- ' the company be to-day very sensible well-behaved man i have preserve only two particulars of he conversation he say he be glad lord george gordon have escape -lrb- 287 -rrb- rather than that a precedent should be establish for hang a man for _ constructive treason _ which in consistency with he true manly constitutional toryism he consider would be a dangerous engine of arbitrary power and upon its be mention that a opulent and very indolent scotch nobleman who totally resign the management of he affair to a man of knowledge and ability have claim some merit by say ` the next best thing to manage a man 's own affair well be be sensible of incapacity and not attempt it but have full confidence in one who can do it : ' johnson ` nay sir this be paltry there be a middle course let a man give application and depend upon it he will soon get above a despicable state of helplessness and attain the power of act for himself ' on Saturday April 7 i dine with he at mr hoole 's with governor bouchier and captain orme both of whom have be long in the east-indy and be man of good sense and observation be very entertaining johnson defend the oriental regulation of different _ cast _ of man which be object to as totally destructive of the hope of rise in society by personal merit he shew that there be a _ principle _ in it sufficiently plausible by analogy ` we see -lrb- say he -rrb- in metal that there be different species and so likewise in animal though one species may not differ very widely from another as in the species of dog -- the cur the spaniel the mastiff the bramin be the mastiff of mankind ' on Thursday April 12 i dine with he at a bishop 's where be sir joshua reynold mr berrenger and some more company he have dine the day before at another bishop 's i have unfortunately record none of he conversation at the bishop 's where we dine together -lrb- 288 -rrb- : but i have preserve he ingenious defense of he dining twice abroad in passion-week -lrb- 289 -rrb- a laxity in which i be convinced he would not have indulge himself at the time when he write he solemn paper in _ the rambler _ -lrb- 290 -rrb- upon that aweful season it appear to I that by be much more in company and enjoy more luxurious living he have contract a keener relish of pleasure and be consequently less rigorous in he religious rite this he would not acknowledge but he reason with admirable sophistry as follow : ` why sir a bishop 's call company together in this week be to use the vulgar phrase not _ the thing _ but you must consider laxity be a bad thing but preciseness be also a bad thing and you general character may be more hurt by preciseness than by dine with a bishop in passion-week there might be a handle for reflection it might be say ` he refuse to dine with a bishop in passion-week but be three sunday absent from church ' boswell ` very true sir but suppose a man to be uniformly of good conduct would it not be better that he should refuse to dine with a bishop in this week and so not encourage a bad practice by he example ' johnson ` why sir you be to consider whether you might not do more harm by lessen the influence of a bishop 's character by you disapprobation in refuse he than by go to he ' to mr lucy porter in lichfield ` dear madam ` life be full of trouble i have just lose my dear friend thrale i hope he be happy but i have have a great loss i be otherwise pretty

tea nor coffee nor lemonade nor any thing whatever and depend upon it sir a man do not love to go to a place from whence he come out exactly as he go in ' i endeavor for argument 's sake to maintain that man of learning and talent might have very good intellectual society without the aid of any little gratification of the sens berrenger join with johnson and say that without these any meeting would be dull and insipid he would therefore have all the slight refreshment nay it would not be amiss to have some cold meat and a bottle of wine upon a side-board ` sir -lrb- say johnson to I with a air of triumph -rrb- mr berrenger know the world every body love to have good thing furnish to they without any trouble i tell mr thrale once that as she do not choose to have card table she should have a profusion of the best sweetmeat and she would be sure to have company enough come to she -lrb- 293 -rrb- ' i agree with my illustrious friend upon this subject for it have please god to make

-rrb- ` one would not go to such a place to hear it -- one would not be see in such a place -- to give countenance to such a meeting ' i however resolve that i would go ` but sir -lrb- say she to johnson -rrb- i should like to hear _ you _ discuss it ' he seem reluctant to engage in it she talk of the resurrection of the human race in general and maintain that we shall be raise with the same body johnson ` nay madam we see that it be not to be the same body for the scripture use the illustration of grain sown and we know that the grain which grow be not the same with what be sow -lrb- 303 -rrb- you can not suppose that we shall rise with a diseased body it be enough if there be such a sameness as to distinguish identity of person ' she seem desirous of know more but he leave the question in obscurity of apparition -lrb- 304 -rrb- he observe ' a total disbelief of they be adverse to the opinion of the existence of the soul between death and the last day the question simply be whether depart spirit ever have the power of make themselves perceptible to we a man who think he have see a apparition can only be convinced himself he authority will not convince another and he conviction if rational must be found on be tell something which can not be know but by supernatural means ' he mention a thing as not unfrequent of which i have never hear before -- be _ call _ that be hear one 's name pronounce by the voice of a know person at a great distance far beyond the possibility of be reach by any sound utter by human organ ` a acquaintance on whose veracity i can depend tell I that walk home one evening to kilmarnock he hear himself call from a wood by the voice of a brother who have go to america and the next packet bring account of that brother 's death ' macbean -lrb- 305 -rrb- assert that this inexplicable _ call _ be a thing very well know dr johnson say that one day at oxford as he be turn the key of he chamber he hear he mother distinctly call sam she be then at lichfield but nothing ensue -lrb- 306 -rrb- this phaenomenon be i think as wonderful as any other mysterious fact which many people be very slow to believe or rather indeed reject with a obstinate contempt some time after this upon he make a remark which escape my attention mr william and mr hall be both together strive to answer he he grow angry and call out loudly ` nay when you both speak at once it be intolerable ' but check himself and soften he say ` this one may say though you _ be _ lady ' then he brighten into gay humor and address they in the word of one of the song in _ the beggar 's opera _ -lrb- 307 -rrb- : -- ` but two at a time there be no mortal can bear ' ` what sir -lrb- say i -rrb- be you go to turn captain macheath ' there be something as pleasantly ludicrous in this scene as can be imagine the contrast between macheath polly and lucy -- and dr samuel johnson blind peevish mr william and lean lank preach mr hall be exquisite i steal away to coachmaker ' - hall and hear the difficult text of which we have talk discuss with great decency and some intelligence by several speaker there be a difference of opinion as to the appearance of ghost in modern time though the argument for it support by mr addison 's authority -lrb- 308 -rrb- preponderate the immediate subject of debate be embarrass by the _ body _ of the saint have be say to rise and by the question what become of they afterwards do they return again to they grave or be they translate to heaven only one evangelist mention the fact -lrb- 309 -rrb- and the commentator whom i have look at do not make the passage clear there be however no occasion for we understand it farther than to know that it be one of the extraordinary manifestation of divine power which accompany the most important event that ever happen on Friday April 20 i spend with he one of the happiest day that i remember to have enjoy in the whole course of my life mr garrick whose grief for the loss of she husband be i believe as sincere as wounded affection and admiration could produce have this day for the first time since he death a select party of he friend to dine with she -lrb- 310 -rrb- the company be miss hannah more who live with she and whom she call she chaplain -lrb- 311 -rrb- mr boscawen -lrb- 312 -rrb- mr elizabeth carter sir joshua reynold dr burney dr johnson and myself we find

complacency and while she cast she eye on he portrait which hang over the chimney-piece say that ` death be now the most agreeable object to she -lrb- 315 -rrb- ' the very semblance of david garrick be cheer mr beauclerk with happy propriety inscribe under that fine portrait of he which by lady diana 's kindness be now the property of my friend mr langton the following passage from he beloved shakspeare : -- ' a merrier man within the limit of become mirth i never spend a hour 's talk withal he eye beget occasion for he wit for every object that the one doth catch the other turn to a mirth-moving jest which he fair tongue -lrb- conceit 's expositor -rrb- deliver in such apt and gracious word that aged ear play truant at he tale and younger hearing be quite ravish : so sweet and voluble be he discourse -lrb- 316 -rrb- ' we be all in fine spirit and i whisper to mr boscawen ' i believe this be as much as can be make of life ' in addition to a splendid entertainment we be regale with lichfield ale -lrb- 317 -rrb- which have a peculiar appropriate value sir joshua and dr burney and i drink cordially of it to dr johnson 's health and though he would not join we he as cordially answer ` gentleman i wish you all as well as you do I ' the general effect of this day dwell upon my mind in fond remembrance but i do not find much conversation record what i have preserve shall be faithfully give one of the company mention mr thoma holli the strenuous whig who use to send over europe present of democratical book with they board stamp with dagger and cap of liberty mr carter say ` he be a bad man he use to talk uncharitably ' johnson ` poh poh madam who be the worse for be talk of uncharitably besides he be a dull poor creature as ever live : and i believe he would not have do harm to a man whom he know to be of very opposite principle to he own i remember once at the society of art when a advertisement be to be draw up he point I out as the man who could do it best this you will observe be kindness to I i however slipt away and escape it ' mr carter have say of the same person ' i doubt he be a atheist -lrb- 318 -rrb- ' johnson ' i do not know that he might perhaps have become one if he have have time to ripen -lrb- smile -rrb- he might have _ exuberated _ into a atheist ' sir joshua reynold praise _ mudge 's sermon _ -lrb- 319 -rrb- johnson ` mudge 's sermon be good but not practical he grasp more sense than he can hold he take more corn than he can make into meal he open a wide prospect but it be so distant it be indistinct i love _ blair 's sermon _ though the dog be a scotchman and a presbyterian and every thing he should not be i be the first to praise they -lrb- 320 -rrb- such be my candor ' -lrb- smile -rrb- mr boscawen ` such he great merit to get the better of all you prejudice ' johnson ` why madam let we compound the matter let we ascribe it to my candor and he merit ' in the evening we have a large company in the drawing-room several lady the bishop of killaloe dr percy mr chamberlayne -lrb- 321 -rrb- of the treasury & c & c somebody say the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining johnson ` but it certainly may this be a remark which have be make and repeat without justice why should the life of a literary man be less entertaining than the life of any other man be there not as interesting variety in such a life -lrb- 322 -rrb- as _ a literary life _ it may be very entertaining ' boswell ` but it must be better surely when it be diversify with a little active variety -- such as he have go to jamaica or -- he have go to the hebride ' johnson be not displeased at this talking of a very respectable author he tell we a curious circumstance in he life which be that he have marry a printer 's devil reynold ' a printer 's devil sir why i think a printer 's devil be a creature with a black face and in rag ' johnson ` yes sir but i suppose he have she face wash and put clean clothes on she -lrb- then look very serious and very earnest -rrb- and she do not disgrace he the woman have a bottom of good sense the word _ bottom _ thus introduce be so ludicrous when contrast with he gravity that most of we could not forbear titter and laugh though i recollect that the bishop of killaloe keep he countenance with perfect steadiness while miss hannah more slyly hide she face behind a lady 's back who sit on the same settee with she he pride could not bear that any expression of he should excite ridicule when he do not intend it he therefore resolve to assume and exercise despotick power glance sternly around and call out in a strong tone ` where 's the merriment ' then collect himself and look aweful to make we feel how he could impose restraint and as it be search he mind for a still more ludicrous word he slowly pronounce ' i say the _ woman _ be _ fundamentally _ sensible ' as if he have say hear this now and laugh if you dare we all sit compose as at a funeral -lrb- 323 -rrb- he and i walk away together we stop a little while by the rail of the adelphi look on the thame and i say to he with some emotion that i be now think of two friend we have lose who once live in the building behind we beauclerk and garrick ` ay sir -lrb- say he tenderly -rrb- and two such friend as can not be supply -lrb- 324 -rrb- ' for some time after this day i do not see he very often and of the conversation which i do enjoy i be sorry to find i have preserve but little i be at this time engage in a variety of other matter which require exertion and assiduity and necessarily occupy almost all my time one day have speak very freely of those who be then in power he say to I ` between ourselves sir i do not like to give opposition the satisfaction of know how much i disapprove of the ministry ' and when i mention that mr burke have boast how quiet the nation be in george the second 's reign when whig be in power compare with the present reign when tory govern -- ` why sir -lrb- say he -rrb- you be to consider that tory have more reverence for government will not oppose with the same violence as whig who be unrestrained by that principle will oppose by any means ' this month he lose not only mr thrale but another friend mr william strahan junior printer the eldest son of he old and constant friend printer to he majesty ` to mr strahan ` dear madam ` the grief which i feel for the loss of a very kind friend be sufficient to make I know how much you suffer by the death of a amiable son a man of whom i think it may truly be say that no one know he who do not lament he i look upon myself as have a friend another friend take from I ` comfort dear madam i would give you if i could but i know how little the form of consolation can avail let I however counsel you not to waste you health in unprofitable sorrow but go to bath and endeavor to prolong you own life but when we have all do all that we can one friend must in time lose the other ' i be dear madam ` you most humble servant ` sam johnson ' ` April 23 1781 ' on Tuesday may 8 -lrb- 325 -rrb- i have the pleasure of again dine with he and mr wilke at mr billy 's -lrb- 326 -rrb- no _ negociation _ be now require to bring they together for johnson be so well satisfy with the former interview that he be very glad to meet wilke again who be this day seat between dr beattie and dr johnson -lrb- between _ truth _ -lrb- 327 -rrb- and _ reason _ as general paolus say when i tell he of it -rrb- wilke ' i have be think dr johnson that there should be a bill bring into parliament that the controvert election for scotland should be try in that country at they own abbey of holy-rood house and not here for the consequence of try they here be that we have a inundation of scotchman who come up and never go back again now here be boswell who be come up upon the election for he own county which will not last a fortnight ' johnson ` nay sir i see no reason why they should be try at all for you know one scotchman be as good as another ' wilke ` pray boswell how much may be get in a year by a advocate at the scotch bar ' boswell ' i believe two thousand pound ' wllke ` how can it be possible to spend that money in scotland ' johnson ` why sir the money may be spend in england : but there be a harder question if one man in scotland get possession of two thousand pound what remains for all the rest of the nation ' wilke ` you know in the last war the immense booty which thurot -lrb- 328 -rrb- carry off by the complete plunder of seven scotch isle he re-embark with _ three and six-penny _ ' here again johnson and wilke join in extravagant sportive raillery upon the suppose poverty of scotland which dr beattie and i do not think it worth we while to dispute the subject of quotation be introduce mr wilke censure it as pedantry -lrb- 329 -rrb- johnson ` no sir it be a good thing there be a community of mind in it classical quotation be the _ parole _ of literary man all over the world ' wllke ` upon the continent they all quote the vulgate bible shakspeare be chiefly quote here and we quote also pope prior butler waller and sometimes cowley -lrb- 330 -rrb- ' we talk of letter-writing johnson ` it be now become so much the fashion to publish letter that in order to avoid it i put as little into mine as i can -lrb- 331 -rrb- ' boswell ` do what you will sir you can not avoid it should you even write as ill as you can you letter would be publish as curiosity : behold a miracle instead of wit see two dull line with stanhope 's pencil writ -lrb- 332 -rrb- ' he give we a entertaining account of _ bet flint _ -lrb- 333 -rrb- a woman of the town who with some eccentrick talent and much effrontery force herself upon he acquaintance ` bet -lrb- say he -rrb- write she own life in verse -lrb- 334 -rrb- which she bring to I wish that i would furnish she with a preface to it -lrb- laughing -rrb- i use to say of she that she be generally slut and drunkard occasionally whore and thief she have however genteel lodgings a spinnet on which she play and a boy that walk before she chair poor bet be take up on a charge of steal a counterpane and try at the old bailey chief justice ------ -lrb- 335 -rrb- who love a wench sum up favourably and she be acquit after which bet say with a gay and satisfied air ` now that the counterpane be _ my own _ i shall make a petticoat of it ' talk of oratory mr wilke describe it as accompany with all the charm of poetical expression johnson ` no sir oratory be the power of beat down you adversary 's argument and put better in they place ' wllke ` but this do not move the passion ' johnson ` he must be a weak man who be to be so move ' wllke -lrb- name a celebrated orator -rrb- ` amidst all the brilliancy of -- 's -lrb- 336 -rrb- imagination and the exuberance of he wit there be a strange want of _ taste _ it be observe of apelle 's venus -lrb- 337 -rrb- that she flesh seem as if she have be nourish by rose : he oratory would sometimes make one suspect that he eat potato and drink whisky ' mr wilke observe how tenacious we be of form in this country and give as a instance the vote of the house of common for remit money to pay the army in america _ in portugal piece _ -lrb- 338 -rrb- when in reality the remittance be make not in portugal money but in we own specie johnson ` be there not a law sir against export the current coin of the realm ' wllke ` yes sir : but might not the house of common in case of real evident necessity order we own current coin to be send into we own colony ' here johnson with that quickness of recollection which distinguish he so eminently give the _ middlesex patriot _ a admirable retort upon he own ground ` sure sir _ you _ do not think a _ resolution of the house of common _ equal to _ the law of the land _ -lrb- 339 -rrb- ' wllke -lrb- at once perceive the application -rrb- ` god forbid sir ' to hear what have be treat with such violence in _ the false alarm _ now turn into pleasant repartee be extremely agreeable johnson go on -- ` locke observe well that a prohibition to export the current coin be impolitick for when the balance of trade happen to be against a state the current coin must be export -lrb- 340 -rrb- ' mr beauclerk 's great library -lrb- 341 -rrb- be this season sell in london by auction mr wilke say he wonder to find in it such a numerous collection of sermon seem to think it strange that a gentleman of mr beauclerk 's character in the gay world should have choose to have many composition of that kind johnson ` why sir you be to consider that sermon make a considerable branch of english literature -lrb- 342 -rrb- so that a library must be very imperfect if it have not a numerous collection of sermon -lrb- 343 -rrb- : and in all collection sir the desire of augment it grow stronger in proportion to the advance in acquisition as motion be accelerate by the continuance of the _ impetus _ besides sir -lrb- look at mr wilke with a placid but significant smile -rrb- a man may collect sermon with intention of make himself better by they i hope mr beauclerk intend that some time or other that should be the case with he ' mr wilke say to I loud enough for dr johnson to hear ` dr johnson should make I a present of he _ life of the poet _ as i be a poor patriot who can not afford to buy they ' johnson seem to take no notice of this hint but in a little while he call to mr dilly ` pray sir be so good as to send a set of my _ live _ to mr wilke with my compliment ' this be accordingly do and mr wilke pay dr johnson a visit be courteously receive and sit with he a long time the company gradually drop away mr dilly himself be call down stair upon business i leave the room for some time when i return i be strike with observe dr samuel johnson and john wilkes esq literally _ tête-à-tête _ for they be recline upon they chair with they head lean almost close to each other and talk earnestly in a kind of confidential whisper of the personal quarrel between george the second and the king of prussium -lrb- 344 -rrb- such a scene of perfectly easy sociality between two such opponent in the war of political controversy as that which i now behold would have be a excellent subject for a picture it present to my mind the happy day which be foretell in scripture when the lion shall lie down with the kid -lrb- 345 -rrb- after this day there be another pretty long interval during which dr johnson and i do not meet when i mention it to he with regret he be please to say ` then sir let we live double ' about this time it be much the fashion for several lady to have evening assembly where the fair sex might participate in conversation with literary and ingenious man animated by a desire to please these society be denominate _ blue-stocking club _ the origin of which title be little known it may be worth while to relate it one of the most eminent member of those society when they first commence be mr stillingfleet -lrb- 346 -rrb- whose dress be remarkably grave and in particular it be observe that he wear blue stocking -lrb- 347 -rrb- such be the excellence of he conversation that he absence be feel as so great a loss that it use to be say ` we can do nothing without the _ blue stocking _ ' and thus by degree the title be establish miss hannah more have admirably describe a _ blue-stocking club _ in she _ bas bleu _ -lrb- 348 -rrb- a poem in which many of the person who be most conspicuous there be mention johnson be prevail with to come sometimes into these circle and do not think himself too grave even for the lively miss monckton -lrb- 349 -rrb- -lrb- now countess of corke -rrb- who use to have the finest _ bit of blue _ at the house of she mother lady galway she vivacity enchant the sage and they use to talk together with all imaginable ease a singular instance happen one evening when she insist that some of sterne 's writings be very pathetick johnson bluntly deny it ' i be sure -lrb- say she -rrb- they have affect _ I _ ' ` why -lrb- say johnson smile and roll himself about -rrb- that be because dearest you be a dunce -lrb- 350 -rrb- ' when she some time afterwards mention this to he he say with equal truth and politeness ` madam if i have think so i certainly should not have say it ' another evening johnson 's kind indulgence towards I have a pretty difficult trial i have dine at the duke of montrose 's with a very agreeable party and he grace accord to he usual custom have circulate the bottle very freely lord graham -lrb- 351 -rrb- and i go together to miss monckton 's where i certainly be in extraordinary spirit and above all fear or awe in the midst of a great number of person of the first rank amongst whom i recollect with confusion a noble lady of the most stately decorum i place myself next to johnson and think myself now fully he match talk to he in a loud and boisterous manner desirous to let the company know how i could contend with _ ajax _ i particularly remember press he upon the value of the pleasure of the imagination and as a illustration of my argument ask he ` what sir supposing i be to fancy that the -- -lrb- name the most charming duchess in he majesty 's dominion -rrb- be in love with I should i not be very happy ' my friend with much address evade my interrogatory and keep I as quiet as possible but it may easily be conceive how he must have feel -lrb- 352 -rrb- however when a few day afterwards i wait upon he and make a apology he behave with the most friendly gentleness -lrb- 353 -rrb- while i remain in london this year -lrb- 354 -rrb- johnson and i dine together at several place i recollect a placid day at dr butter 's -lrb- 355 -rrb- who have now remove from derby to lower grosvenor-street london but of he conversation on that and other occasion during this period i neglect to keep any regular record -lrb- 356 -rrb- and shall therefore insert here some miscellaneous article which i find in my johnsonian note he disorderly habit when ` make provision for the day that be pass over he -lrb- 357 -rrb- ' appear from the follow anecdote communicate to I by mr john nichol : -- ` in the year 1763 a young bookseller who be a apprentice to mr whiston wait on he with a subscription to he _ shakspeare _ : and observe that the doctor make no entry in any book of the subscriber 's name venture diffidently to ask whether he would please to have the gentleman 's address that it might be properly insert in the print list of subscriber ' _ i shall print no list of subscriber _ ' say johnson with great abruptness : but almost immediately recollect himself add very complacently ` sir i have two very cogent reason for not print any list of subscriber -- one that i have lose all the name -- the other that i have spend all the money ' johnson could not brook appear to be worst in argument even when he have take the wrong side to shew the force and dexterity of he talent when therefore he perceive that he opponent gain ground he have recourse to some sudden mode of robust sophistry once when i be press upon he with visible advantage he stop I thus : -- ` my dear boswell let 's have no more of this you 'll make nothing of it i would rather have you whistle a scotch tune ' care however must be take to distinguish between johnson when he ` talk for victory -lrb- 358 -rrb- ' and johnson when he have no desire but to inform and illustrate ` one of johnson 's principal talent -lrb- say a eminent friend of he -rrb- -lrb- 359 -rrb- be shewn in maintain the wrong side of a argument and in a splendid perversion of the truth if you could contrive to have he fair opinion on a subject and without any bias from personal prejudice or from a wish to be victorious in argument it be wisdom itself not only convincing but overpower ' he have however all he life habituate himself to consider conversation as a trial of intellectual vigor and skill -lrb- 360 -rrb- and to this i think we may venture to ascribe that unexampled richness and brilliancy which appear in he own as a proof at once of he eagerness for colloquial distinction and he high notion of this eminent friend he once address he thus : - ' -- we now have be several hour together and you have say but one thing for which i envied you ' he dislike much all speculative desponding consideration which tend to discourage man from diligence and exertion he be in this like dr shaw the great traveller -lrb- 361 -rrb- who mr daine barrington -lrb- 362 -rrb- tell I use to say ' i hate a _ cui bono _ man ' upon be ask by a friend -lrb- 363 -rrb- what he should think of a man who be apt to say _ non est tantus _ - ` that he be a stupid fellow sir -lrb- answer johnson -rrb- : what would these _ tantus _ man be do the while ' when i in a low-spirited fit be talk to he with indifference of the pursuit which generally engage we in a course of action and inquire a _ reason _ for take so much trouble ` sir -lrb- say he in a animated tone -rrb- it be drive on the system of life ' he tell I that he be glad that i have by general oglethorpe 's means become acquaint with dr shebbeare indeed that gentleman whatever objection be make to he have knowledge and ability much above the class of ordinary writer and deserve to be remember as a respectable name in literature be it only for he admirable _ letter on the english nation _ under the name of ` battista angeloni a jesuit -lrb- 364 -rrb- ' johnson and shebbeare -lrb- 365 -rrb- be frequently name together as have in former reign have no predilection for the family of hanover the author of the celebrated _ heroick epistle to sir william chamber _ introduce they in one line in a list of those ` who taste the sweet of he present majesty 's reign -lrb- 366 -rrb- ' such be johnson 's candid relish of the merit of that satire that he allow dr goldsmith as he tell I to read it to he from begin to end and do not refuse he praise to its execution -lrb- 367 -rrb- goldsmith could sometimes take adventurous liberty with he and escape unpunished beauclerk tell I that when goldsmith talk of a project for have a third theater in london solely for the exhibition of new play in order to deliver author from the suppose tyranny of manager johnson treat it slightingly upon which goldsmith say ` ay ay this may be nothing to you who can now shelter yourself behind the corner of a pension ' and that johnson bear this with good-humour johnson praise the earl of carlisle 's poem -lrb- 368 -rrb- which he lordship have publish with he name as not disdain to be a candidate for literary fame my friend be of opinion that when a man of rank appear in that character he deserve to have he merit handsomely allow -lrb- 369 -rrb- in this i think he be more liberal than mr william whitehead -lrb- 370 -rrb- in he _ elegy to lord villier _ in which under the pretext of ` superior toil demand all they care ' he discover a jealousy of the great pay they court to the muse : -- ' ------ to the choose few who dare excel thy fost ` ring aid afford they art they magick power with honor due exalt -- but be thyself what they record -lrb- 371 -rrb- ' johnson have call twice on the bishop of killaloe -lrb- 372 -rrb- before he lordship set out for ireland have miss he the first time he say ` it would have hang heavy on my heart if i have not see he no man ever pay more attention to another than he have do to I -lrb- 373 -rrb- and i have neglect he not wilfully but from be otherwise occupy always sir set a high value on spontaneous kindness he whose inclination prompt he to cultivate you friendship of he own accord will love you more than one whom you have be at pain to attach to you ' johnson tell I that he be once much pleased to find that a carpenter who live near he be very ready to shew he some thing in he business which he wish to see : ` it be pay -lrb- say he -rrb- respect to literature ' i ask he if he be not dissatisfy with have so small a share of wealth and none of those distinction in the state which be the object of ambition he have only a pension of three hundred a year why be he not in such circumstance as to keep he coach why have he not some considerable office johnson ` sir i have never complain of the world -lrb- 374 -rrb- nor do i think that i have reason to complain it be rather to be wonder at that i have so much my pension be more out of the usual course of thing than any instance that i have know here sir be a man avowedly no friend to government at the time who get a pension without ask for it i never court the great they send for I but i think they now give I up they be satisfied they have see enough of I ' upon my observe that i could not believe this for they must certainly be highly please by he conversation conscious of he own superiority he answer ` no sir great lord and great lady do not love to have they mouth stop -lrb- 375 -rrb- ' this be very expressive of the effect which the force of he understanding and brilliancy of he fancy could not but produce and to be sure they must have find themselves strangely diminish in he company when i warmly declare how happy i be at all time to hear he -- ` yes sir -lrb- say he -rrb- but if you be lord chancellor it would not be so : you would then consider you own dignity ' there be much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark but certainly one should think that in whatever elevated state of life a man who _ know _ the value of the conversation of johnson might be place though he might prudently avoid a situation in which he might appear lessen by comparison yet he would frequently gratify himself in private with the participation of the rich intellectual entertainment which johnson could furnish strange however it be to consider how few of the great seek he society -lrb- 376 -rrb- so that if one be dispose to take occasion for satire on that account very conspicuous object present themselves he noble friend lord elibank well observe that if a great man procure a interview with johnson and do not wish to see he more it shew a mere idle curiosity and a wretched want of relish for extraordinary power of mind -lrb- 377 -rrb- mr thrale justly and wittily account for such conduct by say that johnson 's conversation be by much too strong for a person accustom to obsequiousness and flattery it be _ mustard in a young child 's mouth _ one day when i tell he that i be a zealous tory but not enough ` accord to knowledge -lrb- 378 -rrb- ' and should be oblige to he for ' a reason -lrb- 379 -rrb- ' he be so candid and express himself so well that i begged of he to repeat what he have say and i write down as follow : -- of tory and whig ' a wise tory and a wise whig i believe will agree -lrb- 380 -rrb- they principle be the same though they mode of think be different a high tory make government unintelligible : it be lose in the cloud a violent whig make it impracticable : he be for allow so much liberty to every man that there be not power enough to govern any man the prejudice of the tory be for establishment the prejudice of the whig be for innovation a tory do not wish to give more real power to government but that government should have more reverence then they differ as to the church the tory be not for give more legal power to the clergy but wish they should have a considerable influence found on the opinion of mankind the whig be for limit and watch they with a narrow jealousy ' to mr perkin ` sir however often i have see you i have hitherto forget the note but i have now send it : with my good wish for the prosperity of you and you partner -lrb- 381 -rrb- of whom from we short conversation i could not judge otherwise than favourably i be sir you most humble servant sam johnson June 2 1781 ' on Saturday June 2 i set out for scotland and have promise to pay a visit in my way as i sometimes do at southill in bedfordshire at the hospitable mansion of ` squire dilly the elder brother of my worthy friend the bookseller in the poultry dr johnson agree to be of the party this year with mr charle dilly and I and to go and see lord bute 's seat at luton hoe he talk little to we in the carriage be chiefly occupy in read dr watson 's -lrb- 382 -rrb- second volume of _ chemical essay _ -lrb- 383 -rrb- which he like very well and he own _ prince of abyssinium _ on which he seem to be intensely fix have tell we that he have not look at it since it be first publish i happen to take it out of my pocket this day and he seize upon it with avidity he point out to I the follow remarkable passage -lrb- 384 -rrb- : -- ` by what means -lrb- say the prince -rrb- be the european thus powerful or why since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest can not the asiatick and african invade they coast plant colony in they port and give law to they natural prince the same wind that carry they back would bring we thither ' ` they be more powerful sir than we -lrb- answer imlac -rrb- because they be wiser knowledge will always predominate over ignorance as man govern the other animal but why they knowledge be more than ours i know not what reason can be give but the unsearchable will of the supreme be ' he say ` this sir no man can explain otherwise ' we stop at welwyn where i wish much to see in company with dr johnson the residence of the author of _ night thought _ which be then possess by he son mr young here some address be requisite for i be not acquaint with mr young and have i propose to dr johnson that we should send to he he would have check my wish and perhaps be offend i therefore concerted with mr dilly that i should steal away from dr johnson and he and try what reception i could procure from mr young if unfavourable nothing be to be say but if agreeable i should return and notify it to they i hasten to mr young 's find he be at home send in word that a gentleman desire to wait upon he and be shewn into a parlor where he and a young lady he daughter be sit he appear to be a plain civil country gentleman and when i begged pardon for presume to trouble he but that i wish much to see he place if he would give I leave he behave very courteously and answer ` by all means sir we be just go to drink tea will you sit down ' i thank he but say that dr johnson have come with I from london and i must return to the inn and drink tea with he that my name be boswell i have travel with he in the hebride ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- i should think it a great honor to see dr johnson here will you allow I to send for he ' avail myself of this opening i say that ' i would go myself and bring he when he have drunk tea he know nothing of my call here ' have be thus successful i hasten back to the inn and inform dr johnson that ` mr young son of dr young the author of _ night thought _ whom i have just leave desire to have the honor of see he at the house where he father live ' dr johnson luckily make no inquiry how this invitation have arise but agree to go and when we enter mr young 's parlor he address he with a very polite bow ` sir i have a curiosity to come and see this place i have the honor to know that great man -lrb- 385 -rrb- you father ' we go into the garden where we find a gravel walk on each side of which be a row of tree plant by dr young which form a handsome gothick arch dr johnson call it a fine grove i beheld it with reverence we sit some time in the summer-house on the outside wall of which be inscribe _ ` ambulante in horto audiebant vocem dei _ -lrb- 386 -rrb- ' and in reference to a brook by which it be situate _ ` vivendi rectè qui prorogat horam _ -lrb- 387 -rrb- ' & c i say to mr young that i have be tell he father be cheerful -lrb- 388 -rrb- ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- he be too well-bred a man not to be cheerful in company but he be gloomy when alone he never be cheerful after my mother 's death and he have meet with many disappointment ' dr johnson observe to I afterwards ` that this be no favourable account of dr young for it be not become in a man to have so little acquiescence in the way of providence as to be gloomy because he have not obtain as much preferment as he expect -lrb- 389 -rrb- nor to continue gloomy for the loss of he wife grief have its time -lrb- 390 -rrb- ' the last part of this censure be theoretically make practically we know that grief for the loss of a wife may be continue very long in proportion as affection have be sincere no man know this better than dr johnson we go into the church and look at the monument erect by mr young to he father mr young mention a anecdote that he father have receive several thousand pound of subscription-money for he _ universal passion _ but have lose it in the south-sea -lrb- 391 -rrb- dr johnson think this must be a mistake for he have never see a subscription-book upon the road we talk of the uncertainty of profit with which author and bookseller engage in the publication of literary work johnson ` my judgement i have find be no certain rule as to the sale of a book ' boswell ` pray sir have you be much plague with author send you they work to revise ' johnson ` no sir i have be think a sour surly fellow ' boswell ` very lucky for you sir -- in that respect ' i must however observe that notwithstanding what he now say which he no doubt imagine at the time to be the fact there be perhaps no man who more frequently yield to the solicitation even of very obscure author to read they manuscript or more liberally assist they with advice and correction -lrb- 392 -rrb- he find himself very happy at ` squire dilly 's where there be always abundance of excellent fare and hearty welcome on Sunday June 3 we all go to southill church which be very near to mr dilly 's house it be the first Sunday of the month the holy sacrament be administer and i staid to partake of it when i come afterwards into dr johnson 's room he say ` you do right to stay and receive the communion i have not think of it ' this seem to imply that he do not choose to approach the altar without a previous preparation as to which good man entertain different opinion some holding that it be irreverent to partake of that ordinance without considerable premeditation other that whoever be a sincere christian and in a proper frame of mind to discharge any other ritual duty of we religion may without scruple discharge this most solemn one a middle notion i believe to be the just one which be that communicant need not think a long train of preparatory form indispensibly necessary but neither should they rashly and lightly venture upon so aweful and mysterious a institution christian must judge each for himself what degree of retirement and self-examination be necessary upon each occasion be in a frame of mind which i hope for the felicity of human nature many experience -- in fine weather -- at the country house of a friend -- console and elevate by pious exercise -- i express myself with a unrestrained fervor to my ` guide philosopher and friend -lrb- 393 -rrb- ' ` my dear sir i would fain be a good man and i be very good now -lrb- 394 -rrb- i fear god and honor the king i wish to do no ill and to be benevolent to all mankind ' he look at I with a benignant indulgence but take occasion to give I wise and salutary caution ` do not sir accustom yourself to trust to _ impression _ there be a middle state of mind between conviction and hypocrisy of which many be conscious -lrb- 395 -rrb- by trust to impression a man may gradually come to yield to they and at length be subject to they so as not to be a free agent or what be the same thing in effect to _ suppose _ that he be not a free agent a man who be in that state should not be suffer to live if he declare he can not help act in a particular way and be irresistibly impel there can be no confidence in he no more than in a tyger but sir no man believe himself to be impel irresistibly we know that he who say he believe it lie favourable impression at particular moment as to the state of we soul may be deceitful and dangerous in general no man can be sure of he acceptance with god some indeed may have have it reveal to they st paul who work miracle may have have a miracle work on himself and may have obtain supernatural assurance of pardon and mercy and beatitude yet st paul though he express strong hope also express fear lest have preach to other he himself should be a cast-away -lrb- 396 -rrb- ' the opinion of a learn bishop of we acquaintance as to there be merit in religious faith be mention -- johnson ` why yes sir the most licentious man be hell open before he would not take the most beautiful strumpet to he arm we must as the apostle say live by faith not by sight -lrb- 397 -rrb- ' i talk to he of original sin -lrb- 398 -rrb- in consequence of the fall of man and of the atonement make by we savior after some conversation which he desire I to remember he at my request dictate to I as follow : -- ` with respect to original sin the inquiry be not necessary for whatever be the cause of human corruption man be evidently and confessedly so corrupt that all the law of heaven and earth be insufficient to restrain they from crime ` whatever difficulty there may be in the conception of vicarious punishment it be a opinion which have have possession of mankind in all age there be no nation that have not use the practice of sacrifice whoever therefore deny the propriety of vicarious punishment hold a opinion which the sentiment and practice of mankind have contradict from the beginning of the world the great sacrifice for the sin of mankind be offer at the death of the messiah who be call in scripture the lamb of god that taketh away the sin -lrb- 399 -rrb- of the world to judge of the reasonableness of the scheme of redemption it must be consider as necessary to the government of the universe that god should make known he perpetual and irreconcileable detestation of moral evil he might indeed punish and punish only the offender but as the end of punishment be not revenge of crime but propagation of virtue it be more become the divine clemency to find another manner of proceed less destructive to man and at least equally powerful to promote goodness the end of punishment be to reclaim and warn _ that _ punishment will both reclaim and warn which shew evidently such abhorrence of sin in god as may deter we from it or strike we with dread of vengeance when we have commit it this be effect by vicarious punishment nothing could more testify the opposition between the nature of god and moral evil or more amply display he justice to man and angel to all order and succession of being than that it be necessary for the highest and purest nature even for divinity itself to pacify the demand of vengeance by a painful death of which the natural effect will be that when justice be appease there be a proper place for the exercise of mercy and that such propitiation shall supply in some degree the imperfection of we obedience and the inefficacy of we repentance : for obedience and repentance such as we can perform be still necessary we savior have tell we that he do not come to destroy the law but to fulfill to fulfill the typical law by the performance of what those type have foreshewn and the moral law by precept of greater purity and higher exaltation ' -lrb- here he say ` god bless you with it ' i acknowledge myself much oblige to he but i begged that he would go on as to the propitiation be the chief object of we most holy faith he then dictate this one other paragraph -rrb- ` the peculiar doctrine of christianity be that of a universal sacrifice and perpetual propitiation other prophet only proclaim the will and the threatening of god christ satisfy he justice -lrb- 400 -rrb- ' the reverend mr palmer -lrb- 401 -rrb- fellow of queen 's college cambridge dine with we he express a wish that a better provision be make for parish-clerk johnson ` yes sir a parish-clerk should be a man who be able to make a will or write a letter for any body in the parish ' i mention lord monboddo 's notion -lrb- 402 -rrb- that the ancient egyptian with all they learning and all they art be not only black but woolly-haired mr palmer ask how do it appear upon examine the mummy dr johnson approve of this test -lrb- 403 -rrb- although upon most occasion -lrb- 404 -rrb- i never hear a more strenuous advocate for the advantage of wealth than dr johnson : he this day i know not from what caprice take the other side ' i have not observe -lrb- say he -rrb- that man of very large fortune enjoy any thing extraordinary that make happiness what have the duke of bedford what have the duke of devonshire the only great instance that i have ever know of the enjoyment of wealth be that of jamaica dawkin who go to visit palmyra and hearing that the way be infested by robber hire a troop of turkish horse to guard he -lrb- 405 -rrb- ' dr gibbon -lrb- 406 -rrb- the dissent minister be mention he say ' i take to dr gibbon ' and address himself to mr charle dilly add ' i shall be glad to see he tell he if he 'll call on I and dawdle -lrb- 407 -rrb- over a dish of tea in a afternoon i shall take it kind ' the reverend mr smith vicar of southill a very respectable man with a very agreeable family send a invitation to we to drink tea i remark dr johnson 's very respectful -lrb- 408 -rrb- politeness though always fond of change the scene he say ` we must have mr dilly 's leave we can not go from you house sir without you permission ' we all go and be well satisfy with we visit i however remember nothing particular except a nice distinction which dr johnson make with respect to the power of memory maintain that forgetfulness be a man 's own fault -lrb- 409 -rrb- ` to remember and to recollect -lrb- say he -rrb- be different thing a man have not the power to recollect what be not in he mind but when a thing be in he mind he may remember it ' the remark be occasion by my lean back on a chair which a little before i have perceive to be break and plead forgetfulness as a excuse ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- its be break be certainly in you mind -lrb- 410 -rrb- ' when i observe that a housebreaker be in general very timorous johnson ` no wonder sir he be afraid of be shoot get _ into _ a house or hang when he have get _ out _ of it ' he tell we that he have in one day write six sheet of a translation from the french -lrb- 411 -rrb- add ' i should be glad to see it now i wish that i have copy of all the pamphlet write against I as it be say pope have have i know that i should make so much noise in the world i should have be at pain to collect they i believe there be hardly a day in which there be not something about I in the newspaper ' on Monday June 4 we all go to luton-hoe to see lord bute 's magnificent seat -lrb- 412 -rrb- for which i have obtain a ticket as we enter the park i talk in a high style of my old friendship with lord mountstuart -lrb- 413 -rrb- and say ' i shall probably be much at this place ' the sage aware of human vicissitude gently check I : ` do not you be too sure of that ' he make two or three peculiar observation as when shewn the botanical garden ` be not every garden a botanical garden ' when tell that there be a shrubbery to the extent of several mile : ` that be make a very foolish use of the ground a little of it be very well ' when it be propose that we should walk on the pleasure-ground ` do not let we fatigue ourselves why should we walk there here be a fine tree let 's get to the top of it ' but upon the whole he be very much pleased he say ` this be one of the place i do not regret have come to see it be a very stately place indeed in the house magnificence be not sacrifice to convenience nor convenience to magnificence the library be very splendid : the dignity of the room be very great and the quantity of picture be beyond expectation beyond hope ' it happen without any previous concert that we visit the seat of lord bute upon the king 's birthday we dine and drink he majesty 's health at a inn in the village of luton in the evening i put he in mind of he promise to favor I with a copy of he celebrated letter to the earl of chesterfield and he be at last pleased to comply with this earnest request by dictate it to I from he memory for he believe that he himself have no copy -lrb- 414 -rrb- there be a animated glow in he countenance while he thus recall he high-minded indignation he laugh heartily at a ludicrous action in the court of session in which i be counsel the society of _ procurator _ or attorny entitle to practice in the inferior court at edinburgh have obtain a royal charter in which they have take care to have they ancient designation of procurator change into that of _ solicitor _ from a notion as they suppose that it be more genteel -lrb- 415 -rrb- and this new title they display by a publick advertisement for a _ general meeting _ at they hall it have be say that the scottish nation be not distinguish for humor and indeed what happen on this occasion may in some degree justify the remark : for although this society have contrived to make themselves a very prominent object for the ridicule of such as might stoop to it the only joke to which it give rise be the follow paragraph send to the newspaper call _ the caledonian mercury _ : -- ' a correspondent inform we that the worshipful society of _ chaldean _ _ cady _ -lrb- 416 -rrb- or _ run stationer _ of this city be resolve in imitation and encourage by the singular success of they brethren of a equally respectable society to apply for a charter of they privilege particularly of the sole privilege of procure in the most extensive sense of the word -lrb- 417 -rrb- exclusive of chairman porter penny-post man and other _ inferior _ rank they brethren the r -- y -- l s -- ll -- r _ alias _ p -- c -- r _ before the _ inferior court of this city always except ` should the worshipful society be successful they be farther resolve not to be _ puff up _ thereby but to demean themselves with more equanimity and decency than they _ r -- y -- l learn _ and _ very modest _ brethren above mention have do upon they late dignification and exaltation ' a majority of the member of the society prosecute mr robertson the publisher of the paper for damages and the first judgement of the whole court very wisely dismiss the action : _ solventur risu tabula tu missus abibis _ -lrb- 418 -rrb- but a new trial or review be grant upon a petition accord to the form in scotland this petition i be engage to answer and dr johnson with great alacrity furnish I this evening with what follow : -- ` all injury be either of the person the fortune or the fame now it be a certain thing it be proverbially know that _ a jest break no bone _ they never have gain half-a-crown less in the whole profession since this mischievous paragraph have appear and as to they reputation what be they reputation but a instrument of get money if therefore they have lose no money the question upon reputation may be answer by a very old position -- _ de minimis non curat praetor _ ` whether there be or be not a _ animus injuriandus _ be not worth inquire if no _ injurium _ can be prove but the truth be there be no _ animus injuriandus _ it be only a _ animus irritandus -lrb- 419 -rrb- _ which happen to be exercise upon a _ genus irritabile _ produce unexpected violence of resentment they irritability arise only from a opinion of they own importance and they delight in they new exaltation what might have be bear by a _ procurator _ could not be bear by a _ solicitor _ you lordship well know that _ honore mutant mores _ title and dignity play strongly on the fancy as a madman be apt to think himself grow suddenly great so he that grow suddenly great be apt to borrow a little from the madman to co-operate with they resentment would be to promote they phrenzy nor be it possible to guess to what they might proceed if to the new title of solicitor should be add the elation of victory and triumph ` we consider you lordship as the protector of we rights and the guardian of we virtue but believe it not include in you high office that you should flatter we vice or solace we vanity : and as vanity only dictate this prosecution it be humbly hope you lordship will dismiss it ` if every attempt however light or ludicrous to lessen another 's reputation be to be punish by a judicial sentence what punishment can be sufficiently severe for he who attempt to diminish the reputation of the supreme court of justice by reclaim upon a cause already determine without any change in the state of the question do it not imply hope that the judge will change they opinion be not uncertainty and inconstancy in the highest degree disreputable to a court do it not suppose that the former judgement be temerarious or negligent do it not lessen the confidence of the publick will it not be say that _ jus est aut incognitum aut vagum _ and will not the consequence be draw _ misera est servitus -lrb- 420 -rrb- _ will not the rule of action be obscure will not he who know himself wrong to-day hope that the court of justice will think he right to-morrow surely my lord these be attempt of dangerous tendency which the solicitor as man verse in the law should have foresee and avoid it be natural for a ignorant printer to appeal from the lord ordinary but from lawyer the descendant of lawyer who have practice for three hundred year and have now raise themselves to a higher denomination it might be expect that they should know the reverence due to a judicial determination and have be once dismiss should sit down in silence ' i be ashamed to mention that the court by a plurality of voice without have a single additional circumstance before they reverse they own judgement make a serious matter of this dull and foolish joke and adjudge mr robertson to pay to the society five pound -lrb- sterling money -rrb- and cost of suit the decision will seem strange to english lawyer on Tuesday June 5 johnson be to return to london he be very pleasant at breakfast i mention a friend of mine have resolve never to marry a pretty woman johnson ` sir it be a very foolish resolution to resolve not to marry a pretty woman beauty be of itself very estimable no sir i would prefer a pretty woman unless there be objection to she a pretty woman may be foolish a pretty woman may be wicked a pretty woman may not like I but there be no such danger in marry a pretty woman as be apprehend : she will not be persecute if she do not invite persecution a pretty woman if she have a mind to be wicked can find a readier way than another and that be all ' i accompany he in mr dilly 's chaise to shefford where talking of lord bute 's never go to scotland he say ` as a englishman i should wish all the scotch gentleman should be educate in england scotland would become a province they would spend all they rent in england ' this be a subject of much consequence and much delicacy the advantage of a english education be unquestionably very great to scotch gentleman of talent and ambition and regular visit to scotland and perhaps other means might be effectually use to prevent they from be totally estrange from they native country any more than a cumberland or northumberland gentleman who have be educate in the south of england i own indeed that it be no small misfortune for scotch gentleman who have neither talent nor ambition to be educate in england where they may be perhaps distinguish only by a nick-name lavish they fortune in give expensive entertainment to those who laugh at they and saunter about as mere idle insignificant hanger on even upon the foolish great when if they have be judiciously bring up at home they might have be comfortable and creditable member of society at shefford i have another affectionate parting from my revered friend who be take up by the bedford coach and carry to the metropolis i go with monsieur dilly to see some friend at bedford dine with the officer of the militia of the county and next day proceed on my journey ` to bennet langton esq ` dear sir ` how welcome you account of yourself and you invitation to you new house be to I i need not tell you who consider we friendship not only as form by choice but as mature by time we have be now long enough acquaint to have many

send they that they may come to you i will take care that you shall not be without they ` you will perhaps be glad to hear that mr thrale be disencumber of she brewhouse and that it seem to the

memory of all the little dear family particularly pretty mr jane -lrb- 421 -rrb- ' i be sir ` you affectionate humble servant ` sam johnson ' ` bolt-court June 16 1781 ' johnson 's charity to the poor

utter stranger that he say to dr burney sir there be no man possess of the smallest portion of modesty but must be flatter with the admiration of such a man i 'll give he a set of my _ live _ if he will do I the honor to accept of they -lrb- 427 -rrb- in this he keep he word and dr burney have not only the pleasure of gratify he friend with a present more worthy of he acceptance than the segment

be conveniently convey to you the present be small but it be give with good will by reverend sir ` you most & c ` sam johnson ' ` December 31 1782 -lrb- 507 -rrb- ' 1783 : aetat 74 -- in 1783 he be more severely afflict than ever as will appear in the course of he correspondence -lrb- 508 -rrb- but still the same ardor for literature the same constant piety the same kindness for he friend and the same vivacity both in conversation and write distinguished he have give dr johnson a full account of what i be do at auchinleck and particularly mention what i know would please he -- my have bring a old man of eighty-eight from a lonely cottage to a comfortable habitation within my enclosure where he have good neighbor near to he -- i receive a answer in February of which i extract what follow : -- ' i be delighted with you account of you activity at auchinleck and wish the old gentleman whom you have so kindly remove may live long to promote you prosperity by he prayer you have now a new character and new duty : think on they and practice they ` make a impartial estimate of you revenue and whatever it be live upon less resolve never to be poor frugality be not only the basis of quiet but of beneficence no man can help other that want help himself we must have enough before we have to spare ' i be glad to find that mr boswell grow well and hope that to keep she well no care nor caution will be omit may you long live happily together ` when you come hither pray bring with you baxter 's _ anacreon _ -lrb- 509 -rrb- i can not get that edition in london ' on Friday march 31 have arrive in london the night before i be glad to find he at mr thrale 's house in argyll-street appearance of friendship between they be still keep up i be shewn into he room and after the first salutation he say ' i be glad you be come i be very ill ' he look pale and be distressed with a difficulty of breathing but after the common inquiry he assume he usual strong animated style of conversation see I now for the first time as a _ laird _ or proprietor of land he begin thus : ` sir the superiority of a country-gentleman over the people upon he estate be very agreeable and he who say he do not feel it to be agreeable lie for it must be agreeable to have a casual superiority over those who be by nature equal with we -lrb- 510 -rrb- ' boswell ` yet sir we see great proprietor of land who prefer living in london ' johnson ` why sir the pleasure of living in london the intellectual superiority that be enjoy there may counter-balance the other besides sir a man may prefer the state of the country-gentleman upon the whole and yet there may never be a moment when he be willing to make the change to quit london for it ' he say ` it be better to have five _ per cent _ out of land than out of money because it be more secure but the readiness of transfer and promptness of interest make many people rather choose the fund nay there be another disadvantage belong to land compare with money a man be not so much afraid of be a hard creditor as of be a hard landlord ' boswell ` because there be a sort of kindly connection between a landlord and he tenant ' johnson ` no sir many landlord with we never see they tenant it be because if a landlord drive away he tenant he may not get other whereas the demand for money be so great it may always be lend ' he talk with regret and indignation of the factious opposition to government at this time -lrb- 511 -rrb- and imputed it in a great measure to the revolution ` sir -lrb- say he in a low voice have come nearer to I while he old prejudice seem to be ferment in he mind -rrb- this hanoverian family be _ isolée _ here -lrb- 512 -rrb- they have no friend now the stuart have friend who stick by they so late as 1745 when the right of the king be not reverence there will not be reverence for those appoint by the king ' he observation that the present royal family have no friend have be too much justified by the very ungrateful behavior of many who be under great obligation to he majesty at the same time there be honorable exception and the very next year after this conversation and ever since the king have have as extensive and generous support as ever be give to any monarch and have have the satisfaction of know that he be more and more endear to he people -lrb- 513 -rrb- he repeat to I he verse on mr levett with a emotion which give they full effect -lrb- 514 -rrb- and then he be please to say ` you must be as much with I as you can you have do I good you can not think how much better i be since you come in ' he send a message to acquaint mr thrale that i be arrive i have not see she since she husband 's death she soon appear and favor I with a invitation to stay to dinner which i accept there be no other company but herself and three of she daughter dr johnson and i she too say she be very glad i be come for she be go to bath and should have be sorry to leave dr johnson before i come this seem to be attentive and kind and i who have not be inform of any change imagine all to be as well as formerly he be little inclined to talk at dinner and go to sleep after it but when he join we in the drawing-room he seem revive and be again himself talk of conversation he say ` there must in the first place be knowledge there must be material in the second place there must be a command of word in the third place there must be imagination to place thing in such view as they be not commonly see in and in the fourth place there must be presence of mind and a resolution that be not to be overcome by failure : this last be a essential requisite for want of it many people do not excel in conversation now _ i _ want it : i throw up the game upon lose a trick ' i wonder to hear he talk thus of himself and say ' i do not know sir how this may be but i be sure you beat other people 's card out of they hand ' i doubt whether he hear this remark while he go on talk triumphantly i be fix in admiration and say to mr thrale ' o for short-hand to take this down ' ` you 'll carry it all in you head -lrb- say she -rrb- a long head be as good as short-hand ' it have be observe and wonder at that mr charle fox never talk with any freedom in the presence of dr johnson -lrb- 515 -rrb- though it be well know and i myself can witness that he conversation be various fluent and exceedingly agreeable johnson 's own experience however of that gentleman 's reserve be a sufficient reason for he go on thus : ` fox never talk in private company not from any determination not to talk but because he have not the first motion -lrb- 516 -rrb- a man who be use to the applause of the house of common have no wish for that of a private company a man accustom to throw for a thousand pound if set down to throw for sixpence would not be at the pain to count he dice burke 's talk be the ebullition of he mind he do not talk from a desire of distinction but because he mind be full -lrb- 517 -rrb- he thus curiously characterise one of we old acquaintance : ' -- -lrb- 518 -rrb- be a good man sir but he be a vain man and a liar he however only tell lie of vanity of victory for instance in conversation which never happen ' this allude to a story which i have repeat from that gentleman to entertain johnson with its wild bravado : ` this johnson sir -lrb- say he -rrb- whom you be all afraid of will shrink if you come close to he in argument and roar as loud as he he once maintain the paradox that there be no beauty but in utility -lrb- 519 -rrb- sir -lrb- say i -rrb- what say you to the peacock 's tail which be one of the most beautiful object in nature but would have as much utility if its feather be all of one color he _ feel _ what i thus produce and have recourse to he usual expedient ridicule exclaim a peacock have a tail and a fox have a tail and then he burst out into a laugh well sir -lrb- say i with a strong voice look he full in the face -rrb- you have unkennelled you fox pursue he if you dare he have not a word to say sir ' johnson tell I that this be a fiction from begin to end -lrb- 520 -rrb- after muse for some time he say ' i wonder how i should have any enemy for i do harm to nobody -lrb- 521 -rrb- ' boswell ` in the first place sir you will be please to recollect that you set out with attack the scotch so you get a whole nation for you enemy ' johnson ` why i own that by my definition of _ oats _ -lrb- 522 -rrb- i mean to vex they ' boswell ` pray sir can you trace the cause of you antipathy to the scotch ' johnson ' i can not sir -lrb- 523 -rrb- ' boswell ` old mr sheridan say it be because they sell charle the first ' johnson ` then sir old mr sheridan have find out a very good reason ' surely the most obstinate and sulky nationality the most determine aversion to this great and good man must be cure when he be see thus play with one of he prejudice of which he candidly admit that he could not tell the reason it be however probably owe to he have have in he view the worst part of the scottish nation the needy adventurer many of whom he think be advance above they merit by means which he do not approve have he in he early life be in scotland and see the worthy sensible independent gentleman who live rationally and hospitably at home he never could have entertain such unfavourable and unjust notion of he fellow-subject and accordingly we find that when he do visit scotland in the latter period of he life he be fully sensible of all that it deserve as i have already point out when speaking of he _ journey to the western island _ -lrb- 524 -rrb- next day Saturday march 22 i find he still at mr thrale 's but he tell I that he be to go to he own house in the afternoon -lrb- 525 -rrb- he be better but i perceive he be but a unruly patient for sir luca pepy who visit he while i be with he say ` if you be _ tractable _ sir i should prescribe for you ' i related to he a remark which a respectable friend have make to I upon the then state of government when those who have be long in opposition have attain to power as it be suppose against the inclination of the sovereign -lrb- 526 -rrb- ` you need not be uneasy -lrb- say this gentleman -rrb- about the king he laugh at they all he play they one against another ' johnson ` do not think so sir the king be as much oppress as a man can be if he play they one against another he _ win _ nothing ' i have pay a visit to general oglethorpe in the morning and be tell by he that dr johnson see company on Saturday evening and he would meet I at johnson 's that night when i mention this to johnson not doubt that it would please he as he have a great value for oglethorpe the fretfulness of he disease unexpectedly shew itself he anger suddenly kindle and he say with vehemence ` do not you tell he not to come be i to be _ hunt _ in this manner ' i satisfied he that i could not divine that the visit would not be convenient and that i certainly could not take it upon I of my own accord to forbid the general i find dr johnson in the evening in mr william 's room at tea and coffee with she and mr desmoulin who be also both ill it be a sad scene and he be not in very good humor he say of a performance that have lately come out ` sir if you should search all the madhouse in england you would not find ten man who would write so and think it sense ' i be glad when general oglethorpe 's arrival be announce and we leave the lady dr johnson attend he in the parlor and be as courteous as ever the general say he be busy read the writer of the middle age johnson say they be very curious oglethorpe ` the house of common have usurp the power of the nation 's money and use it tyrannically government be now carry on by corrupt influence instead of the inherent right in the king ' johnson ` sir the want of inherent right in the king occasion all this disturbance what we do at the revolution be necessary : but it break we constitution -lrb- 527 -rrb- ' oglethorpe ` my father do not think it necessary ' on Sunday march 23 i breakfast with dr johnson who seem much relieved have take opium the night before he however protest against it as a remedy that should be give with the utmost reluctance and only in extreme necessity i mention how commonly it be use in turkey and that therefore it could not be so pernicious as he apprehend he grow warm and say ` turk take opium and christian take opium but russel in he _ account of aleppo _ -lrb- 528 -rrb- tell we that it be as disgraceful in turkey to take too much opium as it be with we to get drunk sir it be amazing how thing be exaggerate a gentleman be lately tell in a company where i be present that in france as soon as a man of fashion marry he take a opera girl into keep and this he mention as a general custom ` pray sir -lrb- say i -rrb- how many opera girl may there be ' he answer ` about fourscore ' well then sir -lrb- say i -rrb- you see there can be no more than fourscore man of fashion who can do this -lrb- 529 -rrb- ' mr desmoulin make tea and she and i talk before he upon a topick which he have once bear patiently from I when we be by ourselves -lrb- 530 -rrb- -- he not complain of the world because he be not call to some great office nor have attain to great wealth he fly into a violent passion i confess with some justice and command we to have do ` nobody -lrb- say he -rrb- have a right to talk in this manner to bring before a man he own character and the event of he life when he do not choose it should be do i never have seek the world the world be not to seek I it be rather wonderful that so much have be do for I all the complaint which be make of the world be unjust -lrb- 531 -rrb- i never know a man of merit neglect -lrb- 532 -rrb- : it be generally by he own fault that he fail of success a man may hide he head in a hole : he may go into the country and publish a book now and then which nobody read and then complain he be neglect -lrb- 533 -rrb- there be no reason why any person should exert himself for a man who have write a good book : he have not write it for any individual i may as well make a present to the postman who bring I a letter when patronage be limit a author expect to find a maecena and complain if he do not find one why should he complain this maecena have other as good as he or other who have get the start of he ' boswell ` but surely sir you will allow that there be man of merit at the bar who never get practice ' johnson ` sir you be sure that practice be get from a opinion that the person employ deserve it best so that if a man of merit at the bar do not get practice it be from error not from injustice he be not neglect a horse that be bring to market may not be buy though he be a very good horse : but that be from ignorance not from intention -lrb- 534 -rrb- ' there be in this discourse much novelty ingenuity and discrimination such as be seldom to be find yet i can not help think that man of merit who have no success in life may be forgive for _ lament _ if they be not allow to _ complain _ they may consider it as _ hard _ that they merit should not have its suitable distinction though there be no intentional injustice towards they on the part of the world they merit not have be perceive they may yet repine against _ fortune _ or _ fate _ or by whatever name they choose to call the suppose mythological power of _ destiny _ it have however occur to I as a consolatory thought that man of merit should consider thus : - how much harder would it be if the same person have both all the merit and all the prosperity would not this be a miserable distribution for the poor dunce would man of merit exchange they intellectual superiority and the enjoyment arise from it for external distinction and the pleasure of wealth if they would not let they not envy other who be poor where they be rich a compensation which be make to they let they look inwards and be satisfied recollect with conscious pride what virgil finely say of the _ corycius senex _ and which i have in another place -lrb- 535 -rrb- with truth and sincerity apply to mr burke : -- ' _ regum aequabat ope animi -lrb- 536 -rrb- ' _ on the subject of the right employment of wealth johnson observe ' a man can not make a bad use of he money so far as regard society if he do not hoard it for if he either spend it or lend it out society have the benefit it be in general better to spend money than to give it away for industry be more promote by spend money than by give it away a man who spend he money be sure he be do good with it : he be not so sure when he give it away a man who spend ten thousand a year will do more good than a man who spend two thousand and give away eight -lrb- 537 -rrb- ' in the evening i come to he again he be somewhat fretful from he illness a gentleman -lrb- 538 -rrb- ask he whether he have be abroad to-day ` do not talk so childishly -lrb- say he -rrb- you may as well ask if i hang myself to-day ' i mention politick johnson ` sir i would as soon have a man to break my bone as talk to I of publick affair internal or external i have live to see thing all as bad as they can be ' have mention he friend the second lord southwell he say ` lord southwell be the highest-bred man without insolence that i ever be in company with the most _ qualify _ i ever see lord orrery -lrb- 539 -rrb- be not dignified : lord chesterfield be but he be insolent -lrb- 540 -rrb- lord -- -lrb- 541 -rrb- be a man of coarse manners but a man of ability and information i do not say he be a man i would set at the head of a nation though perhaps he may be as good as the next prime minister that come but he be a man to be at the head of a club i do not say _ we _ club for there be no such club ' boswell ` but sir be he not once a factious man ' johnson ' o yes sir as factious a fellow as could be find : one who be for sink we all into the mob -lrb- 542 -rrb- ' boswell ` how then sir do he get into favor with the king ' johnson ` because sir i suppose he promise the king to do whatever the king pleased ' he say ` goldsmith 's blunder speech to lord shelburne which have be so often mention and which he really do make to he be only a blunder in emphasis : i wonder they should call you lordship _ malagrida _ -lrb- 543 -rrb- for malagrida be a very good man mean i wonder they should use _ malagrida _ as a term of reproach -lrb- 544 -rrb- ' soon after this time i have a opportunity of see by means of one of he friend -lrb- 545 -rrb- a proof that he talent as well as he oblige service to author be ready as ever he have revise _ the village _ a admirable poem by the reverend mr crabbe its sentiment as to the false notion of rustick happiness and rustick virtue be quite congenial with he own -lrb- 546 -rrb- and he have take the trouble not only to suggest slight correction and variation but to furnish some line when he think he could give the writer 's meaning better than in the word of the manuscript -lrb- 547 -rrb- on Sunday march 30 i find he at home in the evening and have the pleasure to meet with dr brocklesby -lrb- 548 -rrb- whose reading and knowledge of life and good spirit supply he with a never-failing source of conversation he mention a respectable gentleman who become extremely penurious near the close of he life johnson say there must have be a degree of madness about he ` not at all sir -lrb- say dr brocklesby -rrb- he judgement be entire ' unluckily however he mention that although he have a fortune of twenty-seven thousand pound he deny himself many comfort from a apprehension that he could not afford they ` nay sir -lrb- cry johnson -rrb- when the judgement be so disturbed that a man can not count that be pretty well ' i shall here insert a few of johnson 's saying without the formality of date as they have no reference to any particular time or place ` the more a man extend and vary he acquaintance the better ' this however be mean with a just restriction for he on another occasion say to I ` sir a man may be so much of every thing that he be nothing of any thing ' ` raise the wages of day-labourer be wrong -lrb- 549 -rrb- for it do not make they live better but only make they idler and idleness be a very bad thing for human nature ' ` it be a very good custom to keep a journal -lrb- 550 -rrb- for a man 's own use he may write upon a card a day all that be necessary to be write after he have have experience of life at first there be a great deal to be write because there be a great deal of novelty but when once a man have settle he opinion there be seldom much to be set down ' ` there be nothing wonderful in the journal which we see swift keep in london for it contain slight topick and it might soon be write -lrb- 551 -rrb- ' i praise the accuracy of a account-book of a lady whom i mention johnson ` keep account sir be of no use when a man be spend he own money and have nobody to whom he be to account you will not eat less beef to-day because you have write down what it cost yesterday ' i mention another lady who think as he do so that she husband could not get she to keep a account of the expence of the family as she think it enough that she never exceed the sum allow she johnson ` sir it be fit she should keep a account because she husband wish it but i do not see its use -lrb- 552 -rrb- ' i maintain that keep a account have this advantage that it satisfy a man that he money have not be lose or steal which he might sometimes be apt to imagine be there no written state of he expence and beside a calculation of oeconomy so as not to exceed one 's income can not be make without a view of the different article in figure that one may see how to retrench in some particulars less necessary than other this he do not attempt to answer talking of a acquaintance of ours -lrb- 553 -rrb- whose narrative which abound in curious and interesting topick be unhappily find to be very fabulous i mention lord mansfield 's have say to I ` suppose we believe one _ half _ of what he tell ' johnson ` ay but we do not know _ which _ half to believe by he lie we lose not only we reverence for he but all comfort in he conversation ' boswell ` may we not take it as amusing fiction ' johnson ` sir the misfortune be that you will insensibly believe as much of it as you incline to believe ' it be remarkable that notwithstanding they congeniality in politick he never be acquaint with a late eminent noble judge -lrb- 554 -rrb- whom i have hear speak of he as a writer with great respect -lrb- 555 -rrb- johnson i know not upon what degree of investigation entertain no exalted opinion of he lordship 's intellectual character -lrb- 556 -rrb- talking of he to I one day he say ` it be wonderful sir with how little real superiority of mind man can make a eminent figure in publick life ' he express himself to the same purpose concern another law-lord who it seem once take a fancy to associate with the wit of london but with so little success that foote say ` what can he mean by come among we he be not only dull himself but the cause of dullness in other -lrb- 557 -rrb- ' try he by the test of he colloquial power johnson have find he very defective he once say to sir joshua reynold ` this man now have be ten year about town and have make nothing of it ' mean as a companion -lrb- 558 -rrb- he say to I ' i never hear any thing from he in company that be at all striking and depend upon it sir it be when you come close to a man in conversation that you discover what he real ability be to make a speech in a publick assembly be a knack now i honor thurlow sir thurlow be a fine fellow he fairly put he mind to yours -lrb- 559 -rrb- ' after repeat to he some of he pointed lively saying i say ` it be a pity sir you do not always remember you own good thing that you may have a laugh when you will ' johnson ` nay sir it be better that i forget they that i may be remind of they and have a laugh on they be bring to my recollection ' when i recall to he he have say as we sail up loch-lomond -lrb- 560 -rrb- ` that if he wear any thing fine it should be _ very _ fine ' i observe that all he thought be upon a great scale johnson ` depend upon it sir every man will have as fine a thing as he can get as a large diamond for he ring ' boswell ` pardon I sir : a man of a narrow mind will not think of it a slight trinket will satisfy he : _ nee sufferre queat majori pondera gemma _ -lrb- 561 -rrb- ' i tell he i should send he some essay which i have write -lrb- 562 -rrb- which i hope he would be so good as to read and pick out the good one johnson ` nay sir send I only the good one do not make _ I _ pick they ' i hear he once say ` though the proverb _ nullum numan abest si sit prudentium -lrb- 563 -rrb- do not always prove true we may be certain of the converse of it _ nullum numan adest si sit imprudentium _ ' once when mr seward be go to bath and ask he command he say ` tell dr harrington that i wish he would publish another volume of the _ nugae antiquae _ -lrb- 564 -rrb- it be a very pretty book -lrb- 565 -rrb- ' mr seward second this wish and recommend to dr harrington to dedicate it to johnson and take for he motto what catullus say to cornelius nepo : -- ' -- _ namque tu solebas meas esse aliquid putare _ nuga -lrb- 566 -rrb- ' as a small proof of he kindliness and delicacy of feel the follow circumstance may be mention : one evening when we be in the street together and i tell he i be go to sup at mr beauclerk 's he say ` i 'll go with you ' after have walk part of the way seem to recollect something he suddenly stop and say ' i can not go -- but _ i do not love beauclerk the less _ ' on the frame of he portrait mr beauclerk have inscribe -- ' -- _ ingenium ingen inculto latet hoc sub corpore _ -lrb- 567 -rrb- ' after mr beauclerk 's death when it become mr langton 's property he make the inscription be deface johnson say complacently ` it be kind in you to take it off ' and then after a short pause add ` and not unkind in he to put it on ' he say ` how few of he friend ' house would a man choose to be at when he be sick ' he mention one or two i recollect only thrale 's -lrb- 568 -rrb- he observe ` there be a wicked inclination in most people to suppose a old man decay in he intellect if a young or middle-aged man when leave a company do not recollect where he lay he hat it be nothing but if the same inattention be discover in a old man people will shrug up they shoulder and say ` he memory be go -lrb- 569 -rrb- ' when i once talk to he of some of the saying which every body repeat but nobody know where to find such as _ quo deus vult perdere prius dementat _ -lrb- 570 -rrb- he tell I that he be once offer ten guinea to point out from whence _ semel insanivimus omne _ be take he could not do it but many year afterwards meet with it by chance in _ johanne baptista mantuanus _ -lrb- 571 -rrb- i be very sorry that i do not take a note of a eloquent argument in which he maintain that the situation of prince of wale be the happiest of any person 's in the kingdom even beyond that of the sovereign i recollect only -- the enjoyment of hope -lrb- 572 -rrb- -- the high superiority of rank without the anxious care of government -- and a great degree of power both from natural influence wisely use and from the sanguine expectation of those who look forward to the chance of future favor sir joshua reynold communicate to I the follow particulars : -- johnson think the poem publish as translation from ossian have so little merit that he say ` sir a man might write such stuff for ever if he would _ abandon _ he mind to it -lrb- 573 -rrb- ' he say ' a man should pass a part of he time with _ the laugher _ by which mean any thing ridiculous or particular about he might be present to he view and correct ' i observe he must have be a bold laugher who would have venture to tell dr johnson of any of he particularity -lrb- 574 -rrb- have observe the vain ostentatious importance of many people in quote the authority of duke and lord as have be in they company he say he go to the other extreme and do not mention he authority when he should have do it have it not be that of a duke or a lord -lrb- 575 -rrb- dr goldsmith say once to dr johnson that he wish for some additional member to the literary club to give it a agreeable variety for -lrb- say he -rrb- there can now be nothing new among we : we have travel over one another 's mind johnson seem a little angry and say ` sir you have not travel over _ my _ mind i promise you ' sir joshua however think goldsmith right observe that ` when people have live a great deal together they know what each of they will say on every subject a new understanding therefore be desirable because though it may only furnish the same sense upon a question which would have be furnish by those with whom we be accustom to live yet this sense will have a different coloring and coloring be of much effect in every thing else as well as in painting ' johnson use to say that he make it a constant rule to talk as well as he could both as to sentiment and expression by which mean what have be originally effort become familiar and easy -lrb- 576 -rrb- the consequence of this sir joshua observe be that he common conversation in all company be such as to secure he universal attention as something above the usual colloquial style be expect -lrb- 577 -rrb- yet though johnson have this habit in company when another mode be necessary in order to investigate truth he could descend to a language intelligible to the meanest capacity a instance of this be witness by sir joshua reynold when they be present at a examination of a little blackguard boy by mr saunder welch -lrb- 578 -rrb- the late westminster justice welch who imagine that he be exalt himself in dr johnson 's eye by use big word speak in a manner that be utterly unintelligible to the boy dr johnson perceive it address himself to the boy and change the pompous phraseology into colloquial language sir joshua reynold who be much amuse by this procedure which seem a kind of reverse of what might have be expect from the two man take notice of it to dr johnson as they walk away by themselves johnson say that it be continually the case and that he be always oblige to _ translate _ the justice 's swell diction -lrb- smile -rrb- so as that he meaning might be understand by the vulgar from whom information be to be obtain -lrb- 579 -rrb- sir joshua once observe to he that he have talk above the capacity of some people with whom they have be in company together ` no matter sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- they consider it as a compliment to be talk to as if they be wiser than they be so true be this sir that baxter make it a rule in every sermon that he preach to say something that be above the capacity of he audience -lrb- 580 -rrb- ' johnson 's dexterity in retort when he seem to be drive to a extremity by he adversary be very remarkable of he power in this respect we common friend mr windham of norfolk have be please to furnish I with a eminent instance however unfavourable to scotland he uniformly give liberal praise to george buchanan -lrb- 581 -rrb- as a writer in a conversation concern the literary merit of the two country in

i fear he be a whig in he heart ' johnson 's attention to precision and clearness in expression be very remarkable he disapprove of parenthesis and i believe in all he voluminous writings not half a dozen of they will be find he never use the phrase _ the former _ and _ the latter _ have observe that they often occasion obscurity he therefore contrived to construct he sentence so as not to have occasion for they and would even rather repeat the same word in order to avoid they -lrb- 596 -rrb- nothing be more common than to mistake surname when we hear they carelessly utter for the first time

who before he set out for ireland as secretary to lord northington when lord lieutenant express to the sage some modest and virtuous doubt whether he could bring himself to practice those art which it be suppose a person in that situation have occasion to employ ` do not be afraid sir -lrb- say johnson with a pleasant smile -rrb- you will soon make a very pretty rascal -lrb- 628 -rrb- he talk to-day a good deal of the wonderful extent and variety of london and observe that man of curious enquiry might see in it such mode of life as very few could even imagine he in particular recommend to

exhibition of the royal academy mr thrale know johnson 's character so superficially as to represent he as unwilling to do small act of benevolence and mention in particular that he would hardly take the trouble to write a letter in favor of he friend -lrb- 630 -rrb- the truth however be that he be remarkable in a extraordinary degree for what she deny to he and above all for this very sort of kindness write letter for those to whom he solicitation might be of service he now give mr lowe the following of which i be diligent enough with he permission to take copy at the next coffee-house while mr windham be so good as to stay by I to sir joshua reynold ` sir ` mr lowe consider himself as cut off from all credit and all hope by the rejection of he picture from the exhibition upon this work he have exhaust all he power and suspend all he expectation : and certainly to be refuse a opportunity of take the opinion of the publick be in itself a very great hardship it be to be condemn without a trial if you could procure the revocation of this incapacitating edict you would deliver a unhappy man from great affliction the council have sometimes reverse its own determination and i hope that by you interposition this luckless picture may be get admit i be & c sam johnson April 12 1783 to mr barry sir mr lowe 's exclusion from the exhibition give he more trouble than you and the other gentleman of the council could imagine or intend he consider disgrace and ruin as the inevitable consequence of you determination he say that some picture have be receive after rejection and if there be any such precedent i earnestly entreat that you will use you interest in he favor of he work i can say nothing i pretend not to judge of painting and this picture i never see : but i conceive it extremely hard to shut out any man from the possibility of success and therefore i repeat my request that you will propose the re-consideration of mr lowe 's case and if there be any among the council with whom my name can have any weight be please to communicate to they the desire of sir you most humble servant sam johnson April 12 1783 such intercession be too powerful to be resist and mr

intend a visit to lichfield ` it be -lrb- say he -rrb- with no great expectation of amendment that i make every year a journey into the country but it be pleasant to visit those whose kindness have be often experienced ' on April 18 -lrb- be good-friday -rrb- i find he at breakfast in he usual manner upon that day drinking tea without milk and eat a cross-bun to prevent faintness we go to st clement 's church as formerly when we come home from church he place himself on one of the stone-seat at he garden-door and i take the other and thus in the open air and in a placid frame of mind he talk away very easily johnson ` be i a country gentleman i should not be very hospitable i should not have crowd in my house -lrb- 632 -rrb- ' boswell ` sir alexander dick -lrb- 633 -rrb- tell I that he remember have a thousand people in a year to dine at he house : that be reckon each person as one each time that he dine there ' johnson ` that sir be about three a day ' boswell ` how you statement lessen the idea ' johnson ` that sir be the good of counting -lrb- 634 -rrb- it bring every thing to a certainty which before float in the mind indefinitely ' boswell ` but _ omne ignotum pro magnifico est -lrb- 635 -rrb- : one be sorry to have this diminish ' johnson ` sir you should not allow yourself to be delighted with error ' boswell ` three a day seem but few ' johnson ` nay sir he who entertain three a day do very liberally and if there be a large family the poor entertain those three for they eat what the poor would get : there must be superfluous meat it must be give to the poor or throw out ' boswell ' i observe in london that the poor go about and gather bone which i understand be manufacture ' johnson ` yes sir they boil they and extract a grease from they for grease wheel and other purpose of the best piece they make a mock ivory which be use for haft to knife and various other thing the coarser piece they burn and pound and sell the ash ' boswell ` for what purpose sir ' johnson ` why sir for make a furnace for the chymist for melting iron a paste make of burnt bone will stand a stronger heat than any thing else consider sir if you be to melt iron you can not line you pot with brass because it be softer than iron and would melt sooner nor with iron for though malleable iron be harder than cast iron yet it would not do but a paste of burnt-bone will not melt ' boswell ` do you know sir i have discover a manufacture to a great extent of what you only piddle at -- scrape and dry the peel of orange -lrb- 636 -rrb- at a place in newgate-street there be a prodigious quantity prepare which they sell to the distiller ' johnson ` sir i believe they make a higher thing out of they than a spirit they make what be call orange-butter the oil of the orange inspissated which they mix perhaps with common pomatum and make it fragrant the oil do not fly off in the dry ' boswell ' i wish to have a good walled garden ' johnson ' i do not think it would be worth the expence to you we compute in england a park wall at a thousand pound a mile now a garden-wall must cost at least as much you intend you tree should grow higher than a deer will leap now let we see for a hundred pound you could only have forty-four square yard which be very little for two hundred pound you may have eighty-four square yard -lrb- 637 -rrb- which be very well but when will you get the value of two hundred pound of wall in fruit in you climate no sir such contention with nature be not worth while i would plant a orchard and have plenty of such fruit as ripen well in you country my friend dr madden -lrb- 638 -rrb- of ireland say that in a orchard there should be enough to eat enough to lay up enough to be steal and enough to rot upon the ground cherry be a early fruit you may have they and you may have the early apple and pear ' boswell ` we can not have nonpareil ' johnson ` sir you can no more have nonpareil than you can have grape ' boswell ` we have they sir but they be very bad ' johnson ` nay sir never try to have a thing merely to shew that you _ can not _ have it from ground that would let for forty shilling you may have a large orchard and you see it cost you only forty shilling nay you may graze the ground when the tree be grow up you can not while they be young ' boswell ` be not a good garden a very common thing in england sir ' johnson ` not so common sir as you imagine -lrb- 639 -rrb- in lincolnshire there be hardly a orchard in staffordshire very little fruit ' boswell ` have langton no orchard ' johnson ` no sir ' boswell ` how so sir ' johnson ` why sir from the general negligence of the county he have it not because nobody else have it ' boswell ' a hot-house be a certain thing i may have that ' johnson ' a hot-house be pretty certain but you must first build it then you must keep fire in it and you must have a gardener to take care of it ' boswell ` but if i have a gardener at any rate -- ' johnson ` why yes ' boswell ' i would have it near my house there be no need to have it in the orchard ' johnson ` yes i would have it near my house i would plant a great many currant the fruit be good and they make a pretty sweetmeat ' i record this minute detail which some may think trifling in order to shew clearly how this great man whose mind could grasp such large and extensive subject as he have shew in he literary labor be yet well-informed in the common affair of life and love to illustrate they mr walker the celebrated master of elocution -lrb- 640 -rrb- come in and then we go up stair into the study i ask he if he have teach many clergyman johnson ' i hope not ' walker ' i have teach only one and he be the best reader i ever hear not by my teaching but by he own natural talent ' johnson ` be he the best reader in the world i would not have it tell that he be teach ' here be one of he peculiar prejudice could it be any disadvantage to the clergyman to have it know that he be teach a easy and graceful delivery boswell ` will you not allow sir that a man may be teach to read well ' johnson ` why sir so far as to read better than he might do without be teach yes formerly it be suppose that there be no difference in reading but that one read as well as another ' boswell ` it be wonderful to see old sheridan as enthusiastick about oratory as ever -lrb- 641 -rrb- ' walker ` he enthusiasm as to what oratory will do may be too great : but he read well ' johnson ` he read well but he read low -lrb- 642 -rrb- and you know it be much easier to read low than to read high for when you read high you be much more limited you loudest note can be but one and so the variety be less in proportion to the loudness now some people have occasion to speak to a extensive audience and must speak loud to be hear ' walker ` the art be to read strong though low ' talking of the origin of language johnson ` it must have come by inspiration a thousand nay a million of child could not invent a language while the organ be pliable there be not understand enough to form a language by the time that there be understand enough the organ be become stiff we know that after a certain age we can not learn to pronounce a new language no foreigner who come to england when advance in life ever pronounce english tolerably well at least such instance be very rare when i maintain that language must have come by inspiration i do not mean that inspiration be require for rhetorick and all the beauty of language for when once man have language we can conceive that he may gradually form modification of it i mean only that inspiration seem to I to be necessary to give man the faculty of speech to inform he that he may have speech which i think he could no more find out without inspiration than cow or hog would think of such a faculty ' walker ` do you think sir that there be any perfect synonime in any language ' johnson ` originally there be not but by use word negligently or in poetry one word come to be confound with another ' he talk of dr dodd -lrb- 643 -rrb- ' a friend of mine -lrb- say he -rrb- come to I and tell I that a lady wish to have dr dodd 's picture in a bracelet and ask I for a motto i say i could think of no better than _ currat lex _ i be very willing to have he pardon that be to have the sentence change to transportation : but when he be once hang i do not wish he should be make a saint ' mr burney wife of he friend dr burney come in and he seem to be entertain with she conversation garrick 's funeral be talk of as extravagantly expensive johnson from he dislike to exaggeration would not allow that it be distinguish by any extraordinary pomp ` be there not six horse to each coach ' say mrs burney johnson ` madam there be no more six horse than six phoenix -lrb- 644 -rrb- ' mr burney wonder that some very beautiful new building should be erect in moorfield in so shocking a situation as between bedlam and st luke 's hospital and say she could not live there johnson ` nay madam you see nothing there to hurt you you no more think of madness by have window that look to bedlam than you think of death by have window that look to a church-yard ' mr burney ` we may look to a church-yard sir for it be right that we should be keep in mind of death ' johnson ` nay madam if you go to that it be right that we should be keep in mind of madness which be occasion by too much indulgence of imagination i think a very moral use may be make of these new building : i would have those who have heat imagination live there and take warn ' mr burney ` but sir many of the poor people that be mad have become so from disease or from distressing event it be therefore not they fault but they misfortune and therefore to think of they be a melancholy consideration ' time pass on in conversation till it be too late for the service of the church at three o'clock i take a walk and leave he alone for some time then return and we have coffee and conversation again by ourselves i state the character of a noble friend of mine as a curious case for he opinion : -- ` he be the most inexplicable man to I that i ever know can you explain he sir he be i really believe noble-minded generous and princely but he most intimate friend may be separate from he for year without he ever ask a question concern they he will meet they with a formality a coldness a stately indifference but when they come close to he and fairly engage he in conversation they find he as easy pleasant and kind as they could wish one then suppose that what be so agreeable will soon be renew but stay away from he for half a year and he will neither call on you nor send to inquire about you ' johnson ` why sir i can not ascertain he character exactly as i do not know he but i should not like to have such a man for my friend he may love study and wish not to be interrupt by he friend _ amicus fure tempori _ he may be a frivolous man and be so much occupy with petty pursuit that he may not want friend or he may have a notion that there be a dignity in appear indifferent while he in fact may not be more indifferent at he heart than another ' we go to evening prayer at st clement 's at seven and then part on Sunday April 20 be easter-day after attend solemn service at st paul 's i come to dr johnson and find mr lowe the painter sit with he mr lowe mention the great number of new building of late in london yet that dr johnson have observe that the number of inhabitant be not increase johnson ` why sir the bill of mortality prove that no more people die now than formerly so it be plain no more live the register of birth prove nothing for not one tenth of the people of london be bear there ' boswell ' i believe sir a great many of the child bear in london die early ' johnson ` why yes sir ' boswell ` but those who do live be as stout and strong people as any -lrb- 645 -rrb- : dr price -lrb- 646 -rrb- say they must be naturally stronger to get through ' johnson ` that be system sir a great traveller observe that it be say there be no weak or deform people among the indian but he with much sagacity assign the reason of this which be that the hardship of they life as hunter and fisher do not allow weak or diseased child to grow up now have i be a indian i must have die early my eye would not have serve I to get food i indeed now could fish give I english tackle but have i be a indian i must have starve or they would have knock I on the head when they see i could do nothing ' boswell ` perhaps they would have take care of you : we be tell they be fond of oratory you would have talk to they ' johnson ` nay sir i should not have live long enough to be fit to talk i should have be dead before i be ten year old depend upon it sir a savage when he be hungry will not carry about with he a looby of nine year old who can not help himself they have no affection sir ' boswell ' i believe natural affection of which we hear so much be very small ' johnson ` sir natural affection be nothing : but affection from principle and established duty be sometimes wonderfully strong ' lowe ' a hen sir will feed she chicken in preference to herself ' johnson ` but we do not know that the hen be hungry let the hen be fairly hungry and i 'll warrant she 'll peck the corn herself a cock i believe will feed hen instead of himself but we do not know that the cock be hungry ' boswell ` and that sir be not from affection but gallantry but some of the indian have affection ' johnson ` sir that they help some of they child be plain for some of they live which they could not do without be help ' i dine with he the company be mr william mr desmoulin and mr lowe he seem not to be well talk little grow drowsy soon after dinner and retire upon which i go away have next day go to mr burke 's seat in the country from whence i be recall by a express that a near relation of mine have kill he antagonist in a duel and be himself dangerously wound -lrb- 647 -rrb- i see little of dr johnson till Monday April 28 when i spend a considerable part of the day with he and introduce the subject which then chiefly occupy my mind johnson ' i do not see sir that fighting be absolutely forbid in scripture i see revenge forbid but not self-defence ' boswell ` the quaker say it be unto he that smiteth thee on one cheek offer he also the other -lrb- 648 -rrb- ' johnson ` but stay sir the text be mean only to have the effect of moderate passion it be plain that we be not to take it in a literal sense we see this from the context where there be other recommendation which i warrant you the quaker will not take literally as for instance from he that would borrow of thee turn thou not away -lrb- 649 -rrb- let a man whose credit be bad come to a quaker and say well sir lend I a hundred pound he 'll find he as unwilling as any other man no sir a man may shoot the man who invade he character as he may shoot he who attempt to break into he house -lrb- 650 -rrb- so in 1745 my friend tom cum the quaker -lrb- 651 -rrb- say he would not fight but he would drive a ammunition cart and we know that the quaker have send flannel waistcoat to we soldier to enable they to fight better ' boswell ` when a man be the aggressor and by ill-usage force on a duel in which he be kill have we not little ground to hope that he be go into a state of happiness ' johnson ` sir we be not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leave this life he may in a moment have repent effectually and it be possible may have be accept by god there be in _ camden 's remain _ a epitaph upon a very wicked man who be kill by a fall from he horse in which he be suppose to say ` between the stirrup and the ground i mercy ask would i mercy find -lrb- 652 -rrb- ' boswell ` be not the expression in the burial-service in the _ sure _ and _ certain _ hope of a bless resurrection -lrb- 653 -rrb- too strong to be use indiscriminately and indeed sometimes when those over whose body it be say have be notoriously profane ' johnson ` it be sure and certain _ hope _ sir not _ belief _ ' i do not insist further but can not help think that less positive word would be more proper -lrb- 654 -rrb- talking of a man who be grow very fat so as to be incommode with corpulency he say ` he eat too much sir ' boswell ' i do not know sir you will see one man fat who eat moderately and another lean who eat a great deal ' johnson ` nay sir whatever may be the quantity that a man eat it be plain that if he be too fat he have eat more than he should have do one man may have a digestion that consume food better than common but it be certain that solidity be encrease by put something to it ' boswell ` but may not solid swell and be distend ' johnson ` yes sir they may swell and be distend but that be not fat ' we talk of the accusation against a gentleman for suppose delinquency in indium -lrb- 655 -rrb- johnson ` what foundation there be for accusation i know not but they will not get at he where bad action be commit at so great a distance a delinquent can obscure the evidence till the scent become cold there be a cloud between which can not be penetrate : therefore all distant power be bad i be clear that the best plan for the government of indium be a despotick governor for if he be a good man it be evidently the best government and suppose he to be a bad man it be better to have one plunderer than many a governor whose power be check let other plunder that he himself may be allow to plunder but if despotick he see that the more he let other plunder the less there will be for himself so he restrain they and though he himself plunder the country be a gainer compare with be plunder by number ' i mention the very liberal payment which have be receive for review and as evidence of this that it have be prove in a trial that dr shebbeare -lrb- 656 -rrb- have receive six guinea a sheet for that kind of literary labor johnson ` sir he might get six guinea for a particular sheet but not _ communibus sheetibus _ -lrb- 657 -rrb- ' boswell ` pray sir by a sheet of review be it mean that it shall be all of the writer 's own composition or be extract make from the book review deducted ' johnson ` no sir : it be a sheet no matter of what ' boswell ' i think that it be not reasonable ' johnson ` yes sir it be a man will more easily write a sheet all he own than read a octavo volume to get extract -lrb- 658 -rrb- ' to one of johnson 's wonderful fertility of mind i believe write be really easier than reading and extract but with ordinary man the case be very different a great deal indeed will depend upon the care and judgement with which the extract be make i can suppose the operation to be tedious and difficult : but in many instance we must observe crude morsel cut out of book as if at random and when a large extract be make from one place it surely may be do with very little trouble one however i must acknowledge might be lead from the practice of reviewer to suppose that they take a pleasure in original write for we often find that instead of give a accurate account of what have be do by the author whose work they be review which be surely the proper business of a literary journal they produce some plausible and ingenious conceit of they own upon the topick which have be discuss -lrb- 659 -rrb- upon be tell that old mr sheridan indignant at the neglect of he oratorical plan have threaten to go to america johnson ' i hope he will go to america ' boswell ` the american do not want oratory ' johnson ` but we can want sheridan -lrb- 660 -rrb- ' on Monday -lrb- 661 -rrb- April 29 i find he at home in the forenoon and mr seward with he horace have be mention boswell ` there be a great deal of think in he work one find there almost every thing but religion ' seward ` he speak of he return to it in he ode _ parcus deorum cultor et infrequens _ -lrb- 662 -rrb- johnson ` sir he be not in earnest : this be merely poetical ' boswell ` there be i be afraid many people who have no religion at all ' seward ` and sensible people too ' johnson ` why sir not sensible in that respect there must be either a natural or a moral stupidity if one life in a total neglect of so very important a concern ' seward ' i wonder that there should be people without religion ' johnson ` sir you need not wonder at this when you consider how large a proportion of almost every man 's life be pass without thinking of it i myself be for some year totally regardless of religion it have drop out of my mind it be at a early part of my life sickness bring it back and i hope i have never lose it since -lrb- 663 -rrb- ' boswell ` my dear sir what a man must you have be without religion why you must have go on drinking and swearing and -- -lrb- 664 -rrb- ' johnson -lrb- with a smile -rrb- ' i drink enough and swear enough to be sure ' seward ` one should think that sickness and the view of death would make more man religious ' johnson ` sir they do not know how to go about it : they have not the first notion a man who have never have religion before no more grow religious when he be sick than a man who have never learn figure can count when he have need of calculation ' i mention a worthy friend of ours -lrb- 665 -rrb- whom we value much but observe that he be too ready to introduce religious discourse upon all occasion johnson ` why yes sir he will introduce religious discourse without see whether it will end in instruction and improvement or produce some profane jest he would introduce it in the company of wilke and twenty more such ' i mention dr johnson 's excellent distinction between liberty of conscience and liberty of teaching -lrb- 666 -rrb- johnson ` consider sir if you have child whom you wish to educate in the principle of the church of england and there come a quaker who try to pervert they to he principle you would drive away the quaker you would not trust to the predomination of right which you believe be in you opinion you would keep wrong out of they head now the vulgar be the child of the state if any one attempt to teach they doctrine contrary to what the state approve the magistrate may and ought to restrain he ' seward ` would you restrain private conversation sir ' johnson ` why sir it be difficult to say where private conversation begin and where it end if we three should discuss even the great question concern the existence of a supreme be by ourselves we should not be restrain for that would be to put a end to all improvement but if we should discuss it in the presence of ten boarding-school girl and as many boy i think the magistrate would do well to put we in the stock to finish the debate there ' lord haile have send he a present of a curious little print poem on repair the university of aberdeen by david malloch which he think would please johnson as afford clear evidence that mallet have appear even as a literary character by the name of _ malloch _ he change which to one of softer sound have give johnson occasion to introduce he into he _ dictionary _ under the article _ alia _ -lrb- 667 -rrb- this piece be i suppose one of mallet 's first essay it be preserve in he work with several variation johnson have read aloud from the beginning of it where there be some common-place assertion as to the superiority of ancient time -- ` how false -lrb- say he -rrb- be all this to say that in ancient time learn be not a disgrace to a peer as it be now in ancient time a peer be as ignorant as any one else he would have be angry to have it think he could write he name -lrb- 668 -rrb- man in ancient time dare to stand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to stand forth i be always angry when i hear ancient time praise at the expence of modern time there be now a great deal more learn in the world than there be formerly for it be universally diffuse you have perhaps no man who know as much greek and latin as bentley -lrb- 669 -rrb- no man who know as much mathematick as newton : but you have many more man who know greek and latin and who know mathematick -lrb- 670 -rrb- ' on Thursday may 1 i visit he in the evening along with young mr burke he say ` it be strange that there should be so little reading in the world and so much write people in general do not willingly read if they can have any thing else to amuse they -lrb- 671 -rrb- there must be a external impulse emulation or vanity or avarice the progress which the understanding make through a book have more pain than pleasure in it language be scanty and inadequate to express the nice gradation and mixture of we feeling no man read a book of science from pure inclination the book that we do read with pleasure be light composition which contain a quick succession of event however i have this year read all virgil through -lrb- 672 -rrb- i read a book of the _ aeneid _ every night so it be do in twelve night and i have great delight in it the _ georgick _ do not give I so much pleasure except the fourth book the _ eclogue _ i have almost all by heart i do not think the story of the _ aeneid _ interesting i like the story of the _ odyssey _ much better -lrb- 673 -rrb- and this not on account of the wonderful thing which it contain for there be wonderful thing enough in the _ aeneid _ -- the ship of the trojan turn to sea-nymph -- the tree at polydorus 's tomb drop blood the story of the _ odyssey _ be interesting as a great part of it be domestick it have be say there be pleasure in write particularly in write verse i allow you may have pleasure from write after it be over if you have write well but you do not go willingly to it again -lrb- 674 -rrb- i know when i have be write verse i have run my finger down the margin to see how many i have make and how few i have to make -lrb- 675 -rrb- ' he seem to be in a very placid humor and although i have no note of the particulars of young mr burke 's conversation it be but justice to mention in general that it be such that dr johnson say to I afterwards ` he do very well indeed i have a mind to tell he father -lrb- 676 -rrb- ' ` to sir joshua reynold ` dear sir ` the gentleman who wait on you with this be mr cruikshank -lrb- 677 -rrb- who wish to succeed he friend dr hunter -lrb- 678 -rrb- as professor of anatomy in the royal academy he qualification be very generally know and it add dignity to the institution that such man -lrb- 679 -rrb- be candidate ' i be sir ` you most humble servant ` sam johnson ' ` may 2 -lrb- 680 -rrb- 1783 ' i have no minute of any interview with johnson till Thursday may 15 when i find what follow : -- boswell ' i wish much to be in parliament sir -lrb- 681 -rrb- ' johnson ` why sir unless you come resolve to support any administration you would be the worse for be in parliament because you would be oblige to live more expensively ' boswell ` perhaps sir i should be the less happy for be in parliament i never would sell my vote and i should be vex if thing go wrong ' johnson ` that be cant sir it would not vex you more in the house than in the gallery : publick affair vex no man ' boswell ` have not they vex yourself a little sir have not you be vex by all the turbulence of this reign and by that absurd vote of the house of common that the influence of the crown have increase be increase and ought to be diminish -lrb- 682 -rrb- ' johnson ` sir i have never sleep a hour less nor eat a ounce less meat -lrb- 683 -rrb- i would have knock the factious dog on the head to be sure but i be not _ vex _ ' boswell ' i declare sir upon my honor i do imagine i be vex and take a pride in it but it _ be _ perhaps cant for i own i neither eat less nor sleep less ' johnson ` my dear friend clear you _ mind _ of cant -lrb- 684 -rrb- you may _ talk _ as other people do : you may say to a man sir i be you most humble servant you be not he most humble servant you may say these be bad time it be a melancholy thing to be reserve to such time you do not mind the time you tell a man i be sorry you have such bad weather the last day of you journey and be so much wet you do not care six-penny whether he be wet or dry you may _ talk _ in this manner it be a mode of talk in society -lrb- 685 -rrb- but do not _ think _ foolishly -lrb- 686 -rrb- ' i talk of living in the country johnson ` do not set up for what be call hospitality it be a waste of time and a waste of money you be eat up and not the more respect for you liberality if you house be like a inn nobody care for you a man who stay a week with another make he a slave for a week ' -lrb- 687 -rrb- boswell ` but there be people sir who make they house a home to they guest and be themselves quite easy ' johnson ` then sir home must be the same to the guest and they need not come ' here he discover a notion common enough in person not much accustom to entertain company that there must be a degree of elaborate attention otherwise company will think themselves neglect and such attention be no doubt very fatiguing -lrb- 688 -rrb- he proceed : ' i would not however be a stranger in my own county i would visit my neighbor and receive they visit but i would not be in haste to return visit if a gentleman come to see I i tell he he do I a great deal of honor i do not go to see he perhaps for ten week then we be very complaisant to each other no sir you will have much more influence by give or lend money where it be wanted than by hospitality -lrb- 689 -rrb- ' on Saturday may 17 i see he for a short time have mention that i have that morning be with old mr sheridan he remember they former intimacy with a cordial warmth and say to I ` tell mr sheridan i shall be glad to see he and shake hand with he -lrb- 690 -rrb- ' boswell ` it be to I very wonderful that resentment should be keep up so long ' johnson ` why sir it be not altogether resentment that he do not visit I it be partly fall out of the habit -- partly disgust as one have at a drug that have make he sick besides he know that i laugh at he oratory -lrb- 691 -rrb- ' another day i speak of one of we friend of whom he as well as i have a very high opinion he expatiate in he praise but add ` sir he be a cursed whig a _ bottomless _ whig as they all be now -lrb- 692 -rrb- ' i mention my expectation from the interest of a eminent person -lrb- 693 -rrb- then in power add ` but i have no claim but the claim of friendship however some people will go a great way from that motive ' johnson ` sir they will go all the way from that motive ' a gentleman talk of retire ` never think of that ' say johnson the gentleman urge ' i should then do no ill ' johnson nor no good either sir it would be a civil suicide -lrb- 694 -rrb- ' on Monday may 26 i find he at tea and the celebrated miss burney the author of _ evelina _ -lrb- 695 -rrb- and _ cecilium _ with he i ask if there would be any speaker in parliament if there be no place to be obtain johnson ` yes sir why do you speak here either to instruct and entertain which be a benevolent motive or for distinction which be a selfish motive ' i mention _ cecilium _ johnson -lrb- with a air of animated satisfaction -rrb- ` sir if you talk of _ cecilium _ talk on -lrb- 696 -rrb- ' we talk of mr barry 's exhibition of he picture johnson ` whatever the hand may have do the mind have do its part there be a grasp of mind there which you find nowhere else -lrb- 697 -rrb- ' i ask whether a man naturally virtuous or one who have overcome wicked inclination be the best johnson ` sir to _ you _ the man who have overcome wicked inclination be not the best he have more merit to _ himself _ : i would rather trust my money to a man who have no hand and so a physical impossibility to steal than to a man of the most honest principle there be a witty satirical story of foote he have a small bust of garrick place upon he bureau you may be surprize -lrb- say he -rrb- that i allow he to be so near my gold -- but you will observe he have no hand ' on Friday may 29 -lrb- 698 -rrb- be to set out for scotland next morning i pass a part of the day with he in more than usual earnestness as he health be in a more precarious state than at any time when i have part from he he however be quick and lively and critical as usual i mention one who be a very learn man johnson ` yes sir he have a great deal of learning but it never lie straight there be never one idea by the side of another ` tis all entangled : and then he drive it so aukwardly upon conversation ' i state to he a anxious think by which a sincere christian might be disturb even when conscious of have live a good life so far as be consistent with human infirmity he might fear that he should afterwards fall away and be guilty of such crime as would render all he former religion vain could there be upon this aweful subject such a thing as balancing of account suppose a man who have lead a good life for seven year commit a act of wickedness and instantly die will he former good life have any effect in he favor johnson ` sir if a man have lead a good life for seven year and then be hurry by passion to do what be wrong and be suddenly carry off depend upon it he will have the reward of he seven year ' good life god will not take a catch of he upon this principle richard baxter believe that a suicide may be save if -lrb- say he -rrb- it should be object that what i maintain may encourage suicide i answer i be not to tell a lie to prevent it ' boswell ` but do not the text say as the tree fall so it must lie -lrb- 699 -rrb- ' johnson ` yes sir as the tree fall : but -- -lrb- after a little pause -rrb- -- that be mean as to the general state of the tree not what be the effect of a sudden blast ' in short he interpret the expression as refer to condition not to position the common notion therefore seem to be erroneous and shenstone 's witty remark on divine try to give the tree a jerk upon a death-bed to make it lie favourably be not well found -lrb- 700 -rrb- i ask he what work of richard baxter 's i should read he say ` read any of they they be all good -lrb- 701 -rrb- ' he say ` get as much force of mind as you can live within you income always have something save at the end of the year let you import be more than you export and you 'll never go far wrong ' i assure he that in the extensive and various range of he acquaintance there never have be any one who have a more sincere respect and affection for he than i have he say ' i believe it sir be i in distress there be no man

after i perceive that i have suffer a paralytick stroke and that my speech be take from I i have no pain and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wonder at my own apathy and consider that

which i be so far as i can judge from my window for i write before i have leave my chamber be sufficiently pleasant be so kind as to continue you attention to mr william it be great consolation to the well and still greater to the sick that they find themselves not neglect and i know that you will be desirous of give comfort even where you have no great hope of give help since i write the former

a thousand pound and when it be find it be not worth a farthe ' ` the style and character of he conversation be pretty generally know it be certainly conduct in conformity with a precept of lord bacon but it be not clear i apprehend that this conformity be either perceive or intend by johnson the precept allude to be as follow : in all kind of speech either pleasant grave severe or ordinary it be convenient to speak leisurely and rather drawingly than hastily : because hasty speech confound the memory and oftentimes besides the unseemliness drive the man either to stammer a non-plus or harping on that which should follow whereas a slow speech confirmeth the memory addeth a conceit of wisdom to the hearer besides a seemliness of speech and countenance -lrb- 732 -rrb- dr johnson 's method of conversation be certainly calculate to excite attention and to amuse and instruct -lrb- as it happen -rrb- without weary or confuse he company he be always most perfectly clear and perspicuous and he language be so accurate and he sentence so neatly construct that he conversation might have be all print without any correction at the same time it be easy and natural the accuracy of it have no appearance of labor constraint or stiffness he seem more correct than other by the force of habit and the customary exercise of he powerful mind -lrb- 733 -rrb- ' ` he speak often in praise of french

extraordinary eminence as a actor he conclude with this compliment to he social talent : and after all madam i think he less to be envy on the stage than at the head of a table ' johnson indeed have think more upon the subject of act than might be generally suppose -lrb- 757 -rrb- talking of it one day to mr kemble he say ` be you sir one of those enthusiast who believe yourself transform into

defect -lrb- 773 -rrb- which take away little from the power of the poem and which be see rather than feel ' a rigid examiner of the diction might perhaps wish some word change and some line more vigorously terminate but from such petty imperfection what writer be ever free ` the general form and force of the dialogue be of more importance it seem to want that quickness of reciprocation which characterise the english drama and be not always sufficiently fervid or animated ` of the sentiment i remember not one that i wish omit in the imagery i can not forbear to distinguish the comparison

which he mention -- ' i be upward of twelve year acquaint with he be frequently in he company always talk with ease to he and can truly say that i never receive from he one rough word ' in this letter he relate he have while engage in translate the _ lusiad _ have a dispute of considerable length with johnson who as usual declaim upon the misery and corruption of a sea life and use this expression : -- ` it have be happy for the world sir if you hero gama prince henry of portugal and columbus have never be bear or that they scheme have never go farther than they own imagination ' ` this sentiment -lrb- say mr mickle -rrb- which be to be find in he _ introduction to the world display _ -lrb- 782 -rrb- i in my dissertation prefix to the _ lusiad _ have controvert and though author be say to be bad judge of they own work -lrb- 783 -rrb- i be not ashamed to own to a friend that that dissertation be my favorite above all that i ever attempt in prose next year when the lusiad be publish i wait on dr johnson who address I with one of he good-humoured smile : -- well you have remember we dispute about prince henry and have cite I too you have do you part very well indeed : you have make the best of you argument but i be not convinced yet ` before publish the _ lusiad _ i send mr hoole a proof of that part of the introduction in which i make mention of dr johnson yourself and other well-wisher to the work beg it might be shewn to dr johnson this be accordingly do and in place of the simple mention of he which i have make he dictate to mr hoole the sentence as it now stand -lrb- 784 -rrb- ` dr johnson tell I in 1772 that about twenty year before that time he himself have a design to translate the _ lusiad _ of the merit of which he speak highly but have be prevent by a number of other engagement ' mr mickle remind I in this letter of a conversation at dinner one day at mr hoole 's with dr johnson when mr nicol the king 's bookseller and i attempt to controvert the maxim ` better that ten guilty should escape than one innocent person suffer ' and be answer by dr johnson with great power of reasoning and eloquence i be very sorry that i have no record of that day -lrb- 785 -rrb- : but i well recollect my illustrious friend 's have ably shewn that unless civil institution insure protection to the innocent all the confidence which mankind should have in they would be lose i shall here mention what in strict chronological arrangement should have appear in my account of last year but may more properly be introduce here the controversy have not be close till this the reverend mr shaw -lrb- 786 -rrb- a native of one of the hebride have entertain doubt of the authenticity of the poem ascribe to ossian divest himself of national bigotry and have travel in the highland and island of scotland and also in ireland in order to furnish himself with material for a _ gaelick dictionary _ which he afterwards compile -lrb- 787 -rrb- be so fully satisfied that dr johnson be in the right upon the question that he candidly publish a pamphlet state he conviction and the proof and reason on which it be found a person at edinburgh of the name of clark answer this pamphlet with much zeal and much abuse of its author johnson take mr shaw under he protection and give he he assistance in write a reply which have be admire by the best judge and by many be consider as conclusive a few paragraph which sufficiently mark they great author shall be select : -- ` my assertion be for the most part purely negative : i deny the existence of fingal because in a long and curious peregrination through the gaelick region i have never be able to find it what i could not see myself i suspect to be equally invisible to other and i suspect with the more reason as among all those who have see it no man can shew it ` mr clark compare the obstinacy of those who disbelieve the genuineness of ossian to a blind man who should dispute the reality of color and deny that the british troops be cloathe in red the blind man 's doubt would be rational if he do not know by experience that other have a power which he himself want : but what perspicacity have mr clark which nature have withhold from I or the rest of mankind ` the true state of the parallel must be this suppose a man with eye like he neighbor be tell by a boast corporal that the troops indeed wear red clothes for they ordinary dress but that every soldier have likewise a suit of black velvet which he put on when the king review they this he think strange and desire to see the fine clothes but find nobody in forty thousand man that can produce either coat or waistcoat one indeed have leave they in he chest at port mahon another have always hear that he ought to have velvet clothes somewhere and a third have hear somebody say that soldier ought to wear velvet can the enquirer be blame if he go away believe that a soldier 's red coat be all that he have ` but the most obdurate incredulity may be shame or silence by act to overpower contradiction let the soldier shew he velvet-coat and the fingalist the original of ossian -lrb- 788 -rrb- ` the difference between we and the blind man be this : -- the blind man be unconvinced because he can not see and we because though we can see we find that nothing can be show ' notwithstanding the complication of disorder under which johnson now labor he do not resign himself to despondency and discontent but with wisdom and spirit endeavor to console and amuse he mind with as many innocent enjoyment as he could procure sir john hawkin have mention the cordiality with which he insist that such of the member of the old club in ivy-lane -lrb- 789 -rrb- as survive should meet again and dine together which they do twice at a tavern and once at he house -lrb- 790 -rrb- : and in order to insure himself society in the evening for three day in the week -lrb- 791 -rrb- he institute a club at the essex head in essex-street then keep by samuel greave

remarkable circumstance which have happen in the course of he illness when he be much distressed by the dropsy he have shut himself up and employ a day in particular exercise of religion -- fast humiliation and prayer on a sudden he obtain extraordinary relief for which he look up to heaven with grateful devotion he make no direct inference from this fact but from he manner of tell it i could perceive that it appear to he as something more than a incident in the common course of event -lrb- 836 -rrb- for my own part i have no difficulty to avow that cast of think which by many modern pretender to wisdom be call _ superstitious _ but here i think even man of dry rationality may believe that there be a intermediate -lrb- 837 -rrb- interposition of divine providence and that ` the fervent prayer of this righteous man -lrb- 838 -rrb- ' avail -lrb- 839 -rrb- on Sunday may 9 i find colonel valiancy the celebrated antiquarian and engineer of ireland with he on Monday the 10th i

the youngest man i find only these three small particulars : -- when a person be mention who say ' i have live fifty-one year in this world without have have ten minute of uneasiness ' he exclaim ` the man who say so lie : he attempt to impose on human credulity ' the bishop of exeter in vain observe that man be very different he lordship 's manner be not impressive and i learn afterwards that johnson do not find out that the person who talk to he be a prelate if he have i doubt not that he would have treat he with more respect for once talk of george psalmanazar -lrb- 842 -rrb- whom he reverence for he piety he say ' i should as soon think of contradict a bishop -lrb- 843 -rrb- ' one of the company -lrb- 844 -rrb- provoke he greatly by do what he could least of all bear which be quote something of he own writing against what he then maintain ` what sir -lrb- cry the gentleman -rrb- do you say to the busy day the peaceful night unfelt uncounted glide by -lrb- 845 -rrb- ' -- johnson finding himself thus present as give a instance of a man who have live without uneasiness be much offend for he look upon such a quotation as unfair he anger burst out in a unjustifiable retort insinuate that the gentleman 's remark be a sally of ebriety ` sir there be one passion i would advise you to command : when you have drunk out that glass do not drink another -lrb- 846 -rrb- '

in the kennel -lrb- 853 -rrb- ' i have in another place -lrb- 854 -rrb- oppose and i hope with success dr johnson 's very singular and erroneous notion as to mr burke 's pleasantry mr windham now say low to I that he differ from we great friend in this observation for that mr burke be often very happy in he merriment it would not have be right for either of we to have contradict johnson at this time in a society all of whom do not know and value mr burke as much as we do it might have occasion something more rough and at any rate would probably have check the flow of johnson 's good-humour

this occasion refute a mistaken notion which be very common in scotland that the ecclesiastical discipline of the church of england though duly enforce be insufficient to preserve the moral of the clergy inasmuch as all delinquent may be screen by appeal to the convocation which be never authorize by the king to sit for the dispatch of business the appeal never can be hear dr dougla observe that this be found upon ignorance for that the bishop have sufficient power to maintain discipline and that the sit of the convocation be wholly immaterial in this respect it be not a court of judicature but like a parliament to make canon and regulation as time may require johnson talking of the fear of death say ` some people be not afraid because they look upon salvation as the effect of a absolute decree and think they feel in themselves the mark of sanctification other and those the most rational in my opinion look upon salvation as conditional and as they never can be sure that they have comply with the condition they be afraid -lrb- 858 -rrb- ' in one of he little manuscript diary about this time i find a short notice which mark he amiable disposition more certainly than a

agreeable circle at pembroke college with the comfortable prospect of make some stay johnson welcome my return with more than ordinary glee he talk with great regard of the honorable archibald campbell whose character he have give at the duke of argyll 's table when we be at inverary -lrb- 883 -rrb- and at this time write out for I in he own hand a fuller account of that learn and venerable writer which i have publish in its proper place johnson make a remark this evening which strike I a good deal ' i never -lrb- say he -rrb- know a non-juror who could reason -lrb- 884 -rrb- ' surely he do not mean to deny that faculty to many of they writer to hicke brett -lrb- 885 -rrb- and other eminent divine of that persuasion and do not recollect that the seven bishop so justly celebrate for they magnanimous resistance of arbitrary power be yet nonjurors to the new government -lrb- 886 -rrb- the nonjuring clergy of scotland indeed who except a few have lately by a sudden stroke cut off all tie of allegiance to the house of stuart and resolve to pray for we present lawful sovereign by name may be think to have confirm this remark as it may be say that the divine indefeasible hereditary right which they profess to believe if ever true must be equally true still many of my reader will be surprize when i mention that johnson assure I he have never in he life be in a nonjuring meeting-house -lrb- 887 -rrb- next morning at breakfast he point out a passage in savage 's _ wanderer _ say ` these be fine verse ' ` if -lrb- say he -rrb- i have write with hostility of warburton in my _ shakspeare _ i should have quote this couplet : -- here learn blind first and then beguil would look dark as ignorance as fancy wild -lrb- 888 -rrb- you see they would have fit he to a _ t _ ' -lrb- smile -rrb- dr adam ` but you do not write against warburton ' johnson ` no sir i treat he with great respect both in my preface and in my note -lrb- 889 -rrb- ' mr kennicot speak of she brother the reverend mr chamberlayne who have give up great prospects in the church of england on he conversion to the roman catholick faith johnson who warmly admire every man who act from a conscientious regard to principle erroneous or not exclaim fervently ` god bless he ' mr kennicot in confirmation of dr johnson 's opinion -lrb- 890 -rrb- that the present be not worse than former age mention that she brother assure she there be now less infidelity on the continent than there have be voltaire and rousseau be less read i assert from good authority that hume 's infidelity be certainly less read johnson ` all infidel writer drop into oblivion when personal connection and the floridness of novelty be go though now and then a foolish fellow who think he can be witty upon they may bring they again into notice there will sometimes start up a college joker who do not consider that what be a joke in a college will not do in the world to such defender of religion i would apply a stanza of a poem which i remember to have see in some old collection : -- henceforth be quiet and agree each kiss he empty brother religion scorn a foe like thee but dread a friend like t ` other the point be well though the expression be not correct _ one _ and not _ thee should be oppose to _ t ` other _ -lrb- 891 -rrb- ' on the roman catholick religion he say ` if you join the papist externally they will not interrogate you strictly as to you belief in they tenet no reasoning papist believe every article of they faith there be one side on which a good man might be persuade to embrace it a good man of a timorous disposition in great doubt of he acceptance with god and pretty credulous might be glad to be of a church where there be so many help to get to heaven i would be a papist if i could i have fear enough but a obstinate rationality prevent I i shall never be a papist unless on the near approach of death of which i have a very great terror i wonder that woman be not all papist ' boswell ` they be not more afraid of death than man be ' johnson ` because they be less wicked ' dr adam ` they be more pious ' johnson ` no hang 'em they be not more pious a wicked fellow be the most pious when he take to it he 'll beat you all at piety ' he argue in defense of some of the peculiar tenet of the church of rome as to the give the bread only to the laity he say ` they may think that in what be merely ritual deviation from the primitive mode may be admit on the ground of convenience and i think they be as well warrant to make this alteration as we be to substitute sprinkling in the room of the ancient baptism ' as to the invocation of saint -lrb- 892 -rrb- he say ` though i do not think it authorise it appear to I that the communion of saint in the creed mean the communion with the saint in heaven as connect with the holy catholick church -lrb- 893 -rrb- ' he admit the influence of evil spirit -lrb- 894 -rrb- upon we mind and say ` nobody who believe the new testament can deny it ' i bring a volume of dr hurd the bishop of worcester 's _ sermon _ and read to the company some passage from one of they upon this text ' _ resist the devil and he will fly -lrb- 895 -rrb- from you ' jame _ iv 7 i be happy to produce so judicious and elegant a supporter -lrb- 896 -rrb- of a doctrine which i know not why should in this world of imperfect knowledge and therefore of wonder and mystery in a thousand instance be contest by some with a unthinking assurance and flippancy after dinner when one of we talk of there be a great enmity between whig and tory -- johnson ` why not so much i think unless when they come into competition with each other there be none when they be only common acquaintance none when they be of different sex a tory will marry into a whig family and a whig into a tory family without any reluctance but indeed in a matter of much more concern than political tenet and that be religion man and woman do not concern themselves much about difference of opinion and lady set no value on the moral character of man who pay they address to they the greatest profligate will be as well receive as the man of the greatest virtue and this by a very good woman by a woman who say she prayer three time a day ' we lady endeavor to defend they sex from this charge but he roar they down ` no no a lady will take jonathan wild as readily as st austin if he have three-pence more and what be worse she parent will give she to he woman have a perpetual envy of we vice they be less vicious than we not from choice but because we restrict they they be the slave of order and fashion they virtue be of more consequence to we than we own so far as concern this world ' miss adam mention a gentleman of licentious character and say ` suppose i have a mind to marry that gentleman would my parent consent ' johnson ` yes they would consent and you would go you would go though they do not consent ' miss adam ` perhaps they oppose might make I go ' johnson ' o very well you would take one whom you think a bad man to have the pleasure of vex you parent you put I in mind of dr barrowby -lrb- 897 -rrb- the physician who be very fond of swine 's flesh one day when he be eat it he say ' i wish i be a jew ' ` why so -lrb- say somebody -rrb- the jew be not allow to eat you favorite meat ' ` because -lrb- say he -rrb- i should then have the gust of eat it with the pleasure of sin ' johnson then proceed in he declamation miss adams soon afterwards make a observation that i do not recollect which please he much : he say with a good-humoured smile ` that there should be so much excellence unite with so much _ depravity _ be strange ' indeed this lady 's good quality merit and accomplishment and she constant attention to dr johnson be not lose upon he she happen to tell he that a little coffee-pot in which she have make he coffee be the only thing she could call she own he turn to she with a complacent gallantry ` do not say so my dear i hope you do not reckon my heart as nothing ' i ask he if it be true as report that he have say lately ' i be for the king against fox but i be for fox against pitt ' johnson ` yes sir the king be my master but i do not know pitt and fox be my friend -lrb- 898 -rrb- ' ` fox -lrb- add he -rrb- be a most extraordinary man here be a man -lrb- describe he in strong term of objection in some respects accord as he apprehend but which exalt he ability the more -rrb- who have divide the kingdom with caesar -lrb- 899 -rrb- so that it be a doubt whether the nation should be rule by the sceptre of george the third or the tongue of fox ' dr wall physician at oxford drink tea with we johnson have in general a peculiar pleasure in the company of physician which be certainly not abate by the conversation of this learn ingenious and please gentleman johnson say ` it be wonderful how little good radcliffe 's travel fellowship -lrb- 900 -rrb- have do i know nothing that have be import by they yet many addition to we medical knowledge might be get in foreign country inoculation for instance have save more life than war destroy -lrb- 901 -rrb- : and the cure perform by the peruvian-bark be innumerable but it be in vain to send we travel physician to france and italy and germany for all that be know there be know here i would send they out of christendom i would send they among barbarous nation ' on Friday June 11 we talk at breakfast of form of prayer johnson ' i know of no good prayer but those in the _ book of common prayer _ ' dr adam -lrb- in a very earnest manner -rrb- : ' i wish sir you would compose some family prayer ' johnson ' i will not compose prayer for you sir because you can do it for yourself but i have think of get together all the book of prayer which i could select those which should appear to I the best put out some insert other add some prayer of my own and prefix a discourse on prayer ' we all now gather about he and two or three of we at a time join in press he to execute this plan he seem to be a little displeased at the manner of we importunity and in great agitation call out ` do not talk thus of what be so aweful i know not what time god will allow I in this world there be many thing which i wish to do ' some of we persist and dr adam say ' i never be more serious about any thing in my life ' johnson ` let I alone let I alone i be overpower ' and then he put he hand before he face and recline for some time upon the table -lrb- 902 -rrb- i mention jeremy taylor 's use in he form of prayer ' i be the chief of sinner ' and other such self-condemning expression -lrb- 903 -rrb- ` now -lrb- say i -rrb- this can not be say with truth by every man and therefore be improper for a general print form i myself can not say that i be the worst of man i _ will _ not say so ' johnson ' a man may know that physically that be in the real state of thing he be not the worst man but that morally he may be so law observe that every man know something worse of himself than he be sure of in other -lrb- 904 -rrb- you may not have commit such crime as some man have do but you do not know against what degree of light they have sin besides sir the chief of sinner be a mode of expression for i be a great sinner so st paul speaking of we savior 's have die to save sinner say of whom i be the chief -lrb- 905 -rrb- yet he certainly do not think himself so bad as juda iscariot ' boswell ` but sir taylor mean it literally for he found a conceit upon it when pray for the conversion of sinner and of himself in particular he say lord thou wilt not leave thy _ chief _ work undo johnson ' i do not approve of figurative expression in address the supreme be and i never use they -lrb- 906 -rrb- taylor give a very good advice : never lie in you prayer never confess more than you really believe never promise more than you mean to perform -lrb- 907 -rrb- i recollected this precept in he _ golden grove _ but he _ example _ for prayer contradict he _ precept _ ' dr johnson and i go in dr adam 's coach to dine with dr nowell principal of st mary hall at he beautiful villa at iffley on the bank of the isis about two mile from oxford while we be upon the road i have the resolution to ask johnson whether he think that the roughness of he manner have be a advantage or not and if he would not have do more good if he have be more gentle i proceed to answer myself thus : ` perhaps it have be of advantage as it have give weight to what you say : you could not perhaps have talk with such authority without it ' johnson ` no sir i have do more good as i be obscenity and impiety have always be repress in my company -lrb- 908 -rrb- ' boswell ` true sir and that be more than can be say of every bishop greater liberty have be take in the presence of a bishop though a very good man from he be milder and therefore not command such awe yet sir many people who might have be benefit by you conversation have be frighten away a worthy friend of ours -lrb- 909 -rrb- have tell I that he have often be afraid to talk to you ' johnson ` sir he need not have be afraid if he have any thing rational to say if he have not it be better he do not talk -lrb- 910 -rrb- dr nowell be celebrate for have preach a sermon before the house of common on the 3oth of January 1773 full of high tory sentiment for which he be thank as usual and print it at they request but in the midst of that turbulence and faction which disgrace a part of the present reign the thanks be afterwards order to be expunge -lrb- 911 -rrb- this strange conduct sufficiently expose itself and dr nowell will ever have the honor which be due to a lofty friend of we monarchical constitution dr johnson say to I ` sir the court will be very much to blame if he be not promote ' i tell this to dr nowell and assert my humbler though not less zealous exertion in the same cause i suggest that whatever return we might receive we should still have the consolation of be like butler 's steady and generous royalist ` true as the dial to the sun although it be not shine upon -lrb- 912 -rrb- ' we be well entertain and very happy at dr nowell 's where be a very agreeable company and we drink ` church and king ' after dinner with true tory cordiality we talk of a certain clergyman -lrb- 913 -rrb- of extraordinary character who by exert he talent in write on temporary topick and display uncommon intrepidity have raise himself to affluence i maintain that we ought not to be indignant at he success for merit of every sort be entitle to reward johnson ` sir i will not allow this man to have merit no sir what he have be rather the contrary i will indeed allow he courage and on this account we so far give he credit we have more respect for a man who rob boldly on the highway than for a fellow who jump out of a ditch and knock you down behind you back courage be a quality so necessary for maintain virtue that it be always respect even when it be associate with vice -lrb- 914 -rrb- i censure the coarse invective which be become fashionable in the house of common -lrb- 915 -rrb- and say that if member of parliament must attack each other personally in the heat of debate it should be do more genteely johnson ` no sir that would be much worse abuse be not so dangerous when there be no vehicle of wit or delicacy no subtle conveyance the difference between coarse and refined abuse be as the difference between be bruise by a club and wound by a poison arrow ' i have since observe he position elegantly express by dr young : -- ` as the soft plume give swiftness to the dart good breeding send the satire to the heart -lrb- 916 -rrb- ' on Saturday June 12 there drink tea with we at dr adam 's mr john henderson student of pembroke-college celebrate for he wonderful acquirement in alchymy judicial astrology and other abstruse and curious learning -lrb- 917 -rrb- and the reverend herbert croft who i be afraid be somewhat mortified by dr johnson 's not be highly please with some _ family discourse _ which he have print they be in too familiar a style to be approve of by so manly a mind i have no note of this evening 's conversation except a single fragment when i mention thoma lord lyttelton 's vision -lrb- 918 -rrb- the prediction of the time of he death and its exact fulfilment -- johnson ` it be the most extraordinary thing that have happen in my day i hear it with my own ear from he uncle lord westcote i be so glad to have every evidence of the spiritual world that i be willing to believe it ' dr adam ` you have evidence enough good evidence which need not such support ' johnson ' i like to have more -lrb- 919 -rrb- ' mr henderson with whom i have saunter in the venerable walk of merton-college and find he a very learn and pious man sup with we dr johnson surprise he not a little by acknowledge with a look of horror that he be much oppress by the fear of death -lrb- 920 -rrb- the amiable dr adam suggest that god be infinitely good johnson ` that he be infinitely good as far as the perfection of he nature will allow i certainly believe but it be necessary for good upon the whole that individual should be punish as to a _ individual _ therefore he be not infinitely good and as i can not be _ sure _ that i have fulfil the condition on which salvation be grant i be afraid i may be one of those who shall be damned ' -lrb- look dismally -rrb- dr adam ` what do you mean by damned ' johnson -lrb- passionately and loudly -rrb- ` send to hell sir and punish everlastingly -lrb- 921 -rrb- ' dr adam ' i do not believe that doctrine ' johnson ` hold sir do you believe that some will be punish at all ' dr adam ` be exclude from heaven will be a punishment yet there may be no great positive suffering ' johnson ` well sir but if you admit any degree of punishment there be a end of you argument for infinite goodness simply consider for infinite goodness would inflict no punishment whatever there be not infinite goodness physically consider morally there be ' boswell ` but may not a man attain to such a degree of hope as not to be uneasy from the fear of death ' johnson ' a man may have such a degree of hope as to keep he quiet you see i be not quiet from the vehemence with which i talk but i do not despair ' mr adam ` you seem sir to forget the merit of we redeemer ' johnson ` madam i do not forget the merit of my redeemer but my redeemer have say that he will set some on he right hand and some on he left ' he be in gloomy agitation and say ` i 'll have no more o not -lrb- 922 -rrb- ' if what have now be state should be urge by the enemy of christianity as if its influence on the mind be not benignant let it be remember that johnson 's temperament be melancholy of which such direful apprehension of futurity be often a common effect we shall presently see that when he approach nearer to he aweful change he mind become tranquil and he exhibit as much fortitude as become a think man in that situation from the subject of death we pass to discourse of life whether it be upon the whole more happy or miserable johnson be decidedly for the balance of misery -lrb- 923 -rrb- : in confirmation of which i maintain that no man would choose to lead over again the life which he have experience johnson accede to that opinion in the strongest term -lrb- 924 -rrb- this be a inquiry often make and its be a subject of disquisition be a proof that much misery press upon human feeling for those who be conscious of a felicity of existence would never hesitate to accept of a repetition of it i have meet with very few who would i have hear mr burke make use of a very ingenious and plausible argument on this subject -- ` every man -lrb- say he -rrb- would lead he life over again for every man be willing to go on and take a addition to he life which as he grow older he have no reason to think will be better or even so good as what have precede ' i imagine however the truth be that there be a deceitful hope that the next part of life will be free from the pain and anxiety and sorrow which we have already feel -lrb- 925 -rrb- we be for wise purpose ` condemn would to hope 's delusive mine ' as johnson finely say -lrb- 926 -rrb- and i may also quote the celebrated line of dryden equally philosophical and poetical : -- ` when i consider life ` tis all a cheat yet fool would with hope man favor the deceit : trust on and think to-morrow will repay to-morrow 's falser than the former day lie worse and while it say we shall be bless with some new joy cut off what we possest strange cozenage none would live past year again yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain and from the dregs of life think to receive what the first sprightly running could not give -lrb- 927 -rrb- ' it be observe to dr johnson that it seem strange that he who have so often delighted he company by he lively and brilliant conversation should say he be miserable johnson ` alas it be all outside i may be crack my joke -lrb- 928 -rrb- and cursing the sun _ sun how i hate thy beam _ -lrb- 929 -rrb- ' i know not well what to think of this declaration whether to hold it as a genuine picture of he mind -lrb- 930 -rrb- or as the effect of he persuade himself contrary to fact that the position which he have assume as to human unhappiness be true we may apply to he a sentence in mr greville 's -lrb- 931 -rrb- _ maxim character and reflection _ -lrb- 932 -rrb- a book which be entitle to much more praise than it have receive : ` aristarchus be charming : how full of knowledge of sense of sentiment you get he with difficulty to you supper and after have delighted every body and himself for a few hour he be oblige to return home -- he be finish he treatise to prove that unhappiness be the portion of man -lrb- 933 -rrb- ' on Sunday June 13 we philosopher be calm at breakfast there be something exceedingly please in we lead a college life without restraint and with superior elegance in consequence of we living in the master 's house and have the company of lady mr kennicot related in he presence a lively saying of dr johnson to miss hannah more who have express a wonder that the poet who have write _ paradise lose _ should write such poor sonnet : -- ' milton madam be a genius that could cut a colossus from a rock but could not carve head upon cherry-stone -lrb- 934 -rrb- ' we talk of the casuistical question whether it be allowable at any time to depart from _ truth _ johnson ` the general rule be that truth should never be violate because it be of the utmost importance to the comfort of life that we should have a full security by mutual faith and occasional inconvenience should be willingly suffer that we may preserve it there must however be some exception if for instance a murderer should ask you which way a man be go you may tell he what be not true because you be under a previous obligation not to betray a man to a murderer -lrb- 935 -rrb- ' boswell ` suppose the person who write _ junius _ be ask whether he be the author might he deny it ' johnson ' i do not know what to say to this if you be _ sure _ that he write _ junius _ would you if he deny it think as well of he afterwards yet it may be urge that what a man have no right to ask you may refuse to communicate -lrb- 936 -rrb- and there be no other effectual mode of preserve a secret and a important secret the discovery of which may be very hurtful to you but a flat denial for if you be silent or hesitate or evade it will be hold equivalent to a confession but stay sir here be another case suppose the author have tell I confidentially that he have write _ junius _ and i be ask if he have i should hold myself at liberty to deny it as be under a previous promise express or imply to conceal it now what i ought to do for the author may i not do for myself but i deny the lawfulness of tell a lie to a sick man for fear of alarming he you have no business with consequence you be to tell the truth besides you be not sure what effect you tell he that he be in danger may have it may bring he distemper to a crisis and that may cure he of all lie i have the greatest abhorrence of this because i believe it have be frequently practice on myself ' i can not help think that there be much weight in the opinion of those who have hold that truth as a eternal and immutable principle ought upon no account whatever to be violate from suppose previous or superior obligation of which every man be to judge for himself there be great danger that we too often from partial motive persuade ourselves that they exist and probably whatever extraordinary instance may sometimes occur where some evil may be prevent by violate this noble principle it would be find that human happiness would upon the whole be more perfect be truth universally preserve in the note to the _ dunciad _ -lrb- 937 -rrb- we find the follow verse address to pope -lrb- 938 -rrb- : -- ` while malice pope deny thy page its own celestial fire while critick and while bard in rage admiring will not admire : while wayward pen thy worth assail and envious tongue decry these time though many a friend bewail these time bewail not i but when the world 's loud praise be thine and spleen no more shall blame when with thy homer thou shalt shine in one establish would fame when none shall rail and every lay devote a wreath to thee : that day -lrb- for come it will -rrb- that day shall i lament to see ' it be surely not a little remarkable that they should appear without a name miss seward -lrb- 939 -rrb- know dr johnson 's almost universal and minute literary information signify a desire that i should ask he who be the author he be prompt with he answer : ` why sir they be write by one lewi who be either under-master or a usher of westminster-school and publish a miscellany in which _ grongar hill _ -lrb- 940 -rrb- first come out -lrb- 941 -rrb- ' johnson praise they highly and repeat they with a noble animation in the twelfth line instead of ` one establish would fame ' he repeat ` one unclouded flame ' which he think be the reading in former edition : but i believe be a flash of he own genius it be much more poetical than the other on Monday June 14 and Tuesday 15 dr johnson and i dine on one of they i forget which with mr mickle translator of the _ lusiad _ at wheatley a very pretty country place a few mile from oxford and on the other with dr wetherell master of university-college from dr wetherell 's he go to visit mr sackville parker the bookseller and when he return to we give the follow account of he visit say ' i have be to see my old friend sack parker i find he have marry he maid he have do right she have live with he many year in great confidence and they have mingle mind i do not think he could have find any wife that would have make he so happy the woman be very attentive and civil to I she press I to fix a day for dine with they and to say what i like and she would be sure to get it for I poor sack he be very ill indeed we part as never to meet again it have quite break I down ' this pathetic narrative be strangely diversify with the grave and earnest defense of a man 's have marry he maid i could not but feel it as in some degree ludicrous in the morning of Tuesday June 15 while we sit at dr adam 's we talk of a print letter from the reverend herbert croft -lrb- 942 -rrb- to a young gentleman who have be he pupil in which he advise he to read to the end of whatever book he should begin to read johnson ` this be surely a strange advice you may as well resolve that whatever man you happen to get acquaint with you be to keep to they for life a book may be good for nothing or there may be only one thing in it worth know be we to read it all through -lrb- 943 -rrb- these voyage -lrb- point to the three large volume of _ voyage to the south sea _ -lrb- 944 -rrb- which be just come out -rrb- _ who _ will read they through a man have better work he way before the mast than read they through they will be eat by rat and mouse before they be read through there can be little entertainment in such book one set of savage be like another ' boswell ' i do not think the people of otaheité can be reckon savage ' johnson ` do not cant in defense of savage -lrb- 945 -rrb- ' boswell ` they have the art of navigation ' johnson ' a dog or a cat can swim ' boswell ` they carve very ingeniously ' johnson ' a cat can scratch and a child with a nail can scratch ' i perceive this be none of the _ mollium tempora fandus _ -lrb- 946 -rrb- so desist upon he mention that when he come to college he write he first exercise twice over but never do so afterwards -lrb- 947 -rrb- miss adam ' i suppose sir you could not make they better ' johnson ` yes madam to be sure i could make they better thought be better than no thought ' miss adam ` do you think sir you could make you _ rambler _ better ' johnson ` certainly i could ' boswell ` i 'll lay a bet sir you can not ' johnson ` but i will sir if i choose i shall make the best of they you shall pick out better ' boswell ` but you may add to they i will not allow of that ' johnson ` nay sir there be three way of make they better -- put out -- add -- or correct -lrb- 948 -rrb- ' during we visit at oxford the follow conversation pass between he and I on the subject of my try my fortune at the english bar -lrb- 949 -rrb- : have ask whether a very extensive acquaintance in london which be very valuable and of great advantage to a man at large might not be prejudicial to a lawyer by prevent he from give sufficient attention to he business -- johnson ` sir you will attend to business as business lay hold of you when not actually employ you may see you friend as much as you do now you may dine at a club every day and sup with one of the member every night and you may be as much at publick place as one who have see they all would wish to be but you must take care to attend constantly in westminster-hall both to mind you business as it be almost all learn there -lrb- for nobody read now -rrb- and to shew

find at he chamber ' and sir there must be a kind of solemnity in the manner of a professional man i have nothing particular to say to you on the subject all this i should say to any one i should have say it to lord thurlow twenty year ago ' the profession may probably think this representation of what be require in a barrister who would hope for success to be by much too indulgent but certain it be that as ` the wit of charle find easier way to fame -lrb- 951 -rrb- ' some of the lawyer of this age who have rise high have by no means think it absolutely necessary to submit to that long and painful course of study which a plowden a coke and a hale consider as requisite my respect friend mr langton have shew I in the hand-writing of he grandfather -lrb- 952 -rrb- a curious account of a conversation which he have with lord chief justice hale in which that great man tell he ` that for two year after he come to the inn of court he study sixteen hour a day however -lrb- he lordship add -rrb- that by this intense application he almost bring himself to he grave though he be of a very strong constitution and after reduce himself to eight hour but that he would not advise any body to so much that he think six hour a day with attention and constancy be sufficient that a man must use he body as he would he horse and he stomach not tire he at once but rise with a appetite -lrb- 953

-lrb- 958 -rrb- it have be mention to dr johnson that a gentleman who have a son whom he imagine to have a extreme degree of timidity resolve to send he to a publick school that he might acquire confidence -- ' sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- this be a preposterous expedient for remove he infirmity such a disposition should be cultivate in the shade place he at a publick school be force a owl upon day -lrb- 959 -rrb- ' speaking of a gentleman whose house be much frequent by low company ` rag sir -lrb- say he -rrb- will always make they appearance where they have a right to do it ' of the

man of war -lrb- 960 -rrb- ' a dull country magistrate -lrb- 961 -rrb- give johnson a long tedious account of he exercise he criminal jurisdiction the result of which be he have sentence four convict to transportation johnson in a agony of impatience to get rid of such a companion exclaim ' i heartily wish sir that i be a fifth ' johnson be present when a tragedy be read in which there occur this line : -- ` who rule o'er freeman should himself be free -lrb- 962 -rrb- ' the company have admire it much ' i can not agree with you -lrb- say johnson : -rrb- it might as well be say -- ` who drive

character and much usefulness in he knowledge ' he find a cordial solace at that gentleman 's seat at beckenham in kent which be indeed one of the finest place at which i ever be a guest and where i find more and more a hospitable welcome johnson seldom encourage general censure of any profession -lrb- 964 -rrb- but he be willing to allow a due share of merit to the various department necessary in civilised life in a splenetick sarcastical or jocular frame however he would sometimes utter a pointed saying of that nature one instance have be mention -lrb- 965 -rrb- where he give a sudden satirical stroke to the character of a _ attorney _ the too indiscriminate admission to that employment which require both ability and integrity have give rise to injurious reflection which be totally inapplicable to many very respectable man who exercise it with reputation and honor johnson have argue for some time with a pertinacious gentleman he opponent who have talk in a very puzzling manner happen to say ' i do not understand you sir : ' upon which johnson observe ` sir i have find you a argument but i be not oblige to find you a understanding -lrb- 966 -rrb- ' talk to I of horry walpole -lrb- as horace late earl of orford be often call -lrb- 967 -rrb- -rrb- johnson allow that he get together a great many curious little thing and tell they in a elegant manner -lrb- 968 -rrb- mr walpole think johnson a more amiable character after read he _ letter to mr thrale _ : but never be one of the true admirer of that great man -lrb- 969 -rrb- we may suppose a prejudice conceive if he ever hear johnson 's account to sir george staunton -lrb- 970 -rrb- that when he make the speech in parliament for the _ gentleman 's magazine _ ` he always take care to put sir robert walpole in the wrong and to say every thing he could against the electorate of hanover -lrb- 971 -rrb- ' the celebrated _ heroick epistle _ in which johnson be satyrically introduce have be ascribe both to mr walpole and mr mason one day at mr courtenay 's when a gentleman express he opinion that there be more energy in that poem than could be expect from mr walpole mr warton the late laureat observe ` it may have be write by walpole and _ buckram would _ by mason -lrb- 972 -rrb- ' he disapprove of lord haile for have modernize the language of the ever-memorable john hale of eton -lrb- 973 -rrb- in a edition which he lordship publish of that writer 's work ` a author 's language sir -lrb- say he -rrb- be a characteristical part of he composition and be also characteristical of the age in which he write besides sir when the language be change we be not sure that the sense be the same no sir i be sorry lord haile have do this ' here it may be observe that he frequent use of the expression _ no sir _ be not always to intimate contradiction for he would say so when he be about to enforce a affirmative proposition which have not be deny as in the instance last mention i use to consider it as a kind of flag of defiance as if he have say ` any argument you may offer against this be not just no sir it be not ' it be like falstaff 's ' i deny you major -lrb- 974 -rrb- ' sir joshua reynold have say that he take the altitude of a man 's taste by he story and he wit and of he understanding by the remark which he repeat be always sure that he must be a weak man who quote common thing with a emphasis as if they be oracle johnson agree with he and sir joshua have also observe that the real character of a man be find out by he amusement -- johnson add ` yes sir no man be a hypocrite in he pleasure -lrb- 975 -rrb- ' i have mention johnson 's general aversion to a pun -lrb- 976 -rrb- he once however endure one of mine when we be talk of a numerous company in which he have distinguish himself highly i say ` sir you be a cod surround by smelt be not this enough for you at a time too when you be not _ fishing _ for a compliment ' he laugh at this with a complacent approbation old mr sheridan observe upon my mention it to he ` he like you compliment so well he be willing to take it with _ pun sauce _ ' for my own part i think no innocent species of wit or pleasantry should be suppress and that a good pun may be admit among the smaller excellency of lively conversation have johnson treat at large _ de claris oratoribus _ -lrb- 977 -rrb- he might have give we a admirable work when the duke of bedford attack the ministry as vehemently as he could for have take upon they to extend the time for the importation of corn -lrb- 978 -rrb- lord chatham in he first speech in the house of lord boldly avow himself to be a adviser of that measure ` my colleague -lrb- say he -rrb- as i be confine by indisposition do I the signal honor of come to the bed-side of a sick man to ask he opinion but have they not thus condescend i should have _ take up my bed and walk _ in order to have deliver that opinion at the council-board ' mr langton who be present mention this to johnson who observe ` now sir we see that he take these word as he find they without consider that though the expression in scripture _ take up thy bed and walk _ -lrb- 979 -rrb- strictly suit the instance of the sick man restore to health and strength who would of course be suppose to carry he bed with he it could not be proper in the case of a man who be lie in a state of feebleness and who certainly would not add to the difficulty of move at all that of carry he bed ' when i point out to he in the newspaper one of mr grattan 's animated and glowing speech in favor of the freedom of ireland in which this expression occur -lrb- i know not if accurately take -rrb- : ` we will persevere till there be not one link of the english chain leave to clank upon the rag of the meanest beggar in ireland ' ` nay sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- do not you perceive that _ one _ link can not clank ' mr thrale have publish -lrb- 980 -rrb- as johnson 's a kind of parody or counterpart of a fine poetical passage in one of mr burke 's speech on american taxation it be vigorously but somewhat coarsely execute and i be incline to suppose be not quite correctly exhibit i hope he do not use the word _ ` vile agent ' _ for the american in the house of parliament and if he do so in a extempore effusion i wish the lady have not commit it to write -lrb- 981 -rrb- mr burke uniformly shew johnson the greatest respect and when mr townshend now lord sydney at a period when he be conspicuous in opposition throw out some reflection in parliament upon the grant of a pension to a man of such political principle as johnson mr burke though then of the same party with mr townshend stand warmly forth in defense of he friend to whom he justly observe the pension be grant solely on account of he eminent literary merit i be well assure that mr townshend 's attack upon johnson be the occasion of he ` hitch in a rhyme -lrb- 982 -rrb- ' for that in the original copy of goldsmith 's character of mr burke in he _ retaliation _ another person 's name stand in the couplet where mr townshend be now introduce -lrb- 983 -rrb- : -- ` though fraught with all learn keep -lrb- 984 -rrb- strain he throat to persuade _ tommy townshend _ to lend he a vote ' it may be worth remark among the _ minutiae _ of my collection that johnson be once draw to serve in the militia the trained band of the city of london and that mr rackstrow of the museum in fleet-street be he colonel it may be believe he do not serve in person but the idea with all its circumstance be certainly laughable he upon that occasion provide himself with a musket and with a sword and belt which i have see hang in he closet he be very constant to those whom he once employ if they give he no reason to be displeased when somebody talk of be impose on in the purchase of tea and sugar and such article : ` that will not be the case -lrb- say he -rrb- if you go to a _ stately shop _ as i always do in such a shop it be not worth they while to take a petty advantage ' a author of most anxious and restless vanity be mention ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- there be not a young sapling upon parnassus more severely blow about by every wind of criticism than that poor fellow ' the difference he observe between a well-bred and a ill-bred man be this : ` one immediately attract you liking the other you aversion you love the one

for painting he admire much the manner in which sir joshua reynold treat of he art in he _ discourse to the royal academy _ -lrb- 991 -rrb- he observe one day of a passage in they ' i think i might as well have say this myself : ` and once when mr langton be sit by he he read one of they very eagerly and express himself thus : -- ` very well master reynold very well indeed but it will not be understand ' when i observe to he that painting be so far inferior to poetry that the story or even emblem which it communicate must be previously know and mention as a natural and laughable instance of this that a little miss on see a picture of justice with the scale have exclaim to I ` see there be a woman sell sweetmeat ' he say ` painting sir can illustrate but can not inform ' no man be more ready to make a apology when he have censure unjustly than johnson -lrb- 992 -rrb- when a proof-sheet of one of he work be bring to he he find fault with the mode in which a part of it be arrange

say to he ` mr compositor i ask you pardon mr compositor i ask you pardon again and again ' he generous humanity to the miserable be almost beyond example the follow instance be well attest : -- come home late one night he find a poor woman lie in the street so much exhaust that she could not walk he take she upon he back and carry she to he house where he discover that she be one of those wretched female who have fall into the lowest state of vice poverty and disease instead of harshly upbraid she he have she take care of with all tenderness for a long time at considerable expence till

ingenious and divert cross-reading of the newspaper it be a real name of a ancient roman and clearly expressive of the thing do in this lively conceit -lrb- 996 -rrb- he once in he life be know to have utter what be call a _ bull _ : sir joshua reynold when they be ride together in devonshire complain that he have a very bad horse for that even when go down hill he move slowly step by step ` ay

of considerable eminence -lrb- 998 -rrb- have engross a good share of the conversation in the company of johnson and have say nothing but what be trifling and insignificant johnson when he be go

a good number of particulars concern he most of which be to be find in the department of apothegm & c in the collection of _ johnson 's work _ -lrb- 1001 -rrb- but he have be please to favor I with the follow which be original : -- ` one evening previous to the trial of barrettus -lrb- 1002 -rrb- a consultation of he friend be hold at the house of mr cox the solicitor in southampton-buildings chancery-lane among other present be mr burke and dr johnson who differ in sentiment concern the tendency of some part of the defense the prisoner be to make when the meeting be over mr steeven

have no audience -lrb- 1003 -rrb- ` dr johnson once assume a character in which perhaps even mr boswell never see he he curiosity have be excite by the praise bestow on the celebrated torré 's firework at marybone-garden he desire mr steeven to accompany he thither the evening have prove showery and soon after the few people present be assemble publick notice be give that the conductor to the wheel sun star & c be so thoroughly water-soaked that it be impossible any part of the exhibition should be make this be a mere excuse -lrb- say the doctor -rrb- to save they cracker for a more profitable company let we but hold up we stick and threaten to break those color lamp that surround the orchestra and we shall soon have we wish gratify the core of the firework can not be injure let the different piece be touch in they respective center and they will do they office as well as ever some young man who overhear he immediately begin the violence he have recommend and a attempt be speedily make to fire some of the wheel which appear to have receive the smallest damage but to little purpose be they light for most of they completely fail the author of _ the rambler _ however may be consider on this occasion as the ringleader of a successful riot though not as a skilful pyrotechnist ' ` it have be suppose that dr johnson so far as fashion be concern be careless of he appearance in publick but this be not altogether true as the follow slight instance may show : -- goldsmith 's last comedy be to be represent during some court-mourning -lrb- 1004 -rrb- : and mr steeven appoint to call on dr johnson and carry he to the tavern where he be to dine with other of the poet 's friend the doctor be ready dress but in color cloath yet be tell that he would find every one else in black receive the intelligence with a profusion of thanks hasten to change he attire all the while repeat he gratitude for the information that have save he from a appearance so improper

that he be not court by all the great and all the eminent person of he time it ought fairly to be consider that no man of humble birth who live entirely by literature in short no author by profession

to whom i above all other think i should apply to negociate this business be the lord chancellor -lrb- 1010 -rrb- because i know that he highly value johnson and that johnson highly value he lordship so that it be no degradation of my illustrious friend to solicit for he the favor of such a man i have mention -lrb- 1011 -rrb- what johnson say of he to I when he be at the bar and after he lordship be advance to the seal -lrb- 1012 -rrb- he say of he ' i would prepare myself for no man in england but lord thurlow when i be to meet with he i should wish to know a day before -lrb- 1013 -rrb- ' how he would have prepare himself i can not conjecture would he have select certain topick and consider they in every view so as to be in readiness to argue they at all point and what may we suppose those topick to have be i once start the curious enquiry to the great man who be the subject of this compliment : he smile but do not pursue it i first consult with sir joshua reynold who perfectly coincide in opinion with I and i therefore though personally very little known to he lordship write to he -lrb- 1014 -rrb- state the case and request he good office for dr johnson i mention that i be oblige to set out for scotland early in the follow week so that if he lordship should have any command for I as to this pious negociation he would be please to send they before that time otherwise sir joshua reynold would give all attention to it this application be make not only without any suggestion on the part of johnson himself but be utterly unknown to he nor have he the smallest suspicion of it any insinuation therefore which since he death have be throw out as if he have stoop to ask what be superfluous be without any foundation but have he ask it it would not have be superfluous for though the money he have save prove to be more than he friend imagine or than i believe he himself in he carelessness concern worldly matter know it to be have he travel upon the continent a augmentation of he income would by no means have be unnecessary on Wednesday June 23 i visit he in the morning after have be present at the shocking sight of fifteen man execute before newgate -lrb- 1015 -rrb- i say to he i be sure that human life be not machinery that be to say a chain of fatality plan and direct by the supreme be as it have in it so much wickedness and misery so many instance of both as that by which my mind be now cloud be it machinery it would be better than it be in these respects though less noble as not be a system of moral government he agree with I now as he always do -lrb- 1016 -rrb- upon the great question of the liberty of the human will which have be in all age perplex with so much sophistry ` but sir as to the doctrine of necessity no man believe it if a man should give I argument that i do not see though i could not answer they should i believe that i do not see ' it will be observe that johnson at all time make the just distinction between doctrine _ contrary _ to reason and doctrine _ above _ reason talking of the religious discipline proper for unhappy convict he say ` sir one of we regular clergy will probably not impress they mind sufficiently : they should be attend by a methodist preacher -lrb- 1017 -rrb- or a popish priest ' let I however observe in justice to the reverend mr vilette who have be ordinary of newgate for no less than eighteen year in the course of which he have attend many hundred of wretched criminal that he earnest and humane exhortation have be very effectual he extraordinary diligence be highly praiseworthy and merit a distinguished reward -lrb- 1018 -rrb- on Thursday June 24 i dine with he at mr dilly 's where be the rev mr -lrb- now dr -rrb- knox master of tunbridge-school mr smith vicar of southill dr beattie mr pinkerton author of various literary performance and the rev dr mayo at my desire old mr sheridan be invite as i be earnest to have johnson and he bring together again by chance that a reconciliation might be effect mr sheridan happen to come early and have learn that dr johnson be to be there go away -lrb- 1019 -rrb- so i find with sincere regret that my friendly intention be hopeless i recollect nothing that pass this day except johnson 's quickness who when dr beattie observe as something remarkable which have happen to he that he have chance to see both no 1 and no 1000 of the hackney-coach the first and the last ` why sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- there be a equal chance for one 's see those two number as any other two ' he be clearly right yet the see of the two extreme each of which be in some degree more conspicuous than the rest could not but strike one in a stronger manner than the sight of any other two number though i have neglect to preserve he conversation it be perhaps at this interview that dr knox form the notion of it which he have exhibit in he _ winter evening _ -lrb- 1020 -rrb- on Friday June 25 i dine with he at general paolus 's where he say in one of he letter to mr thrale ' i love to dine -lrb- 1021 -rrb- ' there be a variety of dish much to he taste of all which he seem to I to eat so much that i be afraid he might be hurt by it -lrb- 1022 -rrb- and i whisper to the general my fear and beg he might not press he ` alas -lrb- say the general -rrb- see how very ill he look he can live but a very short time would you refuse any slight gratification to a man under sentence of death there be a humane custom in italy by which person in that melancholy situation be indulge with have whatever they like best to eat and drink even with expensive delicacy ' i shew he some verse on lichfield by miss seward which i have that day receive from she and have the pleasure to hear he approve of they he confirm to I the truth of a high compliment which i have be tell he have pay to that lady when she mention to he _ the colombiade _ a epick poem by madame du boccage -lrb- 1023 -rrb- : -- ` madam there be not any thing equal to you description of the sea round the north pole in you ode on the death of captain cook -lrb- 1024 -rrb- ' on Sunday June 27 i find he rather better i mention to he a young man who be go to jamaica with he wife and child in expectation of be provide for by two of she brother settle in that island one a clergyman and the other a physician johnson ` it be a wild scheme sir unless he have a positive and deliberate invitation there be a poor girl who use to come about I who have a cousin in barbado that in a letter to she express a wish she should come out to that island and expatiate on the comfort and happiness of she situation the poor girl go out : she cousin be much surprised and ask she how she could think of come because -lrb- say she -rrb- you invite I not i answer the cousin the letter be then produce i see it be true -lrb- say she -rrb- that i do invite you : but i do not think you would come they lodge she in a out-house where she pass she time miserably and as soon as she have a opportunity she return to england always tell this when you hear of people go abroad to relation upon a notion of be well receive in the case which you mention it be probable the clergyman spend all he get and the physician do not know how much he be to get ' we this day dine at sir joshua reynold 's with general paolus lord eliot -lrb- formerly mr eliot of port eliot -rrb- dr beattie and some other company talking of lord chesterfield -- johnson ` he manner be exquisitely elegant -lrb- 1025 -rrb- and he have more knowledge than i expect ' boswell ` do you find sir he conversation to be of a superior style ' johnson ` sir in the conversation which i have with he i have the best right to superiority for it be upon philology and literature ' lord eliot who have travel at the same time with mr stanhope -lrb- 1026 -rrb- lord chesterfield 's natural son justly observe that it be strange that a man who shew he have so much affection for he son as lord chesterfield do by write so many long and anxious letter to he almost all of they when he be secretary of state -lrb- 1027 -rrb- which certainly be a proof of great goodness of disposition should endeavor to make he son a rascal he lordship tell we that foote have intend to bring on the stage a father who have thus tutor he son and to shew the son a honest man to every one else but practise he father 's maxim upon he and cheat he -lrb- 1028 -rrb- johnson ' i be much pleased with this design but i think there be no occasion to make the son honest at all no he should be a consummate rogue : the contrast between honesty and knavery would be the stronger it should be contrived so that the father should be the only sufferer by the son 's villainy and thus there would be poetical justice ' he put lord eliot in mind of dr walter harte -lrb- 1029 -rrb- ' i know -lrb- say he -rrb- harte be you lordship 's tutor and he be also tutor to the peterborough family pray my lord do you recollect any particulars that he tell you of lord peterborough he be a favorite of mine and be not enough know he character have be only ventilate in party pamphlet -lrb- 1030 -rrb- ' lord eliot say if dr johnson would be so good as to ask he any question he would tell what he could recollect accordingly some thing be mention ` but -lrb- say he lordship -rrb- the best account of lord peterborough that i have happen to meet with be in _ captain carleton 's memoirs _ carleton be descend of a ancestor who have distinguish himself at the siege of derry -lrb- 1031 -rrb- he be a officer and what be rare at that time have some knowledge of engineering -lrb- 1032 -rrb- ' johnson say he have never hear of the book lord eliot have it at port eliot but after a good deal of enquiry procure a copy in london and send it to johnson who tell sir joshua reynold that he be go to bed when it come but be so much pleased with it that he sit up till he have read it through -lrb- 1033 -rrb- and find in it such a air of truth that he could not doubt of its authenticity -lrb- 1034 -rrb- add with a smile -lrb- in allusion to lord eliot 's have recently be raise to the peerage -rrb- ' i do not think a _ young lord _ could have mention to I a book in the english history that be not know to I -lrb- 1035 -rrb- ' a addition to we company come after we go up to the drawing-room dr johnson seem to rise in spirit as he audience increase he say ` he wish lord orford 's picture -lrb- 1036 -rrb- and sir ashton lever 's museum -lrb- 1037 -rrb- might be purchase by the publick because both the money and the picture and the curiosity would remain in the country whereas if they be sell into another kingdom the nation would indeed get some money but would lose the picture and curiosity which it would be desirable we should have for improvement in taste and natural history the only question be as the nation be much in want of money whether it would not be better to take a large price from a foreign state ' he enter upon a curious discussion of the difference between intuition and sagacity one be immediate in its effect the other require a circuitous process one he observe be the _ eye _ of the mind the other the _ nose _ of the mind -lrb- 1038 -rrb- a young gentleman -lrb- 1039 -rrb- present take up the argument against he and maintain that no man ever think of the _ nose of the mind _ not advert that though that figurative sense seem strange to we as very unusual it be truly not more forced than hamlet 's ` in my _ mind 's eye _ horatio -lrb- 1040 -rrb- ' he persist much too long and appear to johnson as put himself forward as he antagonist with too much presumption upon which he call to he in a loud tone ` what be it you be contend for if you _ be _ contend ' and afterwards imagine that the gentleman retort upon he with a kind of smart drollery he say ` mr -- it do not become you to talk so to I besides ridicule be not you talent you have _ there _ neither intuition nor sagacity ' the gentleman protest that he have intend no improper freedom but have the greatest respect for dr johnson after a short pause during which we be somewhat uneasy -- johnson ` give I you hand sir you be too tedious and i be too short ' mr -- ` sir i be honor by you attention in any way ' johnson ` come sir let 's have no more of it we offend one another by we contention let we not offend the company by we compliment ' he now say ` he wish much to go to italy and that he dread pass the winter in england ' i say nothing but enjoy a secret satisfaction in think that i have take the most effectual measure to make such a scheme practicable on Monday June 28 i have the honor to receive from the lord chancellor the follow letter : -- ` to jame boswell esq sir i should have answer you letter immediately if -lrb- be much engage when i receive it -rrb- i have not put it in my pocket and forget to open it till this morning i be much oblige to you for the suggestion and i will adopt and press it as far as i can the best argument i be sure and i hope it be not likely to fail be dr johnson 's merit but it will be necessary if i should be so unfortunate as to miss see you to converse with sir joshua on the sum it will be proper to ask -- it short upon the means of set he out it would be a reflection on we all if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of he health yours & c thurlow ' this letter give I a very high satisfaction i next day go and shew it to sir joshua reynold who be exceedingly please with it he think that i should now communicate the negociation to dr johnson who might afterwards complain if the attention with which he have be honor should be too long conceal from he i intend to set out for scotland next morning but sir joshua cordially insist that i should stay another day that johnson and i might dine with he that we three might talk of he italian tour and as sir joshua express himself ` have it all out ' i hasten to johnson and be tell by he that he be rather better to-day boswell ' i be very anxious about you sir and particularly that you should go to italy for the winter which i believe be you own wish ' johnson ` it be sir ' boswell ` you have no objection i presume but the money it would require ' johnson ` why no sir ' upon which i give he a particular account of what have be do and read to he the lord chancellor 's letter he listen with much attention then warmly say ` this be take prodigious pain about a man ' ' o sir -lrb- say i with most sincere affection -rrb- you friend would do every thing for you ' he pause grow more and more agitate till tear start into he eye and he exclaim with fervent emotion ` god bless you all ' i be so affect that i also shed tear after a short silence he renew and extend he grateful benediction ` god bless you all for jesus christ 's sake ' we both remain for some time unable to speak he rise suddenly and quit the room quite melt in tenderness he staid but a short time till he have recover he firmness soon after he return i leave he have first engage he to dine at sir joshua reynold 's next day i never be again under that roof which i have so long reverence on Wednesday June 30 the friendly confidential dinner with sir joshua reynold take place no other company be present have i know that this be the last time that i should enjoy in this world the conversation of a friend whom i so much respect and from whom i derive so much instruction and entertainment i should have be deeply affect when i now look back to it i be vex that a single word should have be forget both sir joshua and i be so sanguine in we expectation that we expatiate with confidence on the liberal provision which we be sure would be make for he conjecture whether munificence would be display in one large donation or in a ample increase of he pension he himself catch so much of we enthusiasm as to allow himself to suppose it not impossible that we hope might in one way or other be realize he say that he would rather have he pension double than a grant of a thousand pound ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- though probably i may not live to receive as much as a thousand pound a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the remainder of he life in splendor how long soever it might be ' consider what a moderate proportion a income of six hundred pound a year bear to innumerable fortune in this country it be worthy of remark that a man so truly great should think it splendor -lrb- 1041 -rrb- as a instance of extraordinary liberality of friendship he tell we that dr brocklesby have upon this occasion offer he a hundred a year for he life -lrb- 1042 -rrb- a grateful tear start into he eye as he speak this in a faultering tone sir joshua and i endeavor to flatter he imagination with agreeable prospects of happiness in italy ` nay -lrb- say he -rrb- i must not expect much of that when a man go to italy merely to feel how he breathe the air he can enjoy very little ' we conversation turn upon living in the country which johnson whose melancholy mind require the dissipation of quick successive variety have habituate himself to consider as a kind of mental imprisonment -lrb- 1043 -rrb- ` yet sir -lrb- say i -rrb- there be many people who be content to live in the country ' johnson ` sir it be in the intellectual world as in the physical world we be tell by natural philosopher that a body be at rest in the place that be fit for it they who be content to live in the country be _ fit _ for the country ' talking of various enjoyment i argue that a refinement of taste be a disadvantage as they who have attain to it must be seldomer pleased than those who have no nice discrimination and be therefore satisfy with every thing that come in they way johnson ` nay sir that be a paltry notion endeavor to be as perfect as you can in every respect ' i accompany he in sir joshua reynold 's coach to the entry of bolt-court he ask I whether i would not go with he to he house i decline it from a apprehension that my spirit would sink we bid adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage when he have get down upon the foot-pavement he call out ` fare you well ' and without look back spring away with a kind of pathetick briskness if i may use that expression which seem to indicate a struggle to conceal uneasiness and impressed I with a foreboding of we long long separation i remain one day more in town to have the chance of talk over my negociation with the lord chancellor but the multiplicity of he lordship 's important engagement do not allow of it so i leave the management of the business in the hand of sir joshua reynold soon after this time dr johnson have the mortification of be inform by mr thrale that ` what she suppose he never believe -lrb- 1044 -rrb- ' be true namely that she be actually go to marry signor piozzus a italian musick-master -lrb- 1045 -rrb- he endeavor to prevent it but in vain if she would publish the whole of the correspondence that pass between dr johnson and she on the subject we should have a full view of he real sentiment as it be we judgement must be biass by that characteristick specimen which sir john hawkin have give we : ` poor thrale i think that either she virtue or she vice would have restrain she from such a marriage she be now become a subject for she enemy to exult over and for she friend if she have any leave to forget or pity -lrb- 1046 -rrb- ' it must be admit that johnson derive a considerable portion of happiness from the comfort and elegancy which he enjoy in mr thrale 's family -lrb- 1047 -rrb- but mr thrale assure we he be indebted for these to she husband alone who certainly respect he sincerely she word be -- ' _ veneration for he virtue reverence for he talent _ delight _ in he conversation and _ habitual endurance of a yoke my husband first put upon I _ and of which he contentedly bear he share for sixteen or seventeen year make I go on so long with _ mr johnson _ but the perpetual confinement i will own to have be _ terrifying _ in the first year of we friendship and _ irksome _ in the last nor could i pretend to support _ it without help when my coadjutor be no more _ -lrb- 1048 -rrb- ' alas how different be this from the declaration which i have hear mr thrale make in he life-time without a single murmur against any peculiarity or against any one circumstance which attend they intimacy -lrb- 1049 -rrb- as a sincere friend of the great man whose _ life _ i be write i think it necessary to guard my reader against the mistaken notion of dr johnson 's character which this lady 's _ anecdote _ of he suggest for from the very nature and form of she book ` it lend deception lighter wing to fly ' -lrb- 1050 -rrb- ` let it be remember -lrb- say a eminent critick -lrb- 1051 -rrb- -rrb- that she have comprise in a small volume all that she could recollect of dr johnson in _ twenty year _ during which period doubtless some severe thing be say by he and they who read the book in _ two hour _ naturally enough suppose that he whole conversation be of this complexion but the fact be i have be often in he company and never _ once _ hear he say a severe thing to any one and many other can attest the same -lrb- 1052 -rrb- when he do say a severe thing it be generally extort by ignorance pretend to knowledge or by extreme vanity or affectation ` two instance of inaccuracy -lrb- add he -rrb- be peculiarly worthy of notice : ` it be say _ that natural -lrb- 1053 -rrb- roughness of he manner so often mention would notwithstanding the regularity of he notion burst through they all from time to time and he once bid a very celebrated lady who praise he with too much zeal perhaps or perhaps too strong a emphasis -lrb- which always offend he -rrb- consider what she flattery be worth before she choak he with it _ ` now let the genuine anecdote be contrast with this the person thus represent as be harshly treat though a very celebrated lady -lrb- 1054 -rrb- be _ then _ just come to london from a obscure situation in the country at sir joshua reynold 's one evening she meet dr johnson she very soon begin to pay she court to he in the most fulsome strain spare I i beseech you dear madam be he reply she still _ lay it on _ pray madam let we have no more of this he rejoin not pay any attention to these warning she continue still she eulogy at length provoke by this indelicate and vain obtrusion of compliment he exclaim dearest lady consider with yourself what you flattery be worth before you bestow it so freely -lrb- 1055 -rrb- ` how different do this story appear when accompany with all these circumstance which really belong to it but which mr thrale either do not know or have suppress ` she say in another place -lrb- 1056 -rrb- _ one gentleman however who dine at a nobleman 's house in he company and that of _ mr thrale _ to whom i be oblige for the anecdote be willing to enter the list in defense of _ king william 's _ character and have oppose and contradict _ johnson _ two or three time petulantly enough the master of the house begin to feel uneasy and expect disagreeable consequence to avoid which he say loud enough for the doctor to hear -- ` we friend here have no meaning now in all this except just to relate at club to-morrow how he teize _ johnson _ at dinner to-day this be all to do himself _ honor ' _ no upon my word -lrb- reply the other ' -rrb- i see no _ honor _ in it whatever you may do well sir -lrb- return _ mr johnson _ sternly -rrb- if you do not _ see _ the honor i be sure i _ feel _ the disgrace _ ` this be all sophisticated mr thrale be _ not _ in the company though he might have relate the story to mr thrale a friend from whom i have the story be present and it be _ not _ at the house of a nobleman on the observation be make by the master of the house on a gentleman 's contradict johnson that he have talk for the honor & c the gentleman mutter in a low voice i see no honor in it and dr johnson say nothing : so all the rest -lrb- though _ bien trouvée _ -rrb- be mere garnish ' i have have occasion several time in the course of this work to point out the incorrectness of mr thrale as to particulars which consist with my own knowledge -lrb- 1057 -rrb- but indeed she have in flippant term enough express she disapprobation of that anxious desire of authenticity which prompt a person who be to record conversation to write they down _ at the moment _ -lrb- 1058 -rrb- unquestionably if they be to be record at all the sooner it be do the better this lady herself say -lrb- 1059 -rrb- -- _ ` to recollect however and to repeat the saying of _ dr johnson _ be almost all that can be do by the writer of he life as he life at least since my acquaintance with he consist in little else than talk when he be not -lrb- absolutely -rrb- employ in some serious piece of work ' _ she boast of she have keep a common-place book -lrb- 1060 -rrb- and we find she note at one time or other in a very lively manner specimen of the conversation of dr johnson and of those who talk with he but have she do it recently they probably would have be less erroneous and we should have be relieve from those disagreeable doubt of they authenticity with which we must now peruse they she say of he -lrb- 1061 -rrb- -- _ ` he be the most charitable of mortal without be what we call a _ active friend _ admirable at give counsel no man see he way so clearly but he _ would not stir a finger _ for the assistance of those to whom he be willing enough to give advice ' _ and again on the same page _ ` if you want a slight favor you must apply to people of other disposition for _ not a step would johnson move _ to obtain a man a vote in a society to repay a compliment which might be useful or please to write a letter of request & c or to obtain a hundred pound a year more for a friend who perhaps have already two or three no force could urge he to diligence no importunity could conquer he resolution to stand still ' _ it be amazing that one who have such opportunity of know dr johnson should appear so little acquaint with he real character i be sorry this lady do not advert that she herself contradict the assertion of he be obstinately defective in the _ petite morale _ in the little endearing charity of social life in confer smaller favor for she say -lrb- 1062 -rrb- -- ` dr johnson _ be liberal enough in grant literary assistance to other i think and innumerable be the preface sermon lecture and dedication which he use to make for people who beg of he _ ' i be certain that a _ more active friend _ have rarely be find in any age -lrb- 1063 -rrb- this work which i fondly hope will rescue he memory from obloquy contain a thousand instance of he benevolent exertion in almost every way that can be conceive and particularly in employ he pen with a generous readiness for those to whom its aid could be useful indeed he obliging activity in do little office of kindness both by letter and personal application be one of the most remarkable feature in he character and for the truth of this i can appeal to a number of he respectable friend : sir joshua reynold mr langton mr hamilton mr burke mr windham mr malone the bishop of dromore sir william scott sir robert chamber and can mr thrale forget the advertisement which he write for she husband at the time of he election contest -lrb- 1064 -rrb- the epitaph on he and she mother -lrb- 1065 -rrb- the playful and even trifling verse for the amusement of she and she daughter he correspond with she child -lrb- 1066 -rrb- and enter into they minute concern -lrb- 1067 -rrb- which shew he in the most amiable light she relate -lrb- 1068 -rrb- -- that mr ch-lm-ley unexpectedly ride up to mr thrale 's carriage in which mr thrale and she and dr johnson be travel that he pay they all he proper compliment but observe that dr johnson who be read do not see he _ ` tapt he gently on the shoulder ` tis _ mr ch-lm-ley _ say my husband well sir -- and what if it be _ mr ch-lm-ley _ say the other sternly just lift he eye a moment from he book and return to it again with renew avidity ' _ this surely convey a notion of johnson as if he have be grossly rude to mr cholmondeley -lrb- 1069 -rrb- a gentleman whom he always love and esteem if therefore there be a absolute necessity for mention the story at all it might have be think that she tenderness for dr johnson 's character would have dispose she to state any thing that could soften it why then be there a total silence as to what mr cholmondeley tell she -- that johnson who have know he from he earliest year have be make sensible of what have doubtless a strange appearance take occasion when he afterwards meet he to make a very courteous and kind apology there be another little circumstance which i can not but remark she book be publish in 1785 she have then in she possession a letter from dr johnson date in 1777 -lrb- 1070 -rrb- which begin thus : -- ` cholmondeley 's story shock I if it be true which i can hardly think for i be utterly unconscious of it : i be very sorry and very much ashamed -lrb- 1071 -rrb- ' why then publish the anecdote or if she do why not add the circumstance with which she be well acquaint in he social intercourse she thus describe he -lrb- 1072 -rrb- : -- ' _ ever muse till he be call out to converse and converse till the fatigue of he friend or the promptitude of he own temper to take offence consign he back again to silent meditation _ ' yet in the same book -lrb- 1073 -rrb- she tell we -- ' _ he be however seldom incline to be silent when any moral or literary question be start and it be on such occasion that like the sage in _ rassela -lrb- 1074 -rrb- _ he speak and attention watch he lip he reason and conviction close he period _ ' he conversation indeed be so far from ever _ fatiguing _ he friend that they regret when it be interrupted or cease and could exclaim in milton 's language -- ` with thee conversing i forget all time -lrb- 1075 -rrb- ' i certainly then do not claim too much in behalf of my illustrious friend in say that however smart and entertaining mr thrale 's _ anecdote _ be they must not be hold as good evidence against he for wherever a instance of harshness and severity be tell i beg leave to doubt its perfect authenticity for though there may have be _ some _ foundation for it yet like that of he reproof to the ` very celebrated lady ' it may be so exhibit in the narration as to be very unlike the real fact the evident tendency of the follow anecdote -lrb- 1076 -rrb- be to represent dr johnson as extremely deficient in affection tenderness or even common civility : -- _ ` when i one day lament the loss of a first cousin kill in _ america -- _ prithee my dear -lrb- say he -rrb- have do with cant how would the world be the worse for it i may ask if all you relation be at once spit like lark and roasted for _ presto 's _ supper _ -- presto -lrb- 1077 -rrb- _ be the dog that lay under the table while we talk _ ' i suspect this too of exaggeration and distortion i allow that he make she a angry speech but let the circumstance fairly appear as tell by mr barettus who be present : -- ` mr thrale while sup very heartily upon lark lay down she knife and fork and abruptly exclaim o my dear mr johnson do you know what have happen the last letter from abroad have bring we a account that we poor cousin 's head be take off by a cannon-ball johnson who be shock both at the fact and she light unfeeling manner of mention it reply madam it would give _ you _ very little concern if all you relation be spit like those lark and drest for presto 's supper -lrb- 1078 -rrb- ' it be with concern that i find myself oblige to animadvert on the inaccuracy of mr piozzus 's _ anecdote _ and perhaps i may be think to have dwell too long upon she little collection but as from johnson 's long residence under mr thrale 's roof and he intimacy with she the account which she have give of he may have make a unfavourable and unjust impression my duty as a faithful biographer have oblige I reluctantly to perform this unpleasing task have leave the _ pious negotiation _ as i call it in the best hand i shall here insert what relate to it johnson write to sir joshua reynold on July 6 as follow : -- ' i be go i hope in a few day to try the air of derbyshire but hope to see you before i go let I however mention to you what i have much at heart if the chancellor should continue he attention to mr boswell 's request and confer with you on the means of relieve my languid state i be very desirous to avoid the appearance of ask money upon false pretence i desire you to represent to he lordship what as soon as it be suggest he will perceive to be reasonable -- that if i grow much worse i shall be afraid to leave my physician to suffer the inconvenience of travel and pine in the solitude of a foreign country that

motion of this grateful alleviation i know not the cause nor dare depend upon its continuance but while it last i endeavor to enjoy it and be desirous of communicate while it last my pleasure to my friend hitherto dear sir i have write before the post which stay in this town but a little while bring I you letter mr davies seem to have represent my little tendency to recovery in term too splendid

-rrb- i could not in any case have approve such publick violence of resentment and should have consider any who encourage it as rather seek sport for themselves than honor for you resentment gratify he who intend a injury and pain he unjustly who do not intend it but all this be now superfluous i still continue by god 's mercy to mend my breath be easier my night be quieter and my leg be less in bulk and stronger in use i have however yet a great deal to overcome before i can yet attain even a old man 's health write do write to I now and then we be now old acquaintance and perhaps few people have live so much and so long together with less cause of complaint on either side the retrospection of this be very pleasant and i hope we shall never think on each other with less kindness ' sept 9 ' i could not answer you letter -lrb- 1131 -rrb- before this day because i go on the sixth to chatsworth and do not come back till the post be go many word i hope be not necessary between you and I to convince you what gratitude be excite in my heart by the chancellor 's liberality and you kind office i do not indeed expect that what be ask by the chancellor would have be refuse -lrb- 1132 -rrb- but since it have we will not tell that any thing have be ask i have enclose a letter to the chancellor which when you have read it you will be please to seal with a head or other general seal and convey it to he have i send it directly to he i should have seem to overlook the favor of you intervention my last letter tell you of my advance in health which i think in the whole still continue of the hydropick tumor there be now very little appearance the asthma be much less troublesome and seem to remit something day after day i do not despair of support a english winter at chatsworth i meet young mr burke who lead I very commodiously into conversation with the duke and duchess we have a very good morning the dinner be publick -lrb- 1133 -rrb- ' sept 18 ' i flattered myself that this week would have give I a letter from you but none have come write to I now and then but direct you next to lichfield i think and i hope be sure that i still grow better i have sometimes good night but be still in my leg weak but so much mend that i go to lichfield in hope of be able to pay my visit on foot for there be no coach i have three letter this day all about the balloon i could have be content with one do not write about the balloon whatever else you may think proper to say -lrb- 1134 -rrb- ' October 2 ' i be always proud of you approbation and therefore be much pleased that you like my letter when you copy it -lrb- 1135 -rrb- you invade the chancellor 's right rather than mine the refusal i do not expect but i have never think much about it for i doubt whether the chancellor have so much tenderness for I as to ask he be keeper of the king 's conscience ought not to be suppose capable of a improper petition all be not gold that glitter as we have often be tell and the adage be verify in you place -lrb- 1136 -rrb- and my favor but if what happen do not make we richer we must bid it welcome if it make we wiser i do not at present grow better nor much worse my hope however be somewhat abate and a very great loss be the loss of hope but i struggle on as i can ' to mr john nichol : -- lichfield oct 20 ` when you be here you be please as i be tell to think my absence a inconvenience i should certainly have be very glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquity any information about my native place of which however i know not much and have reason to believe that not much be know though i have not give you any amusement i have receive amusement from you at ashbourne where i have very little company i have the luck to borrow _ mr bowyer 's life _ -lrb- 1137 -rrb- a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of he old friend i think that i could now and then have tell you some hint -lrb- 1138 -rrb- worth you notice and perhaps we may talk a life over i hope we shall be much together you must now be to I what you be before and what dear mr allen be besides he be take unexpectedly away but i think he be a very good man i have make little progress in recovery i be very weak and very sleepless but i live on and hope -lrb- 1139 -rrb- ' this various mass of correspondence which i have thus bring together be valuable both as a addition to the store which the publick already have of johnson 's writings and as exhibit a genuine and noble specimen of vigor and vivacity of mind which neither age nor sickness could impair or diminish it may be observe that he write in every way whether for the publick or privately to he friend be by fit and start for we see frequently that many letter be write on the same day when he have once overcome he aversion to begin he be i suppose desirous to go on in order to relieve he mind from the uneasy reflection of delay what he ought to do -lrb- 1140 -rrb- while in the country notwithstanding the accumulation of illness which he endure he mind do not lose its power he translate a ode of horace -lrb- 1141 -rrb- which be print in he _ work _ and compose several prayer i shall insert one of they which be so wise and energetick so philosophical and so pious that i doubt not of its afford consolation to many a sincere christian when in a state of mind to which i believe the best be sometimes liable -lrb- 1142 -rrb- and here i be enable fully to refute a very unjust reflection by sir john hawkin -lrb- 1143 -rrb- both against dr johnson and he faithful servant mr franci barber -lrb- 1144 -rrb- as if both of they have be guilty of culpable neglect towards a person of the name of heely whom sir john choose to call a _ relation _ of dr johnson 's the fact be that mr heely be not he relation he have indeed be marry to one of he cousin but she have die without have child and he have marry another woman so that even the slight connection which there once have be by _ alliance _ be dissolve dr johnson who have shewn very great liberality to this man while he first wife be alive as have appear in a former part of this work -lrb- 1145 -rrb- be humane and charitable enough to continue he bounty to he occasionally but surely there be no strong call of duty upon he or upon he legatee to do more the follow letter obligingly communicate to I by mr andrew strahan will confirm what i have state : -- ` to mr heely no 5 in pye-street westminster ` sir ` as necessity oblige you to call so soon again upon I you should at least have tell the smallest sum that will supply you present want you can not suppose that i have much to spare two guinea be as much as you ought to be behind with you creditor if you wait on mr strahan in new-street fetter-lane or in he absence on mr andrew strahan shew this by which they be entreat to advance you two guinea and to keep this as a voucher ' i be sir ` you humble servant ` sam johnson ' ` ashbourne aug 12 1784 ' indeed it be very necessary to keep in mind that sir john hawkin have unaccountably view johnson 's character and conduct in almost every particular with a unhappy prejudice -lrb- 1146 -rrb- we now behold johnson for the last time in he native city for which he ever retain a warm affection and which by a sudden apostrophe under the word _ lich _ -lrb- 1147 -rrb- he introduce with reverence into he immortal work the english dictionary : -- _ salve magna paren -lrb- 1148 -rrb- while here he feel a revival of all the tenderness of filial affection a instance of which appear in he order the grave-stone and inscription over elizabeth blaney -lrb- 1149 -rrb- to be substantially and carefully renew to mr henry white -lrb- 1150 -rrb- a young clergyman with whom he now form a intimacy so as to talk to he with great freedom he mention that he could not in general accuse himself of have be a undutiful son ` once indeed -lrb- say he -rrb- i be disobedient i refuse to attend my father to uttoxeter-market pride be the source of that refusal and the remembrance of it be painful a few year ago i desire to atone for this fault i go to uttoxeter in very bad weather and stand for a considerable time barehead in the rain on the spot where my father 's stall use to stand in contrition i stand and i hope the penance be expiatory -lrb- 1151 -rrb- ' ' i tell he -lrb- say miss seward -rrb- in one of my latest visit to he of a wonderful learn pig which i have see at nottingham and which do all that we have observe exhibit by dog and horse the subject amuse he ` then -lrb- say he -rrb- the pig be a race unjustly calumniate _ pig _ have it seem not be want to _ man _ but _ man _ to _ pig _ we do not allow _ time _ for he education we kill he at a year old ' mr henry white who be present observe that if this instance have happen in or before pope 's time he would not have be justify in instance the swine as the lowest degree of grovel instinct -lrb- 1152 -rrb- dr johnson seem pleased with the observation while the person who make it proceed to remark that great torture must have be employ ere the indocility of the animal could have be subdue ` certainly -lrb- say the doctor -rrb- but -lrb- turn to I -rrb- how old be you pig ' i tell he three year old ` then -lrb- say he -rrb- the pig have no cause to complain he would have be kill the first year if he have not be _ educate _ and protracted existence be a good recompence for very considerable degree of torture -lrb- 1153 -rrb- ' as johnson have now very faint hope of recovery and as mr thrale be no longer devote to he it might have be suppose that he would naturally have choose to remain in the comfortable house of he beloved wife 's daughter and end he life where he begin it but there be in he a animated and lofty spirit -lrb- 1154 -rrb- and however complicated disease might depress ordinary mortal all who see he behold and acknowledge the _ invictum animum catoni _ -lrb- 1155 -rrb- such be he intellectual ardor even at this time that he say to one friend ` sir i look upon every day to be lose in which i do not make a new acquaintance -lrb- 1156 -rrb- ' and to another when talk of he illness ' i will be conquer i will not capitulate -lrb- 1157 -rrb- ' and such be he love of london so high a relish have he of its magnificent extent and variety of intellectual entertainment that he languish when absent from it he mind have become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoy the metropolis and therefore although at lichfield surround with friend who love and revere he and for whom he have a very sincere affection he still find that such conversation as london afford could be find no where else these feeling join probably to some flattering hope of aid from the eminent physician and surgeon in london who kindly and generously attend he without accept fee make he resolve to return to the capital from lichfield he come to birmingham where he pass a few day with he worthy old schoolfellow mr hector who thus write to I : -- ` he be very solicitous with I to recollect some of we most early transaction and transmit they to he for i perceive nothing give he greater pleasure than call to mind those day of we innocence i comply with he request and he only receive they a few day before he death i have transcribe for you inspection exactly the minute i write to he ' this paper have be find in he repository after he death sir john hawkin have insert it entire -lrb- 1158 -rrb- and i have make occasional use of it and other communication from mr hector -lrb- 1159 -rrb- in the course of this work i have both visit and correspond with he since dr johnson 's death and by my inquiry concern a great variety of particulars have obtain additional information i follow the same mode with the reverend dr taylor in whose presence i write down a good deal of what he could tell and he at my request sign he name to give it authenticity it be very rare to find any person who be able to give a distinct account of the life even of one whom he have know intimately without question be put to they my friend dr kippi -lrb- 1160 -rrb- have tell I that on this account it be a practice with he to draw out a biographical catechism johnson then proceed to oxford where he be again kindly receive by dr adam -lrb- 1161 -rrb- who be please to give I the follow account in one of he letter -lrb- feb 17th 1785 -rrb- : -- ` he last visit be i believe to my house which he leave after a stay of four or five day we have much serious talk together for which i ought to be the better as long as i live you will

and to give we a specimen of the style and manner that he approve he add that he be now in a right frame of mind and as he could not possibly employ he time better he would in earnest set about it but i find upon enquiry that no papers of this sort be leave behind he except a few short ejaculatory form suitable to he present situation ' dr adam have not then receive accurate information on this subject for it have since appear that various prayer have be compose by he at different period which intermingle with pious resolution and some short note of he life be entitle by he _ prayer and

this admirable collection to which i have frequently refer in the course of this work evince beyond all he composition for the publick and all the eulogy of he friend and admirer the sincere virtue and piety of johnson it prove with unquestionable authenticity that amidst all he constitutional infirmity he earnestness to conform he practice to the precept of christianity be unceasing and that he habitually endeavor to refer every transaction of he life to the will of the supreme be he arrive in london on the 16th of November and next day send to dr burney the follow note which i insert as the last token of he remembrance of that ingenious and amiable man and as another of the many proof of the tenderness and benignity of he heart : -- ` mr johnson who come home last night send he respects

london shall now so far as be proper be produce in one series : -- July 26 he write to I from ashbourne : -- ` on the 14th i come to lichfield and find every body glad enough to see I on the 20th i

of much improvement i come through the journey without much inconvenience but when i attempt self-motion i find my leg weak and my breath very short this day i have be much disorder i have no company the doctor -lrb- 1166 -rrb- be busy in he field and go to bed at nine and he whole system be so different from mine that we seem form for different element -lrb- 1167 -rrb- i have therefore all my

have disturb I he answer be chiefly in term of reproach for a suppose charge of ` affect discontent and indulge the vanity of complaint ' it however proceed -- ` write to I often and write like a man

very soon that the manner in which he have write might hurt I he two day afterwards July 28 write to I again give I a account of he suffering after which he thus proceed : -- ` before this letter you

power to write to my illustrious friend as formerly or without express such complaint as offended he have conjure he not to do I the injustice of charge I with affectation i be with much regret long silent he last letter to I then come and affect I very tenderly : -- ` to jame boswell esq ` dear sir ' i have this summer sometimes amend and sometimes relapse but upon the whole have lose ground

you sick or be you sullen whatever be the reason if it be less than necessity drive it away and of the short life that we have make the best use for yourself and for you friend i be sometimes afraid that you omission to write have some real cause and shall be glad to know that you be not sick and that nothing ill have befall dear mr boswell or any of you family ' i be sir you & c ` sam johnson ' ` lichfield nov 5 1784 ' yet it be not a little painful to I to find that in a paragraph of this letter which i have omit he still persevere in arraign I as before which be strange in he who have so much experience of what i suffer i however write to he two as kind letter as i could the last of which come too late to be read by he for he illness encrease more rapidly upon he than i have apprehend but i have the consolation of be inform that he speak of I on he death-bed with affection and i look forward with humble hope of renew we friendship in a better world i now relieve the reader of this work from any farther personal notice of its author who if he should be think to have obtrude himself too much upon they attention request they to consider the peculiar plan of he biographical undertaking soon after johnson 's return to the metropolis both the asthma and dropsy become more violent and distressful he have for some time keep a journal in latin of the state of he illness and the remedy which he use under the title of _ aegrus ephemeri _ which he begin on the 6th of July but continue it no longer than the 8th of November find i suppose that it be a mournful and unavailing register it be in my possession and be write with great care and accuracy still he love of literature -lrb- 1170 -rrb- do not fail a very few day before he death he transmit to he friend mr john nichol a list of the author of the _ universal history _ mention they several share in that work it have accord to he direction be deposit in the british museum and be print in the _ gentleman 's magazine _ for December 1784 during he sleepless night he amuse himself by translate into latin verse from the greek many of the epigram in the anthologica -lrb- 1171 -rrb- these translation with some other poem by he in latin he give to he friend mr langton who have add a few note sell they to the bookseller for a small sum to be give to some of johnson 's relation which be accordingly do and they be print in the collection of he work a very erroneous notion have circulate as to johnson 's deficiency in the knowledge of the greek language partly owe to the modesty with which from know how much there be to be learn he use to mention he own comparative acquisition when mr cumberland -lrb- 1172 -rrb- talk to he of the greek fragment which be so well illustrate in the observer -lrb- 1173 -rrb- and of the greek dramatist in general he candidly acknowledge he insufficiency in that particular branch of greek literature yet it may be say that though not a great he be a good greek scholar dr charle burney -lrb- 1174 -rrb- the younger who be universally acknowledge by the best judge to be one of the few man of this age who be very eminent for they skill in that noble language have assure I that johnson could give a greek word for almost every english one and that although not sufficiently conversant in the nicety of the language he upon some occasion discover even in these a considerable degree of critical acumen mr dalzel professor of greek at edinburgh whose skill in it be unquestionable mention to I in very liberal term the impression which be make upon he by johnson in a conversation which they have in london concern that language as johnson therefore be undoubtedly one of the first latin scholar in modern time let we not deny to he fame some additional splendor from greek -lrb- 1175 -rrb- i shall now fulfil my promise -lrb- 1176 -rrb- of exhibit specimen of various sort of imitation of johnson 's style in the _ transaction of the royal irish academy _ 1787 there be a ` essay on the style of dr samuel johnson ' by the reverend robert burrowe whose respect for the great object of he criticism -lrb- 1177 -rrb- be thus evince in the conclude paragraph : -- ' i have single he out from the whole body of english writer because he universally-acknowledged beauty would be most apt to induce imitation and i have treat rather on he fault than he perfection because a essay might comprize all the observation i could make upon he fault while volume would not be sufficient for a treatise on he perfection ' mr burrowe have analyze the composition of johnson and point out its peculiarity with much acuteness and i would recommend a careful perusal of he essay to those who be captivate by the union of perspicuity and splendor which the writings of johnson contain without have a sufficient portion of he vigor of mind may be in danger of become bad copyist of he manner i however can not but observe and i observe it to he credit that this learn gentleman have himself catch no mean degree of the expansion and harmony which independent of all other circumstance characterise the sentence of johnson thus in the preface to the volume in which he essay appear we find -- ` if it be say that in society of this sort too much attention be frequently bestow on subject barren and speculative it may be answer that no one science be so little connected with the rest as not to afford many principle whose use may extend considerably beyond the science to which they primarily belong and that no proposition be so purely theoretical as to be totally incapable

fond of introduce they occasionally there be not a single sentence in all he writings where they be crowd together as in the first verse of the follow imaginary ode by he to mr thrale -lrb- 1178 -rrb- which appear in the newspaper : -- ' _ cervisial coctor 's viduate _ dame _ opin ` st _ thou this gigantick frame _ procumb _ at thy shrine : shall _ catenate _ by thy charm a captive in thy _ ambient

or even for caricature mr colman in he _ prose on several occasion _ have _ a letter from lexiphane -lrb- 1179 -rrb- contain proposal for a glossary or vocabulary of the vulgar tongue : intend as a supplement to a larger dictionary _ it be evidently mean as a sportive sally of ridicule on johnson whose style be thus imitate without be grossly overcharge : -- ` it be easy to foresee that the idle and illiterate will complain that i have increase they labor by endeavor to diminish they and that i have explain what be more easy by what be more difficult -- _ ignotum per ignotius _ i expect on the other hand the liberal acknowledgement of the learn he who be bury in scholastick retirement seclude from the assembly of the gay and remote from the circle of the polite will at once comprehend

not even adhering to alphabetical concatenation -lrb- 1180 -rrb- the serious imitator of johnson 's style whether intentionally or by the imperceptible effect of its strength and animation be as i have have already occasion to observe so many that i might introduce quotation from a numerous body of writer in we language since he appear in the literary world i shall point out only the following

while i be yet alive let I know dear sir that you receive this ' i be sir ` you most humble servant ` sam johnson ' ` dec 2 1784 ' ` to mr lucy porter in lichfield ` dear madam ' i be very ill and desire you prayer i have send mr green the epitaph and a power to call on you for ten pound ' i lay this summer a stone over tetty in the chapel of bromley in kent -lrb- 1198 -rrb- the inscription be in latin of which this be the english -lrb- here a translation -rrb- ` that this be do i think it fit that you should know what care will be take of we who can tell may god pardon and bless we for jesus christ 's sake ' i be & c ` sam johnson -lrb- 1199 -rrb- ' ` dec 2 1784 ' my reader be now at last to behold samuel johnson prepare himself for that doom from which the most exalted power afford no exemption to man -lrb- 1200 -rrb- death have always be to he a object of terror so that though by no means happy he still cling to life with a eagerness at which many have wonder at any time when he be ill he be very much pleased to be tell that he look better a ingenious member of the _ eumelian club _ -lrb- 1201 -rrb- inform I that upon one occasion when he say to he that he see health return to he cheek johnson seize he by the hand and exclaim ` sir you be one of the kindest friend i ever have ' he own state of he view of futurity will appear truly rational and may perhaps impress the unthink with seriousness ` you know -lrb- say he -rrb- -lrb- 1202 -rrb- i never think confidence with respect to futurity any part of the character of a brave a wise or a good man bravery have no place where it can avail nothing wisdom impress strongly the consciousness of those fault of which it be perhaps itself a aggravation and goodness always wish to be better and impute every deficience to criminal negligence and every fault to voluntary corruption never dare to suppose the condition of forgiveness fulfil nor what be want in the crime supply by penitence ` this be the state of the best but what must be the condition of he whose heart will not suffer he to rank himself among the best or among the good such must be he dread of the approach trial as will leave he little attention to the opinion of those whom he be leave for ever and the serenity that be not feel it can be no virtue to feign ' he great fear of death and the strange dark manner in which sir john hawkin -lrb- 1203 -rrb- impart the uneasiness which he express on account of offence with which he charge himself may give occasion to injurious suspicion as if there have be something of more than ordinary criminality weigh upon he conscience on that account therefore as well as from the regard to truth which he inculcate -lrb- 1204 -rrb- i be to mention -lrb- with all possible respect and delicacy however -rrb- that he conduct after he come to london and have associate with savage and other be not so strictly virtuous in one respect as when he be a younger man it be well know that he amorous inclination be uncommonly strong and impetuous he own to many of he friend that he use to take woman of the town to tavern and hear they relate they history -lrb- 1205 -rrb- in short it must not be conceal that like many other good and pious man among whom we may place the apostle paul upon he own authority johnson be not free from propensity which be ever ` war against the law of he mind -lrb- 1206 -rrb- ' -- and that in he combat with they he be sometimes overcome -lrb- 1207 -rrb- here let the profane and licentious pause let they not thoughtlessly say that johnson be a _ hypocrite _ or that he _ principle _ be not firm because he _ practice _ be not uniformly conformable to what he profess let the question be consider independent of moral and religious association and no man will deny that thousand in many instance act against conviction be a prodigal for example a _ hypocrite _ when he own he be satisfied that he extravagance will bring he to ruin and misery we be _ sure _ he _ believe _ it but immediate inclination strengthen by indulgence prevail over that belief in influence he conduct why then shall credit be refuse to the _ sincerity _ of those who acknowledge they persuasion of moral and religious duty yet sometimes fail of live as it require i hear dr johnson once observe ` there be something noble in publish truth though it condemn one 's self -lrb- 1208 -rrb- ' and one who say in he presence ` he have no notion of people be in earnest in they good profession whose practice be not suitable to they ' be thus reprimand by he : -- ` sir be you so grossly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very sincere in good principle without have good practice -lrb- 1209 -rrb- ' but let no man encourage or soothe himself in ` presumptuous sin -lrb- 1210 -rrb- ' from know that johnson be sometimes hurry into indulgence which he think criminal i have exhibit this circumstance as a shade in so great a character both from my sacred love of truth and to shew that he be not so weakly scrupulous as he have be represent by those who imagine that the sin of which a deep sense be upon he mind be merely such little venial trifle as pour milk into he tea on good-friday he understanding will be defend by my statement if he consistency of conduct be in some degree impaired but what wise man would for momentary gratification deliberately subject himself to suffer such uneasiness as we find be experience by johnson in review he conduct as compare with he notion of the ethick of the gospel let the follow passage be keep in remembrance : -- ' o god giver and preserver of all life by whose power i be create and by whose providence i be sustained look down upon I with tenderness and mercy grant that i may not have be create to be finally destroy that i may not be preserve to add wickedness to wickedness -lrb- 1211 -rrb- ' ' o lord let I not sink into total depravity look down upon I and rescue I at last from the captivity of sin -lrb- 1212 -rrb- ' ` almighty and most merciful father who hast continue my life from year to year grant that by longer life i may become less desirous of sinful pleasure and more careful of eternal happiness -lrb- 1213 -rrb- ' ` let not my year be multiply to increase my guilt but as my age advance let I become more pure in my thought more regular in my desire and more obedient to thy law -lrb- 1214 -rrb- ' ` forgive o merciful lord whatever i have do contrary to thy law give I such a sense of my wickedness as may produce true contrition and effectual repentance so that when i shall be call into another state i may be receive among the sinner to whom whom sorrow and reformation have obtain pardon for jesus christ 's sake aman -lrb- 1215 -rrb- ' such be the distress of mind such the penitence of johnson in he hour of privacy and in he devout approach to he maker he _ sincerity _ therefore must appear to every candid mind unquestionable it be of essential consequence to keep in view that there be in this excellent man 's conduct no false principle of _ commutation _ no _ deliberate _ indulgence in sin in consideration of a counter-balance of duty he offend and he repenting be distinct and separate -lrb- 1216 -rrb- : and when we consider he almost unexampled attention to truth he inflexible integrity he constant piety who will dare to ` cast a stone at he -lrb- 1217 -rrb- ' besides let it never be forget that he can not be charge with any offence indicate badness of _ heart _ any thing dishonest base or malignant but that on the contrary he be charitable in a extraordinary degree : so that even in one of he own rigid judgement of himself -lrb- easter-eve 1781 -rrb- while he say ' i have correct no external habit ' he be oblige to own ' i hope that since my last communion i have advance by pious reflection in my submission to god and my benevolence to man -lrb- 1218 -rrb- ' i be conscious that this be the most difficult and dangerous part of my biographical work and i can not but be very anxious concern it i trust that i have get through it preserve at once my regard to truth -- to my friend -- and to the interest of virtue and religion nor can i apprehend that more harm can ensue from the knowledge of the irregularity of johnson guard as i have state it than from know that addison and parnell be intemperate in the use of wine which he himself in he _ live _ of those celebrated writer and pious man have not forborne to record -lrb- 1219 -rrb- it be not my intention to give a very minute detail of the particulars of johnson 's remain day -lrb- 1220 -rrb- of whom it be now evident that the crisis be fast approach when he must ' _ die like man and fall like one of the prince _ -lrb- 1221 -rrb- ' yet it will be instructive as well as gratify to the curiosity of my reader to record a few circumstance on the authenticity of which they may perfectly rely as i have be at the utmost pain to obtain a accurate account of he last illness from the best authority -lrb- 1222 -rrb- dr heberden -lrb- 1223 -rrb- dr brocklesby dr warren -lrb- 1224 -rrb- and dr butter physician generously attend he without accept any fee as do mr cruikshank surgeon and all that could be do from professional skill and ability be try to prolong a life so truly valuable he himself indeed have on account of he very bad constitution be perpetually apply himself to medical inquiry unite he own effort with those of the gentleman who attend he and imagine that the dropsical collection of water which oppress he might be draw off by make incision in he body he with he usual resolute defiance of pain cut deep when he think that he surgeon have do it too tenderly -lrb- 1225 -rrb- about eight or ten day before he death when dr brocklesby pay he he morning visit he seem very low and desponding and say ' i have be as a die man all night ' he then emphatically break out in the word of shakspeare -- ` can ` st thou not minister to a mind disea would pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the write trouble of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff would bosom of that perilous stuff which weigh upon the heart ' to which dr brocklesby readily answer from the same great poet : -- ' ---------------- therein the patient must minister to himself -lrb- 1226 -rrb- ' johnson express himself much satisfied with the application on another day after this when talk on the subject of prayer dr brocklesby repeat from juvenal -- ' _ orandum est ut sit men sana in corpore sano _ -lrb- 1227 -rrb- ' and so on to the end of the tenth satire but in run it quickly over he happen in the line ' _ quus spatium vita extremum inter munera ponat _ ' to pronounce _ supremum _ for _ extremum _ at which johnson 's critical ear instantly take offence and discourse vehemently on the unmetrical effect of such a lapse he shew himself as full as ever of the spirit of the grammarian -lrb- 1228 -rrb- have no near relation -lrb- 1229 -rrb- it have be for some time johnson 's intention to make a liberal provision for he faithful servant mr franci barber whom he look upon as particularly under he protection and whom he have all along treat truly as a humble friend have ask dr brocklesby what would be a proper annuity to a favorite servant and be answer that it must depend on the circumstance of the master and that in the case of a nobleman fifty pound a year be consider as a adequate reward for many year ' faithful service ` then -lrb- say johnson -rrb- shall i be _ nobilissimus _ for i mean to leave frank seventy pound a year and i desire you to tell he so -lrb- 1230 -rrb- ' it be strange however to think that johnson be not free from that general weakness of be averse to execute a will so that he delay it from time to time -lrb- 1231 -rrb- and have it not be for sir john hawkin 's repeatedly urge it i think it be probable that he kind resolution would not have be fulfil after make one which as sir john hawkin inform we extend no further than the promise annuity johnson 's final disposition of he property be establish by a will and codicil of which copy be subjoin -lrb- 1232 -rrb- the consideration of numerous papers of which he be possess seem to have strike johnson 's mind with a sudden anxiety and as they be in great confusion it be much to be lament that he have not entrust some faithful and discreet person with the care and selection of they instead of which he in a precipitate manner burnt large mass of they with little regard as i apprehend to discrimination not that i suppose we have thus be deprive of any composition which he have ever intend for the publick eye but from what escape the flame i judge that many curious circumstance relate both to himself and other literary character have perish -lrb- 1233 -rrb- two very valuable article i be sure we have lose which be two quarto volume contain a full fair and most particular account of he own life from he earliest recollection i own to he that have accidentally see they i have read a great deal in they and apologize for the liberty i have take ask he if i could help it -lrb- 1234 -rrb- he placidly answer ` why sir i do not think you could have help it ' i say that i have for once in my life feel half a inclination to commit theft it have come into my mind to carry off those two volume and never see he more upon my inquire how this would have affect he ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- i believe i should have go mad -lrb- 1235 -rrb- ' during he last illness johnson experience the steady and kind attachment of he numerous friend mr hoole have draw up a narrative of what pass in the visit which he pay he during that time from the both of November to the 13th of December the day of he death inclusive and have favor I with a perusal of it with permission to make extract which i have do nobody be more attentive to he than mr langton to whom he tenderly say _ te teneam morien deficiente manu _ -lrb- 1237 -rrb- and i think it highly to the honor of mr windham that he important occupation as a active statesman -lrb- 1238 -rrb- do not prevent he from pay assiduous respect to the die sage whom he revere mr langton inform I that ` one day he find mr burke and four or five more friend sit with johnson mr burke say to he i be afraid sir such a number of we may be oppressive to you no sir -lrb- say johnson -rrb- it be not so and i must be in a wretched state indeed when you company would not be a delight to I mr burke in a tremulous voice expressive of be very tenderly affect reply my dear sir you have always be too good to I immediately afterwards he go away this be the last circumstance in the acquaintance of these two eminent man -lrb- 1239 -rrb- ' the follow particulars of he conversation within a few day of he death i give on the authority of mr john nichol -lrb- 1240 -rrb- : -- ` he say that the parliamentary debate be the only part of he writings which then give he any compunction -lrb- 1241 -rrb- : but that at the time he write they he have no conception he be impose upon the world though they be frequently write from very slender material and often from none at all -- the mere coinage of he own imagination he never write any part of he work with equal velocity three column of the _ magazine _ in a hour be no uncommon effort which be faster than most person could have transcribe that quantity ` of he friend cave he always speak with great affection yet -lrb- say he -rrb- cave -lrb- who never look out of he window but with a view to the _ gentleman 's magazine _ -rrb- be a penurious pay-master he would contract for line by the hundred and expect the long hundred but he be a good man and always delighted to have he friend at he table ` when talk of a regular edition of he own work he say that he have power -lrb- from the bookseller -rrb- to print such a edition if he health admit it but have no power to assign over any edition unless he could add note and so alter they as to make they new work which he state of health forbid he to think of i may possibly live -lrb- say he -rrb- or rather breath three day or perhaps three week but find myself daily and gradually weaker ` he say at another time three or four day only before he death speaking of the little fear he have of undergo a chirurgical operation i would give one of these leg for a year more of life i mean of comfortable life not such as that which i now suffer -- and lament much he inability to read during he hour of restlessness i use formerly -lrb- he add -rrb- when sleepless in bed _ to read like a turk _ -lrb- 1242 -rrb- ` whilst confine by he last illness it be he regular practice to have the church-service read to he by some attentive and friendly divine the rev mr hoole perform this kind office in my presence for the last time when by he own desire no more than the litany be read in which he response be in the deep and sonorous voice which mr boswell have occasionally notice and with the most profound devotion that can be imagine he hearing not be quite perfect he more than once interrupted mr hoole with louder my dear sir louder i entreat you or you pray in vain -lrb- 1243 -rrb- -- and when the service be end he with great earnestness turn round to a excellent lady who be present say i thank you madam very heartily for you kindness in join I in this solemn exercise live well i conjure you and you will not feel the compunction at the last which i now feel -lrb- 1244 -rrb- so truly humble be the thought which this great and good man entertain of he own approach to religious perfection -lrb- 1245 -rrb- ` he be earnestly invite to publish a volume of _ devotional exercise _ -lrb- 1246 -rrb- but this -lrb- though he listen to the proposal with much complacency and a large sum of money be offer for it -rrb- he decline from motive of the sincerest modesty ` he seriously entertain the thought of translate _ thuanus _ -lrb- 1247 -rrb- he often talk to I on the subject and once in particular when i be rather wish that he would favor the world and gratify he sovereign by a life of spenser -lrb- 1248 -rrb- -lrb- which he say that he would readily have do have he be able to obtain any new material for the purpose -rrb- he add i have be think again sir of _ thuanus _ : it would not be the laborious task which you have suppose it i should have no trouble but that of dictation which would be perform as speedily as a amanuensis could write it be to the mutual credit of johnson and divine of different communion that although he be a steady church-of-england man there be nevertheless much agreeable intercourse between he and they let I particularly name the late mr la trobe and mr hutton -lrb- 1249 -rrb- of the moravian profession he intimacy with the english benedictine at paris have be mention -lrb- 1250 -rrb- and as a additional proof of the charity in which he live with good man of the romish church i be happy in this opportunity of record he friendship with the reverend thoma hussey -lrb- 1251 -rrb- dd he catholick majesty 's chaplain of embassy at the court of london that very respectable man eminent not only for he powerful eloquence as a preacher but for he various ability and acquisition nay though johnson love a presbyterian the least of all this do not prevent he have a long and uninterrupted social connection with the reverend dr jame fordyce who since he death have gratefully celebrated he in a warm strain of devotional composition -lrb- 1252 -rrb- amidst the melancholy cloud which hang over the die johnson he characteristical manner shew itself on different occasion when dr warren in the usual style hope that he be better he answer be ` no sir you can not conceive with what acceleration i advance towards death ' a man whom he have never see before be employ one night to sit up with he -lrb- 1253 -rrb- be ask next morning how he like he attendant he answer be ` not at all sir : the fellow 's a ideot he be as aukward as a turn-spit when first put into the wheel and as sleepy as a dormouse ' mr windham have place a pillow conveniently to support he he thank he for he kindness and say ` that will do -- all that a pillow can do ' he repeat -lrb- 1254 -rrb- with great spirit a poem consist of several stanza in four line in alternate rhyme which he say he have compose some year before on occasion of a rich extravagant young gentleman 's come of age say he have never repeat it but once since he compose it and have give but one copy of it that copy be give to mr thrale now piozzus who have publish it in a book which she entitle _ british synonymy _ -lrb- 1255 -rrb- but which be truly a collection of entertaining remark and story no matter whether accurate or not be a piece of exquisite satire convey in a strain of pointed vivacity and humor and in a manner of which no other instance be to be find in johnson 's writings i shall here insert it -lrb- 1256 -rrb- : -- long-expected one-and-twenty ling ` ring year at length be fly pride and pleasure pomp and plenty great -- -- -lrb- 1257 -rrb- be now you own loosen would from the minor 's tether free to

on a Sunday -lrb- 1259 -rrb- sir joshua readily acquiesce -lrb- 1260 -rrb- indeed he shew the greatest anxiety for the religious improvement of he friend to whom he discourse of its infinite consequence he beg of mr hoole to think of what he have say and to commit it to write : and upon be afterwards assure that this be do press he hand and in a earnest tone thank he dr brocklesby have attend he with the utmost assiduity and kindness as he physician and friend he be peculiarly desirous that this gentleman should not entertain any loose speculative notion but be confirm in the truth of christianity and insist on he write down in he presence as nearly as he could collect it the import of what pass on the subject : and dr brocklesby have comply with the request he make he sign the paper and urge he to keep it in he own custody as long as he live -lrb- 1261 -rrb- johnson with that native fortitude which amidst all he bodily distress and mental suffering never forsake he ask dr brocklesby as a man in whom he have confidence to tell he plainly whether he could recover ` give I -lrb- say he -rrb- a direct answer ' the doctor have first ask he if he could bear the whole truth which way soever it might lead and be answer that he could declare that in he opinion he could not recover without a miracle ` then -lrb- say johnson -rrb- i will take no more physick not even my opiate for i have pray that i may render up my soul to god uncloud ' in this resolution he persevere and at the same time use only the weakest kind of sustenance be press by mr windham to take somewhat more generous nourishment lest too low a diet should have the very effect which he dread by debilitate he mind he say ' i will take any thing but inebriating sustenance -lrb- 1262 -rrb- ' the reverend mr strahan who be the son of he friend and have be always one of he great favorite have during he last illness the satisfaction of contribute to soothe and comfort he that gentleman 's house

that distemper which it be once imagine the royal touch could cure and by a slovenly mode of dress he have the use only of one eye yet so much do mind govern and even supply the deficiency of organ that he visual perception as far as they extend be uncommonly quick and accurate -lrb- 1286 -rrb- so morbid be he temperament that he never know the natural joy of a free and vigorous use of he limb : when he walk it be like the struggle gait of one in fetter when he ride he have no command or direction of he horse but be carry as if in a balloon -lrb- 1287 -rrb- that with he constitution and habit of life he should have live seventy-five year be a proof that a inherent _ vivida vis _ -lrb- 1288 -rrb- be a powerful preservative of the human frame man be in general make up of contradictory quality and these will ever shew themselves in strange succession where a consistency in appearance at least if not in reality have not be attain by long habit of philosophical discipline in proportion to the native vigor of the mind the contradictory quality will be the more prominent and more difficult to be adjust and therefore we be not to wonder that johnson exhibit a eminent example of this remark which i have make upon human nature at different time he seem a different man in some respects not however in any great or essential article upon which he have fully employ he mind and settle certain principle of duty but only in he manners and in the display of argument and fancy in he talk he be prone to superstition but not to credulity though he imagination might incline he to a belief of the marvellous and the mysterious he vigorous reason examine the evidence with jealousy -lrb- 1289 -rrb- he be a sincere and zealous christian of high church-of-england and monarchical principle which he would not tamely suffer to be question and have perhaps at a early period narrow he mind somewhat too much both as to religion and politick he be impress with the danger of extreme latitude in either though he be of a very independent spirit occasion he appear somewhat unfavourable to the prevalence of that noble freedom of sentiment which be the best possession of man nor can it be deny that he have many prejudice which however frequently suggest many of he pointed saying that rather shew a playfulness of fancy than any settle malignity he be steady and inflexible in maintain the obligation of religion and morality both from a regard for the order of society and from a veneration for the great source of all order correct nay stern in he taste hard to please and easily offend -lrb- 1290 -rrb- impetuous and irritable in he temper but of a most humane and benevolent heart -lrb- 1291 -rrb- which shew itself not only in a most liberal charity as far as he circumstance would allow but in a thousand instance of active benevolence he be afflict with a bodily disease which make he often restless and fretful and with a constitutional melancholy the cloud of which darken the brightness of he fancy and give a gloomy cast to he whole course of thinking : we therefore ought not to wonder at he sally of impatience and passion at any time especially when provoke by obtrusive ignorance or presume petulance and allowance must be make for he utter hasty and satirical sally even against he best friend and surely when it be consider that ` amidst sickness and sorrow -lrb- 1292 -rrb- ` he exert he faculty in so many work for the benefit of mankind and particularly that he atchieve the great and admirable dictionary of we language we must be astonish at he resolution the solemn text ` of he to whom much be give much will be require -lrb- 1293 -rrb- ' seem to have be ever present to he mind in a rigorous sense and to have make he dissatisfied with he labor and act of goodness however comparatively great so that the unavoidable consciousness of he superiority be in that respect a cause of disquiet he suffer so much from this and from the gloom which perpetually haunt he and make solitude frightful that it may be say of he ` if in this life only he have hope he be of all man most miserable -lrb- 1294 -rrb- ' he love praise when it be bring to he but be too proud to seek for it he be somewhat susceptible of flattery as he be general and unconfined in he study he can not be consider as master of any one particular science but he have accumulate a vast and various collection of learning and knowledge which be so arrange in he mind as to be ever in readiness to be bring forth but he superiority over other learn man consist chiefly in what may be call the art of think the art of use he mind a certain continual power of seize the useful substance of all that he know and exhibit it in a clear and forcible manner so that knowledge which we often see to be no better than lumber in man of dull understanding be in he true evident and actual wisdom he moral precept be practical for they be draw from a intimate acquaintance with human nature he maxim carry conviction for they be found on the basis of common sense and a very attentive and minute survey of real life he mind be so full of imagery that he might have be perpetually a poet yet it be remarkable that however rich he prose be in this respect he poetical piece in general have not much of that splendor but be rather distinguish by strong sentiment and acute observation convey in harmonious and energetick verse particularly in heroick couplet though usually grave and even aweful in he deportment he possess uncommon and peculiar power of wit and humor he frequently indulge himself in colloquial pleasantry and the heartiest merriment -lrb- 1295 -rrb- be often enjoy in he company with this great advantage that as it be entirely free from any poisonous tincture of vice or impiety it be salutary to those who share in it he have accustom himself to such accuracy in he common conversation -lrb- 1296 -rrb- that he at all time express he thought with great force and a elegant choice of language the effect of which be aid by he have a loud voice and a slow deliberate utterance -lrb- 1297 -rrb- in he be unite a most logical head with a most fertile imagination which give he a extraordinary advantage in argue : for he could reason close or wide as he see best for the moment exult in he intellectual strength and dexterity he could when he please be the greatest sophist that ever contend in the list of declamation and from a spirit of contradiction and a delight in shew he power he would often maintain the wrong side with equal warmth and ingenuity so that when there be a audience he real opinion could seldom be gather from he talk -lrb- 1298 -rrb- though when he be in company with a single friend he would discuss a subject with genuine fairness : but he be too conscientious to make error permanent and pernicious by deliberately write it and in all he numerous work he earnestly inculcate what appear to he to be the truth he piety be constant and the ruling principle of all he conduct -lrb- 1299 -rrb- such be samuel johnson a man whose talent acquirement and virtue be so extraordinary that the more he character be consider the more he will be regard by the present age and by posterity with admiration and reverence -lrb- 1300 -rrb- appendix a -lrb- _ page _ 115 _ note _ 4 -rrb- there be at least three account of

highly improper to speak in that style to a minister of the gospel and i be the more hurt on reflect with what mild dignity he receive it ' if johnson really speak of the dean 's _ mild dignity _ it be clear that richard burke 's account be wrong but it be write just after the scene and boswell say there be ' a pretty smart altercation ' miss reynold continue : -- ` when the dean come up into the

i copy for this purpose and whatever may be the merit or justness of the remark you may be sure that be write to a most intimate friend without any intention that they ever should go further they be the genuine and undisguised sentiment of the writer : -- ` jan 6 1792 ` last week i be read the second volume of boswell 's _ johnson _ with increase esteem for the worthy author and increase veneration of the wonderful and excellent man who be the subject of it the writer throw in now and then very properly some serious religious reflection but there be one remark in my mind a obvious and just one which i think he have not make that johnson 's morbid melancholy and constitutional infirmity be intend by providence like st paul 's thorn in the flesh to check intellectual conceit and arrogance which the consciousness of he extraordinary talent awake as he be to the voice of praise might otherwise have generate in a very culpable degree another observation strike I that in consequence of the same natural indisposition and habitual sickliness -lrb- for he say he scarcely pass one day without pain after he twentieth year -rrb- he consider and represent human life as a scene of much greater misery than be generally experience there may be person bow down with affliction all they day and there be those no doubt whose iniquity rob they of rest but neither calamity nor crime i hope and believe do so much and so generally abound as to justify the dark picture of life which johnson 's imagination design and he strong pencil delineate this i be sure the coloring be far too gloomy for what i have experience though as far as i can remember i have have more sickness -lrb- i do not say more severe but only more in quantity -rrb- than fall to the lot of most people but then daily debility and occasional sickness be far overbalance by intervenient day and perhaps week void of pain and overflow with comfort so that in short to return to the subject human life as far as i can perceive from experience or observation be not that state of constant wretchedness which johnson always insist it be which misrepresentation -lrb- for such it surely be -rrb- he biographer have not correct i suppose because unhappily he have himself a large portion of melancholy in he constitution and fancy the portrait a faithful copy of life ' the learn writer then proceed thus in he letter to I : -- ' i have converse with some sensible man on this subject who all seem to entertain the same sentiment respect life with those which be express or imply in the foregoing paragraph it might be add that as the representation here speak of appear not consistent with fact and experience so neither do it seem to be countenance by scripture there be perhaps no part of the sacred volume which at first sight promise so much to lend its sanction to these dark and desponding notion as the book of _ ecclesiaste _ which so often and so emphatically proclaim the vanity of thing sublunary but the design of this whole book -lrb- as it have be justly observe -rrb- be not to put we out of conceit with life but to cure we vain expectation of a compleat and perfect happiness in this world to convince we that there be no such thing to be find in mere external enjoyment -- and to teach we to seek for happiness in the practice of virtue in the knowledge and love of god and in the hope of a better life for this be the application of all _ let we hear _ & c xii 13 not only he duty but he happiness too _ for _ god & c ver 14 -- see _ sherlock on providence _ p 299 ` the new testament tell we indeed and most truly that sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof and therefore wisely forbid we to increase we burden by foreboding of sorrow but i think it no where say that even we ordinary affliction be not consistent with a very considerable degree of positive comfort and satisfaction and accordingly one whose suffering as well as merit be conspicuous assure we that in proportion as the suffering of christ abound in they so they consolation also abound by christ 2 _ cor _ i 5 it be needless to cite as indeed it would be endless even to refer to the multitude of

upon the whole setting aside instance of great and lasting bodily pain of mind peculiarly oppress by melancholy and of severe temporal calamity from which extraordinary case we surely should not form we estimate of the general tenor and complexion of life exclude these from the account i be convince that as well the gracious constitution of thing which providence have ordain as the declaration of scripture and the actual experience of individual authorize the sincere christian to hope that he humble and constant endeavor to perform he duty checquer as the best life be with many failing will be crown with a greater degree of present peace serenity and comfort than he could reasonably permit himself to expect if he measure he view and judge of life from the opinion of dr johnson often and energetically express in the memoirs of he without any animadversion or censure by he ingenious biographer if he himself upon review the subject shall see the matter in this light he will in a octavo edition which be eagerly expect make such additional remark or correction as he shall judge fit lest the impression which these discourage passage may leave on the reader 's mind should in any degree hinder what otherwise the whole spirit and energy of the work tend and i hope successfully to promote -- pure morality and true religion ' though i have in some degree obviate any reflection against
