then for no apparent reason margaret flush and billy think it vastly become billy wood billy unfold it slowly with a puzzle look grow in he countenance ` my lady ' he ask very softly ` have not you any good news for I on this wonderful morning ' miss hugonin pout ` you need not be such a grandfather ' she suggest helpfully regard they with alert eye the eagle 's shadow i this be the story of margaret hugonin and of the eagle and with you permission we will for the present defer all consideration of the bird and devote we unqualified attention to margaret i have always esteem margaret the obvious sensible most appropriate name that can be bestow upon a girl-child for it be a name that fit a woman -- any woman -- as neatly as she proper size in glove yes the first point i wish to make be that a woman-child once baptise margaret be thereby insure of a suitable name be she grave or gay in after-life wanton or pious or sullen comely or otherwise there will be no possible chance of incongruity whether she develop a taste for winter-garden or the higher mathematics whether she take to golf or clinging organdie the event be provide for one have only to consider for a moment and if among a choice of madge marjorie meta maggie margherita peggy and gretchen and countless other -- if among all these he can not find a name that suit she to a t -- why then the case be indeed desperate and he may permissibly fall back upon madam or -- if the cat jump propitiously and at he own peril -- on darling or sweetheart the second proof that this name must be the best of all possible name be that margaret hugonin bear it and so the murder be out you may suspect what you choose i warn you in advance that i have no part whatever in she story and if my admiration for she give name appear somewhat excessive i can only protest that in this dissentient world every one have a right to he own taste i know margaret i admire she and if in some unguarded moment i may have carry my admiration to the point of indiscretion she husband most assuredly know all about it by this and he and i be still the best of friend so you perceive that if i ever do so far forget myself it could scarcely have amount to a hang matter i be doubly sure that margaret hugonin be beautiful for the reason that i have never find a woman under forty-five who share my opinion if you clap a testament into my hand i can not affirm that woman be eager to recognize beauty in one another at the utmost they concede that this or that particular feature be well enough but when a woman be clean-eyed and straight-limbed and have a cheery heart she really can not help be beautiful and when nature accord she a sufficiency of dimple and a infectious laugh i protest she be well-nigh irresistible and all these margaret hugonin have and surely that be enough i shall not endeavor then to picture she feature to you in any nicely pick word she chief charm be that she be margaret and besides that mere carnal vanity be trivial thing a gray eye or so be not in the least to the purpose yet since it be the immemorial custom of writer-folk to inventory such possession of they heroine here you have a catalogue of she personal attraction launce 's method will serve we turn imprimis there be not very much of she -- five foot three at the most and hers be the well-groomed modern type that imply a grandfather or two and be in every respect the antithesis of that hulk venus of the louvre whom people pretend to admire item she have blue eye and when she talk with you she head droop forward a little the frank intent gaze of these eye be very flattering and in its ultimate effect perilous since it lead you fatuously to believe that she have forget there be any other trousered being extant later on you find this a decide error item she have a quite incredible amount of yellow hair that be not in the least like gold or copper or bronze -- i scorn the hackneyed simile of metallurgical poet -- but a straightforward yellow darken at the root and she wear it low down on she neck in great coil that be hold in place by a multitude of little golden hair-pin and diver corpulent tortoise-shell one item she nose be a tiny miracle of perfection and this be noteworthy for you will observe that nature who be a adept at eye and hair and mouth very rarely achieve a creditable nose item she have a mouth and if you be a gradgrindian with a taste for hairsplitting i can not swear that it be a particularly small mouth the lip be rather full than otherwise one saw in they potentiality of heroic passion and tenderness and generosity and if you will temper no she mouth be not in the least like the pink shoe-button of romance and sugared portraiture it be manifestly design less for simper out of a gilt frame or the dribbling of stock phrase over three hundred page than for gibe and laughter and cheery gossip and honest unromantic eating as well as another purpose which as a highly dangerous topic i decline even to mention there you have the best description of margaret hugonin that i be capable of give you no one realize its glaring inadequacy more acutely than i furthermore i stipulate that if in the progress of we comedy she appear to act with a utter lack of reason or even common-sense -- as every woman worth the win must do once or twice in a lifetime -- that i be permit to record the fact to set it down in all its ugliness nay even to exaggerate it a little -- all to the end that i may eventually exasperate you and goad you into cry out come come you be not treat the girl with common justice for if such a thing be possible i should desire you to rival even I in a liking for margaret hugonin and speak for myself i can assure you that i have come long ago to regard she fault with the same leniency that i accord my own ii we begin on a fine may morning in colonel hugonin 's room at selwoode which be as you may or may not know the hugonin ' country-place and there we discover the colonel dawdle over he breakfast in a intermediate stage of that careful toilet which enable he later in the day to pass casual inspection as turn forty-nine at present the old gentleman be discuss the member of he daughter 's house-party we will omit by you leave a number of picturesque descriptive passage -- for the colonel be on occasion a man of unfettered speech -- and come hastily to the conclusion to the summing-up of the whole matter altogether say colonel hugonin they strike I as be the most ungodly menagerie ever get together under one roof since noah land on ararat now i be sorry that veracity compel I to present the colonel in this particular state of mind for ordinarily he be as pleasant-spoken a gentleman as you will be apt to meet on the longest summer day -lrb- illustration : ` altogether ' say colonel hugonin ` they strike I as be the most ungodly menagerie ever get together under one roof since noah land on ararat ' -rrb- you must make allowance for the fact that on this especial morning he be still suffer from a recent twinge of the gout and that he toast be somewhat dryer than he like it and most potent of all that the foreign mail just in have cause he to rebel anew against the propriety and he daughter 's inclination which chained he to selwoode in the height of the full london season to preside over a house-party every member of which he cordially dislike therefore the colonel have glance through the well-known name of those at lady pevensey 's last cotillion groan and glare at he daughter who sit opposite he and revile he daughter 's friend with point and fluency and characterise they as above for the reason that he be hunger at heart for the shady side of pall mall and that they presence at selwoode prevent he attaining this elysium for i be sorry to say that the colonel loathe all thing american save he daughter whom he worship and i think no one who could have see she prepare he second cup of tea would have dispute that in make this exception he act with a show of reason for margaret hugonin -- but as you know she be we heroine and as i fear you have already learn word be very paltry makeshift when it come to describe she let we simply say then that margaret he daughter begin to make he a cup of tea and add that she laugh not unkindly no for at bottom she adore she father -- a comely englishman of some sixty-odd who have run through he wife 's fortune and he own in the most gallant fashion -- and she accord he opinion a conscientious but at time a sorely tax tolerance that very month she have reach twenty-three the age of omniscience when the fallacy and general obtuseness of older people become dishearteningly apparent it be nonsense pursue the old gentleman utter bedlamite nonsense fill selwoode up with write people never hear of such a thing gad i do remember as a young man meeting thackeray at a garden-party at orlean house -- gentlemanly fellow with a broken nose -- and brown go about a bit too now i think of it people have 'em one at a time to lend flavor to a dinner -- like a olive we do not dine on olive though you have 'em for breakfast luncheon dinner and everything i be sick of olive i tell you margaret margaret pout they be not even good olive i look into one of that fellow charteri 's book the other day -- that chap you have here last week it be bally rot -- proverb stand on they head and grin like dwarf in a condemn street-fair who want to be tell that impropriety be the spice of life and that a roving eye gather remorse _ you _ may call that sort of thing cleverness if you like i call it damn ' foolishness and the emphasis with which he say this leave no doubt that the colonel speak he honest opinion attractive say he daughter patiently mr charteri be very very clever mr kennaston say literature suffer a considerable loss when he begin to write for the magazine and now that margaret have speak permit I to call you attention to she voice mellow and suave and of astonishing volume be margaret 's voice it come not from the back of she throat as most of we woman 's voice do but from she chest and i protest it have the timbre of a violin man hear she voice for the first time be wont to stare at she a little and afterward to close they hand slowly for always its modulation have the tonic sadness of distant music and it thrill you to much the same magnanimity and yearning cloudily conceive and yet you could not but smile in spite of yourself at the quaint emphasis flutter through she speech and pounce for the most part on the unlikeliest word in the whole sentence but i fancy the colonel must have be tone-deaf do not you make phrase for I he snort you keep 'em for you menagerie think by gad the world never think i believe the world deliberately read the six bestselling book in order to incapacitate itself for think then he wrath gathering emphasis as he go on : the longer i live the plainer i see shakespeare be right -- what fool these mortal be and all that there be that haggage woman -- speech-making through the country like a hiatused politician it may be philanthropic but it be not ladylike -- no begad what have she get to do with juvenile court and child-labour in the south i would like to know why be not she at home attend to that cripple boy of hers -- poor little beggar -- instead of flaunt through america meddle with other folk 's child miss hugonin put another lump of sugar into he cup and deign no reply by gad cry the colonel fervently if you be so anxious to spend that money of yours in charity why do not you find a day nursery for the child of philanthropist -- a place where advance man and woman can leave they offspring in capable hand when they be busy with mother ' meeting and educational conference it would do a thousand time more good i can tell you than that fresh kindergarten scheme of yours for teach the child of the labor class to make a new sort of mud-pie you do not understand these thing attractive margaret gently point out you be not in harmony with the trend of modern thought no thank god say the colonel heartily ensue a silence during which he chip at he egg-shell in a absent-minded fashion that fellow kennaston say anything to you yet he presently query i -- i do not understand she protest -- oh perfectly unconvincingly the tea-making too engross she at this point to a utterly improbable extent thus it shortly befall that the colonel still regard she under intent brow clear he throat and make bold to question she generosity in the matter of sugar five lump be as he suggest a rather unusual allowance for one cup then mr kennaston and i be very good friend say she with dignity and have spoil the first cup in the make she begin on another glad to hear it growl the old gentleman i hope you value he friendship sufficiently not to marry he the man 's a fraud -- a flimsy sickening fraud like he poetry begad and that be make up of botany and wide margin and indecency in about equal proportion it be not fit for a woman to read -- in fact a woman ought not to read anything a comprehension of the decalogue and the cookery-book be enough learning for the best of 'em you mother never -- never -- colonel hugonin pause and stare at the open window for a little he seem to be interested in something a great way off we use to read ouida 's book together he say somewhat wistfully lord lord how she revel in chando and bertie cecil and those dash life guardsman and she use to toss that little head of hers and say i be a finer figure of a man than any of 'em -- thirty year ago good lord and i be then but i be not now i be only a broken-down cantankerous old fool declare the colonel blow he nose violently and that be why i be quarrel with the dearest foolishest daughter man ever have ah my dear do not mind I -- run you menagerie as you like and i 'll stand it margaret adopt she usual tactic she perch herself on the arm of he chair and begin to stroke he cheek very gently she often wonder as to what dear sort of a woman that tender-eye pink-cheeked mother of the old miniature have be -- the mother who have die when she be two year old she love the idea of she vague as it be and just now somehow the notion of two grown people read ouida do not strike she as be especially ridiculous be she very beautiful she ask softly my dear say she father you be the picture of she you dangerous old man say she laugh and rub she cheek against he in a manner that must have be highly agreeable dear do you know that be the nicest little compliment i have have for a long time thereupon the colonel chuckle pay I for it then say he by drive the dog-cart over to meet billy 's train to-day eh i -- i can not say miss hugonin promptly why demand she father because -- say miss hugonin and after give this really excellent reason reflect for a moment and strengthen it by add because -- see here she father question what do you two quarrel about anyway i -- i really do not remember say she reflectively then continue with hauteur and some inconsistency i be not aware that mr wood and i have ever quarrel by gad then say the colonel you may as well prepare to for i intend to marry you to billy some day dear dear child he interpolate with malice aforethought have you a fever -- you cheek 's like a coal billy 's a man i tell you -- worth a dozen of you kennaston and charterise i like billy and besides it be only right he should have selwoode -- be not he bring up to expect it it be not right he should lose it simply because he have a quarrel with frederick for by gad -- not to speak unkindly of the dead my dear -- frederick quarrel with every one he ever know from the woman who nurse he to the doctor who give he he last pill he may have get he genius for money-making from heaven but he certainly get he temper from the devil i really believe say the colonel reflectively it be worse than mine yes not a doubt of it -- i be a lamb in comparison but he have he way after all and even now poor billy can not get selwoode without take you with it and he catch he daughter 's face between he hand and turn it toward he for a moment i wonder now say he in meditative wise if billy will consider that a drawback it seem very improbable any number of marriageable male would have swear it be unthinkable however of course margaret begin in a crisp voice if you advise mr wood to marry I as a good speculation -- but she father catch she up with a whistle eh say he love in a cottage -- be it thus the poet turn he lay that be damn ' nonsense i tell you even in a cottage the plumber 's bill have to be pay and the grocer 's little account settle every month yes by gad and even if you elect to live on bread and cheese and kiss you 'll find camembert a bit more to you taste than sweitzer but i do not want to marry anybody you ridiculous old dear say margaret oh very well say the old gentleman do not be a old maid and lecture before the mother ' club if you like i do not care anyhow you meet billy to-day at twelve-forty-five you will -- that be a good child now run along and tell the menagerie i 'll be down-stair as soon as i have finish dress and the colonel ring for he man and proceed to finish he toilet he seem a think absent-minded this morning i say wilkin he question after a little ever read any of ouida 's book ho yes sir say wilkin miss ` enderson -- mr ` aggage 's maid that he sir -- be read haloud hout hof ` hunder two flag ' honly last hevening sir h be -- wilkin -- if you can run across one of they in the servant ' quarter -- you might leave it -- by my bed -- to-night yes sir and -- h be wilkin -- you can put it under that book of herbert spencer 's my daughter give I yesterday _ under _ it wilkin -- and h be wilkin -- you need not mention it to anybody ouida be not culture wilkin but she be damn ' good reading i suppose that be why she be not culture wilkin iii and now let we go back a little in a word let we utilise the next twenty minute -- during which miss hugonin drive to the neighbouring railway station in if you press I not the most pleasant state of mind conceivable -- by explain a think more fully the posture of affair at selwoode on the may morning that start we story and to do this i must commence with the nature of the man who found selwoode it be when the nineteenth century be still a hearty octogenarian that frederick r wood cause selwoode to be build i give you the name by which he be know on the street a mythology have grow about the name since and strange legend of its owner be still narrate where broker congregate but with the lamb he shear and the bull he drag to earth and the bear he gore to financial death we have nothing to do suffice it that he perform these operation with almost uniform success and in a unimpeachably respectable manner and if in he time he add materially to the list of inmate in various asylum and almshouse it must be acknowledge that he bear he victim no malice and that on every Sunday morning he confess himself to be a miserable sinner in a voice that be perfectly audible three pew off at bottom i think he consider he relation with heaven on a purely business basis he keep a species of run account with providence and if on occasion he overdraw it somewhat he see no incongruity in evening matter with a cheque for the church fund so that at he death it be say of he that he have in he day send more man into bankruptcy and more missionary into africa than any other man in the country in he sixty-fifth year he catch alfred van orden short in lard erect a memorial window to he wife and become a country gentleman he never set foot in wall street again he build selwoode -- a handsome tudor manor which stand some seven mile from the village of fairhaven -- where he dwell in state by turn affable and domineering to the neighbouring farmer and evince a grave interest in the condition of they crop he no longer turn to the financial report in the papers and the pedigree of the woods hang in the living-hall for all man to see begin gloriously with woden the scandinavian god and attain a respectable culmination in the name of frederick r wood and of william he brother it be not to be suppose that he omit to supply himself with a coat-of-arms frederick r wood evince a almost childlike pride in he heraldic blazoning the wood arm he would inform you with a relish gusto be vert a eagle display barry argent and gule and the crest be out of a ducal coronet or a demi-eagle proper we have no motto sir -- none of you ancient coat have motto the wood eagle he glory in the bird be perch in every available nook at selwoode it be carve in the woodwork be set in the mosaic be chase in the tableware be weave in the napery be glaze in the very china turn where you would a eagle or two confront you and hunston wyke who be account something of a wit swear that frederick r wood at selwoode remind he of a sore-headed bear who have take up permanent quarter in a aviary there be one however who find the bear no very untractable monster this be the son of he brother dead now who dwell at selwoode as heir presumptive frederick r wood 's wife have die long ago leave he childless he brother 's boy be a orphan and so for a time he and the grim old man live together peaceably enough indeed billy wood be in those day as fine a lad as you would wish to see with the eye of a inquisitive cherub and a big tow-head which frederick r wood fall into the habit of cuff heartily in order to conceal the fact that he would have burn selwoode to the ground rather than allow any one else to injure a hair of it in the consummation of time billy have attain the ripe age of eighteen announce to he uncle that he intend to become a famous painter frederick r wood exhort he not to be a fool and pack he off to college billy wood return on he first vacation with a fragmentary mustache and any quantity of paint-tubes canvas palette mahl-stick and such-like paraphernalia frederick r wood pass over the mustache and have the painter ' trappings burn by the second footman billy promptly purchase another lot he uncle come upon they one morning rub he chin meditatively for a moment and laugh for the first time so far as know in he lifetime then he tiptoe to he own apartment lest billy -- the lazy young rascal be still abe in the next room -- should awaken and discover he knowledge of this act of flat rebellion i dare say the old gentleman be so completely accustom to have he own way that this unlooked-for opposition tickle he by its novelty or perhaps he recognize in billy a obstinacy akin to he own or perhaps it be merely that he love the boy in any event he never again allude to the subject and it be a fact that when billy send for carpenter to convert a upper room into a atelier frederick r wood spend two long and dreary week in boston in order to remain in ignorance of the entire affair billy scramble through college somehow in the allotted four year at the end of that time he return to find new inmate install at selwoode for the wife of frederick r wood have be before she marriage one of the beautiful anstruther sister who as certain new yorker still remember -- those grizzled portly rosy-gilled fellow who prattle on provocation of jenny lind and castle garden and remember everything -- create a pronounced furor at they début in the day of crinoline and the grecian bend and margaret anstruther as they will tell you be marry to thoma hugonin then a gallant cavalry officer in the service of she majesty the empress of indium and she must have be the nicer of the two because everybody who know she say that margaret hugonin be exactly like she so it come about naturally enough that billy wood now a _ artium baccalaureus _ if you please and not a little proud of it find the colonel and he daughter then on a visit to this country install at selwoode as guest and quasi-relative and billy be twenty-two and margaret be nineteen \* \* \* \* \* precisely what happen i be unable to tell you billy wood claim it be none of my business and margaret say that it be a long long time ago and she really can not remember but i fancy we can all form a very fair notion of what be most likely to occur when two sensible normal healthy young people be throw together in this intimate fashion at a country-house where the remain company consist of two elderly gentleman billy be force to be polite to he uncle 's guest and margaret could not well be discourteous to she host 's nephew could she of course not : so it befall in the course of time that frederick r wood and the colonel -- who have quickly become a great favorite by virtue of he implicit faith in the eagle and in woden and sir percival de wode of hasting and such-like flight of heraldic fancy and have augment he popularity by he really brilliant suggestion of wynkyn de worde the famous sixteenth-century printer as a probable collateral relation of the family -- it come to pass i say that the two gentleman nod over they port and chuckle and wink at one another and agree that the thing would do this be all very well but they fail to make allowance for the inevitable quarrel and the subsequent spectacle of the gentleman contemplate suicide and the lady look wistfully toward a nunnery in this case it arise i believe over teddy anstruther who for a cousin be undeniably very attentive to margaret and in the natural course of event they would have make it up before the week be out have not frederick r wood select this very moment to interfere in the matter ah _ si vieillesse savait _ the blunder old man summon billy into he study and order he to marry margaret hugonin precisely as the colonel might have order a private to go on sentry-duty ten day earlier billy would have jump at the chance ten day later he would probably have suggest it himself but at that exact moment he would have as willingly contemplate matrimony with alecto or medusa or any of the fury accordingly he decline frederick r wood fly into a pyrotechnical display of temper and give he he choice between obey he command and leave he house forever -- the choice in fact which he have be accord billy at very brief interval ever since the boy have have the measles fifteen year before and have refuse to take the proper medicine it be merely he usual manner of express a request or a suggestion but this time to he utter horror and amaze the boy take he at he word and leave selwoode within the hour billy 's life you see be irrevocably blighted it matter very little what become of he personally he do not care in the least but as for that fair false fickle woman -- perish the thought sooner a thousand death no he would go to pari and become a painter of worldwide reputation the money he father have leave he would easily suffice for he simple want and some day the observe of all observer in some bright hall of gaiety he would pass she coldly by with a cynical smile upon he lip and she would grow pale and totter and fall into the arm of the bloated silenus for whose title she have barter she purely superficial charm yes upon mature deliberation that be precisely what billy decide to do follow dark day at selwoode frederick r wood tell margaret of what have occur and he add the information that as he wife 's nearest relative he intend to make she he heir then margaret do what i would scarcely have expect of margaret she turn upon he like a virago and inform frederick r wood precisely what she think of he she acquaint he with the fact that he be a sordid low-minded grasp beast and a miser and a tyrant and -lrb- i think -rrb- a parricide she notify he that he be thoroughly unworthy to wipe the dust off he nephew 's shoe -- a office toward which to do he justice he have never show any marked aspiration -- and that billy have act throughout in a most noble and sensible manner and that personally she would not marry billy wood if he be the last man on earth for she have always despise he and she add the information that she expect to die shortly and she hope they would both be sorry _ then _ and subsequently she clap the climax by throw she arm about he neck and burst into tear and tell he he be the dearest old man in the world and that she be thoroughly ashamed of herself so they kiss and make it up and after a little the colonel and margaret go away from selwoode and frederick r wood be leave alone to nourish he anger and indignation if he could and to hunger for he boy whether he would or not he be too proud to seek he out indeed he never think of that and so he wait alone in he fine house sick at heart impotent hope against hope that the boy would come back the boy never come no the boy never come because he be what the old man have make he -- headstrong and wilful and obstinate billy have be thoroughly spoil the old man have nurture he pride have applaud it as a mark of proper spirit and now it be this same pride that have rob he of the one thing he love in all the world so at last the weak point in the armor of this sturdy old pharisee be find and fate have pierce it gaily it be retribution if you will and i think that none of he victim in the street none of the countless widow and orphan that he have make suffer more bitterly than he in those last day it be almost two year after billy 's departure from selwoode that he body-servant come to rouse frederick r wood one June morning find he dead in he room he have be ail for some time it be he heart the doctor say and i think that it be though not precisely in the sense which they mean the man find he seat before he great carve desk on which he head and shoulder have fall forward they rest on a sheet of legal-cap paper half-covered with a calculation in he crabbed old hand as to the value of certain property -- the calculation which he never finish and underneath be a mass of miscellaneous papers among they he will date the day after billy leave selwoode in which frederick r wood bequeath he million unconditionally to margaret hugonin when she should come of age she twenty-first birthday have fall in the precede month so margaret be one of the richest woman in america and you may depend upon it that if many man have love she before they worship she now -- or at least say they do and after all they protestation be the only means she have of judge she might have be a countess -- and it must be own that the old colonel who have a honest anglo-saxon reverence for a title see this chance lose wistfully -- and she might have marry any number of grammarless gentleman personally unknown to she whose fervent proposal almost every mail bring in and besides these there be many other more orthodox in they woo some of whom be genuinely in love with margaret hugonin and some -- i grieve to admit it -- who be genuinely in love with she money and she would have none of they she refuse they all with the utmost civility as i happen to know how i learn it be no affair of yours for miss hugonin have remarkably keen eye which she use to advantage in the world about she they discover very little that she could admire she be none the happier for she wealth the piled-up million overshadow she personality and it be not long before she know that most people regard she simply as the heiress of the wood fortune -- a unavoidable encumbrance attach to the property which diver thrifty-minded gentleman be willing to put up with to put up with -- at the think she pride rise in a hot blush and it must be confess she seek consolation in the looking-glass she be a humble-minded young woman as the sex go and she see no great reason there why a man should go mad over margaret hugonin this decision i grant you be preposterous for there be any number of reason she final conclusion however be for the future to regard all man as fortune-hunter and to do she hair differently she carry out both resolution when a gentleman grow press in he attention she more than suspect he motive and when she eventually decline he it be do with perfect courtesy but the glow of she eye be at such time accentuate to a marked degree meanwhile the eagle brood undisturbed at selwoode miss hugonin would allow nothing to be alter the place do not belong to I attractive she would tell she father i belong to the place yes i do -- i be exactly like a little cow throw in with a little farm when they sell it and _ all _ my little suitor think so and they be very willing to take I on those term too but they sha not attractive i hate every single solitary man in the whole wide world but you beautiful and i particularly hate that horrid old eagle but we 'll keep he because he be a constant reminder to I that solomon or mose or whoever it be that say all man be liar be a person of _ very _ great intelligence so that i think we may fairly say the money do she no good if it benefit no one else it be not margaret 's fault she have a high sense of she responsibility and therefore at various time endeavor to further the spread of philanthropy and literature and theosophy and art and temperance and education and other laudable cause mr kennaston in he laugh manner be wont to jest at she varied enterprise and term she lady bountiful but then mr kennaston have no real conception of the proper use of money in fact he never think of money he admit this to margaret with a whimsical sigh margaret grow very fond of mr kennaston because he be not mercenary mr kennaston be much at selwoode many people come there now -- masculine woman and muscleless man for the most part they have every one of they some scheme for better the universe and if among they margaret seem somewhat out of place -- a butterfly among earnest-minded ant -- she heart be in every plan they advocate and they find she purse-strings infinitely elastic the girl be pitiably anxious to be of some use in the world so at selwoode they gossip of great cause and further the millenium and above they the eagle brood in silence and billy all this time billy be junket abroad where every year he paint masterpiece for the salon which -- on account of a nefarious conspiracy among certain artist jealous of he superior merit -- be invariably refuse now billy be back again in america and the colonel have insist that he come to selwoode and margaret be wait for he in the dog-cart the glow of she eye be very very bright she father 's careless word this morning couple with certain speech of mr kennaston 's last night have give she food for reflection he would not dare say margaret to no one in particular oh no he would not dare after what happen four year ago and margaret-like she have quite forget that what happen four year ago be all cause by she have flirt outrageously with teddy anstruther in order to see what billy would do iv the twelve forty-five for a wonder be on time and there descend from it a big blond young man who do not look in the least like a fortune-hunter miss hugonin resent this manifestly he look clean and honest for the deliberate purpose of deceive she very well she would show he he be quite unembarrassed he shake hand cordially then he shake hand with the groom who you may believe it be grin in a most unprofessional manner because master billy be back again at selwoode subsequently in he old decisive way he announce they would walk to the house as he leg need stretch the insolence of it -- quite as if he have something to say to margaret in private and could not wait a minute beyond doubt this be a young man who must be take down a peg or two and that at once of course she be not go to walk back with he -- a pretty figure they would cut stroll through the field like a house-girl and the milkman on a Sunday afternoon she would simply say she be too tired to walk and that would end the matter so she say she think the exercise would do they both good they come presently with desultory chat to a meadow bravely deck in all the gaud of spring about they the day be clear the air bland spring have revamp she ageless frippery of tender leave and bird-cry and sweet warm odour for the adornment of this meadow above it she have set a turki sky splash here and there with little cloud that be like whip cream and upon it she have scatter largesse a danaë 's shower of buttercup altogether she have make of it a particularly dangerous meadow for a man and a maid to frequent yet there mr wood pause under a burgeon maple -- pause resolutely with the lure of spring thick about he compass with every snare of scent and sound and color that the witch be mistress of margaret hope he have a pleasant passage over she father thank you be in the pink of condition oh yes she be quite well she hope mr wood would not find america -- well peggy say mr wood then we 'll have it out right here he insolence be so surprising that -- in order to recover herself -- margaret actually sit down under the maple-tree peggy indeed why she have not be call peggy for -- no not for four whole year because i intend to be friend you know say mr wood and about they the maple-leaf make a little island of sombre green around which more vivid grass ripple and dimple under the fitful spring breeze and everywhere leave lisp to one another and bird shrill insistently it be a perilous locality i fancy billy wood be out of he head when he suggest be friend in such a place friend indeed -- you would have think from the airy confidence with which he speak that margaret have come safely to forty year and wear steel-rimmed spectacles but miss hugonin merely cast down she eye and be aware of no reason why they should not be she be sure he must be hungry and she think luncheon must be ready by now in he soul mr wood observe that she lash be long -- long beyond all reason lack the number that petrarch flow in he do not venture even to himself to characterise they further but oh how queer it be they should be pure gold at the root -- she must have dip they in the ink-pot and oh the strong sudden bewildering curve of 'em he could not recall at the present moment ever notice quite such lash anywhere else no it be highly improbable that there be such lash anywhere else perhaps a few of the superior angel might have such lash he resolve for the future to attend church more regularly aloud mr wood observe that in that case they have better shake hand it would have be ridiculous to contest the point the dignified course be to shake hand since he insist on it and then to return at once to selwoode margaret hugonin have a pretty hand and mr wood as a artist could not well fail to admire it still he need not have look at it as though he have never before see anything quite like it he need not have neglect to return it and when miss hugonin reclaim it after a decent interval he need not have laugh in a manner that compel she to laugh too these thing be unnecessary and annoying as they cause margaret to forget that she despise he -lrb- illustration : then for no apparent reason margaret flush and billy think it vastly become -rrb- for the time be -- will you believe it -- she actually think he be rather nice i act like a ass say mr wood tragically oh yes i do you know but if you 'll forgive I for have be a ass i 'll forgive you for throw I over for teddy anstruther and at the wedding i 'll dance through any number of pair of patent-leather you choose to mention so that be the way he look at it teddy anstruther indeed why teddy be a dark little man with brown eye -- just the sort of man she most object to how could any one ever possibly fancy a brown-eyed man then for no apparent reason margaret flush and billy who have stretch he great length of limb on the grass beside she note it with a pair of the bluest eye in the world and think it vastly become billy say she impulsively -- and the name have slip out once by accident it would have be absurd to call he anything else afterward -- it be horrid of you to refuse to take any of that money but i do not want it he protest good lord i would only have do something foolish with it it be awfully square of you peggy to offer to divide but i do not want it you see i do not want to be a millionaire and give up the rest of my life to found library and explain to people that if they never spend any money on amusement they 'll have a great deal by the time they be too old to enjoy it i would rather paint picture so that i think margaret must have endeavor at some time to make he accept part of frederick r wood 's money you make I feel -- and look -- like a thief she reprove he then billy laugh a little you do not look in the least like one he reassure she you look like a uncommonly honest straightforward young woman mr wood add handsomely and i do not believe you would purloin under the severest temptation she thank he for he testimonial with all three dimple in evidence this be unsettling he hedge except perhaps -- say he yes query margaret after a pause however she question he with she head droop forward she brow raise and as this give he the full effect of she eye mr wood become quite certain that there be at least one thing she might be expect to rob he of and wisely decline to mention it margaret do not insist on know what it be perhaps she hear it thump under he waistcoat where it be behave very queerly so they sit in silence for a while then margaret fall a-humming to herself and the air -- will you believe it -- chance by the purest accident to be that foolish senseless old song they use to sing together four year ago billy chuckle let 's he obscurely plead spring prompt she oh where have you be billy boy query margaret 's wonderful contralto oh where have you be billy boy billy boy oh where have you be charming billy she sing it in a low hushed voice just over she breath not look at he however and oh what a voice think billy wood a voice that be honey and gold and velvet and all that be most sweet and rich and soft in the world find I another voice like that you _ prime donne _ find I a simile for it you uninventive poet indeed i would like to see you do it but he chime in nevertheless with he pleasant throaty baritone and lilt he own part quite creditably i have be to seek a wife she be the joy of my life she be a young thing and can not leave she mother -- only billy sing it father just as they use to do and then they sing it through do margaret and billy -- sing of the dimple in she chin and the ringlet in she hair and of the cherry pie she achieve with such celerity -- sing as they sit in the spring-decked meadow every word of that inane old song that be so utterly senseless and so utterly unforgettable it be a quite idiotic performance i set it down to the snare of spring -- to she insidious delightful snare of scent and sound and color that -- for the moment at least -- have trap these young people into loving life infinitely but i wonder who be responsible for that tatter of rhyme and melody that have come to they from nowhere in particular mr wood as he sit up at the conclusion of the singing vigorously to applaud would have share he last possession he ultimate crust with that unknown benefactor of mankind indeed though the heart of mr wood just now be full of loving kindness and capable of any freakish magnanimity for -- will it be believe -- mr wood who four year ago have throw over a fortune and exile himself from he native land rather than propose marriage to margaret hugonin have no sooner come again into she presence and look once into she perfectly fathomless eye than he could no more have leave she of he own accord than a moth can turn he back to a light candle he have fancy himself entirely cure of that boy-and-girl nonsense he broken heart after the first few month have not interfere in the least with a naturally healthy appetite and behold here be the old malady rage again in he vein and with renew fervor and all because the girl have a pretty face i think you will agree with I that in the conversation i have record margaret have not display any great wisdom or learning or tenderness or wit nor in fine any of the quality a man might naturally look for in a helpmate yet at the precise moment he hand he baggage-check to the groom mr wood have make up he mind to marry she in a instant he have fall head over ear in love or to whittle accuracy to a point he have discover that he have never fall out of love and if you have offer he a empress or fetch helen of troy from the grave for he delectation he would have laugh you to scorn in he defense i can only plead that margaret be a unusually beautiful woman it be all very well to flourish a death 's - head at the feast and bid my lady go paint herself a inch thick for to this favor she must come and it be quite true that the reddest lip in the universe may give vent to slander and lie and the brightest eye be set in the dullest head and the most roseate of complexion be purchase at the corner drug-store but say what you will a pretty woman be a pretty woman and while she continue so no amount of common-sense or experience will prevent a man on provocation from alluring coax even entreat she to make a fool of he we like it and i think they like it too so mr wood lose he heart on a fine spring morning and be unreasonably elate over the fact and margaret margaret be content v they talk for a matter of a half-hour in the fashion aforetime record -- not very wise nor witty talk if you will but very pleasant to make there be many pause there be much laughter over nothing in particular there be any number of sentence ambitiously begin that end nowhere altogether it be just the sort of talk for a man and a maid yet some twenty minute later mr wood prepare for luncheon in the privacy of he chamber give a sudden exclamation then he sit down and rumpled he hair thoroughly good lord he groan i would forget all about that damned money oh you ass -- you abject ass why she be one of the richest woman in america and you be only a fifth-rate painter with a paltry thousand or so a year _ you _ marry she -- why i dare say she be refuse a hundred better man than you she would think you be mad why she would think you be after she money she -- oh she would only think you a precious cheeky ass she would and she would be quite right you _ be _ a ass billy wood you ought to be lock up in some nice quiet stable where you heehawing would not disturb people you need a keeper you do he sit for some ten minute aghast afterward he rise and throw back he shoulder and draw a deep breath no we be not a ass he address he reflection in the mirror as he carefully knot he tie we be only a poor chuckle-headed moth who be be look at a star too long it be a bright star billy but it be not for you so we be go to be sensible now we be go to get a telegram to-morrow that will call we away from selwoode we be not come back any more either we be simply go to continue painting fifth-rate picture and hope that some day she 'll find the right man and be very very happy nevertheless he decide that a blue tie would look better and be very particular in arrange it at the same moment margaret stand before she mirror and tidy she hair for luncheon and assure she image in the glass that she be a weak-minded fool she point out to herself the undeniable fact that billy have formerly refuse to marry she -- oh ignominy -- seem pleasant-spoken enough now that she have become a heiress he refusal to accept part of she fortune be a very flimsy device it simply mean he hope to get all of it oh he do do he margaret powdered she nose viciously _ she _ saw through he he honest bearing she very plainly perceive to be the result of consummate hypocrisy in he laughter she keen ear detect a hollow ring and he courteous manner she find at bottom mere servility and finally she demonstrate -- to she own satisfaction at least -- that he charm of manner be of exactly the same sort that have be possess by many other eminently distinguish criminal how do she do this my dear sir you have best inquire of you mother or you sister or you wife or any other lady that you fancy dictate they know i be sure i do not and after it all -- oh dear dear say margaret i _ do _ wish he do not have such nice eye vi on the way to luncheon mr wood come upon adèle haggage and hugh van orden both of whom he know very much engross in one another in a nook under the stairway to billy it seem just now quite proper that every one should be in love be not it -- after all -- the most pleasant condition in the world so he greet they with a semi-paternal smile that cause adèle to flush a little for she be -- let we say interested -- in mr van orden that be tolerably well know in fact margaret -- prompt by mr haggage it must be confess -- have invite he to selwoode for the especial purpose of entertaining miss adèle haggage for he be a good match and mr haggage as a experienced chaperon know the value of country house very unexpectedly however the boy have develop a disconcerting tendency to fall in love with margaret who snub he promptly and unmercifully he have accordingly fall back on adèle and mr haggage have regain both she trust in providence and she temper in the breakfast-room where luncheon be lay out the colonel greet mr wood with the enthusiasm a sailor shipwreck on a desert island might conceivably display toward the boat-crew come to rescue he the colonel like billy and furthermore the poor colonel 's position at selwoode just now be not utterly unlike that of the suppositious mariner be i mind to venture into metaphor i should picture he as cling desperately to the rock of a old fogeyism and surround by welter sea of advanced thought colonel hugonin himself be not advance in he idea also he have forceful opinion as to the ultimate destination of those who be then billy be present to the man of the party -- mr felix kennaston and mr petheridge jukesbury mr haggage he know slightly and kathleen saumarez he have know very well indeed some six year previously before she have ever hear of miguel saumarez and when billy be still a undergraduate she be a widow now and not well-to-do and mr wood 's first thought on see she be that a man be a fool to write verse and that she look like just the sort of woman to preserve they he second be that he have verge on imbecility when he fancy he admire that slender dark-haired type a woman 's hair ought to be a enormous coronal of sunlight a woman ought to have very large candid eye of a color between that of sapphire and that of the spring heaven only infinitely more beautiful than either and all petticoated person differ from this description be manifestly quite unworthy of any serious consideration so he eye turn to margaret who have no eye for he she have forget he existence with a utterness that verge on ostentation and if it have be any one else billy would have surmise she be in a temper but that angel in a temper -- nonsense and oh what eye she have and what lash and what hair -- and altogether how adorable she be and what a wonder the admire god have not snatch she up to olympus long ago thus far mr wood but if miss hugonin be somewhat taciturn she counsellor in diver scheme for benefit the universe be in opulent vein billy hear they silently i have spend the entire morning by the lake mr kennaston inform the party at large in company with a mocking-bird who be practise a new aria it be a wonderful place the tree be lisping verse to themselves and the sky overhead be like a robin 's egg in color and a faint wind be make tuck and ruch and pleat all over the water quite as if the breeze have set up in business as mantua-maker i fancy they think they be work on a great sheet of blue silk for it be very like that and every once in a while a fish would leap and leave a splurge of bubble and foam behind that you would have swear be a insert lace medallion mr kennaston as you be doubtless aware be the author of the king 's quest and other volume of verse he be a full-bodied young man with hair of no particular shade and if he green eye be a little aged he manner be very youthful he voice in speaking be wonderfully please and he have a habit of cock he head on one side in a bird-like fashion indeed mr petheridge jukesbury observe it be very true that god make the country and man make the town a little more wine please mr jukesbury be a prominent worker in the cause of philanthropy and temperance he be ponderous and bland and for the rest he be president of the society for the suppression of nicotine and the nude vice-president of the anti-inebriation league secretary of the incorporated brotherhood of benevolence and the bearer of diver similar honor i be never really happy in the country mr saumarez dissent it remind I so constantly of we rural drama i be always afraid the quartette may come on and sing something kathleen eppe saumarez as i hope you do not need to be tell be the well-known lecturer before woman 's club and the author of many sympathetic story of nature and animal life of the kind that have have such a vogue of late there be always a indefinable air of pathos about she as hunston wyke put it one feel somehow that she mother have be of a domineering disposition and that she take after she father ah dear lady mr kennaston cry playfully you like many of we have become a alien to nature in you quest of a mere earthly paradox epigram be all very well but i fancy there be more happiness to be derive from a single impulse from a vernal wood than from a whole problem-play of smart saying so few of we be natural mr kennaston complain with a dulcet sigh we be too sophisticated we very speech lack the tang of outdoor life why should we not love nature -- the great mother who be i grant you the necessity of various useful invention in she angry mood but who in she kindly moment -- he pause with a wry face i beg you pardon say he but i believe i have catch rheumatism lie by that confound pond mr saumarez rally the poet with a pale smile that come of commune with nature she remind he and it serve you rightly for natural communication corrupt good epigram i prefer nature with wide margin and uncut leaf she speak in she best platform manner art should be a expurgated edition of nature with all the unpleasant part leave out and i be sure mr saumarez add handsomely and clinch she argument that mr kennaston give we much better sunset in he poem than i have ever see in the west he acknowledge this with a bow not sherry -- claret if you please say mr jukesbury art should be a expurgated edition of nature he repeat with a suave chuckle do you know i consider that admirably put mr saumarez -- admirably upon my word ah if we latter-day writer would only take that say to heart we do not need to be tell of the vice and corruption prevalent i be sorry to say among the very best people what we really need be continually to be remind of the fact that pure heart and home and happy face be to be find to-day alike in the palatial residence of the wealthy and in the humbler home of those less abundantly favor by fortune and yet dwelling together in harmony and christian resignation and -- er -- comparatively moderate circumstance surely mr saumarez protest art have nothing to do with morality art be a process you see a thing in a certain way you make you reader see it in the same way -- or try to if you succeed the result be art if you fail it may be the book of the year endure immortality and -- ah -- the patronage of the read public mr jukesbury placidly insist will be award in the end only to those who dwell upon the true the beautiful and the -- er -- respectable art must cheer it must be optimistic and edifying and -- ah -- suitable for young person it must have a uplift a leaven of righteousness a -- er -- a sort of moral baking-powder it must utterly eschew the -- ah -- unpleasant and repugnant detail of life it be if i may so express myself not at home in the ménage à troi or -- er -- the representation of the nude yes another glass of claret if you please i quite agree with you say mr haggage in she deep voice sarah ellen haggage be of course the well-known author of child-labour in the south and the down-trodden afro-american and other notable contribution to literature she be also the madame president both of the society for the betterment of civic government and sewerage and of the lady ' league for the edification of the impecunious and i be glad to see mr haggage presently go on that the literature of the day be so largely begin to chronicle the saying and doings of the labor class the virtue of the humble must be admit in spite of they dissolute and unhygienic tendency yes mrs haggage add meditatively we literature be undoubtedly acquire a more elevated tone at last we be shake off the scintillant and unwholesome influence of the french ah the french sigh mr kennaston a people who think depravity the soul of wit they art be mere artfulness they care nothing for nature no mr haggage assent they prefer nastiness _ all _ french book be immoral i run across one the other day that be simply hideously indecent -- unfit for a modest woman to read and i can assure you that none of its author 's other book be any better i purchase the entire set at once and read they carefully in order to make sure that i be perfectly justified in warn my working-girl ' class against they i wish to misjudge no man -- not even a member of a nation notoriously devote to absinthe and illicit relation she breathe heavily and look at mr wood as if somehow he be responsible then she give the name of the book to petheridge jukesbury he wish to have it place on the _ index expurgatorius _ of the brotherhood of benevolence he say dear dear felix kennaston sigh as mr jukesbury make a note of it you be all so practical you perceive a evil and proceed at once in you common-sense way to crush it to stamp it out now i can merely lament certain unfortunate tendency of the age i be quite unable to contend against they do you know mr kenneston continue gaily as he trifle with a bunch of grape i feel horribly out-of-place among you here be mrs saumarez create a epidemic of useful and improve knowledge throughout the country by means of she charming lecture here be mrs haggage the mainspring if i may say so of any number of educational and philanthropic alarm clock which will some day rouse the sleep public from its lethargy and here be my friend jukesbury whose eloquent plea for a higher life have turn so many workman from gin and improvidence and which in a print form be disseminate even in such remote region as africa where i be tell they have produce the most satisfactory result upon the unsophisticated but polygamous monarch of that continent and here above all be miss hugonin utilise the vast power of money -- which i be credibly inform be a very good thing to have though i can not pretend to speak from experience -- and cast whole bakeryful of bread upon the water of charity and here be i the idle singer of a empty day -- a mere drone in this hive of philanthropic bee dear dear say mr kennaston enviously what a thing it be to be practical and he laugh toward margaret in he whimsical way miss hugonin have be strangely silent but she return mr kennaston 's smile and begin to take part in the conversation you be only a ignorant child she rebuke he and a very naughty child too to make fun of we in this fashion yes mr kennaston assent i be wilfully ignorant the world adore ignorance and where ignorance be kiss it be folly to be wise to-morrow i shall read you a chapter from my ` defense of ignorance ' which my confiding publisher be go to bring out in the autumn so the table-talk go on and now margaret bear a part therein \* \* \* \* \* however i do not think we need record it further mr wood listen in a sort of a daze adèle haggage and hugh van orden be converse in low tone at one end of the table the colonel be eat he luncheon silently and with a certain air of resignation and so billy wood be leave alone to attend and marvel the idea they advance seem to he for the most part sensible what puzzle he be the uniform gravity which they accord equally -- as it appear to he -- to the discussion of the most pompous platitude and of the most arrant nonsense they be always serious and the general tone of infallibility billy think could be warrant only by a vast fund of inexperience but in the main they advocate theory he have always hold -- excellent theory he consider and he be seize with a unreasonable desire to repudiate every one of they for it seem to he that every one of they be aim at margaret 's approval it do not matter to whom a remark be ostensibly address -- always at its conclusion the speaker glance more or less openly toward miss hugonin she be the audience to which they zealously play think billy and he wonder i think i have say that owe to the smallness of the house-party luncheon be serve in the breakfast-room the dining-room at selwoode be very rarely use because margaret declare its size make a meal there equivalent to eat out-of-door and i must confess that the breakfast-room be far cosier the room in the first place be of reasonable dimension it be hang with flemish tapestry from design by van eyck represent the four season but the wall and ceiling be panel in oak and over the mantel carve in bas-relief the inevitable eagle be display the mantel stand behind margaret 's chair and over she golden head half-protectingly half-threateningly with he wing outstretch to the uttermost the eagle brood as he have once brood over frederick r wood the old man sit contentedly beneath that symbol of what he have achieve in life he have start -lrb- as the phrase run -rrb- from nothing he have make himself a power to he the eagle mean that crude incalculable power of wealth he glory in and to billy wood the eagle mean identically the same thing and -- i be sorry to say -- he begin to suspect that the eagle be really the audience to whom miss hugonin 's friend so zealously play perhaps the misanthropy of mr wood be not wholly unconnected with the fact that margaret never look at he _ she would _ show he -- the fortune-hunter so she eye never stray toward he and she attention never leave he at the end of luncheon she could have enumerate for you every morsel he have eat every glare he have direct toward kennaston every beseech look he have turn to she of course he have take sherry -- dry sherry have not he tell she four year ago -- it be the first day she have ever wear the white organdie dot with purple sprig and they sit by the lake so late that afternoon that frederick r wood finally send for they to come to dinner -- have not he tell she then that only woman and child care for sweet wine of course he have -- the villain -lrb- illustration : billy wood -rrb- billy too have he emotion to hear that paragon that queen among woman descant of work do in the slum and of the mystery of sweat-shop to hear she state off-hand that there be seventeen hundred and fifty thousand child between the age of ten and fifteen year employ in the mine and factory of the united state to hear she discourse of foreign mission as glibly as though she have be bear and nurture in zambesus land : all these thing fill he with a odd sense of alienation he be not worthy of she and that be a fact he be only a dumb idiot and half the word that be fall thick and fast from philanthropic lip about he might as well have be hailstone for all the benefit he be derive from they he could not understand half she say in consequence he very cordially detest the people who could -- especially that grimace ass kennaston altogether neither mr wood nor miss hugonin get much comfort from they luncheon vii after luncheon billy have a quiet half-hour with the colonel in the smoking-room say billy between puff of a cigar : peggy 's change a bit the colonel grunt perhaps he dare not trust to word seem to have make some new friend a more vigorous grunt culture lot they seem say mr wood anxious to do good in the world too -- philanthropic set eh a snort this time eh say mr wood there be dawn suspicion in he tone the colonel look about he my boy say he you thank you star you do not get that money and depend upon it there never be a gold-ship yet that be not follow pirate billy wood suggest helpfully pirate be human being say colonel hugonin with dignity shark my boy shark viii that evening after proper deliberation célestine miss hugonin command get out that little yellow dress with the little red bandanna handkerchief on it and for heaven 's sake stop pull my hair out by the root unless you want a _ rave _ maniac on you hand célestine whereby she have land I in a quandary for how pray be it possible for I a simple-minded male fittingly to depict for you the clothes of margaret -- the innumerable vanity the quaint device the pleasing conceit with which she delight to enhance she comeliness the thing be beyond I let we keep discreetly out of she wardrobe you and i otherwise i should have to prattle of a infinity of mystery -- of she scarf feather lace glove girdle knot hat shoe fan and slipper -- of she embroidery ring pin pendant ribbon spangle bracelet and chain -- in fine there would be no end to the list of gewgaw that go to make margaret hugonin even more adorable than nature have fashion she for when you come to think of it it take the craft and skill and life-work of a thousand man to dress one girl properly and in margaret 's case i protest that every one of they could he have behold the result of they unite labor would have so gloried in he own part therein that there would have be no put up with any of the lot yet when i think of the tiny shoe she affect -- patent-leather one mostly with a seam run straight up the middle -lrb- and you may guess the exact date of we comedy by know in what year these shoe be modish -rrb- the string of fat pearl she so often wear about she round full throat the white frock say with arabesque of blue all over it that felix kennaston say remind he of ruskin 's tombstone or that other white-and-blue one -- _ décolleté _ that be -- which i swear seraphic mantua-maker have weave out of mist and the sky of June : when i remember these thing i repeat almost be i tempt to become a boot-maker and a lapidary and a milliner and in fine a adept in all the other art and trade and science that go to make a well-groomed american girl what she be -- the incredible fruit of graft century the period after the list of time 's achievement -- just that i might describe margaret to you properly but the thing be beyond I i leave such consideration then to célestine and resolve for the future rigorously to eschew all such gaud meanwhile if a untutored masculine description will content you -- margaret i have on reliable feminine authority be one of the very few blonde whose complexion can carry off red and yellow this particular gown -- i remember it perfectly -- be of a dim dull yellow -- flounciful -lrb- if i may coin a word -rrb- diaphanous expansive i have not the least notion what fabric compose it but scatter about it in unexpected place be diamond-shaped red thing that i be credibly inform be call medallion the general effect of it may be briefly characterise as grateful to the eye and dangerous to the heart and to a rational train of thought quite fatal for it be cut low in the neck and margaret 's neck and shoulder would have draw madrigal from a bench of bishop and in consequence billy wood eat absolutely no dinner that evening ix it be a hour or two later when the moon drift tardily up from the south find miss hugonin and mr kennaston chat amicably together in the court at selwoode they be discuss the deplorable tendency of the modern drama the court at selwoode lie in the angle of the build the ground plan of which be l-shaped its two outer side be form by covered cloister lead to the palm-garden and by moonlight -- the night bland and sweet with the odour of grow thing vocal with plash fountain spangle with fire-fly that flicker indolently among a glimmering concourse of nymph and faun eternally posture in flight or in pursuit -- by moonlight i say the court at selwoode be perhaps as satisfactory a spot for a _ tête-à-tête _ as this transitory world afford mr kennaston be in vein to-night he scintillate he be also a little nervous this be probably owe to the fact that margaret lean against the back of the stone bench on which they both sit she chin prop by she hand be gaze at he in that peculiar intent fashion of hers which -- as i think i have mention -- cause you fatuously to believe she have forget there be any other trousered being extant mr kennaston however stick to apt phrase and nice distinction the moon find it edifying but rather dull after a little mr kennaston pause in he boyish ebullient speech and they sit in silence the lisping of the fountain be very audible in the heaven the moon climb a little further and register a manifestly impossible hour on the sun-dial it also brighten it be a companionable sort of a moon it invite talk of a confidential nature bless my soul it be signalling to any number of gentleman at that moment there be only you and i and the girl here speak out man she 'll have you now if she ever will you 'll never have a chance like this again i can tell you come now my dear boy i be shine full in you face and you have no idea how become it be i be not like that garish blunder sun who do not know any better than to let she see how red and fidgetty you get when you be excite i be a old hand at such matter i have preside over these little affair since babylon be a paltry village _ i 'll _ never tell and -- and if anything should happen i be always ready to go behind a cloud you know so speak out -- speak out man if you have the heart of a mouse thus far the conscienceless spring moon mr kennaston sigh the moon take this as a promising sign and brighten over it perceptibly and thereby afford he a excellent gambit yes say margaret what be it beautiful that in privacy be she fantastic name for he the poet laugh a little beautiful child say he -- and that under similar circumstance be he perfectly reasonable name for she -- i have be discourteous to be frank i have be sulk as irrationally as a baby who clamor for the moon yonder you be not really anything but a baby you know indeed margaret almost think of he as such he be so delightfully naïf he bent toward she a faint tremor wake in he speech and so say he softly i cry for the moon -- the unattainable exquisite moon it be very ridiculous be it not but he do not look at the moon he look toward margaret -- past margaret toward the gleaming window of selwoode where the eagle brood : oh i really can not say margaret cry in haste she be kind to endymion you know we will hope for the best i think we would better go into the house

I awfully awfully tired with which characteristic speech miss hugonin lean back and sit up very rigidly and smile at he like a cherub kennaston groan it shall be as you will he assure she with a little quaver in he speech that be decidedly effective and in any event i be not sorry that i have love you beautiful child you have always be a power for good in my life you have gladden I with the vision of a beauty that be more than human you have hearten I for this petty business of live you have praise my verse you have even accord I certain pecuniary assistance as to they publication --

forget the great barrier that stand between we he gasp and take a short turn about the court pardon I miss hugonin he entreat when he emotion be under a little better control for have speak as i do i have forget think of I if you will as no better than the other -- think of I as a mere fortune-hunter my presumption will be justly punish oh no no it be not that she cry it be not that be it you -- you would care just as much about I if i be poor would not you beautiful i do not want you to care for I of course margaret add with haste i want to go on be friend oh that money that _ nasty _ money she cry in a sudden gust of petulance it make I so distrustful and i can not help it he smile at she wistfully my dear say he be there no mirror at selwoode to remove you doubt i -- yes i do believe in you she say at length but i do not want to marry you you see i be not a bit in love with you margaret explain candidly ensue a silence mr kennaston bow he head you bid I go say he no -- not exactly say she he indicate a movement toward she now you need not attempt to take any liberty with I miss hugonin announce decisively because if you do i 'll never speak to you again you must let I go now you -- you must let I think then felix kennaston act very wisely he rise and stand aside with a little bow i can wait child he say sadly i have already wait a long time miss hugonin escape into the house without further delay it be very flattering of course he have speak beautifully she think and nobly and poetically and considerately and altogether there be absolutely no excuse for she being in a temper still she be the moon however consider the affair as arrange for she have be no whit more resolute in she refusal you see than become any self-respecting maid in fact she have not refuse he and the experienced moon have see the hope of many a wooer thrive chameleon-like on answer far less encouraging than that which margaret have give felix kennaston margaret be very fond of he all woman like a man who can do a picturesque thing without bother to consider whether or not he be make himself ridiculous and more than once in thinking of he she have wonder if -- perhaps -- possibly -- some day -- and always these vague flight of fancy have end at this precise point -- incinerate if you will grant I the simile by the sudden flaming of she cheek the thing be common enough you may remember that romeo be not the only gentleman that juliet notice at she début : there be the young petruchio and the son and heir of old tiberio and i do not question that she have a kind glance or so for county pari beyond doubt there be many with whom my lady have dance with whom she have laugh a little with whom she have exchange a few perfectly affable word and look -- when of a sudden she heart speak : who be he that would not dance if he be marry my grave be like to prove my marriage-bed in any event pari and petruchio and tiberio 's young hopeful can go hang romeo have come romeo be seldom the first pray you what be there to prevent juliet from admire so-and-so 's dancing or from observe that signor such-an-one have remarkably expressive eye or from thinking of tybalt as a dear reckless fellow whom it be the duty of some good woman to rescue from perdition if no one blame the young montague for send rosaline to the right-about -- rosaline for whom he be weep and rhyme a hour before -- why pray should not signorina capulet have have a few previous _ affaire du coeur _ depend upon it she have for be she not already past thirteen in like manner i dare say that a deal pass between desdemona and cassio that the honest moor never know of and that lucrece be probably very pleasant and agreeable to tarquin as a well-bred hostess should be and that helen have that little affair with theseus before she ever think of pari and that if cleopatra die for love of antony it be not until she have previously live a great while with cæsar so felix kennaston have he hour now margaret have go into selwoode flame-faced and quite unconscious that she be hum under she breath the word of a certain inane old song : oh she sit for I a chair she have ringlet in she hair she be a young thing and can not leave she mother -- only she sing it father and afterward she suddenly frown and stamp she foot do margaret i _ hate _ he say she but she look very guilty x in the living-hall of selwoode miss hugonin pause undeniably there be the account of the lady ' league for the edification of the impecunious to be put in order she monthly report as treasurer be due in a few day and margaret be in such matter a careful painstaking body and not wholly dependent upon she secretary but she be entirely too much out of temper to attend to that now it be really all mr kennaston 's fault she assure a prick conscience as she go out on the terrace before selwoode he have bother she dreadfully there she find petheridge jukesbury smoking placidly in the effulgence of the moonlight and the rotund pasty countenance he turn toward she be ludicrously like the moon 's counterfeit in muddy water i be sorry to admit it but mr jukesbury have dine somewhat injudiciously you be not to stretch the phrase he be merely prepare to accord the universe he approval to pat destiny upon the head and he thought run clear enough but with aprilian counter-change of the jovial and the lachrymose ah miss hugonin he greet she with a genial smile i be indeed fortunate you find I deep in meditation and also i be sorry to say in the practice of a most pernicious habit you do not object ah that be so like you you be always kind miss hugonin you kindness which fall if i may so express myself as the gentle rain from heaven upon all deserving charitable institution and daily comfort the destitute with good advice and console the sorrowing with blanket would now induce you to tolerate a odour which i be sure be personally distasteful to you but _ really _ i do not mind be margaret 's protest i can not permit it mr jukesbury insist and wave a pudgy hand in the moonlight no really i can not permit it we will throw it away if you please and say no more about it and he glance follow the glowing flight of he cigar-end somewhat wistfully you father 's cigar be such as it be seldom my privilege to encounter but then my personal habit be not luxurious nor my private income precisely what my childish imagining have picture it at this comparatively advanced period of life ah youth youth -- as the poet admirably say miss hugonin the thought of youth be long long thought but its vision of existence be rose-tinged and free from care and its conception of the responsibility of manhood -- such as tax and the water-rate -- i may safely characterise as extremely sketchy but pray be seat miss hugonin petheridge jukesbury blandly urge common courtesy force she to comply so margaret seat herself on a little red rustic bench in the moonlight -- but i think i have mention how margaret look in the moonlight and above she golden head the eagle sculpture over the door-way stretch he wing to the uttermost half-protectingly half-threateningly and seem to view mr jukesbury with a certain air of expectation a beautiful evening petheridge jukesbury suggest after a little cogitation she concede that this be undeniable where nature smile and only the conduct of man be vile and altogether what it ought not to be he continue with unction -- ah how true that be and how console it be a good thing to meditate upon we own vileness miss hugonin -- to reflect that we be but worm with naturally the most vicious inclination it be most salutary even i be but a worm miss hugonin though the press have be please to speak most kindly of I even you -- ah no cry mr jukesbury kiss he finger-tip with gallantry let we say a worm who have burst its cocoon and become a butterfly -- a butterfly with a charming face and a most charitable disposition and considerable property margaret thank he with a smile and begin to think wistfully of the lady ' league account still he be a good man and she endeavor to persuade herself that she consider he goodness to atone for he flabbiness and he fleshiness and he interminable verbosity -- which she do not mr jukesbury sigh a naughty world say he with pathos -- a very naughty world which really do not deserve the honor of include you in its census report yet i dare say it have the effrontery to put you down in the tax-list it even put I down -- I a humble worker in the vineyard with both hand set to the plough and if i do not pay up it sell I out a very naughty world indeed i dare say mr jukesbury observe raise he eye -- not toward heaven but toward the eagle that its conduct as the poet say create considerable distress among the angel i do not know i be not acquaint with many angel my wife be a angel but she be now a lifeless form she have be for five year i erect a tomb to she at considerable personal expense but i do not begrudge it -- no i do not begrudge it miss hugonin she be very hard to live with but she be a angel and angel be rare miss hugonin say petheridge jukesbury with emphasis _ you _ be a angel oh dear _ dear _ say margaret to herself i do wish i would go to bed directly after dinner above they the eagle brood surely he breathe you must know what i have so long want to tell you -- no say margaret and i do not want to know please you make I awfully tire and i do not care for you in the _ least _ now you let go my hand -- let go at once he detain she you be a angel he insist -- a angel with a large property i love you margaret be mine -- be my blush bride i entreat you you property be far too large for a angel to look after you need a man of affair i be a man of affair i be forty-five and have no bad habit my press-notice be as a rule favourable my eloquence be account considerable and my dearest aspiration be that you will comfort my decline year i might add that i adore you but i think i mention that before margaret will you be my blush bride no say miss hugonin emphatically no you tipsy old beast -- no there be a rustle of skirt the door slam and the philanthropist be leave alone on the terrace xi in the living-hall margaret come upon hugh van orden who be search in one of the alcove for a piece of music that adèle haggage want and have misplace the boy greet she miserably miss hugonin he lament you be awfully hard on I i be sorry say margaret that you consider I discourteous to a guest in my own house oh i grant you margaret be in a temper now it be not that he protest but i never see you alone and i have have something to tell you yes say she coldly he draw near to she surely he breathe you must know what i have long want to tell you -- yes i should think i _ do _ say margaret and if you dare tell I a word of it i 'll never speak to you again it be get a little monotonous good-night mr van orden half way up the stair she pause and run lightly back oh hugh hugh she say contritely i be unpardonably rude i be sorry dear but it be quite impossible you be a dear cute little boy and i love you -- but not that way so let 's shake hand hugh and be friend and then you can go and play with adèle he raise she hand to he lip he really be a nice boy but oh dear say margaret when he have go what horrid creature man be and what a temper i be in and what a vexatious place the world be i wish i be a pauper i wish i have never be bear and i wish -- and i wish i have those league papers fix i 'll do it to-night i be sure i need something tranquillise like assessment and decimal place and unpaid due to keep I from _ scream _ i hate they all -- all three of they -- as badly as i do _ he _ thereupon she blush for no apparent reason and go to she own room in a frame of mind that be inexcusable but very become she cheek burn she eye flash with a brighter glow that be gem-like and a little cruel and she chin tilted up defiantly margaret have a resolute chin a masculine chin i fancy that it be only at the last moment that nature find it a thought too boyish and modify it with a dimple -- a very creditable dimple by the way that she must have be really proud of that ridiculous little dint save it feminise it altogether then she sweep down upon the papers of the lady ' league for the edification of the impecunious with very much the look of a diminutive valkyrie -- a valkyrie of unusual personal attraction you understand -- _ en route _ for the battle-field and a little a very little eager and expectant of the strife subsequently oh dear _ dear _ say she amid a feverish rustling of papers the whole world be out of sort to-night i never _ do _ know how much seven time eight be and i hate everybody and i have leave that list of unpaid due in uncle fred 's room and i have get to go after it and i do not want to bother those little suitor of mine miss hugonin rise and go out from she own room carry a bunch of key across the hallway to the room in which frederick r wood have die it be he study you may remember it have be little use since he death but margaret keep she less important papers there -- the overflow the flotsam of she vast philanthropic and educational correspondence and there she find billy wood xii he back be turn to the door as she enter he be stare at a picture beside the mantel -- a portrait of frederick r wood -- and he eye when he wheel about be wistful then on a sudden they light up as if they have catch fire from hers and he adoration flaunt crimson banner in he cheek and he heart i dare say be a great blaze of happiness he love she you see when she enter a room it really make a difference to this absurd young man he see a great many light for instance and hear music and accordingly he laugh now in a very contented fashion i be not burglarise say he -- that be not exactly i ought to have ask you permission i suppose before come here but i could not find you and -- and it be rather important you see mr wood continue point to the great carve desk i happen to speak of this desk to the colonel to-night we -- we be talk of uncle fred 's death and i find out quite by accident that it have not be search since then -- that be not thoroughly there be secret drawer you see one here and he touch the spring that throw it open and the other on this side there be -- there be nothing of importance in they only receipt bill and such the other drawer be inside that center compartment which be lock the colonel would not come he say it be all foolishness and that he have a book he want to read so he send I after what he call my mare 's nest it be not you see -- no not quite not quite mr wood murmur with a odd smile and then laugh and add lamely : i -- i suppose i be the only person who know about it mr wood 's manner be a think strange he stammer a little in speak he laugh unnecessarily and margaret could see that he hand tremble take he all in all you would have swear he be repress some vital emotion but he do not seem unhappy -- no not exactly unhappy he be with margaret you see oh you beauty he meditation run he have some excuse in the soft rosy twilight of the room -- the study at selwoode be panel in very dark oak and the door and window be screen with crimson hanging -- she parti-coloured red-and-yellow gown might have be a scrap of afterglow leave over from a unusually fine sunset in a word miss hugonin be a very quaint and colorful and delectable figure as she come a little further into the room she eye shine like blue star and she hair shone -- there must be pound of it billy think -- and she very shoulder plump flawless ineffable shone with the glow of a errant cloud-tatter that be just past the track of dawn and be therefore neither pink nor white but manage somehow to combine the best point of both color ah indeed say miss hugonin she tone impart a surprising degree of chilliness to this simple remark no she go on very formally this be not a private room you owe I no apology for be here indeed i be rather oblige to you mr wood for none of we know of these secret drawer here be the key to the central compartment if you will be kind enough to point out the other one dear dear margaret conclude languidly all this be quite like a third-rate melodrama i have not the least doubt you will discover a will in there in you favor and be reinstate as the long-lost heir and all that sort of thing how tiresome that will be for I though she be in a mood to be cruel to-night she hold out the key to he in a disinterested fashion and drop they daintily into he outstretched palm just as she might have give a coin to a unusually grimy mendicant but the tip of she finger graze he hand that do the mischief she least touch be enough to set every nerve in he body a-tingle peggy he say hoarsely as the key jangle to the floor then mr wood draw a little nearer to she and say peggy peggy in a voice that tremble curiously and appear to have no intention of say anything further indeed word would have seem mere tautology to any one who could have see he eye margaret look into they for a minute and she own eye fall before they blaze and she heart -- very foolishly -- stand still for a breathing-space subsequently she recall the fact that he be a fortune-hunter and that she despise he and also observe -- to she surprise and indignation -- that he be hold she hand and have apparently be do so for some time you may believe it that she withdraw that pink-and-white trifle angrily enough pray do not be absurd mr wood say she billy catch up the word absurd he echo -- yes that describe what i have be pretty well do not it peggy i _ be _ absurd when i let you send I to the right-about four year ago i realize that to-day the moment i see you i should have hold on like the very grimmest death i should have bully you into marry I if necessary and in spite of fifty anstruther oh yes i know that now but i be only a boy then peggy and so i let a boy 's pride come between we i know now there be not any question of pride where you be concern -- not any question of pride nor of any silly misunderstanding nor of any uncle 's wish nor of anything but just you peggy it be just you that i care for now -- just you ah margaret cry with a swift intake of the breath that be almost a sob he have dare after all oh it be shameless sordid and yet -lrb- she think dimly -rrb- how dear that little quiver in he voice have be be it unplanned -- and how she could have love this big eager boy be he not the hypocrite she know he _ she would _ show he but somehow -- though it be manifestly what he deserve -- she find she could not look he in the face while she do it so she drop she eye to the floor and wait for a moment of tense silence then be i to consider this a proposal mr wood she ask in muffle tone billy stare yes say he very gravely after a interval you see she explain still in the same dull voice you phrase it so vaguely i could not well be certain you do not propose very well mr wood i -- i have have opportunity to become a authority on such matter you see since i have be rich that make a difference do not it a great many man be willing to marry I now who would not have think of such a thing say -- say four year ago so i have have some experience oh yes three -- three _ person _ have offer to marry I for my money earlier in this very evening -- before you do mr wood and really i can not compliment you on you method mr wood they be a little vague a little abrupt a little transparent do not you think peggy he cry in a frightened whisper he could not believe you see that it be the woman he love who be speak and for my part i admit frankly that at this very point if ever in she life margaret deserve a thorough shake dear I she airily observe i be sure i have say nothing out of the way i think it speak very well for you that you be so fond of you old home -- so anxious to regain it at _ any _ cost it be quite touching mr wood she raise she eye toward he i dare say she be suffer as much as he but woman consider it a point of honor to smile when they stab margaret smile with a innocence that would have seem overdo in a angel then in a instant she have the grace to be abjectly ashamed of herself billy 's face have go white he mouth be set mask-like and he breathing be a little perfunctory it sting she though that he be not angry he be sorry i -- i see he say very carefully you think i -- want the money yes -- i see and why not she query pleasantly dear I money 's a very sensible thing to want i be sure it make a great difference you know he look down into she face for a moment one might have swear this detect fortune-hunter pity she yes he assent slowly it make a difference -- not a difference for the better i be afraid peggy ensue a silence then margaret toss she head she be fast lose she composure she would have give the world to retract what she have say and accordingly she resolve to brazen it out you need not look at I as if i be a convict criminal she say sharply i will not marry you and there be a end of it it be not that i be think of say mr wood with a grave smile you see it take I a little time to realize you honest opinion of I i believe i understand now you think I a very hopeless cad -- that be about you real opinion be not it peggy i do not know that you see i think you know I better than that you do once peggy -- once a long time ago and -- and i hope you have not quite forget that time the allusion be ill choose oh oh _ oh _ she cry gasp _ you _ to remind I of that time -- you of all man have not you a vestige of shame have not you a rag of honor leave oh i do not know there be such man in the world and to think -- to think -- margaret 's glorious voice break and she wring she hand helplessly then after a little she raise she eye to he and speak without a trace of emotion to think she say and she voice be toneless now to think that i love you it be that that hurt you know for i love you very dearly billy wood -- yes i think i love you quite as much as any woman can ever love a man you be the first you see and girl -- girl be very foolish about such thing i think you be brave and strong and clean and honest and beautiful and dear -- oh quite the best and dearest man in the world i think you billy wood that -- that be queer be not it she ask with a listless little shiver yes it be very queer you do not think of I in quite that way do you no you -- you think i be well enough to amuse you for a while i be well enough for a summer flirtation be not i billy but marriage -- ah no you never think of marriage then you run away when uncle fred suggest that you refuse point-blank -- refuse in this very room -- do not you billy ah that -- that hurt margaret end with a faint smile yes it -- hurt billy wood raise a protest hand as though to speak but afterward he draw a deep tremulous breath and bit he lip and be silent she have speak very quietly very simply very like a tired child now she voice lift but you have hurt I more to-night she say equably -- to-night when you have come cringe back to I -- to I whom you would have none of when i be poor i be rich now though that make a difference do not it billy you be willing to whistle back the girl 's love you fling away once -- yes quite willing but can not you understand how much it must hurt I to think i ever love you margaret ask very gently she want he to understand she want he to be ashamed she pray god that he might be just a little little bit ashamed so that she might be able to forgive he but he stand silent bend puzzle brow toward she can not you understand billy she plead softly i can not help see what a cur you be i must hate you billy -- of course i must she insist very gently as though argue the matter with herself then suddenly she sob and wring she hand in anguish oh i can not i can not she wail god help I i can not hate you even though i know you for what you be he arm lift a little and in a flash margaret know that what she most want in all the world be to have they close about she and then to lay she head upon he shoulder and cry contentedly oh she do want to forgive he if he have lose all sense of shame why could he not lie to she surely he could at least lie and oh how gladly she would believe -- only the tiniest the flimsiest fiction she eye crave of he but he merely say i see -- i see very slowly and then smile we 'll put the money aside just now he say perhaps after a little we -- we 'll come back to that i think you have forget though that when -- when uncle fred and i have we difference you have just throw I over -- have just order I never to speak to you again i could not very well ask you to marry I could i under those circumstance i speak in a moment of irritation a very dignified margaret point out you would have pay no attention whatever to it if you have really -- care billy laugh rather sadly oh i care right enough he say i still care the question be -- do you no say margaret with decision i do not -- not in the _ least _ peggy mr wood command look at I you have have you answer i think miss hugonin indifferently observe billy catch she chin in he hand and turn she face to he peggy do you -- care he ask softly and margaret look into he honest-seeming eye and in a panic know that she traitor lip be form yes that would be rather unfortunate would not it she ask with a smile you see it be only a hour ago i promise to marry mr kennaston kennaston billy gasp you -- you do not mean that you care for _ he _ peggy i really can not see why it should concern you say margaret sweetly but since you ask -- i do you could not expect I to remain inconsolable forever you know then the room blur before she eye she stand rigid defiant she be dimly aware that billy be speak speak from a great distance it seem and then after a century or two he face come back to she out of the whirl of thing and though she do not know it they be smile bravely at one another -- and so mr wood be state i have be a even greater ass than usual and i hope you 'll be very very happy -lrb- illustration : billy unfold it slowly with a puzzle look grow in he countenance -rrb- thank you she return mechanically i -- i hope so after a interval good-night peggy say mr wood oh -- good-night say she with a start he turn to go then by jove say he grimly i have be so busy make a ass of myself i would forget all about more -- more important thing mr wood pick up the key and go to the desk unlock the center compartment with a jerk afterward he give a sharp exclamation he have find a paper in the secret drawer at the back which appear to startle he billy unfold it slowly with a puzzle look grow in he countenance then for a moment margaret 's golden head draw close to he yellow curl and they read it through together and in the most melodramatic and improbable fashion in the world they find it to be the last will and testament of frederick r wood but -- but i do not understand be miss hugonin 's awed comment it be exactly like the other will only -- why it be date the seventeenth of June the day before he die and it be witness by hodge and burton -- the butler and the first footman you know -- and they have never say anything about such a paper and then why should he have make another will just like the first billy ponder by and bye i think i can explain that he say in a rather peculiar voice you see hodge and burton witness all he papers half the time without know what they be about they would hardly have think of this particular one after he death and it be not quite the same will as the other it leave you practically everything but it do not appoint any trustee as the other do because this will be draw up after you be of age moreover it contain these four bequest to college to establish a wood chair of ethnology which the other will do not provide for of course it would have be simpler merely to add a codicil to the first will but uncle fred be always very methodical i -- i think he be probably go through the desk the night he die destroy various papers he must have take the other will out to destroy it just -- just before he die perhaps -- perhaps -- billy pause for a little and then laugh unmirthfully it scarcely matter say he here be the will it be undoubtedly genuine and undoubtedly the last he make you 'll have to have it probated peggy and settle with the college it -- it will not make much of a hole in the wood million there be a half-humorous bitterness in he voice that margaret note silently so -lrb- she think -rrb- he have hope for a moment that at the last frederick r wood have relent toward he it grieve she in a dull fashion to see he so mercenary it grieve she -- though she would have deny it emphatically -- to see he so disappointed since he want the money so much she would have like for he to have have it worthless as he be for the sake of the boy he have be thank you she say coldly as she take the paper i will give it to my father he will do what be necessary good-night mr wood then she lock up the desk in a businesslike fashion and turn to he and hold out she hand good-night billy say this perfectly inconsistent young woman for a moment i think uncle fred have alter he will in you favor i almost wish he have billy smile a little that would never have do he say gravely as he shake hand you forget what a sordid and heartless and generally good-for-nothing chap i be peggy it be much better as it be only the tiniest the flimsiest fiction she eye crave of he even now at the eleventh hour lie to I billy wood and oh how gladly i will believe but he merely say good-night peggy and go out of the room he broad shoulder have a pathetic droop a listlessness margaret be glad of course she be glad at last she have tell he exactly what she think of he why should not she be glad she be delighted so by way of express this delight she sit down at the desk and begin to cry very softly xiii have duly consider the emptiness of existence the unworthiness of man the dreary future that await she -- though this do not trouble she greatly as she confidently expect to die soon -- and many other such dolorous topic miss hugonin decide to retire for the night she rise fill with speculation as to the paltriness of life and the probability of she eye be red in the morning it will be all he fault if they be she console herself doubtless he 'll be very much pleased after rob I of all faith in humanity i dare say the one thing need to complete he happiness be to make I look like a fright i hate he after make I miserable now i suppose he 'll go off and make some other woman miserable oh of course he 'll make love to the first woman he meet who have any money i be sure she be welcome to he i only pity any woman who have to put up with _ he _ no i do not margaret decide after reflection i hate she too miss hugonin go to the door lead to the hallway and pause then -- i grieve to relate it -- she shake a little pink-tipped fist in the air i detest you she comment between she tooth oh how _ dare _ you make I feel so ashamed of the way i have treat you the query -- as possibly you may have divine -- be address to mr wood he be stand by the fireplace in the hallway and he tall figure be outline sharply against the flame of the gas-log that burn there he shoulder have a pathetic droop a listlessness billy be read a paper of some kind by the firelight and the black outline of he face smile grimly over it then he laugh and throw it into the fire billy a voice observe -- a voice that be honey and gold and velvet and all that be most sweet and rich and soft in the world mr wood be aware of a light step a swish sibilant delightful rustling -- the caress of sound be the rustling of a well-groomed woman 's skirt -- and of a afterthought of violet of a mere reminiscence of orri all of which come toward he through the dimness of the hall he start noticeably billy miss hugonin state i be sorry for what i say to you i be not sure it be not true you know but i be sorry i say it bless you heart say billy do not you worry over that peggy that be all right incidentally the thing you have say to I and about I be not true of course but we will not discuss that just now i -- i fancy we be both feel a bit fagged go to bed peggy

eye turn back to hers slowly and irresistibly draw toward they as it seem just as the sunflower be draw toward the sun or the needle toward the pole or in fine as the eye of young gentleman ordinarily be draw toward the eye of the one woman in the world then he disappear the mummery of it vex margaret there be no excuse for he look at she in that way it irritated she she be almost as angry with he for do it as she would have be for not do it therefore she bent a angry face toward the fire she mouth pout in a rather invite fashion then it round slowly into a sanguine o which of itself suggest osculation but in reality stand for observe for the paper billy have throw into the fire have fall under the gas-log and she remember he guilty start after all say margaret it be none of my business so she eye it wistfully it may be important she considerately remember it ought not to be leave there so she fish it out with a big paper-cutter but it can not be very important she dissent afterward or he would not have throw it away so she look at the superscripture on the back of it then she give a little gasp and tear it open and read it by the firelight miss hugonin subsequently take credit to herself for not go into hysteric and i think she have some reason to for she find the paper a duplicate of the one billy have take out of the secret drawer with he name set in the place of hers at the last frederick r wood have relent toward he nephew margaret laugh a little then she cry a little then she do both together afterward she sit in the firelight very puzzle and very excited and very penitent and very beautiful and be happier than she have ever be in she life he have it in he pocket she dear voice quaver he have it in he pocket my brave strong beautiful billy do when he ask I to marry he it be king cophetua woo the beggar-maid -- and the beggar be a impudent ungrateful idiotic little _ piece _ margaret hiss in she most shrewish manner she ought to be spank she ought to go down on she knee to he in sackcloth and tear and ash and all sort of penitential thing she will too oh it be such a beautiful world -- _ such _ a beautiful world billy love I -- really billy 's a millionaire and i be a pauper oh i be glad glad _ glad _ she caress the paper that have render the world such a goodly place to live in -- caress it tenderly and rub she check against it that be margaret 's way of show affection you know and i protest it must have be very pleasant for the paper the only wonder be that the ink it be write in do not turn red with delight then she read it through again for sheer enjoyment of those beautiful incomprehensible word that disinherit she how _ lovely _ of uncle fred she think of course he have forgive billy who would not what beautiful language uncle fred use quite prayer-booky she term it then she gasp the will in billy 's favor be date a week earlier than the one they have find in the secret drawer it be worthless mere waste paper at the last frederick r wood 's pride have conquer he love oh the horrid old man margaret wail he be leave I everything he have how _ dare _ he disinherit billy i call it rank impertinence in he oh boy dear dear _ dear _ boy miss hugonin croon in a ecstacy of tenderness and woe he find this first will in one of the other drawer and think _ he _ be the rich one and come in a great whirl of joy to ask I to marry he and i be horrid to he oh what a mess i have make of it i have call he a fortune-hunter and i have tell he i love another man and he 'll never never ask I to marry he now and i love he i worship he i adore he and if only i be poor -- ensue a silence margaret lift the two will scrutinise they closely and then look at the fire interrogatively it be penal servitude for quite a number of year she say but then he really _ could not _ tell any one you know no gentleman would allow a lady to be lock up in jail and if he know -- if he know i do not and could not consider he a fortune-hunter i really believe he would -- whatever she believe he would do the probability of he do it seem highly agreeable to miss hugonin she smile at the fire in the most friendly fashion and hold out one of the fold papers to it yes say margaret i be quite sure he will there i think we may leave she for i have dredge the dictionary and i confess i have find no fitting word wherewith to picture this inconsistent impulsive adorable young woman dream brave dream in the firelight of she lover and of they united future i should only bungle it you must imagine it for yourself it be a pretty picture be it not -- with its laughable side perhaps under the circumstance whimsical if you will but very very sacred for she love he with a clean heart love he infinitely let we smile at it -- tenderly -- and pass on but upon my word when i think of how unreasonably how outrageously margaret have behave during the entire evening i be tempt to depose she as we heroine i begin to regret i have not select adèle haggage she would have do admirably for depend upon it she too have she trepidation she white night she occult battle over hugh van orden also she be a pretty girl -- if you care for brunette -- and accomplish she be verse in i forget how many foreign language both continental and dead and could discourse sensibly in any one of they she be perfectly reasonable perfectly consistent perfectly unimpulsive and never express a opinion that be not countenance by at least two competent authority i do not know a man living prepare to dispute that miss haggage excel miss hugonin in all these desirable quality yet with please unanimity they go mad for margaret and have the greatest possible respect for adèle and my dear mrs grundy i grant you cheerfully that this be all wrong a sensible man as you very justly observe will seek in a woman something more enduring than mere personal attraction he will value she for some sensible reason -- say for she wit or she learning or she skill in cookery or she proficiency in greek a sensible man will look for a sensible woman he will not concern he sensible head over such trumpery as a pair of bright eye or a red lip or so or a satisfactory suit of hair these be fleeting vanity however -- you have doubtless hear ere this my dear madam that have cleopatra 's nose be a inch shorter the destiny of the world would have be change have she be the woman you describe -- perfectly reasonable perfectly consistent perfectly sensible in all she say and do -- confess dear lady would not antony have take to he heel and have flee from such a monster xiv i regret to admit that mr wood do not toss feverishly about he bed all through the silent watch of the night he be very miserable but he be also twenty-six that be a age when the blind bow-god deal no fatal wound it be a age to suffer poignantly if you will a age wherein to aspire to the dearest woman on earth to write she halting verse to lose she to affect the _ clichés _ of cynicism to hear the chime at midnight -- and after it all to sleep like a top so billy sleep and kind hypno loose a dream through the gate of ivory that lift he to a delectable land where peggy be nineteen and have never hear of kennaston and be unbelievably sweet and dear and beautiful but presently they and the colonel put forth to sea -- on a great carve writing-desk -- fishing for shark which the colonel say be very plentiful in those water and frederick r wood climb up out of the sea and say billy be a fool and must go to college and peggy say that be impossible as seventeen hundred and fifty thousand child have to be give a education apiece and they could not spare one for billy and a missionary from zambesus land come out of one of the secret drawer and say billy must give he both of he foot as he need they for he working-girl ' class and thereupon the shark poke they head out of the water and begin in a deafening chorus to cry foot foot foot and billy then wake with a start and find it be only the bird chatter in the dawn outside then he be miserable he toss and groan and doze and smoke cigarette until he could stand it no longer he get up and dress in sheer desperation and go for a walk in the garden the day be clear as a new-minted coin it be not yet wholly air not wholly free from the damp savor of night but low in the east the sun be take heart a mile-long shadow foot it with billy wood in he pacing through the amber-chequered garden actaeon-like he surprise the world at its toilet and its fleeting grace somewhat fortify he spirit but he thought pester he like gnat the thing he say to the rose it be not necessary to set down xv after a vituperative half-hour or so mr wood be hungry he come back toward selwoode and upon the terrace in front of the house he find kathleen saumarez during the warm weather one corner of the terrace have be convert by means of gay red-and-white awning into a sort of living-room there be chair table sofa-cushion bowl of rose and any number of bright-coloured rug altogether it be a cosy place and the glowing hue of its furnishings be very become to mr saumarez who sit there write industriously it be a think embarrassing they have avoid one another yesterday -- rather obviously -- both strive to put off a necessarily awkward meeting now it have come and now somehow they eye meet for a moment and they laugh frankly and the awkwardness be go kathleen say mr wood with conviction you be a dear you break my heart say she demurely but i be go to forgive you mr saumarez be not strive to be clever now and heaven -lrb- think billy -rrb- how much nicer she be like this it be not the same woman : she thin cheek flush arbutus-like and she rather metallic voice be grow low and gentle billy bring memory with he you see and for the moment she be kathleen eppe again -- kathleen eppe in the first flush of youth eager trustful and joyous-hearted as he have know she long ago since then the poor woman have eat of the bread of dependence and have find it salt enough she have pay for it daily endure a thousand petty slight a thousand petty insult and smile under they as only woman can but she have forget now that shrewd kathleen saumarez who must earn she livelihood as best she might she smile frankly -- a purely unprofessional smile i be sorry when i hear you be come she say irrelevantly but i be glad now mr wood -- i grieve to relate -- be still hold she hand in he there stir in he pulse the thrill kathleen eppe have always waken -- a thrill of memory now a mere wraith of emotion he be think of a certain pink-cheeked girl with crinkly black-brown hair and eye that he have liken to chrysoberyl -- and he wonder whimsically what have become of she this be not she this be assuredly not kathleen for this woman have a large mouth -- a humorous and kindly mouth it be true but undeniably a large one -- whereas kathleen 's mouth have be quite perfect and rather diminutive than otherwise have not he rhyme of it often enough to know they stand gaze at one another for a long time and in the back of billy 's brain line of he old verse sing themselves to a sad little tune -- the verse that reprove the idiocy of all other poet who have very foolishly write they sonnet to other woman : and yet as the jingle point out have these poet ever stray in thy path they have not make random rhyme of arabellum song of dolly hymn of stellum lay of lalage or chlori -- not of daphne nor of dori florimel nor amarylli nor of phyllida nor phylli be they wanton melody : but all of these -- all they melody have be of thee kathleen would they have be billy think it improbable the verse be very silly and recall the big blundering boy who have write they billy begin to wonder -- somewhat forlornly -- whither he too have vanish he and the girl he have go mad for both seem rather mythical -- legendary as king pepin yes say mr saumarez -- and oh she startle he i fancy they be both quite dead by now billy she cry earnestly do not laugh at they -- do not laugh at those dear foolish child i -- somehow i could not bear that billy kathleen say mr wood in admiration you be a witch i be not laugh though my dear i be develop quite a twilight mood over they -- a plaintive old-lettery sort of mood you know she sigh a little yes -- i know then she eyelid flicker in a parody of kathleen 's glance that billy note with a queer tenderness come and talk to I billy she command i be a early bird this morning and entitle to the very biggest and best-looking worm i can find you be only a worm you know -- we be all worm mr jukesbury tell I so last night make a exception in my favor for it appear i be a angel he be amorously incline last night the tipsy old fraud it be shameless billy the amount of money he get out of miss hugonin -- for the deserving poor do you know i rather fancy he class himself under that head and i grant you he be poor enough -- but deserving mr saumarez snap she finger eloquently eh shark eh query mr wood in some discomfort she nod he be as bad as sarah haggage she inform he and everybody know what a bloodsucker she be the haggage be a disease billy that all rich woman be expose to -- ` more easily catch than the pestilence and the taker run presently mad ' depend upon it billy those two will have every penny they can get out of you uncle 's money peggy 's so generous he plead she want to make everybody happy -- bring about a general millenium you know she pay dearly enough for she fancy say mr saumarez in a hard voice then after a little she cry suddenly : oh billy billy it shame I to think of how we lie to she and toady to she and lead she on from one mad scheme to another -- all for the sake of the money we can pilfer incidentally we be all arrant hypocrite you know i be no better than the other billy -- not a bit better but my husband leave I so poor and i have always be accustom to the pretty thing of life and i could not -- i could not give they up billy i love they too dearly so i lie and toady and write drivel talk about thing i do not understand for drivel woman to listen to and i still have the creature comfort of life i pawn my self-respect for they -- that be all such a little price to pay be not it billy she speak in a sort of frenzy i dare say that at the outset she want mr wood to know the worst of she know he could not fail to discover it in time billy bring memory with he you see and this shrewd hard woman want somehow more than anything else in the world that he should think well of she so she babble out the whole pitiful story wait in a kind of terror to see contempt and disgust awaken in he eye but he merely say i see -- i see very slowly and he eye be kindly he could not be angry with she somehow that pink-cheeked crinkly haired girl stand between they and shield she he be only very very sorry and kennaston he ask after a little mr saumarez flush mr kennaston be a man of great genius she say quickly of course miss hugonin be glad to assist he in publish he book -- it be a honor to she that he permit it they have to be publish privately you know as the general public be not capable of appreciate such dainty little masterpiece oh do not make any mistake billy -- mr kennaston be a very wonderful and very admirable man h be yes he strike I as be a unusually nice chap say mr wood untruthfully i dare say they 'll be very happy who mr saumarez demand why -- er -- i do not suppose they 'll make any secret of it billy stammer in tardy repentance of he hasty speaking peggy tell I last night she have accept he mrs saumarez turn to rearrange a bowl of rose she seem to have some difficulty over it billy she speak inconsequently and with avert head a honest man be the noblest work of god -- and the rarest billy groan do you know say he i have just be tell the rose in the garden yonder the same thing about woman i be a misogynist this morning i have decide no woman be worthy of be love that be quite true she assent but on the other hand no man be worthy of loving billy smile i have likewise come to the conclusion say he that a man 's love be like he hat in that any peg will do to hang it on also in that the proper and best place for it be on he own head oh i assure you i vented any number of cheap cynicism on the helpless rose and yet -- will you believe it kathleen -- it do not seem to make I feel a bit better -- no not a bit it be very like he hat she declare in that he have a new one every year then she rest she hand on he in a half-maternal fashion what be the matter boy she ask softly you be always so fresh and wholesome i do not like to see you like this better leave phrase-making to we phrase-monger she voice ring true -- true and compassionate and tender and all that a woman 's voice should be billy could not but trust she i have be a ass say he rather tragically oh not a unusual ass kathleen -- just the sort man be always make of themselves you see before i go to france there be a girl i -- care for and i let a quarrel come between we -- a foolish trifling idle little quarrel kathleen that we might have make up in a half-hour but i be too proud you see no i be not proud either mr wood amend bitterly i be simply pig-headed and mulish so i go away and yesterday i see she again and realize that i -- still care that be all kathleen it be not a unusual story and mr wood laugh mirthlessly and take a turn on the terrace mr saumarez be regard he intently she cheek be of a deeper more attractive pink and she breath come and go quickly i -- i do not understand she say in a rather queer voice oh it be simple enough billy assure she you see she -- well i think she would have marry I once yes she care for I once and i quarrel with she -- i conceited young ass that i be actually presume to dictate to the dearest sweetest most lovable woman on earth and tell she what she must do and what she must not i -- good lord i who be not worthy to sweep a cross clean for she -- who be not worthy to breathe the same air with she -- who be not worthy to exist in the same world she honor by live in oh i _ be _ a ass but i have pay for it -- oh yes kathleen i have pay dearly for it and i 'll pay more dearly yet before i have do i try to avoid she yesterday -- you must have see that and i could not -- i give you my word i could no more have keep away from she than i could have spread a pair of wing and fly away she do not care a bit for I now but i can no more give up loving she than i can give up eat my dinner that be not a pretty simile kathleen but it express the way i feel toward she it be not merely that i want she it be more than that -- oh far more than that i simply can not do without she do not you understand kathleen he ask desperately yes -- i think i understand she say when he have end i -- oh billy i be almost sorry it be dear of you -- dear of you billy to care for I still but -- but i be almost sorry you care so much i be not worth it boy dear and i -- i really do not know what to say you must let I think mr wood give a inarticulate sound the face she turn to he be perplexed half-sad fond a little pleased and strangely compassionate it be kathleen eppe who sit beside he the six year be as utterly forget as the name of magdalen 's first lover she be a girl again listen -- with a heart that flutter i dare say -- to the wild talk the mad dithyrambic of a big blundering boy the ludicrous horror of it stun mr wood he could no more have tell she of she mistake than he could have strike she in the face kathleen -- say he vaguely let I think -- ah let I think billy she plead in a flutter of joy and amazement go away boy dear -- go away for a little and let I think i be not a emotional woman but i be on the verge of hysteric now for -- for several reason go in to breakfast billy i -- i want to be alone you have make I very proud and -- and sorry i think and glad and -- and -- oh i do not know boy dear but please go now -- please billy go in the living-hall he pause to inspect a picture with peculiar interest since kathleen care for he -lrb- he think rather forlornly -rrb- he must perjure himself in as plausible a manner as might be possible please god have do what he have do he would lie to she like a gentleman and try to make she happy a vision in incredible violet ruffle come down to breakfast see he and pause on the stairway and flush and laugh deliciously poor billy stare at she and he heart give a great bind and then appear to stop for a indefinite time good lord say mr wood in he soul and i think i be a ass last night why last night in comparison i display intelligence that be almost human oh peggy peggy if i only dare tell you what i think of you i believe i would gladly die afterward -- yes i be sure i would you really have not any right to be so beautiful -- it be not fair to we peggy but the vision be peep over the bannister at he and the vision 's eye be sparkling with a lucent mischief and a wonderful half-hushed contralto be demand of he : oh where have you be billy boy billy boy oh where have you be charming billy and billy 's baritone answer she : i have be to seek a wife -- and break off in a groan good lord say mr wood it be a ludicrous business if you will indeed it be vastly humorous -- be it not -- this woman 's think a man 's love might by any chance endure through six whole year but they love endure you see and the silly creature have a superstition among they that love be a sacred thing stronger than time victorious over death itself let we laugh then at kathleen saumarez -- those of we who have learn that love be only a tinkle cymbal and faith a sound brass and fidelity a obsolete affectation : but for my part i honor and think better of the woman who through all she struggle with the world -- through all those sordid grim merciless secret battle where the vanquish may not even cry for succor -- i honor she i say for that she have yet cherish the memory of that first love which be the best and purest and most unselfish and most excellent thing in life xvi breakfast margaret enjoy hugely i regret to confess that the fact that every one of she guest be more or less miserable move this hard-hearted young woman to untimely and excessive mirth only mr saumarez puzzle she for she could think of no reason for that lady 's manifest agitation when kathleen eventually join the other but for the rest the hopeless glance that hugh van orden cast toward she cause adèle to flush and mr haggage to become despondent and speechless and astonishingly rigid and petheridge jukesbury 's vaguely apologetic attitude toward the world strike miss hugonin as infinitely divert kennaston she pity a little but he bearing toward she range ludicrously from that of proprietorship to that of supplication and moreover she be furious with he for have hint at various time that billy be a fortune-hunter margaret be quite confident by this that she have never believe he -- not really you know -- have argue the point out at some length the night before and reach she conclusion by a course of reasoning peculiar to herself mr wood as you may readily conceive be sink in the slough of despond deeper than ever plummet sound margaret think this very nice of he it be a delicate tribute to she that he eat nothing and the fact that hugh van orden and petheridge jukesbury -- as she believe -- act in precisely the same way for precisely the same reason merely demonstrate of course they overwhelming conceit and presumption so sit in the great eagle 's shadow she eat a quantity of marmalade -- she be wont to begin the day in this ungodly english fashion -- and gossip like a brook trot over sunlit pebble she have plan a pulverise surprise for the house-party and in due time she intend to explode it and subsequently billy be to apologise for he conduct and then they be to live happily ever afterward she have not yet decide what he be to apologise for that be he affair he conscience ought to have tell he by this wherein he have offend and if he conscience have not why then of course he would have to apologise for he lack of proper sensibility after breakfast she go accord to she usual custom to she father 's room for as i think i have tell you the old gentleman be never visible until noon she have astonishing news for he what time she divulge it the other sit on the terrace and mr kennaston read to they as he have promise from he defense of ignorance it prove a welcome diversion to more than one of the party mr wood especially esteem it a godsend it stave off misfortune for at least a little so he sit at kathleen 's side in silence try desperately to be happy try desperately not to see the tiny wrinkle the faint crow 's foot time have sketch in she face as a memorandum of the work he mean to do shortly billy console himself with the reflection that he be very fond of she but oh -lrb- he think -rrb- what worship what adoration he could accord this woman if she would only decline -- positively -- to have anything whatever to do with he i think we ought not to miss hearing mr kennaston 's discourse it be generally concede that he style be wonderfully clever and i have no doubt that he detractor -- who complain that he style be mere word-twist a mere inversion of the most ancient truism -- be actuate by the very basest jealousy let we listen then and be duly edify as he read in a low sweet voice and the bird twitter about he in the clear morning it have be for many year mr kennaston begin the custom of patriotic gentleman in quest of office to point with pride to the fact that the schoolmaster be abroad in the land in whose defense they stand pledge to draw they salary and fight to the last gasp for reelection these lofty platitude while try to the lung doubtless appeal to a certain class of mind but indeed the schoolmaster be not abroad he be domesticate in every village in america where each hamlet have its would-be shakespeare and each would-be shakespeare have he ` hamlet ' by heart learning be rampant in the land and valuable information be paste up in the streetcar so that he who ride may read and ignorance -- beautiful divine ignorance -- be forsake by a generation that clamor for the truth and what value pray have this truth that we should lust after it he glance up in a inquire fashion mr jukesbury meet he eye smile and shake he head and say fie fie very placidly to do he justice he have not the least idea what kennaston be talk about i be aware the poet continue with a air of generosity that many pleasant thing have be say of it in fact we decade have turn its back relentlessly upon the decayed and we no longer read the lament over the lost art of lie issue many magazine ago by a once prominent british author still without advance any wilde theory one may fairly claim that truth be a jewel -- a jewel with many facet differ in appearance from each point of view and while ` tell the truth and shame the devil ' be a very pretty sentiment it need not necessarily mean anything the devil if there be a personal devil -- and it have be point out with some show of reason that a impersonal one could scarcely carry out such enormous contract -- would in all probability rather approve than otherwise of indiscriminate truth-telling irritation be the root of all evil and there be nothing more irritating than to hear the truth about one 's self it be bad enough in all conscience to be insult but the truth of a insult be the barb that prevent its retraction ` truth hurt ' have all the pathos of understatement it not only hurt but infuriate it have no more right to go naked in public than any one else indeed it have less right for truth-telling be natural to mankind -- as be show by its prevalence among the younger sort such as child and cynic -- and as shakespeare long ago forget to tell we a touch of nature make the whole world embarrass at this point mr haggage sniff she consider he be grow improper she distrust nature truth-telling then may safely be regard as a unamiable indiscretion in art the bare truth must in common gallantry be award a print petticoat or one of canvas as the case may be to hide she nakedness and in life it be a disastrous virtue that we have unite to commend and avoid nor be the decision a unwise one for man be a gregarious animal know that friendship be at best but a feeble passion and therefore to be treat with the care due a invalid it be impossible to be quite candid in conversation with a man and with a woman it be absolutely necessary that you speech should be candy truth then be the least desirable of acquaintance but even if one wish to know the truth the desire could scarcely be fulfil franci bacon lord verulam a prominent lawyer of elizabeth 's time who would have write shakespeare 's play have he other occupation not prevent it quote pilate as inquire ` what be truth ' -- and then not stay for a answer pilate deserve all the praise he have never receive nothing be quite true even truth lie at the bottom of a well and not infrequently in other place no assertion be one whit truer than its opposite a mild buzz of protest rise about he kennaston smile and cock he head on one side we have for example he point out a large number of proverb the small coin of conversation receive everywhere whose value no one dispute they be rap forth like a oath with a air of settle the question once and forever well there be safety in quotation but even the devil can cite shakespeare for he purpose ` never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day ' agree ill with ` sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof ' and it be somewhat difficult to reconcile ` take care of the penny and the pound will take care of themselves ' with the equally familiar ` penny-wise pound-foolish ' yet the saying be equally untrue any maxim be perforce a general statement and therefore fallacious and therefore universally accept art be long and life be short but the platitude concern they be both insufferable and eternal we must remember that a general statement be merely a snap-shot at fly truth a instantaneous photograph of a move body it may be the way that a thing be but it be never the way in which any one ever see that thing or ever will this be of course a general statement as to present event then it may be assume that no one be either capable or desirous of speak the truth why then make such a pother about it as to the past there we have carry the investigation of truth to such a extreme that nowadays very few of we dare believe anything opinion be difficult to secure when a quarter of a hour in the library will prove either side of any question formerly people have a few opinion which if erroneous be at least universal nero be not consider a immaculate man the flood be currently believe to have cause the death of quite a number of person and george washington it be widely state once cut down a cherry-tree but now all these comfortable illusion have be destroy by ` the least little man who spend they time and lose they wit in chase nimble and retire truth to the extreme perturbation and dry up of the moisture ' kennaston look up for a moment and billy wood who have count seven wrinkle and be drop into a forlorn doze start violently he interest then become abnormal there be mr kennaston complain rather reproachfully too many inquiry doubt investigation discovery and apology there be palliation of tiberius eulogy of henry viii rehabilitation of aaron burr lucretium borgium it appear be a grievously misunderstand woman and heliogabalus a most exemplary monarch even the dog in the manger may have be a nervous animal in search of rest and quiet as for shakespeare he be a atheist a syndicate a lawyer 's clerk a inferior writer a puritan a scholar a _ nom de plume _ a doctor of medicine a fool a poacher and another man of the same name information of this sort crop up on every side even the newspaper be infected truth lurk in the patent-medicine advertisement and sometimes creep stealthily into the very editorial we must all learn the true fact of history whether we will or no eventually the writer of historical romance will not escape so the sad tale go ignorance -- beautiful divine ignorance -- be forsake by a generation that clamor for the truth the earnest-minded person have pluck zeus out of heaven and drive the maenad from the wood and drag poseidon out of

phenomenon and the labor of hercule prove to be a dozen weather bulletin be it any cause for wonder that under this cheerless influence we poetry be either silent or unsold the true poet must be ignorant for information be the thief of rhyme and it be only in deal with -- kennaston pause margaret have appear in the vestibule and behind she stand she father look very grave we have make a most interesting discovery miss hugonin airily announce to the world at large it appear that uncle fred leave all he property to mr wood here we find the will only last night i be sure you 'll all be

hypocritical philanthropic shark and i be damn ' glad frederick have do the square thing by you -- yes begad the old gentleman be stand beside mr wood in the vestibule of selwoode some distance from the other member of the house-party and be speak in confidence he be sincere i do not say that the thought of face the world at sixty-five with practically no resource save he half-pay -- i think i have tell you that the colonel 's diversion have drunk up he wife 's fortune and he own like a glass of water -- i do not say that this thought move he to hilarity over it indeed he pull a frankly grave face but he care a deal for billy and even now there be balm -- soothing priceless balm -- to be have of the reflection that this change in he prospects affect materially the prospects of those culture broad-minded philanthropic person who have aforetime set he daughter to require of he a perusal of herbert spencer billy be pretty well aware how monetary matter stand with the old wastrel and the sincerity of the man affect he far more than the most disinterested sentiment would have do mr wood accordingly shake hand with entirely unnecessary violence you be a trump that be what you be he declare oh yes you be colonel you be a incorrigible incurable old ace of trump -- the very best there be in the pack -- and it be entirely useless for you to attempt to conceal it gad -- say the colonel and do not you worry about that will mr wood advise i -- i can not explain thing just now but it be all right you just wait -- just wait till i have see peggy billy urge in desperation and i 'll explain everything by gad -- say the colonel but mr wood be half-way out of the vestibule mr wood be in a unenviable state of perturbation he could not quite believe that peggy have destroy the will the thing out-heroded herod out-margareted margaret but if she have it strike he as a high-handed proceeding entail certain vague penalty make and provide by the law to cover just such case -- penalty of whose nature he be entirely ignorant and do not care to think heaven for all he know that angel might have let herself in for a jail sentence billy picture that queen among woman that paragon with she glorious hair crop and she pink-tipped little hand set to beat hemp -- he have a shadowy notion that the life of all female convict be devote to this pursuit -- and groan in horror in the name of heaven mr wood demand of he soul what _ possible _ reason could she have have for this new insanity and in the name of heaven why could not she have put off she _ tête-à-tête _ with kennaston long enough to explain and in the name of heaven what do she see to admire in that putty-faced grimace ass any way and in the name of heaven what be i to say to this poor old man here i can not explain that he daughter be not in any danger of be poor but merely of be lock up in jail and in the name of heaven how long do that outrageous angel expect I to remain in this state of suspense billy groan again and pace the vestibule then he retrace he step shake hand with colonel hugonin once more and kennaston or no kennaston set out to find she xviii but when he come out upon the terrace sarah ellen haggage stop he -- stop he with a queer blending of diffidence and resolve in she manner the other by this have disappear in various direction puzzle and exceedingly uncertain what to do indeed to congratulate billy in the colonel 's presence would have be tactless and on the other hand to condole with the colonel without seem to affront the wealthy mr wood be almost impossible so they temporise and flee -- all save mr haggage she alone remain to view mr wood with newly open eye for as he pause impatiently -- the sculptured eagle above he head -- she perceive that he be a remarkably handsome and intelligent young man she motherly heart open toward this lonely wealthy orphan my dear billy she coo with asthmatic gentleness as a old old friend of you mother 's be not you go to let I tell you how rejoiced adèle and i be over you good fortune it be not polite you naughty boy for you to run away from you friend as soon as they have hear this wonderful news ah such news it be -- such a manifest intervention of providence my heart have be flutter flutter like a little bird billy ever since i hear it in testimony to this fact mr haggage clasp a stodgy hand to a exceedingly capacious bosom and exhibit the whites of she eye freely she smile however remain unchanged and ample er -- ah -- oh yes very kind of you i be sure say mr wood i never in my life see adèle so deeply affect by _ anything _ mr haggage continue with a certain large archness the sweet child be always so fond of you you know billy ah i remember distinctly hear she speak of you many and many a time when you be in that dear delightful wicked pari and wonder when you would come back to you friend -- not very grand and influential friend billy but sincere i trust for all that mr wood say he have no doubt of it so many people she inform he confidentially will pursue you with adulation now that you be wealthy oh yes you will find that wealth make a great difference billy but not with adèle and I -- no dear boy despise we if you will but my child and i be not mercenary money make no difference with we we shall be the same to you that we always be -- sincerely interested in you true welfare overjoy at you present good fortune prayerful as to you brilliant future and delighted to have you drop in any evening to dinner we do not consider money the chief blessing of life no do not tell I that most people be different billy for i know it very well and many be the tear that thought have cost I we live in a very mercenary world my dear boy but _ we _ thought at least be set on higher thing and i trust we can afford to despise the merely temporal blessing of life and i entreat you to remember that we humble dwelling be always open to the son of my old old friend and that there be always a jug of good whiskey in the cupboard thus in the shadow of the eagle babble the woman whom -- for all she absurdity -- margaret have love as a mother billy thank she with a angry heart and this -- i give you the gist of he meditation -- this be peggy 's dearest friend oh philanthropy be thy protestation then all void and empty and be thy noblest sentiment -- every one of 'em -- so full of sound and rhetoric so specious so delectable -- be these then but dicer ' oath aloud i be rather surprise you know he say slowly that you take it just this way mr haggage i should have think you would have be sorry on -- on miss hugonin 's account it be awfully jolly of you of course -- oh awfully jolly and i appreciate it at its true worth i assure you but it be a bit awkward be not it that the poor girl will be practically penniless i really do not know whom she 'll turn to now then billy the diplomatist receive a surprise she 'll come with I of course say mr haggage mr wood make a -- unfortunately -- inaudible observation i beg you pardon she query then obtain no response she continue with perfect simplicity : margaret 's quite like a daughter to I you know of course she and the colonel will come with we -- at least until affair be a bit more settle even afterward -- well we have a large house billy and i do not see that they would be any better off anywhere else billy 's emotion be complex you big-hearted old parasite he own heart be singing if you could only keep that ring of truth that be in you voice for you platform utterance -- why in less than no time you could afford to feed you afro-american on nightingale ' tongue and clothe every working-girl in the land in cloth of gold you have be pilfer from peggy for year -- pilfer right and leave with both hand but you have love she all the time god bless you and now the moment she be in trouble you be ready to take both she and the colonel -- whom by the way you must very cordially detest -- and share you pitiful pilfered little crust with 'em and -- have two more mouth to feed -- probably pilfer a little more outrageously in the future you be a sanctimonious old hypocrite you be and a pious fraud and a delusion and a snare and you and adèle have nefarious design on I at this very moment but i think i would like to kiss you indeed i believe mr wood come very near do so she love peggy you see and he love every one who love she but he compromise by shake hand energetically for a matter of five minute and entreat to be allow to subscribe to some of she deserving charitable enterprise -- any one she might mention -- and so leave the old lady a little bewildered but very much pleased she decide that for the future adèle must not see so much of mr van orden she begin to fear that gentleman 's view of life be not sufficiently serious xix billy go into the garden in pursuit of margaret he be almost happy now and feel vaguely ashamed of himself then he come upon kathleen saumarez who indeed be wait for he there and he heart go down into he boot he realize on a sudden that he be one of the richest man in america it be a staggering thought also mr wood 's view at this moment as to the advantage of wealth might have be interesting kathleen stand silent for a instant eye downcast face flush she be tremble then billy she ask almost inaudibly do -- do you still want -- you answer the bird sing about they spring triumph in the garden she look very womanly and very pretty to all appearance it might easily have be a lover and he lass meet in the springtide shamefaced after last night 's kissing but billy somehow lack much of the elation and the perfect content and the disposition to burst into melody that be currently suppose to seize upon rustic swain at such moment he merely want to know if at any time in the remote future he heart would be likely to resume the discharge of its proper function it be stand still now however can you ask -- dear he word at least lie gallantly the poor woman look up into billy 's face after year of battle with the world here for the asking be peace and luxury and wealth incalculable and -- as kathleen thought -- a love that have endure since they be boy and girl together yet she shrink from he a little and clinch she hand before she speak yes kathleen falter and afterward she shudder and here if for the moment i may prefigure the eagle as a sentient be i can imagine he chuckle please god think poor billy i will make she happy yes please god i can at least do that since she care for I then he kiss she my dear say he aloud i 'll try to make you happy and -- and you do not mind do you if i leave you now query this ardent lover you see it be absolutely necessary i should see -- see miss hugonin about this will business you do not mind very much do you -- darling mr wood inquire of she the last word be rather obviously a afterthought no say she not if you must -- dear billy go away lug a heart of lead in he breast kathleen stare after he and give a hard wringing motion of she hand she have do what many woman do daily the thing be common and sensible and universally commend but in she own eye the draggled trollop of the pavement be neither better nor worse than she at the entrance of the next walkway billy encounter felix kennaston -- alone and in the most ebulliently mirthful of humor xx but we have leave mr kennaston i think in company with miss hugonin at the precise moment she inquire of he whether it be not the strangest thing in the world -- refer thereby to the sudden manner in which she have be disinherit the poet laugh and assent afterward turn north from the front court they descend past the shield-bearing griffin -- and you may depend upon it that each shield be adorn with a bas-relief of the eagle -- that guard the broad stairway lead to the formal garden of selwoode the garden stretch northward to the confines of peter blagden 's estate of gridlington and for my part -- unless it be that primitive garden that adam lose -- i can imagine no goodlier place on this particular forenoon however neither miss hugonin nor felix kennaston have eye for its comeliness silently they brave the griffin and in silence they skirt the fish-pond -- silver-crinkling in the may morning -- and pass through cloistral ilex-shadowed walk and amphitheatre of green velvet and terrace ample and mellow in the sunlight silently the tree pelt they with blossom pedestale in leafy recess satyr grin at they apishly and the arrow of diver pot-bellied cupid threaten they and faun pipe for they ditty of no tone the bird be about shrill avocation overhead and everywhere the heatless odourful air be a caress but for all this miss hugonin and mr kennaston be silent and very fidgetty margaret be hatless -- and the glory of the eminently sensible spring sun appear to center in she hair -- and violet-clad and the gown like most of she gown be all tiny tuck and frill and flounce diaper with semi-transparency -- unsubstantial foam-like mere violet froth as she come starry-eyed through the garden the impudent wind trifle with she hair i protest she might have be some lady of oberon 's court steal out of elfland to bedevil we poor mortal with only a moonbeam for the changeable heart of she and for raiment a violet shadow spirit from the under side of some big fleecy cloud they come presently through a trim yew-hedged walkway to a summer-house cover with vine into which margaret peep and decline to enter on the ground that it be entirely too chilly and gloomy and _ exactly _ like a mausoleum but nearby they find a semi-circular marble bench about which a group of elm-tree make a pleasant shadow splash at just the proper interval with sunlight on this margaret seat herself and then pensively move to the other end of the bench because a slanting sunbeam fall there since it be absolutely necessary to blast mr kennaston 's dearest hope she thoughtfully endeavor to distract he attention from he own misery -- as far as might be possible -- by show he how exactly like a aureole she hair be in the sunlight margaret always have a kind heart kennaston stand before she smile a little he be the sort of man to appreciate the manoeuver my lady he ask very softly have not you any good news for I on this wonderful morning excellent news margaret assent with a cheerfulness that be not utterly free from trepidation i have decide not to marry you beautiful and i trust you be properly grateful you see you be very nice of course but i be go to marry somebody else and bigamy be a crime you know and anyhow i be only a pauper and you would never be able to put up with my temper -- now beautiful i be quite sure you could not so there be not a bit of use in argue it some day you would end by strangle I which would be horribly disagreeable for I and then they would hang you for it you know and that would be equally disagreeable for you fancy though what a good advertisement it would be for you poem -lrb- illustration : ` my lady ' he ask very softly ` have not you any good news for I on this wonderful morning ' -rrb- she be not look at he now -- oh no margaret be far too busily employ get the will -lrb- which she have carry all this time -rrb- into a absurd little silver chain-bag hang at she waist she have no time to look at felix kennaston there be such scant room in the bag she purse take up so much space there be scarcely any leave for the fold paper the affair really require she closest undivided attention besides she have not the least desire to look at kennaston just now beautiful child he plead look at I but she do not she feel that at that moment she could have look at a gorgon say or a cockatrice or any other trifle of that nature with infinitely greater composure the pause that follow margaret accordingly devote to a scrutiny of he shoe and sincere regret that they owner be not a mercenary man who would be glad to be rid of she beautiful child speak the poet 's voice sadly you be not -- surely you be not say this in mistaken kindness to I surely you be not say this because of what have happen in regard to you money affair believe I my dear that make no difference to I it be you i love -- you the woman of my heart -- and not a certain and doubtless desirable amount of metal disk and dirty paper now i suppose you be go to be very noble and very nasty about it observe miss hugonin resentfully that be my main objection to you you know that you have not any fault i can recognize and feel familiar and friendly with my dear he protest i assure you i be not intentionally disagreeable at that she raise velvet eye to he -- with a visible effort though -- and smile i know you far too well to think that she say wistfully i know i be not worthy of you i be tremendously fond of you beautiful but -- but you see i love somebody else margaret conclude with admirable candor ah say he in a rather curious voice the painter chap eh then margaret 's face flame in a wonderful glow of shame and happiness and pride that must have make the surround rose very hopelessly jealous a quaint mothering look sacred divine madonna-like wake in she great eye as she think -- remorsefully -- of how unhappy billy must be at that very moment and of how big he be and of he general niceness and she desire very heartily that this fleshy young man would make he scene and have do with it who be he forsooth to keep she from billy she wish she have never hear of felix kennaston _ souvent femme varie _ my brother however yes say margaret you be a dear say mr kennaston with conviction in he voice i dare say margaret be surprised but the poet have take she hand and have kiss it reverently and then sit down beside she twist one foot under he in a fashion he have he be frankly grateful to she for refuse he and the mask of affectation slip she see in he another man i be a out-and-out fraud he confess with the gayest of smile i be not in love with you and i be inexpressibly glad that you be not in love with I oh margaret margaret -- you do not mind if i call you that do you i shall have to in any event because i like you so tremendously now that we be not go to be marry -- you have no idea what a night i spend i consider it most peculiar and unsympathetic of my hair not to have turn gray i think you be go to have I you see margaret be far to much astonished to be angry but last night she presently echo in candid surprise why last night you do not know i be poor he wag a protest forefinger that make no earthly difference he assure she of course it be the money -- and in some degree the moon -- that induce I to make love to you i act on the impulse of the moment just for a instant the novelty of do a perfectly sensible thing -- and marry money be universally concede to come under that head -- appeal to I so i do it but all the time i be in love with kathleen saumarez why the moment i leave you i begin to realize that not even you -- and you be quite the most fascinating and generally adorable woman i ever know margaret -- i begin to realize i say that not even you could ever make I forget that fact and i be very properly miserable it be extremely queer mr kennaston continue after a interval of meditation but fall in love appear to be the one utterly inexplicable utterly reasonless thing one ever do in one 's life you can usually think of some more or less plausible palliation for embezzlement say or for rob a cathedral or even for commit suicide -- but no man can ever explain how he happen to fall in love he simply do it margaret nod sagely she know now you mr kennaston be please to say be infinitely more beautiful younger more clever and in every way more attractive than kathleen i recognize these thing clearly but it do not appear somehow to alter the fact that i be in love with she i think i have be in love with she all my life we be boy and girl together margaret and -- and i give you my word kennaston cry with he boyish flush i worship she i simply can not explain the perfectly unreasonable way in which i worship she he be sincere he love kathleen saumarez as much as he be capable of love any one -- almost as much as he love to dilate on he own peculiarity and emotion margaret 's gaze be intent upon he yet she marvel you make love to I very tropically with unconcealed pride mr kennaston assent do not i he say i be in rather good form last night i think and you be actually prepare to marry I she ask -- even after you know i be poor i could not very well back out he submit and then cock he head on one side you see he add whimsically i be sufficiently a conceited ass to fancy you care a little for I so of course i be go to marry you and try to make you happy but how dear -- oh how unutterably dear it be of you margaret to decline to be make happy in any such fashion and mr kennaston pause to chuckle and to regard she with genuine esteem and affection but still she candid eye weigh he and transparently find he want you be think perhaps what a unutterable cad i have be he suggest yes -- you be rather by way of be a cad beautiful but i can not help like you somehow i dare say it be because you be honest with I nobody -- nobody miss hugonin lament a forlorn little quiver in she voice _ ever _ seem to be honest with I except you and now i know you be not oh beautiful be not i ever to have any real friend she plead wistfully kennaston have mean a deal to she you see he have be the one man she trust she have glory in he fustian rhetoric he glib artlessness he airy scorn of money and now all this prove mere pinchbeck on a sudden too there wake in some bycorner of she heart a queasy realisation of how near she have come to loving kennaston the thought nauseate she my dear he answer kindly you will have any number of friend now that you be poor it be merely you money that keep you from have any you see mr kennaston go on with somewhat the air of one climb upon he favorite hobby money be the only thing that count nowadays in america the rich be necessarily we only aristocracy it be quite natural one can not hope for a aristocracy of intellect if only for the reason that not one person in a thousand have any and birth do not count for much of course it be quite true that all of we remote ancestor come over with william the conqueror -- i have sometimes think that the number of steerage passenger he ship would accommodate must have be little short of marvellous -- but it be equally true that the grandfather of most of we leisure class be either deserving or dishonest person -- who either start life on a farm and study euclid by the firelight and do all the other priggish thing they think would look well in a biography or else meet with marked success in embezzlement so money after all be we only standard and when a woman be as rich as you be yesterday she can not hope for friend any more than the queen of england can you could have plenty of flatterer toady sycophant -- anything in fine but friend i do not believe it say margaret half angrily -- not a word of it there _ must _ be some honest people in the world who do not consider that money be everything you know there must be beautiful the poet laugh that say he affably be poppycock you be repeat the sort of thing i say to you yesterday i be honest now the best of we margaret can not help be impress by the power of money it be the greatest power in the world and we can not -- can not possibly -- look upon rich people as be quite like we we must toady to they a bit margaret whether we want to or not the eagle intimidate we all i _ hate _ he miss hugonin announce with vehemence kennaston search he pocket after a moment he produce a dollar bill and show she the eagle on it there he say gravely be the original of the wood eagle -- the eagle that intimidate we all do you remember what shakespeare -- one always hark back to shakespeare to clinch a argument because not even we foremost actor have be able to conceal the fact that he be as somebody in dickens acutely point out ' a dayvilish clever fellow ' -- do you remember i say what shakespeare observe as to this very eagle miss hugonin shake she little head till it glitter in the sunlight like a topaz she care no more for shakespeare than the average woman do and she be never quite comfortable when he be allude to he say mr kennaston quote solemnly : the eagle suffer little bird to sing and be not careful what they mean thereby know that with the shadow of he wing he can at pleasure still they melody that be nonsense say margaret calmly i have not the _ least _ idea what you be talk about and i do not believe you have either he wave the dollar bill with a heroical gesture here he assert be the eagle and by the little bird i have not a doubt he mean charity and independence and kindliness and truth and the rest of the standard virtue that be quite as plausible as the interpretation of the average commentator the presence of money chill these little bird -- ah it be lamentable no doubt but it be true i do not believe it say margaret -- quite as if that settle the question but now he hobby rowel by opposition be spur to loftier flight ah the power of these great fortune america have breed be monstrous he suddenly cry and always they work for evil if i be ever to write a melodrama margaret i could wish for no more thorough-paced villain than a large fortune kennaston pause and laugh grimly we cringe to the eagle say he eh well why not the eagle be very powerful and very cruel in the south yonder the eagle have pen over a million child in he factory where day by day he drain the youth and health and very life out of they tired body in sweat-shop man and woman be toiling for the eagle give they life for the pittance that he grudge they in countless mine and mill the eagle be trade human life for coal and flour in wall street yonder the eagle be juggle as he will with life 's necessity -- thieve from the farmer thieve from the consumer thieve from the poor fool who try to play the eagle 's game and drive they at will to despair and ruin and death : look whither you may man die that the eagle may grow fat so the eagle thrive and daily the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer and the end -- kennaston pause stare into vacancy eh well say he with a smile and a snap of he finger the end rest upon the knee of the god but there must need be a end some day and meanwhile you can not blame we if we cringe to the eagle that be master of the world it be human nature to cringe to its master and while human nature be not always a admirable thing it be i believe rather widely distribute margaret do not return the smile like any sensible woman she never tolerate opinion that differ from she own so she wave he preachment aside you be try to be eloquent be she observation and you have only succeed in be very silly and tiresome go away beautiful you make I awfully tire and i do not care for you in the least go and talk to kathleen i shall be here -- on this very spot margaret add with commendable precision and a unaccountable increase of color if -- if any one should happen to ask then kennaston rise and laugh merrily you be quite delicious he comment it will always be a grief and a puzzle to I that i be not mad for love of you it be unreasonable of I he complain sadly and shake he head but i prefer kathleen and i be quite certain that somebody will ask where you be i shall describe to he the exact spot -- mr kennaston pause with a slight air of apology if i be you he suggest pleasantly i would move a little -- just a little -- to the left that will enable you to obtain to a fuller extent the benefit of the sunbeam which be fall -- quite by accident of course -- upon you hair you be perfectly right margaret in select that hedge as a background its sombre green set you off to perfection he go away chuckle he feel that margaret must think he a devil of a fellow she do not though the _ idea _ of he suspect I of such unconscionable vanity she say properly offend then anyhow a man have no business to know about such thing she continue with rise indignation i believe felix kennaston be as good a judge of chiffon as any woman that be effeminate i think and catty and absurd i do not believe i ever like he -- not really that be now what would billy care about sunbeam and background i would like to know he would never even notice they billy be a _ man _ why that be just what father say yesterday margaret cry and afterward laugh happily i suppose old people be right sometimes -- but dear dear they be terribly unreasonable at other have thus utter the ancient undying plaint of youth miss hugonin move a matter of two inch to the left and smile and wait contentedly it be barely possible some one might come that way and it be always a comfort to know that one be not exactly repulsive in appearance also there be the spring about she and chief of all there be a queer fluttering in she heart that be yet not unpleasant in fine she be unreasonably happy for no reason at all i believe the foolish poet call this feeling love and swear it be divine however they will say anything for the sake of a ear-tickling jingle and while it be true that scientist have any number of plausible and interesting explanation for this same feeling i be sorry to say i have forget they i be compel then to fall back upon those same unreliable irresponsible rhymester and to insist with they that a maid wait in the springtide for the man she love be necessarily happy and very rarely puzzle she head over the scientific reason for it xxi but ten minute later she see mr wood in the distance stride across the sunlit terrace and be seize with a conviction that they interview be likely to prove a stormy one there be a ominous stiffness in he gait oh dear dear miss hugonin wail he be in a temper now and he 'll probably be just as disagreeable as it be possible for any one to be i do wish man be not so unreasonable he look exactly like a big blue-eyed thunder-cloud just now -- just now when i be sure he have every cause in the _ world _ to be very much pleased -- after all i have do for he he make I awfully tire i think he be _ very ungrateful _ i -- i think i be rather afraid in fact she be now that the meeting she have anticipate these twelve hour past be actually at hand there wake in she breast a unreasoning panic miss hugonin consider and catch up she skirt and whisk into the summer-house and there sit down in the darkest corner and devoutly wish mr wood in crim tartary or jericho or in a word any region other than the garden of selwoode billy come presently to the opening in the hedge and stare at the desert bench he be undeniably in a temper but then how become it be think someone miss hugonin he say coldly evidently -lrb- think someone -rrb- he intend to be just as nasty as possible peggy say mr wood after a little perhaps -lrb- think someone -rrb- he will not be _ very _ nasty dear peggy say mr wood in he most conciliatory tone someone rearrange she hair complacently but there be no answer save the irresponsible chattering of the bird and with a sigh billy turn upon he heel then by the oddest chance in the world margaret cough i dare say it be damp in the summer-house or perhaps it be cause by some pass bronchial irritation or perhaps incredible as it may seem she cough to show he where she be but i scarcely think so because margaret insist afterward -- very positively too -- that she do not cough at all xxii well mr wood observe lengthen the word somewhat in the intimate half-light of the summer-house he loom prodigiously big he be gaze downward in careful consideration of three fat tortoise-shell pin and a surprising quantity of gold hair which be practically all that he could see of miss hugonin 's person for that young lady have suddenly become a limp mass of abashed violet ruffle and have discover new and irresistible attraction in the mosaic about she foot billy 's arm be cross on he breast and he right hand caress he chin meditatively by and bye i wonder now he reflect aloud if you can give any reason -- any possible reason -- why you should not be lock up in the nearest sanatorium you need not be rude you know a voice observe from the neighborhood of the ruffle because there be not anything you can do about it mr wood venture a series of inarticulate observation but why he conclude desperately but why peggy -- in heaven 's name what be the meaning of all this she look up billy be aware of two large blue star he heart leap and then he recall a pair of gray-green eye that have regard he in much the same fashion not long ago and he groan i be unfair to you last night she say and the ring of she odd deep voice and the richness and sweetness of it move he to faint longing to a sick heart-hunger it be tremulous too and very tender yes i be unutterably unfair billy you ask I to marry you when you think i be a beggar and -- and uncle fred _ ought _ to have leave you the money it be on account of I that he do not you know i really owe it to you and after the way i talk to you -- so long as i have the money -- i -- and anyhow its very disagreeable and eccentric and _ horrid _ of you to object to be rich margaret conclude somewhat incoherently she have not think it would be like this he seem so stern but be not that exactly like she mr wood be demand of he soul she think she have be unfair to I -- to I whom she do not care a button for mind you so she hand over a fortune to make up for it simply because that be the first means that come to hand now be not that perfectly unreasonable and fantastic and magnificent and incredible -- in short be not that peggy all over why god bless she she heart 's bigger than a barn-door oh it be no wonder that fellow kennaston be grin just now when he send I to she he can afford to grin aloud he state you be a angel peggy that be what you be i have always suspect it and i be glad to know it now for a fact but in this prosaic world not even angel be allow to burn up will for recreation why bless my soul child you -- why there be no tell what trouble you might have get into miss hugonin pout you need not be such a grandfather she suggest helpfully but it be a serious business he insist at this point billy begin to object to she pouting as distract one 's mind from the subject under discussion it -- why it be -- it be what she pout even more rebelliously crimson say mr wood consider -- oh the very deepest duskiest crimson such as you can not get in tube it be a color be never mix on any palette it be -- eh oh i beg you pardon i think you ought to say margaret primly nevertheless she have brighten considerably of course mr wood continue with a fine color i can not take the money that be absurd be it she query idly now i wonder how you be go to help yourself simplest thing in the world he assure she you see this match do not you peggy well now you be go to give I that paper i see in that bag-thing at you waist and i be go to burn it till it be all nice soft feathery ash that can not ever be probate and then the first will which be practically the same as the last will be allow to stand and i 'll tell you father all about the affair because he ought to know and you 'll have to settle with those college and in that way mr wood submit uncle fred 's last wish will be carry out just as he express they and there need not be any trouble -- none at all so give I the will peggy it be curious what a trivial matter love make of felony margaret 's heart sink however yes say she encouragingly and what do you intend do afterward -- i -- i shall probably live abroad say billy cheaper you know -lrb- illustration : miss hugonin pout ` you need not be such a grandfather ' she suggest helpfully -rrb- and here -lrb- he think -rrb- be a excellent a undreamed-of opportunity to inform she of he engagement he have much better tell she now and have do mr wood open he mouth and look at margaret and close it again she be pout in a fashion that distract one 's mind that would be most unattractive say miss hugonin calmly you be very stupid billy to think of live abroad billy i think you be almost as stupid as i be i have be very

that be a very interesting mosaic there in the summer-house i do not understand say mr wood he voice shake and he hand lift a little toward she and tremble poor billy dare not understand she eye downcast she foot tap the floor gently margaret be all one blush she too be tremble a little and she be a little afraid and quite unutterably happy and outwardly she be very much the tiny lady of oberon 's court very much the coquette quintessentialise it be pitiable that we proud margaret should come to such a pass ah the man that you have flout and scorn and bedevil and mock at margaret -- could they see you now i think the basest of they could not but pity and worship you this man be bind in honor to another woman yet a little and he lip will open -- very dry parched lip they be now --

moment he have misunderstand and now just for a little -lrb- think poor billy -rrb- let my eye drink in those dear felicity of color and curve and meet just for a little the splendor of those eye that have the April in they and rest just for a little upon that sanguine close-grained petulant mouth and then i will tell she and then i think that i must die peggy -- he begin in a flattish voice they have evidently go say the voice of mr kennaston yes those beautiful happy young people have foolishly desert the very prettiest spot in the garden let we sit here kathleen but i be not a eavesdropper mr wood protest half angrily i fear margaret be not properly impressed please billy she plead in a shrill whisper please let 's listen he be go to propose to she now and you have no idea how funny he be when he propose oh do not be so pokey billy -- do let 's listen but mr wood have rise with a strange celerity and be about to leave the summer-house margaret pout mr saumarez and mr kennaston be seat not twenty foot from the summer-house on the bench which miss hugonin have just leave and when that unprincipled young woman finally rise to she foot it must be confess that it be with a toss of the head and with the reflection that while to listen be not honorable it would at least be very amusing i grieve to admit it but with billy 's scruple she have not the slightest sympathy then kennaston cry suddenly : why you be mad kathleen wood want to marry _ you _ why he be heel over head in love with miss hugonin miss hugonin turn to mr wood with a little intake of the breath no i shall not attempt to tell you what billy see in she countenance timanthes-like i drape before it the vine of the summer-house for a brief space i think we have best betake ourselves outside leave margaret in a very pitiable state of anger and shame and humiliation and heartbreak -- leave poor billy with a heart that ache see the horror of he in she face xxiii mr saumarez laugh bitterly no she say billy care for I you know a long time ago and this morning he tell I he still care billy do not pretend to be a clever man you see and so he can afford to practice some of the brute virtue such as constancy and fidelity there be a challenging flame in she eye but kennaston let the stab pass unnoticed to do he justice he be think less of himself just now than of how this news would affect margaret and he face be very grave and strangely tender for in he own fashion he love margaret it be nasty very nasty he say at length in a voice that be puzzle yet i could have swear yesterday -- kennaston pause and laugh lightly she be a heiress yesterday and to-day she be nobody and mr wood be wealthy can afford to gratify the virtue you commend so highly and with a fidelity that be most edifying return again to he old love and she welcome he -- and the wood million -- with open arm it be quite affect be it not kathleen you need not be disagreeable she observe my dear kathleen i assure you i be not angry i be merely a little sorry for human nature i could have swear wood be honest but rogue all rogue all kathleen money rule we in the end and now the parable be fulfil and love the prodigal return to make merry over the calf of gold confess mr kennaston query with a smile be it not strange a all-wise creator should have be at pain to fashion this brave world about we for little man and woman such as we to lie and pilfer in be it worth while think you to arch the firmament above we roguery and light the ageless star as candle to display we antic let we be frank kathleen and confess that life be but a trivial farce ignobly play in a very stately temple and mr kennaston laugh again let we be frank kathleen cry with a little catch in she voice why it be not in you to be frank felix kennaston you life be nothing but a succession of pose -- shallow foolish pose mean to hoodwink the world and at time yourself for you do hoodwink yourself do not you felix she ask eagerly and give he no time to answer she fear you see lest he answer might dilapidate the one fortress she have be able to build about he honor and now she go on quickly you be try to make I think you a devil of a fellow be not you and you be hint that i have accept billy because of he money be not you well it be true that i would not marry he if he be poor but he be very far from be poor and he care for I and i be fond of he and so i shall marry he and make he as good a wife as i can so there mrs saumarez face he with a uneasy defiance he be smile oddly i have hear it rumor in many foolish tale and jingle verse say kennaston after a little that a thing call love exist in the world and i have also hear kathleen that it sometimes enter into the question of marriage it appear that i be misinform no she answer slowly there be a thing call love i think woman be none the better for know it to a woman it mean to take some man -- some utterly commonplace man perhaps -- perhaps only a idle _ poseur _ such as you be felix -- and to set he up on a pedestal and to bow down and worship he and to protest loudly both to the world and to herself that in spite of all appearance she idol really have not foot of clay or that at any rate it be the very nicest clay in the world for a time she deceive herself felix then the idol topple from the pedestal and be break and she see that it be all clay felix -- clay through and through -- and she heart break with it kennaston bow he head it be true say he that be the love of woman to a man she go on dully it mean to take some woman -- the nearest woman who be not actually deform -- and to make pretty speech to she and to make she love he and after a while -- kathleen shrug she shoulder drearily why after a while say she he grow tired and look for some other woman it be true say kennaston -- yes very true that some man love in that fashion there ensue a silence it be a long silence and under the tension of it kathleen 's composure snap like a cord that have be stretch to the breaking point yes yes yes she cry suddenly that be how i have love you and that be how you have love I felix kennaston ah billy tell I what happen last night and that -- that be why i -- mr saumarez pause and regard he curiously you do not make a very noble figure just now do you she ask with careful deliberation you be ready to sell yourself for miss hugonin 's money be not you and now you must take she without the money poor felix ah you poor petty liar who have over-reach yourself so utterly and again kathleen begin to laugh but somewhat shrilly somewhat hysterically you be wrong he say with a flush it be true that i ask miss hugonin to marry I but she -- very wisely i dare say -- decline ah kathleen say slowly then -- and it will not do to inquire too closely into she logic -- she speak with considerable sharpness : she be a conceited little cat i never in all my life know a girl to be quite so conceited as she be positively i do not believe she think there be a man breathing who be good enough for she kennaston grin oh kathleen kathleen he say you be simply delicious and mr saumarez color prettily and try to look severe and could not for the simple reason that while she know kennaston to be flippant and weak and unstable as water and generally worthless yet for some occult cause she love he as tenderly as though he have be a paragon of all the manly virtue and i dare say that for many of we it be by a very kindly provision of nature that all woman be create capable of do this illogical thing and that most of they do it daily it be true the poet say at length that i have play no heroic part and i do not question kathleen that i be all you think I yet such as i be i love you and such as i be you love I and it be i that you be go to marry and not that wood person he be worth ten of you she cry scornfully twenty of I perhaps mr kennaston assent but that be not the question you do not love he kathleen you be about to marry he for he money you be about to do what i think to do yesterday but you will not kathleen you know that i need you my dear and -- unreasonably enough god know -- you love I mrs saumarez regard he intently for a considerable space and during that space the eagle war in she heart with the one foe he can never conquer love have a worthless ally but love fight staunchly by and bye yes she say and she voice be almost sullen i love you i ought to love billy but i do not i shall ask he to release I from my engagement and yes i will marry you if you like he raise she hand to he lip you be a angel mr kennaston be please to say no mr saumarez dissent rather forlornly i be simply a fool otherwise i would not be about to marry you know you as i do for what you be -- know that i have not one chance in a hundred of any happiness my dear he say and he voice be earnest you know at least that what there be of good in I be at its best with you yes yes kathleen cry quickly that be so be not it felix and you do care for I do not you felix be you sure you care for I -- quite sure and be you quite certain felix that you never care so much for any one else mr kennaston be quite certain he proceed to explain he feeling toward she at some length kathleen listen with downcast eye and almost cheated herself into the belief that the man she love be all that he should be but at the bottom of she heart she know he be not i think we may fairly pity she kennaston and mr saumarez chat very amicably for some ten minute at the end of that period the twelve forty-five express bellow faintly in the distance recall the fact that the morning mail be in and thereupon in the very best of humor they set out for the house i grieve to admit it but kathleen have utterly forget billy by this and be no more thinking of he than she be of the man in the iron mask she be with kennaston you see and she thought and glance and lip and adoration be all give to he pleasure just as she life would have be if its loss could have save he from a toothache he strut a little and be a little grateful to she and -- to do he justice -- receive the tribute she accord he with perfect satisfaction and equanimity xxiv margaret come out of the summer-house billy wood follow she in a very moist state of perturbation peggy -- say mr wood but miss hugonin be laugh clear as a bird-call she pour forth she ripple

breathing to great sob for she have turn full face to he and he could see the look in she eye i think he have never forget it year after the memory of it would come upon he suddenly and set hot drenching wave of shame and remorse surge about he body -- remorse unutterable that he ever hurt he peggy so deeply for they be tragic eye beneath they she twitching mouth smile bravely but the mirth of she eye be monstrous it be the mirth of a beaten woman of a woman who have know the last extreme of shame and misery and have learn to laugh at it even now billy wood can not quite forget peggy say

alert look surely he have hear a voice -- the dearest of all voice billy it wail oh billy _ billy _ xxv for at the height of this particularly mischancy posture of affair the meddlesome fate have elect to dispatch cock-eye flink to serve as we _ deus ex machina _ and just as in the comedy the police turn up in the nick of time to fetch tartuffe to prison or in the tragedy friar john manage to be detain on he journey to mantua and thus bring about that lamentable business in the tomb of the capulet so mr flink now happen inopportunely to arrive upon we lesser stage faithfully to narrate how cock-eye flink chance to be at selwoode be a task of magnitude that gentleman travel very quietly and for the most part he journey incognito under a variety of alias suggest partly by a fertile imagination and in part by prudential motive for he notion of proprietary rights be deplorably vague and he acquaintance with the police in consequence extensive and finally that he be now at selwoode be not in the least he fault but all the do of a n & o brakesman who have in uncultured argument reinforce by a coupling-pin persuade mr flink to disembark from the northern freight on the night previous mr flink then sit lean against a tree in the garden of selwoode some thirty foot from the wall that stand between selwoode and gridlington and nurse he pride and foot both injure in that high debate of last evening and with a jackknife round off the top of a substantial staff design to alleviate he present lameness meanwhile he temper he solitude with music whistle melodiously the air of a song that pertain to the sacredness of home and of a white-haired mother subsequently to cock-eye flink -lrb- as the playbill have it -rrb- enter a vision in violet ruffle wide-eyed she come upon he in she misery steadily trudge toward a unknown goal i think he startle she a bit indeed it must be admit that mr flink while a man of undoubted talent in he particular line of business be like many of you great genius in outward aspect unprepossessing and misleading for whereas he look like a very shiftless and very dirty tramp he be as a matter of fact as vile a rascal as ever pawn a swinish soul for whiskey what be you do here say margaret sharply do not you know this be private property to he foot rise cock-eye flink lady say he with humbleness you would not be hard on a poor workingman would you it be not my fault i be here lady -- at least it be not rightly my fault i just climb over the wall to rest a minute -- just a minute lady in the shade of these beautiful tree i be not a-hurting nobody by that lady i hope well you have no business to do it miss hugonin point out and you can just climb right back then she regard he more intently and she face soften somewhat what be the matter with you foot she demand brakesman say mr flink briefly throw I off a train he strike I cruel hard he do and I a poor workingman try to make my way to new york lady where my poor old mother 's die lady and I out of a job ah it be a hard hard world lady -- and I she only son -- and he strike I cruel cruel hard he do but i forgive he for it lady ah lady you be so beautiful i know you be get a kind good heart lady can not you do something for a poor workingman lady with a poor die mother -- and a poor sick wife mr flink add as a dolorous afterthought and draw nearer to she and hold out one hand appealingly petheridge jukesbury have at diver time point out to she the evil of promiscuous charity and these dictum margaret parrot glibly enough to do she justice so long as there be no immediate question of dispense alms but for all that the next whining beggar would move she tender heart he glib invention play upon it like a fiddle and she would give as recklessly as though there be no such thing in the whole wide world as soup-kitchen and organise charity and common-sense because you know she would afterward salve she conscience i _ could not _ be sure he do not need it whereas i be _ quite _ sure i do not now she waver for a moment you do not say you have a wife before she suggest a invalid sigh mr flink -- a helpless invalid lady and six small child probably cry for bread at this very moment ah lady think what my feeling must be to hear 'em cry in vain -- think what i must suffer to know that i summon they cherub out of heaven into this here hard hard world lady and now can not do by 'em properly and cock-eye flink brush away a tear which i for one be incline to regard as a particularly ambitious flight of he imagination promptly margaret open the bag at she waist and take out she purse do not she plead please do not i -- i be upset already take this and please -- oh _ please _ do not spend it in get drunk or gambling or anything horrid miss hugonin implore he you all do and it be so selfish of you and so discouraging mr flink eye the purse hungrily such a fat purse think cock-eye plink and there be not nobody within a mile of here neither you be not to imagine that mr flink be totally abandon he vice be parochial restrain for the most part by a lively apprehension of the law but now the spell of the eagle be strong upon he lady say mr flink twist in he grimy hand the bill she have give he -- and there too the eagle flaunt in he vigor and hearten he lady that be not much for you to give can not you do a little better than that by a poor workingman lady a very unpleasant-looking person mr cock-eye flink oh a peculiarly unpleasant-looking person to be a model son and a loving husband and a tender father margaret be fill with a vague alarm but she be brave be margaret no say she very decidedly i sha not give you another cent so you climb right over that wall and go straight back where you belong the method of mr flink i regret to say be somewhat more crude than those of mesdame haggage and saumarez and messieur kennaston and jukesbury cheese it say mr flink and fling away he staff and draw very near to she gimme that money do you hear do not you dare touch I she pant ah do not you _ dare _ aw hell say mr flink disgustedly and he dirty hand be upon she and he foul breath reek in she face in she hour of need margaret 's heart speak billy she wail oh billy _ billy _ \* \* \* \* \* he come to she -- just as he would have scale heaven to come to she just as he would have come to she in the nethermost pit of hell if she have call ah yes billy wood come to she now in she peril and i do not think that mr flink particularly relish the look upon billy 's face as he run through the garden for billy be furiously move cock-eye flink glance back at the wall behind he ten foot high and the fellow be not far off cock-eye flink catch up he staff and as billy close upon he strike he full on the head again and again he strike he it be a sickening business billy have stop short for a instant he stand sway on he foot a puzzle face show under the trickle blood then he fling out he hand a little and they flap loosely at the wrist like wet clothes hang in the wind to dry and billy seem to crumple up suddenly and slide down upon the grass in a untidy heap ah-h-h say mr flink he draw back and stare stupidly at that sprawl flesh which just now have be a man and be seize with uncontrollable shudder ah-h-h say mr flink very quietly and margaret go mad the earth and the sky dissolve in many float speck and then go red -- red like that heap yonder the veneer of civilisation peel fall from she like snow from a shake garment the primal beast wake and flick aside the century ' work she be the cave-woman who have see the death of she mate -- the brute who have be rob of she mate damn you _ damn _ you she scream she voice high flat quite unhuman ah god in heaven damn you with inarticulate bestial cry she fall upon the man who have kill billy and she violet frippery flutter she impotent little hand beat at he tear at he she be fearless shameless insane she only know that billy be dead with a oath the man fling she from he and turn on he heel she fall to coax the heap in the grass to tell she that he forgive she -- to open he eye -- to stop bloody she dress -- to come to luncheon a fly settle on billy 's face and come in he zig-zag course to the red stream trickle from he nostril and stop short she brush the carrion thing away but it crawl back drunkenly she touch it with she finger and the fly would not move on a sudden every nerve in she body begin to shake and jerk like a flag snap in the wind xxvi some ten minute afterward as the member of the house-party sit chat on the terrace before selwoode there come among they a mad woman in violet trappings that be splotch with blood do you know that billy be dead she query smilingly oh yes a man kill billy just now be not it too bad billy be such a nice boy you know i -- i think it be very sad i think it be the saddest thing i ever know of in my life kathleen saumarez be the first to reach she but she draw back quickly no ah no she say with a little shudder you do not love billy he love you and you do not love he oh kathleen kathleen how _ could _ you help loving billy he be such a nice boy i -- i be rather sorry he be dead then she stand silent pick at she dress thoughtfully and still smile afterward for the first and only time in history miss hugonin faint -- faint with a anxious smile petheridge jukesbury catch she as she fall and begin to blubber like a whip schoolboy as he stand there hold she in he arm xxvii but billy be not dead there be still a feeble jerky flutter in he big chest when colonel hugonin find he he heart still move but under the colonel 's hand its stirring be vague and aimless as those of a captive butterfly the colonel have see dead man and die man before this and as he bent over the boy he love he give a convulsive sob and afterward bury he face in he hand then -- of all unlikely person in the world -- it be petheridge jukesbury who rise to meet the occasion he suavity and blandness forget in the presence of death he mount with confident alacrity to height of greatness masterfully he override they all he pour brandy between billy 's tooth then he order the lady off to bed and recommend to mr kennaston -- when that gentleman speak of a clergyman -- a far more startling destination for it be far from my intention say mr jukesbury to appear lack in respect to the cloth but -- er -- just at present i be incline to think we be in somewhat greater need of a mattress and a doctor and -- ah -- the exercise of a little common-sense the gentleman be -- er -- let we hope in no immediate danger how dare you suggest such a thing sir thunder petheridge jukesbury do not you see that poor girl 's face i tell you i 'll be damned if he die sir and i fancy the recording angel hear he and against a list of wordy cheat register that oath to he credit it be petheridge jukesbury then who stalk into mr haggage 's apartment and appropriate she mattress as the first at hand and afterward waddle through the garden bear it on he fat shoulder and still later lift billy upon it as gently as a woman could have but it be the hatless colonel on he favorite black bess -lrb- damn you motor-car the colonel be wont to say i consider my appearance sufficiently unprepossessing already sir without my arrive in heaven in fragment and stink of gasoline -rrb- who in fairhaven town some quarter of a hour afterward leap dr jeal 's garden fence and subsequently bundle the doctor into he gig and again yet later it be the colonel who stand fume upon the terrace with dr jeal on he way to selwoode indeed but still some four mile from the mansion toward which he be urge he staid horse at its liveliest gait kennaston try to soothe he but the colonel clamour to the heaven kennaston he qualify in various way and as for dr jeal he would hold he responsible -- personally sir -- for the consequence of he dawdle in this fashion -- damme sir like a damn ' snail with a wooden leg i be afraid say kennaston gravely that the doctor will be of very little use when he do arrive there be that in he face which make the colonel pause in he objurgation sir say the colonel what -- do -- you -- mean he find articulation somewhat difficult in you absence kennaston answer mr jukesbury who it appear know something of medicine have subject mr wood to a examination it -- it would be unkind to deceive you -- come to the point sir the colonel interrupt he what -- do you -- mean i mean say felix kennaston sadly that -- he be afraid -- mr wood will never recover consciousness colonel hugonin stare at he the skin of he flabby wrinkled old throat be work convulsively then you be wrong sir the colonel say billy _ sha not _ die damn jukesbury damn all doctor too sir i put my trust in my god sir and not in a box of damn ' sugar-pill sir and i tell you sir _ that boy be not go to die _ afterward he turn and go into selwoode defiantly xxviii in the living-hall the colonel find margaret white as paper with purple lip that timidly smile at he why be not you in bed the old gentleman demand with as great a affectation of sternness as he could muster to say the truth it be not much for colonel hugonin for all he bluster optimism be sadly shake now attractive say margaret i be but i could not stay there my -- my brain will not stop work you see she complain wearily there be a thin little whisper in the back of it that keep tell I about billy and what a liar he be and what nice eye he have and how poor billy be dead it keep tell I that over and over again attractive it be such a tiresome silly little whisper but he be dead be not he do not mr kennaston tell I just now that he be dead -- or be it the whisper attractive the colonel cough kennaston -- er -- kennaston 's a fool he declare helplessly always say he be a fool we 'll have jeal in presently no -- i remember now -- mr kennaston say billy would die very soon you do not like people to disagree with you do you attractive of course he will die for the man hit he very _ very _ hard i be sorry billy be go to die though even if he be such a liar do not say the colonel hoarsely do not daughter i do not know what there be between you and billy but you be wrong oh you be very hopelessly wrong billy 's the finest boy i know margaret shake she head in dissent no he be a very contemptible liar she say disinterestedly and that be what make it so queer that i should care for he more than i do for anything else in the world yes it be very queer then margaret go into the room opening into the living-hall where billy wood lay unconscious pallid breathing stertorously and the colonel stare after she oh my god my god groan the poor colonel why could not it have be i why could not it have be i that be not want any longer she would never have grieve like that for I and indeed i do not think she would have for to margaret there have come as god willing there come to every clean-souled woman the time to put away all childish thing and all childish memory and all childish tie if need be to follow one man only and cleave to he and know he life and hers to be knit up together past severance in a love that death itself may not affright nor slay xxix she sit silent in one corner of the darkened room it be the bedroom that frederick r wood formerly occupy -- on the ground floor of selwoode opening into the living-hall -- to which they have carry billy jukesbury have do what he could in the bed lay billy wood swathe in hot blanket with bottle of hot water set to he foot jukesbury have wash he face clean of that awful red and have wrap bandage of crack ice about he head and prop it high with pillow it be little short of marvellous to see the pursy old hypocrite go cat-footed about the room on he stealthy ministration replenish the bandage force spirit of ammonia between billy 's tooth fight deftly and confidently with death billy still breathe the colonel come and go uneasily the clock on the mantel tick margaret brood in a silence that be only accentuate by that horrible wheeze gurgle tremulous breathing in the bed yonder would the doctor never come she be curiously conscious of she absolute lack of emotion but always the interminable thin whispering in the back of she head go on and on oh if he have only die four year ago oh if he have only die the dear clean-minded honest boy i use to know when that noise stop he will be dead and then perhaps i shall be able to cry oh if he have only die four year ago and then _ da capo _ on and on run the interminable thin whispering as margaret wait for death to come to billy billy look so old now under he many bandage surely he must be very very near death suddenly as jukesbury wrap new bandage about he forehead billy open he eye and without further movement smile placidly up at he hello jukesbury say billy wood where 's my armor jukesbury too smile the man be bring it downstairs now he answer quietly because billy go on fretfully i do not propose to miss the trojan war the prince orgulous with high blood chafe you know be all go to be there and i do not propose to miss it behind he fat back petheridge jukesbury wave a caution hand at margaret who have rise from she chair but it be very absurd billy murmur in the mere ghost of a voice because man do not propose by mistake except in farce somebody tell I that but i can not remember who because i be a misogynist that be a greek word and i would explain it to peggy if she would only give I a chance but she can not because she have those seventeen hundred and fifty thousand child to look after there must be some way to explain to she though because where there be a will there be always a way and there be three will uncle fred should not have leave so many will -- who would have think the old man have so much ink in he but i will be a very great painter uncle fred and make she sorry for the way she have treat I and _ then _ kathleen will understand i be talk about peggy he voice die away and margaret sit with wide eye listen for it again would the doctor never come billy be smile and pick at the sheet but peggy be so rich the faint voice presently complain -- so beastly rich there be gold in she hair and if you will look very closely you will see that she lash be pure gold until she dip they in the ink-pot besides she expect I to sit up and beg for lump of sugar and i _ never _ take sugar in my coffee and peggy do not drink coffee at all so i think it be very unfair especially as teddy anstruther drink like a fish and she be go to marry he peggy why will not you marry I you know i have always love you peggy and now i can tell you so because uncle fred have leave I all he money you think a great deal about money peggy you say it be the greatest thing in the world and it must be because it be the only thing -- the _ only _ thing peggy -- that have be strong enough to keep we apart a part be never greater than the whole peggy but i will explain about that when you open that desk there be shark in it be not there peggy -- _ be not _ there he voice have rise to a querulous tone gently the fat old man restrain he yes say petheridge jukesbury dear I yes why dear I of course but he warn hand hold margaret back -- margaret who stand with big tear trickle down she cheek dearer than life itself billy assent wearily but before god loving you as i do i would not marry you now for all the wealth in the world i forget why but all the world be a stage you know and they do not use stage now but only railroad be that why you rail at I so peggy that be a joke you ought to laugh at my joke because i love you but i can not ever ever tell you so because you be rich a rich man can not pass through a needle 's eye oh peggy peggy i love you eye but they be so _ big _ peggy so billy wood lay still and babble ceaselessly but through all he irrelevant talk as you may see a tributary stream pulse unsullied in a muddy river run the thought of peggy -- of peggy and of she cruelty and of she beauty and of the money that stand between they and margaret who could never have believe he in he sens listen and know that in he delirium the rudder of he thought snap he could not but speak truth as she crouch in the corner of the room she face bury in a arm-chair she gold hair half loosen she shoulder monotonously heave she weep gently inaudibly almost happily almost happily billy be die but she know now past any doubt that he love she the dear clean-minded honest boy have come back to she and she could love he now without shame and there be only herself to be loathe -lrb- illustration : regard they with alert eye -rrb- then the door open then with colonel hugonin come martin jeal -- a wisp of a man like a November leaf -- and regard they from under he shaggy white hair with alert eye hey what be this say dr jeal eh yes eh -- yes he meditate slowly most irregular you must let we have the room miss hugonin in the hall she wait hope ah of course there be no hope the thin little whisper tell she by and bye though -- after century of wait -- the three man come into the hall miss hugonin say dr jeal with a strange kindness in he voice i do not think we shall need you again i be happy to tell you though that the patient be do nicely -- very nicely indeed margaret clutch he arm you -- you mean -- i mean say dr jeal that there be no fracture a slight concussion of the brain madam and -- so far as i can see -- no sign of inflammation bar accident i think we 'll have that young man out of bed in a week thanks he add to mr -- er -- jukesbury here whose prompt action be under heaven undoubtedly the means of stave off meningitis and probably -- indeed more than probably -- the means of save mr wood 's life it be splendid sir splendid no doctor -- why god bless my soul for miss hugonin have throw she arm about petheridge jukesbury 's neck and have kiss he vigorously you beautiful child say miss hugonin er -- jukesbury say the colonel mysteriously there be a little cognac in the cellar that -- er -- the colonel jerk he thumb across the hallway with the air of a conspirator eh say the colonel why -- er -- yes say mr jukesbury why -- ah -- yes i think i might they go across the hall together the colonel 's hand rest fraternally on petheridge jukesbury 's shoulder xxx the next day there be a general exodus from selwoode and margaret 's satellite disperse upon they diver way selwoode as they understand it be no longer hers and they know billy wood well enough to recognize that from selwoode 's new master there be no desirable pickings to be have such as the philanthropic crew have fatten on these four year past so there come to they one and all urgent telegram or insistent letter or some equally unanswerable demand for they presence elsewhere such as be usually prevalent among we guest in very dull or very troublous time miss hugonin smile a little bitterly she consider that the scale have fall from she eye and flattered herself that she be by way of become a bit of a misanthrope also i believe there be a note concern the hollowness of life and the worthlessness of society in general in a word margaret fall back upon the extreme cynicism and world-weariness of twenty-three and assure herself that she despise everybody whereas as a matter of fact she never in she life succeed in dislike anything except mouse and piano-practice and for a very little while billy wood and this for the very excellent reason that the god have fashion she solely to the end that she might love all mankind and in return be love by humanity in general and adore by that portion of it which inhabit trousers but the rat always desert a sink ship say miss hugonin with the air of one deliver a particularly original sentiment they make I awfully tire and i do not care for they in the least but petheridge jukesbury be a _ dear _ and i may be poor now but i _ do _ try to do good with the money when i have it and _ anyhow _ billy be go to get well and after all that be the one thing that really matter though of course billy would always despise she he would be quite right too the girl think humbly but the conventionality of life be more powerful than even youthful cynicism and youthful heart-break prior to devote herself to a loveless life and the commonplace of the stoic 's tub miss hugonin be compel by the barest decency to bid she guest godspeed and adèle haggage kiss she for the first time in she life she have be a little awed by miss hugonin the famous heiress -- a little jealous of she i dare say on account of hugh van orden -- but now she kiss she very heartily in farewell and say do not forget you be to come to we as soon as _ possible _ and be beyond any question perfectly sincere in say it and hugh van orden almost drag margaret under the main stairway and far from show any marked abhorrence to she in she present state of destitution implore she with tear in he eye to marry he at once and to bring the colonel to live with they for the rest of he natural existence for it be damned impertinent of I of course mr van orden readily concede and i suppose i ought to beg you pardon for mention it but i _ do _ love you to a perfectly unlimited extent it be play the very deuce with my polo miss hugonin and as for my appetite -- why if you will not have I cry hugh in desperation i -- i really you know i do not believe i 'll _ ever _ be able to eat anything when margaret refuse he -- for the sixth time i think -- i will not swear that she do not kiss he under the dark stairway and if she do he be a nice boy and he deserve it and as for sarah ellen haggage that unreverend old parasite bring she a blank cheque sign with she name and mention quite a goodly sum as the extent to which margaret might go for necessary expense for you 'll need it she say and rub she nose reflectively move be the very deuce for waste money because so many little thing keep crop up now remember a quarter be quite enough to give _ any _ man for move a trunk and there be no earthly sense in you take a cab margaret -- the street-car will bring you within a block of we door these little trifle count dear and do not let célestine pack you thing because she be abominably careless let marie do it -- and do not tip she give she a old hat and if i be you i would certainly consult a lawyer about the legality of that idiotic will i remember distinctly hear that mr wood be very eccentric in he last day and i have not a doubt he be rave mad when he leave all he money to a great strapping long-legged young fellow who be perfectly capable of take care of himself get better be he well i suppose i be glad to hear it but he would much better have stay in paris -- where i remember distinctly hear he lead the most dissipate and immoral life my dear -- instead of come over here and upset everything and again mr haggage rub she nose -- indignantly he _ do not _ say margaret and i _ can not _ take you money beautiful and i do not see how we can possibly come to stay with you do not you argue with I mrs haggage exhort she i be not in any temper to be argue with i have spend the morning sewing bias stripe in a bias skirt -- something which from a moral-ruining and resolution-overthrowing standpoint simply knock the spot off job you 'll take that money and you 'll come to I as soon as you can and -- god bless you my dear and again margaret be kiss altogether it be a very osculatory morning for miss hugonin mr jukesbury 's adieus however be more formal and -- i be sorry to say it -- the old fellow go away wonder if the rich mr wood might not conceivably be very grateful to the man who have save he life and evince he gratitude in some agreeable and substantial form mr saumarez and mr kennaston also be somewhat unenthusiastic in they parting kennaston could not feel quite at ease with margaret brazen it as he might with devil-may-carish flippancy and kathleen have by this a inkling as to how matter stand between margaret and billy and be somewhat puzzle thereat and love the former in consequence no more than any christian female be compel to love the woman who either unconsciously or with deliberation purloin she ancient lover a woman rarely forgive the man who have cease to care for she and rarelier still can she pardon the woman who have dare succeed she in he affection and besides they be utterly engross with one another and utterly happy and utterly selfish with the immemorial selfishness of lover who can not for a moment conceive that the whole world be not somehow benefit by they happiness and do not await with breathless interest the outcome of they bickering with the blind bow-god and from this providential delusion derive a meritorious and comfortable glow so mrs saumarez and mr kennaston part from margaret with kindness it be true but not without awkwardness and that be the man that almost she have love thought margaret as she gaze on the whirl of dust leave by they carriage-wheel go with a few perfunctory word of sympathy and for my part i think that the base indian who throw a pearl away worth more than all he tribe be in comparison with felix kennaston a shrewd and long-headed man if you have give _ I _ he chance margaret but this however be highly digressive the colonel standing beside she used language that be unrefined he aspiration as to the future of mr kennaston and mr jukesbury it appear be both lurid and unfriendly but why attractive query he daughter may they be qualify with such and such adjective desire the colonel fervently they try to lend I money -- would not hear of my not take it in case of necessity ' bah say the colonel and shake he fist after the retreat carriage may they be qualify with such and such adjective how happily she laugh and you be swearing at they she pout oh my dear my dear how hard you be on all my little friend of course i be say the colonel stoutly they have deprive I of the pleasure of despise 'em it be worth double the money i tell you i never object to any man quite so much and now they have go and behave decently with the deliberate purpose of annoying I oh cry the colonel and shake a immaculate withered old hand toward the spring sky may they be qualify with such and such adjective and that so far as we be concern be the end of margaret 's satellite my dear mrs grundy may one point the somewhat obvious moral i thank you madam for you long-suffering kindness permit I then to vault toward my moral over the shoulder of a greater man among the papers leave by one charle dickens -- a novelist who be obsolete now because he wallow naked in the pathetic and be frequently guilty of a very vulgar sort of humor that actually make people laugh which as we now know be not the purpose of humor -- a novelist who incessantly caricature nature and by these inartistic and underhand method create character that be more real to we than the folk we jostle in the street and -lrb- god know -rrb- far more vital and worthy of attention than the folk who can not read dickens -- you will find i say a note of a idea which he never afterward develop run to this effect : full length portrait of he lordship surround by worshipper sensible man enough agreeable man enough independent man enough in a certain way but the moment they begin to circle round my lord and to shine with a borrow light from he lordship heaven and earth how mean and subservient what a competition and outbid of each other in servility and this with my lord and he lordship erase to make way for the word money be my moral the folk who have just leave selwoode be honest enough as honesty go nowadays kindly as any of we dare be who have we own way to make among very stalwart and determine rival generous as any man may venture to be in a world where the first of every month find the butcher and the baker and the candlestick-maker rap at the door with they little bill : but they cringe to money it be very wrong of they my dear lady and in extenuation i can only plead that they could no more help cringe to money than you or i can help it this be very crude and very cynical but unfortunately it be true we always cringe to money which be humiliating and the sun always rise at a hour when sensible people be abed and have not the least need for its service which be foolish and what you and i my dear madam be to do about rectify either one of these vexatious circumstance i be sure i do not know we can at least be honest let we then console ourselves at will with moral observation concern the number of pocket in a shroud and the difficulty of a rich man 's enter into the kingdom of heaven but with a humble and reverent heart let we admit that in the world we know money rule its presence awe we and if we be quite candid we must concede that we very unfeignedly envy and admire the rich we must grant that money confer a certain distinction on a man be he the veriest ass that ever heehaw a platitude and that we can not but treat he accordingly you and i you be friendly of course with you poor cousin you be delighted to have they drop in to dinner and liberal enough with the claret when they do but when the magnate come there be a magnum of champagne and a extra lamp in the drawing-room and -- i blush to write it -- a far more agreeable hostess at the head of the table dive be such good company you see and speak for my own sex i defy any honest fellow to lay he hand upon he waistcoat and swear that it do not give he a distinct thrill of pleasure to be see in public with a millionaire daily we truckle in the eagle 's shadow -- the shadow that lay so heavily across selwoode with the eagle himself and with the eagle 's work in the world -- the grim implacable ruthless work that hourly he go about -- we little comedy have naught to do schlemihl-like we deal but in shadow even the shadow of the eagle be a terrible thing -- a shadow that as felix kennaston have tell you chill faith and charity and independence and kindliness and truth and -- alas -- even common honesty but this be both cynical and digressive xxxi dr jeal better than he word have billy wood out of bed in five day to billy they be very long and very dreary day and to margaret very long and penitential one but colonel hugonin enjoy they thoroughly for as he feelingly and frequently observe it be a immense consolation to any man to reflect that he home no longer contain more damn ' foolishness to the square inch than any other house in the united state on all side they seek for cock-eye flink but they never find he and to this day they have never find he the fate have play they pawn sweep it from the board and cock-eye flink disappear in clotho 's capacious pocket all this time the young people see nothing of one another on this point jeal be adamantean in a sick-room he vehemently declare a woman be well enough but _ the _ woman be the devil and all i have tell that young man plainly sir that he do not see you daughter till he get well -- and by george sir he 'll get well now just in order to see she nature be the only doctor who ever cure anybody colonel we human for all we pill-box and lancet can only prompt she -- and devilish demoralising advice we generally give she too he add with a chuckle peggy this be the first observation of mr wood when he come to he sens he swear feebly when peggy be deny to he he plead he scold he even threaten as a last resort to get out of bed and go in immediate search of she and in return jeal tell he very affably that it be far less difficult to manage a patient in a straight-jacket than one out of it and that personally nothing would please he so much as a plausible pretext for clap mr wood into one of 'em jeal have he own method in deal with the fractious then billy clamour for colonel hugonin and subsequently the colonel come in some bewilderment to he daughter 's room billy say that will be not to be probate he inform she testily i be to make sure it be not probate till he get well you be to give I you word you 'll do nothing further in the matter till billy get well that be he message and i would like to know what the devil this infernal nonsense mean i be not a fenian nor yet a guy fawke daughter and in consequence i be free to confess i do not care for all this damn mystery and shilly-shallying but that be the message miss hugonin debate with herself that i will do nothing further in the matter till billy get well she repeat reflectively yes i suppose i 'll have to promise it but you can tell he for I that i consider he be _ horrid _ and just as obstinate and selfish as he can _ possibly _ be can you remember that attractive yes thank you say the colonel i can remember it but i be not go to nice sort of message to send a sick man be not it i do not know what be get into you margaret -- no begad i do not i think you be possess of seventeen devil and now the old gentleman demand after a awkward pause be you or be you not go to tell I what all this mystery be about i can not miss hugonin protest it -- it be a secret attractive it be not say the colonel flatly -- it be some more damn foolishness and he go away in a fret and use language xxxii leave to herself miss hugonin meditate miss hugonin be in she kimono and oh madame chrysastheme oh madame butterfly oh mimosa san and pittus sing and yum yum and all ye vaunted beauty of japan if you could have see she in that garb poor little lady of the orient how hopelessly you would have wring you henna-stained finger poor little ichabod of the east whose glory depart irretrievably when she adopt this garment i tremble to think of the heart-burning and palpitation and hari-kari that would have ensue it be pink -- the pink of she cheek to a shade and scatter about it be bird and butterfly and snaky emaciated dragon with back like saw-teeth and prodigious fang and claw and very curly tail such as they breed in nankeen plate and use to breed on package of fire-cracker -- all do in gold the gold of she hair moreover one might catch a glimpse of she neck -- which be a manifest favor of the god -- and about it mysterious lacy white thing intermingle with diver tiny blue ribbon i see she in it once -- by accident and now i fancy as she stand rigid with indignation she cheek flush it must have be a heady spectacle to note how they shell-pink repeat the pink of she fantastic garment like a chromatic echo and how she sunny hair a thought loosen a shade dishevelled clung heavily about she face a golden snare for eye and heart and how she own eye enormous cerulean -- twin sapphire such as in the old day might have ransom a brace of emperor -- grow wistful like a child 's who have be punish and do not know exactly why and how she petulant mouth quiver and the long black lash golden at the root quiver too -- ah yes it must have be a heady spectacle _ now _ she announce i see plainly what he intend do he be go to destroy that will and burden I once more with a large and influential fortune i do not want it and i will not take it and he might just as well understand that in the very begin i do not care if uncle fred do leave it to I -- i do not ask he to do i besides he be a very foolish old man -- if he have leave the money to billy _ everything _ would have be all right that be always the way -- my doll be invariably stuff with sawdust and i _ never _ have a dear gazelle to glad I with he dappled hide but when he come to know I well he fall upon the buttered side -- or something to that effect i hate poetry anyhow -- it be so mushy and this from the miss hugonin who a week ago be interested in the french _ decadent _ and partial to folk-songs from the romaic i think we may fairly deduce that the reign of felix kennaston be over the king be dead and margaret 's thought and affection and she very dream have fall loyally to cry long live the king -- he majesty billy the first oh say margaret with a indignant gasp what time she eyebrow gesticulate i think billy wood be a meddlesome _ piece _ -- that be what i think do he suppose that after wait all this time for the only man in the world who can keep I interested for four hour on a stretch and send my pulse up to a hundred and make I feel those thrilly thrill i have always long for -- do he suppose that now i be go to pay any attention to he silly notion about will and thing he be abominably selfish i sha not margaret move across the room shimmering rustling glitter like a fairy in a pantomime then to consider matter at greater ease she curl up on a divan in much the attitude of a tiny cleopatra ride at anchor on a carpeted cydnus billy think i want the money -- bless he boot he think i be a stuck-up grasp purse-proud little pig and he have every right to think so after the way i talk to he though he ought to have realize i be in a temper about kathleen saumarez and have pay no attention to what i say and he actually attempt to reason with I if he would have _ any _ consideration for my feeling he would have simply smack I and make I behave -- however he be a man and all man be selfish and _ she be _ a skinny old thing and i _ never _ have any use for she bother she lecture i never understand a word of they and i do not believe she do either woman 's club be _ all _ silly and i think the woman who belong to they be _ all _ bold-faced jig if they have any sense they would stay at home and take care of the baby instead of mess with philanthropy and education and theosophy and anything else that they can not make head or tail of and they call that be culture culture -- i hate the word i do not want to be culture -- i want to be happy this you will observe be in effect a sweeping recantation of every ideal margaret have ever boast but love be a canny pedagogue and of late he have instruct miss hugonin in a variety of matter before god loving you as i do i would not marry you for all the wealth in the world she repeat with a little shiver even in he delirium he say that but i _ know _ now that he love I and i know that i adore he and if this be a sensible world i would walk right in there and explain thing and ask he to marry I and then it would not matter in the least who have the money but i can not because it would not be proper bother propriety -- but bother it do not do any good as long as i have the money billy will never come near I because of the idiotic way i talk to he and he be bent on my take the money simply because it happen to belong to I i consider that a very silly reason i 'll _ make _ billy wood take the money and i 'll make he see that i be _ not _ a little pig and that i trust he implicitly and i think i be quite justified in use a little -- we 'll call it diplomacy -- because otherwise he would go back to france or some other objectionable place and we would both be _ very _ unhappy margaret begin to laugh softly i have give he my word that i 'll do nothing further in the matter till he get well and i will not _ but _ -- miss hugonin rise from the divan with a gesture of sweep back she hair and then -- oh treachery of tortoise-shell oh the villainy of those little gold hair-pin -- the fat twisted coil tumble loose and slowly unravel themselves and she pink-and-white face half-eclipsed show a delectable wedge between big odourful crinkly ponderous mass of hair it cling about she a heavy cloak all shimmering gold like the path of sunset over the June sea and margaret look at herself in the mirror laugh and appear perfectly content with what she see there but say she if the fate be kind to I -- and i sometimes think i _ have _ a pull with the god -- i 'll make you happy billy wood in spite of yourself the mirror flash back a smile margaret be strangely interested in the mirror she have ringlet in she hair sing margaret happily -- a low half-hushed little song she hold up a strand of it to demonstrate this fact there be a dimple in she chin -- and indeed there be and a dimple in either cheek too for a long time afterward she continue to smile at the mirror i be afraid kathleen saumarez be right she be a vain little cat be margaret but bar a rearrangement of the cosmic scheme i dare say maid will continue to delight in they own comeliness so long as mirror speak truth let we then leave miss hugonin to this innocent diversion the staidest of we be conscious of a brisk elation at sight of a pretty face and surely no considerate person will deny its owner a portion of the pleasure that daily she accord the beggar at the street-corner xxxiii we be credibly inform that time travels in diver pace with diver person -- the statement be make by a lady who may be consider to speak with some authority have triumphantly withstand the ravages of chrono for a matter of three century but i doubt if even the insolent sweet wit of rosalind could have devise a fitting simile for time 's gait at selwoode those five day that billy lay abed margaret could not but marvel at the flourish proportion attain by the hour in those sunlit spring day and at dinner say she thought hark back to luncheon recall it by a vigorous effort as a affair of the dim yester-year -- a mere blur memory faint and vague as a druidical tenet or a merovingian squabble but the time pass for all that and eventually -- it be just before dusk -- she come with martin jeal 's permission into the room where billy be and beside the big open fireplace where a wood fire chatter companionably sit a very pallid billy a rather thin billy with a great many bandage about he head you may depend upon it margaret be not look she worst that afternoon by actual count célestine have do

the eagle against poor billy who have only he honor to help he margaret 's face be pale as she bent toward he she lip part a little she eye glint eerily in the firelight the room be dark now save in the small radius of its amber glow beyond that be darkness where panel and brass blink yes say billy gravely -- forgive I if i be wrong dear but -- i do think that but you see you do not care for I peggy in the summer-house i think for a moment -- ah well you have show in a hundred way that you do not care -- and i would not have you come to I not care so i be go to burn the paper dear margaret

the end ah rope dagger and poison there be the end oh peggy peggy if you could only have love I if only this accursed money have not spoil you so utterly billy be quite properly miserable over it but he raise he head with a smile and now say he -- and not without a little little bitterness if i have any right to advise you peggy i -- i think i would be more careful in the future as to how i use

firelight she hair be a aureole and she gown yellow with multitudinous tiny arabesque of black velvet echo the glow of she hair to a shade the dancing flame make of she a flicker little yellow wraith and oh the quaint tenderness of she eye -- oh the hint of faint nameless perfume she diffuse thus run the meditation of billy 's dizzied brain listen i tell you i burn the other will i start to burn it but i be afraid to because i do not know what they could do to I if i do so i put it away in my little handkerchief-box -- and if you would have a _ grain _ of sense you would have notice the orri on it and you make I promise not to take any step in the matter till you get well i know you would so i have already send that second will -- send it before i promise you -- to hunston wyke -- he be my lawyer now you know -- and i have hear from he and he have probate it billy be make various irrelevant sound and i bring that other will to you and if you do not choose to examine it more carefully

money and money-worshipper and the power of money because i want you -- you respect billy and you think i could not give it up very well miss hugonin wave she hand airily toward the hearth now i hope you know better _ do not you dare get up billy wood _ but i think nothing short of brute force could have keep mr wood from she peggy he babble -- ah forgive I if i be a presumptuous ass -- but be it
