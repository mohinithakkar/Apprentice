produce by joseph myer and pg distribute proofreader autobiography of sir george biddell airy kcb ma lld dcl fr fras honorary fellow of trinity college cambridge astronomer royal from 1836 to 1881 edit by wilfrid airy ba minstce 1896 preface the life of airy be essentially that of a hard-working business man and differ from that of other hard-working people only in the quality and variety of he work it be not a exciting life but it be full of interest and he work bring he into close relation with many scientific man and with many man high in the state he real business life commence after he become astronomer royal and from that time forward during the 46 year that he remain in office he be so entirely wrap up in the duty of he post that the history of the observatory be the history of he life for write he business life there be abundant material for he preserve all he correspondence and the chief source of information be as follow : -lrb- 1 -rrb- he autobiography -lrb- 2 -rrb- he annual report to the board of visitor -lrb- 3 -rrb- he print papers entitle papers by gb airy -lrb- 4 -rrb- he miscellaneous private correspondence -lrb- 5 -rrb- he letter to he wife -lrb- 6 -rrb- he business correspondence -lrb- 1 -rrb- he autobiography after the time that he become astronomer royal be as might be expect mainly a record of the scientific work carry on at the greenwich observatory : but by no means exclusively so about the time when he take charge of the observatory there be a immense development of astronomical enterprise : observatory be spring up in all direction and the astronomer royal be expect to advise upon all of the british and colonial observatory it be necessary also for he to keep in touch with the continental observatory and they work and this he do very diligently and successfully both by correspondence and personal intercourse with the foreign astronomer there be also much work on important subject more or less connect with he official duty -- such as geodetical survey work the establishment of time-ball at different place longitude determination observation of eclipse and the determination of the density of the earth lastly there be a great deal of time and work give to question not very immediately connect with he office but on which the government ask he assistance in the capacity of general scientific adviser : such be the correction of the compass in iron ship the railway gauge commission the commission for the restoration of the standard of length and weight the maine boundary lighthouse the westminster clock the london university and many other question besides those above-mentioned there be a great many subject which he take up out of sheer interest in the investigation for it may fairly be say that every subject of a distinctly practical nature which could be advance by mathematical knowledge have a interest for he : and he incessant industry enable he to find time for many of they amongst such subject be tide and tidal observation clockwork and the strain in beam and bridge a certain portion of he time be also give to lecture generally on current astronomical question for he hold it as he duty to popularize the science as far as lay in he power and he attend the meeting of the royal astronomical society with great regularity and take a very active part in the discussion and business of the society he also do much work for the royal society and -lrb- up to a certain date -rrb- for the british association all of the foregoing matter be record pretty fully in he autobiography up to the year 1861 after that date the autobiography be give in a much more abbreviated form and might rather be regard as a collection of note for he biography he private history be give very fully for the first part of he life but be very lightly touch upon during he residence at greenwich a great part of the autobiography be in a somewhat disjointed state and appear to have be form by extract from a number of different source such as official journal official correspondence and report in editing the autobiography it have be think advisable to omit a large number of short note relate to the routine work of the observatory to technical and scientific correspondence to papers communicate to various society and official business connect with they and to miscellaneous matter of minor importance these in the aggregate occupy a great deal of time and attention but from they detach nature they would have but little general interest at various place will be find short memoirs and other matter by the editor -lrb- 2 -rrb- all of he annual report to the board of visitor be attach to he autobiography and be evidently intend to be read with it and to form part of it these report be so carefully compile and be so copious that they form a very complete history of the greenwich observatory and of the work carry on there during the time that he be astronomer royal the first report contain only four page but with the constantly increase amount and range of work the report constantly increase in volume till the later report contain 21 page extract from these report relate to matter of novelty and importance and illustrate the principle which guide he in he conduct of the observatory have be incorporate with the autobiography -lrb- 3 -rrb- the print papers by gb airy be bind in 14 large quarto volume there be 518 of these papers on a great variety of subject : a list of they be append to this history as also be a list of the book that he write and one or two of the papers which be separately print they form a very important part of he life 's work and be frequently refer to in the present history they be almost all to be find in the transaction of society or in newspaper and extend over a period of 63 year -lrb- 1822 to 1885 -rrb- the progress make in certain branch of science during this long period can very fairly be trace by these papers -lrb- 4 -rrb- he private correspondence be large and like he other papers it be carefully arrange no business letter of any kind be include under this head in this correspondence letter be occasionally find either deal with matter of importance or in some way characteristic and these have be insert in this biography as already state the autobiography leave by airy be confine almost entirely to science and business and touch very lightly on private matter or correspondence -lrb- 5 -rrb- the letter to he wife be very numerous they be write during he occasional absence from home on business or for relaxation on these occasion he rarely let a day pass without write to he wife and sometimes he write twice on the same day they be full of energy and interest and many extract from they be insert in this history a great deal of the personal history be take from they -lrb- 6 -rrb- all correspondence in any way connect with business during the time that he be astronomer royal be to be find at the royal observatory it be all bind and arrange in the most perfect order and any letter throughout this time can be find with the greatest ease it be very bulky and much of it be in a historical sense very interesting it be no doubt mainly from this correspondence that the autobiography which so far as related to the greenwich part of it be almost entirely a business history be compile the history of the early part of he life be write in great detail and contain a large quantity of family matter which be evidently not intend for publication this part of the autobiography have be compress the history of the latter part of he life be not write by himself at all and have be compile from he journal and other source in both these case and occasionally in short paragraph throughout the narrative it have be find convenient to write the history in the third person 2 the circus greenwich note the syndic of the cambridge university press desire to express they thanks to messr macmillan

by gb airy and list of book write by gb airy index chapter i personal sketch of george biddell airy the history of airy 's life and especially the history of he life 's work be give in the chapter that follow but it be feel that the present memoir would be incomplete without a reference to those personal characteristic upon which the work of he life hinge and which can only be very faintly gather from he autobiography he be of medium stature and not powerfully build : as he advance in year he stoop a good deal he hand be large-boned and well-formed he constitution be remarkably sound at no period in he life do he seem to have take the least interest in athletic sport or competition but he be a very active pedestrian and could endure a great deal of fatigue he be by no means want in physical courage and on various occasion especially in boat expedition he run considerable risk in debate and controversy he have great self-reliance and be absolutely fearless he eye-sight be peculiar and required correction by spectacles the lens of which be ground to peculiar curve accord to formula which he himself investigate : with these spectacles he see extremely well and he commonly carry three pair adapt to different distance : he take great interest in the change that take place in he eye-sight and write several papers on the subject in he later year he become somewhat deaf but not to the extent of serious personal inconvenience the ruling feature of he character be undoubtedly order from the time that he go up to cambridge to the end of he life he system of order be strictly maintain he write he autobiography up to date soon after he have take he degree and make he first will as soon as he have any money to leave he account be perfectly keep by double entry throughout he life and he value extremely the order of book-keeping : this facility of keep account be very useful to he he seem not to have destroy a document of any kind whatever : counterfoil of old cheque-book note for tradesman circular bill and correspondence of all sort be carefully preserve in the most complete order from the time that he go to cambridge and a huge mass they form to a high appreciation of order he attribute in a great degree he command of mathematics and sometimes speak of mathematics as nothing more than a system of order carry to a considerable extent in everything he be methodical and orderly and he have the greatest dread of disorder creep into the routine work of the observatory even in the smallest matter as a example he spend a whole afternoon in write the word empty on large card to be nail upon a great number of empty packing box because he notice a little confusion arise from they get mixed with other box contain different article and a assistant could not be spare for this work without withdraw he from he appoint duty he arrangement of the observatory correspondence be excellent and elaborate : probably no papers be more easy of reference than those arrange on he system he strict habit of order make he insist very much upon detail in he business with other and the rigid discipline arise out of he system of order make he rule irksome to such of he subordinate as do not conform readily to it : but the efficiency of the observatory unquestionably depend mainly upon it as he power fail with age the ruling passion for order assume a greater prominence and in he last day he seem to be more anxious to put letter which he receive into they proper place for reference than even to master they contents he nature be eminently practical and any subject which have a distinctly practical object and could be advance by mathematical investigation possess interest for he and he dislike of mere theoretical problem and investigation be proportionately great he be continually at war with some of the resident cambridge mathematician on this subject year after year he criticise the senate house papers and the smith 's prize papers question by question very severely : and conduct a interesting and acrimonious private correspondence with professor cayley on the same subject he great mathematical power and he command of mathematics be sufficiently evidence by the numerous mathematical treatise of the highest order which he publish a list of which be append to this biography but a very important feature of he investigation be the thoroughness of they he be never satisfy with leave a result as a barren mathematical expression he would reduce it if possible to a practical and numerical form at any cost of labor : and would use any approximation which would conduce to this result rather than leave the result in a unfruitful condition he never shirk arithmetical work : the longest and most laborious reduction have no terror for he and he be remarkably skilful with the various mathematical expedient for shorten and facilitate arithmetical work of a complex character this power of handle arithmetic be of great value to he in the observatory reduction and in the observatory work generally he regard it as a duty to finish off he work whatever it be and the writer well remember he comment on the mathematics of one of he old friend to the effect that he be too fond of leave a result in the form of three complex equation with three unknown quantity to one who have know in some degree of the enormous quantity of arithmetical work which he have turn out and the unsparing manner in which he have devote himself to it there be something very pathetic in he discovery towards the close of he long life that the figure would not add up he energy and business capacity be remarkable he be make for work and could not long be happy without it whatever subject he be engage upon he keep he object clearly in view and make straight for it aim far more at clearness and directness than at elegance of period or symmetry of arrangement he write he letter with great ease and rapidity : and have write they he very rarely have occasion to re-write they though he often add insertion and interlineation even in the most important official letter without this it would have be impossible for he to have turn out the enormous quantity of correspondence that he do he never dictate letter and only avail himself of clerical assistance in matter of the most ordinary routine in he excursion as in he work he be always energetic and could not endure inaction whatever there be of interest in the place that he visit he examine thoroughly and without delay and then pass on and he thus accomplish a great deal in a short vacation he letter write to he wife while he be on he excursion be very numerous and characteristic and afford ample proof of he incessant energy and activity both of body and mind they be not brilliantly write for it be not in he nature to write for effect and he would never give himself the trouble to study the composition of he letter but they be straight-forward clear and concise and he be never at a loss for suitable language to express he idea he have a wonderful capacity for enjoyment : the subject that chiefly interest he be scenery architecture and antiquity but everything novel or curious have a interest for he he make several journey to the continent but by far the greater number of he excursion be make in england and scotland and there be few part of the country which he have not visit he be very fond of the lake district of cumberland and visit it very frequently and each time that he go there the same set of view have a eternal freshness for he and he write long description of the scenery and effect with the same rapture as if he have see it for the first time many of he letter be write from playford a village in a beautiful part of suffolk a few mile from ipswich here he have a small property and generally stay there for a short time once or twice a year he be extremely fond of this country and be never tire of repeat he walk by the well-known lane and footpath and as in cumberland the suffolk country have a eternal freshness and novelty for he wherever he go he be indefatigable in keep up he acquaintance with he numerous friend and he letter abound in social reminiscence he memory be singularly retentive it be much remark at school in he early day and in the course of he life he have store up in he memory a incredible quantity of poetry ballad and miscellaneous fact and information of all sort which be all constantly ready and at he service it be almost needless to add that he memory be equally accurate and extensive in matter connect with science or business he independence of character be no doubt due to and inseparable from he great power the value of he scientific work greatly depend upon he self-reliance and independence of thought and in the heavy work of remodel the observatory it be a very valuable quality this same self-reliance make he in he latter year apt to draw conclusion too confidently and hastily on subject which he have take up more as a pastime than as work but whatever he touch he deal with ably and in the most fearless truthseeking manner and leave original and vigorous opinion he have a remarkably well-balanced mind and a simplicity of nature that appear invulnerable no amount of hero-worship seem to have the least effect upon he and from a very early time he be expose to a great deal of it he mind be incessantly engage on investigation of nature and this seem to have be with he as have be the case with other a preserving influence this simplicity of character he retain throughout he life at the same time he be sensible and shrewd in he money matter and attentive to he personal interest and he practical good sense in the general affair of life combine with he calm and steady consideration of point submit to he make he advice very valuable this be especially recognize by he own and he wife 's relation who consult he on many occasion and place the fullest confidence in he absolute sense of justice as well as in he wise counsel he be extremely liberal in proportion to he means and give away money to a large extent to all who have any claim upon he but he be not in any sense reckless and keep a most cautious eye on he expense he be not indifferent to the honor which he receive in the scientific world but he do not appear to have seek they in any way and he certainly do not trouble himself about they he courtesy be unfailing : no amount of trouble could shake it whether it be the secretary of the admiralty or a servant girl want she fortune tell : whether a begging-letter for money or miscellaneous invitation : all have they answer in the most clear and courteous language but he would not grant personal interview when he could avoid it : they take up too much of he time he head be so clear that he never seem to want for the clearest and most direct language in express he meaning and he letter be model of terseness in all he view and opinion he be strongly liberal at cambridge at a early date he be one of the 83 member of the senate who support the application to permit the grant of medical degree without require a expression of assent to the religious doctrine of the church of england and in 1868 he decline to sign a petition against the abolition of religious declaration require of person admit to fellowship or proceed to the degree of ma and he be oppose to every kind of narrowness and exclusiveness when he be appoint to the post of astronomer royal he stipulate that he should not be ask to vote in any political election but all he view be in the liberal direction he be a great reader of theology and church history and as regarded form of worship and the interpretation of the scripture he treat they with great respect but from the point of view of a freethinking layman in the preface to he note on the earlier hebrew scripture he say in regard to the general tone of these note i will first remark that i have nothing to say on the subject of verbal inspiration with those who entertain that doctrine i can have nothing in common nor do i recognize in the professedly historical account any other inspiration which can exempt they from the severest criticism that would be applicable to so-called profane account write under the same general circumstance and in the same country and he treatment of the subject in the note shew how entirely he take a rationalistic view of the whole question he also strongly side with bishop colenso in he fearless criticism of the pentateuch though he dissent from some of he conclusion but he be deeply imbue with the spirit of religion and reflect much upon it he whole correspondence convey the impression of the most sterling integrity and high-mindedness without a trace of affectation in no letter do there appear a shadow of waver on matter of principle whether in public or private matter and he be very clear and positive in he conviction the great secret of he long and successful official career be that he be a good servant and thoroughly understand he position he never set himself in opposition to he master the admiralty he never hesitate to ask the admiralty for what he think right whether in the way of money grant for various object or for occasional permission to give he service to scientific matter not immediately connect with the observatory sometimes the admiralty refuse he request and he feel this very keenly but he be far too busy and energetic to trouble himself about such little slight and cheerfully accept the situation what be refuse by one administration be frequently grant by another and in the meantime he be always ready to give he most zealous assistance in any matter that be officially bring before he this cheerful readiness to help combine with he great ability and punctuality in business matter make he a very valuable servant and speak generally he have the confidence of the admiralty in a remarkable degree in many of he report to the board of visitor he speak gratefully of the liberality of the admiralty in forwarding scientific progress and research in matter too which be perhaps of minor importance from the high stand-point of science but which be invaluable in the conduct of a important business office such for example as estimate and official correspondence he be orderly and punctual in the highest degree and what be by no means unimportant he possess a excellent official style in correspondence combine with great clearness of expression he entire honesty of purpose and the high respect in which he be hold both at home and abroad give great weight to he recommendation with regard to he habit while he reside at the observatory he custom be to work in he official room from 9 to about 230 though in summer he be frequently at work before breakfast he then take a brisk walk and dine at about 330 this early hour have be prescribe and insist upon by he physician dr haviland of cambridge in whom he have great confidence he eat heartily though simply and moderately and sleep for about a hour after dinner he then have tea and from about 7 to 10 he work in the same room with he family he would never retire to a private room and regard the society of he family as highly beneficial in take the edge off he work he power of abstraction be remarkable : nothing seem to disturb he neither music singing nor miscellaneous conversation he would then play a game or two at card read a few page of a classical or historical book and retire at 11 on sunday he attend morning service at church and in the evening read a few prayer very carefully and impressively to he whole household he be very hospitable and delighted to receive he friend in a simple and natural way at he house in this he be most admirably aid by he wife whose grace and skill make everything pleasant to they guest but he avoid dinner-party as much as possible -- they interfere too much with he work -- and with the exception of scientific and official dinner he seldom dine away from home he taste be entirely domestic and he be very happy in he family with he natural love of work and with the incessant call upon he he would soon have break down have it not be for he system of regular relaxation two or three time a year he take a holiday : generally a short run of a week or ten day in the spring a trip of a month or thereabout in the early autumn and about three week at playford in the winter these trip be always conduct in the most active manner either in constant motion from place to place or in daily active excursion this system he maintain with great regularity and from the exceed interest and enjoyment that he take in these trip he mind be so much refresh and steady that he always keep himself equal to he work airy seem to have have a strong bent in the direction of astronomy from he youth and it be curious to note how well furnished he be by the time that he become astronomer royal both with astronomy in all its branch and with the kindred science so necessary for the practical working and improvement of it at the time that he go to cambridge physical astronomy be greatly study there and form a most important part of the university course he eagerly avail himself of this and master the physical astronomy in the most thorough manner as be evidence by he papers collect in he mathematical tract he investigation of the long inequality of the earth and venus and many other work as plumian professor he have charge of the small observatory at cambridge where he do a great deal of the observe and reduction work himself and become thoroughly verse in the practical working of a observatory the result of this be immediately see in the improve method which he introduce at greenwich and which be speedily imitate at other observatory optics and the undulatory theory of light have be very favorite subject with he and he have write and lecture frequently upon they in the construction of the new and powerful telescope and other optical instrument require from time to time this knowledge be very essential for in its instrumental equipment the greenwich observatory be entirely remodel during he tenure of office and in many of the matter refer to he as for instance that of the lighthouse a thorough knowledge of optics be most valuable he have make a great study of the theory and construction of clock and this knowledge be invaluable to he at greenwich in the establishment of new and more accurate astronomical clock and especially in the improvement of chronometer he have carefully study the theory of pendulum and have learn how to use they in he experiment in the cornish mine this knowledge he afterwards utilize very effectively at the harton pit in compare the density of the earth 's crust with its mean density and it be very useful to he in connection with geodetic survey and experiment on which he be consult and he mechanical knowledge be useful in almost everything the subject -lrb- outside those require for he professional work -rrb- in which he take most interest be poetry history theology antiquity architecture and engineering he be well acquaint with standard english poetry and have commit large quantity to memory which he frequently refer to as a most valuable acquisition and a ever-present relief and comfort to he mind history and theology he have study as opportunity offer and without be widely read in they he be much at home with they and he powerful memory make the most of what he do read antiquity and architecture be very favorite subject with he he have visit most of the camp and castle in the unite kingdom and be never tire of trace they connection with ancient military event : and he write several papers on this subject especially those relate to the roman invasion of britain ecclesiastical architecture he be very fond of : he have visit nearly all the cathedral and principal church in england and many on the continent and be most enthusiastic on they different style and merit : he letter abound in critical remark on they he be extremely well verse in mechanic and in the principle and theory of construction and take the greatest interest in large engineering work this lead to much communication with stephenson brunel and other engineer who consult he freely on the subject of great work on which they be engage : in particular he render much assistance in connection with the construction of the britannium bridge over the menai strait there be various other subject which he read with much interest -lrb- geology in particular -rrb- but he make no study of natural history and know very little about it beyond detach fact he industry be untiring and in go over he book one by one it be very noticeable how large a number of they be feathered with he paper mark shew how carefully he have read they and refer to they he nature be essentially cheerful and literature of a witty and humourous character have a great charm for he he be very fond of music and know a great number of song and he be well acquaint with the theory of music : but he be no performer he do not sketch freehand but make excellent drawing with he camera lucida at the time when he take he degree -lrb- 1823 -rrb- and for many year afterwards there be very great activity of scientific investigation and astronomical enterprise in england and as in the time of flamsteed and halley the earnest zeal of man of science occasionally lead to much controversy and bitterness amongst they airy be by no means exempt from such controversy he be a man of keen sensitiveness though it be combine with great steadiness of temper and he never hesitate to attack theory and method that he consider to be scientifically wrong this lead to difference with ivory challi south cayley archibald smith and other but however much he might differ from they he be always personally courteous and the dispute generally go no farther than as regard the special matter in question almost all these controversial discussion be carry on openly and be publish in the athenaeum the philosophical magazine or elsewhere for he print nearly everything that he write and be very careful in the selection of the most suitable channel for publication he regard it as a duty to popularize as much as possible the work do at the observatory and to take the public into he confidence and this he effect by article communicate to newspaper lecture numerous papers write for scientific society report debate and critique he strong constitution and he regular habit both of work and exercise be sufficient explanation of the good health which in general he enjoy not but what he have sharp touch of illness from time to time at one period he suffer a good deal from a attack of eczema and at another from a varicose vein in he leg and he be occasionally trouble with severe cold but he bear these ailment with great patience and throw they off in course of time he be happy in he marriage and in he family and such trouble and distress as be inevitable he accept calmly and quietly in he death as in he life he be fortunate : he have no long or painful illness and he be spare the calamity of aberration of intellect the saddest of all visitation chapter ii from he birth to he take he ba degree at cambridge from July 27th 1801 to January 18th 1823 george biddell airy be bear at alnwick in northumberland on July 27th 1801 he father be william airy of luddington in lincolnshire the descendant of a long line of airy who have be trace back with a very high degree of probability to a family of that name which be settle at kentmere in westmorland in the 14th century a branch of this family migrate to pontefract in yorkshire where they seem to have prosper for many year but they be involve in the consequence of the civil war and one member of the family retire to ousefleet in yorkshire he grandson remove to luddington in lincolnshire where he descendant for several generation pursue the calling of small farmer george biddell airy 's mother ann airy be the daughter of george biddell a well-to-do farmer in suffolk william airy the father of george biddell airy be a man of great activity and strength and of prudent and steady character when a young man he become foreman on a farm in the neighborhood of luddington and lay by he earnings in summer in order to educate himself in winter for a person in he rank he education be unusually good in matter of science and in english literature but at the age of 24 he grow tired of country labor and obtain a post in the excise after serve in various collection he be appoint collector of the northumberland collection on the 15th August 1800 and during he service there he eldest son george biddell airy be bear the time over which he service as officer and supervisor extend be that in which smuggling rise to a very high pitch and in which the position of excise officer be sometimes dangerous he be remarkable for he activity and boldness in contest with smuggler and make many seizure ann airy the mother of george biddell airy be a woman of great natural ability both speculative and practical kind as a neighbor and as head of a family and be deeply love and respect the family consist of george biddell elizabeth william and arthur who die young william airy be appoint to hereford collection on 22nd October 1802 and remove thither shortly after he stay at hereford till he be appoint to essex collection on 28th February 1810 and during this time george biddell be educate at elementary school in write arithmetic and a little latin he record of himself that he be not a favorite with the schoolboy for he have very little animal vivacity and seldom join in active play with he schoolfellow but in the proceedings of the school he be successful and be a favorite with he master on the appointment of william airy to essex collection the family remove to colchester on April 5th 1810 here george biddell be first send to a large school in sir isaac 's walk then keep by mr byatt walker and be soon note for he correctness in orthography geography and arithmetic he evidently make rapid progress for on one occasion mr walker say openly in the schoolroom how remarkable it be that a boy 10 year old should be the first in the school at this school he stay till the end of 1813 and thoroughly learn arithmetic -lrb- from walkingame 's book -rrb- book-keeping by double entry -lrb- on which knowledge throughout he life he set a special value -rrb- the use of the slide rule -lrb- which knowledge also be specially useful to he in after life -rrb- mensuration and algebra -lrb- from bonnycastle 's book -rrb- he also study grammar in all its branch and geography and acquire some knowledge of english literature begin with that admirable book the speaker but it do not appear that latin and greek be attend to at this school he record that at this time he learn a infinity of snatch of song small romance & c which he powerful memory retain most accurately throughout he life he be no hand at active play : but be notorious for he skill in construct gun for shooting pea and arrow and other mechanical contrivance at home he relate that he pick up a wonderful quantity of learn from he father 's book he read and remember much poetry from such standard author as milton pope gay gray swift & c which be destine to prove in after life a invaluable relaxation for he mind but he also study deeply a excellent cyclopaedia call a dictionary of art and science in three volume folio and learn from it much about ship-building navigation fortification and many other subject during this period he valuable friendship with he uncle arthur biddell commence arthur biddell be a prosperous farmer and valuer at playford near ipswich he be a well-informed and able man of powerful and original mind extremely kind and good-natured and greatly respect throughout the county in the autobiography of george biddell airy he state as follow : i do not remember precisely when it be that i first visit my uncle arthur biddell i think it be in a winter : certainly as early as the winter of 1812 -- 13 here i find a friend whose society i could enjoy and i entirely appreciate and enjoy the practical mechanical and at the same time speculative and enquire talent of arthur biddell he have a library which for a person in middle life may be call excellent and he historical and antiquarian knowledge be not small after spend one winter holiday with he it easily come to pass that i spend the next summer holiday with he : and at the next winter holiday finding that there be no precise arrangement for my movement i secretly write he a letter beg he to come with a gig to fetch I home with he : he comply with my request give no hint to my father or mother of my letter : and from that time one-third of every year be regularly spend with he till i go to college how great be the influence of this on my character and education i can not tell it be with he that i become acquaint with the messr ransome w cubitt the civil engineer -lrb- afterwards sir w cubitt -rrb- bernard barton thoma clarkson -lrb- the slave-trade abolitionist -rrb- and other person whose acquaintance i have value highly it be also with he that i become acquaint with the work of the best modern poet scott byron campbell hogg and other : as also with the waverley novel and other work of merit in 1813 william airy lose he appointment of collector of excise and be in consequence very much straiten in he circumstance but there be no relaxation in the education of he child and at the beginning of 1814 george biddell be send to the endowed grammar school at colchester then keep by the rev e crosse and remain there till the summer of 1819 when he go to college the autobiography proceed as follow : i become here a respectable scholar in latin and greek to the extent of accurate translation and composition of prose latin : in regard to latin verse i be i think more defective than most scholar who take the same pain but i be not much ashamed of this for i entirely despise the system of instruction in verse composition my father on some occasion have to go to london and bring back for I a pair of 12-inch globe they be invaluable to I the first star which i learn from the celestial globe be alpha lyra alpha aquila alpha cygnus : and to this time i involuntarily regard these star as the birth-star of my astronomical knowledge have somewhere see a description of a gunter 's quadrant i perceive that i could construct one by means of the globe : my father procure for I a board of the proper shape with paper paste on it and on this i trace the line of the quadrant my command of geometry be tolerably complete and one way in which i frequently amuse myself be by make paper model -lrb- most carefully draw in outline -rrb- which be button together without any cement or sewing thus i make model not only of regular solid regularly irregular solid cone cut in all direction so as to shew the conic section and the like but also of six-gun battery intrenchment and fortress of various kind & c from various book i have learn the construction of the steam-engine : the older form from the dictionary of art and science newer form from modern book the newest form however -lrb- with the slide steam valve -rrb- i learn from a 6-horse engine at bawtrey 's brewery -lrb- in which mr keel the father of my schoolfellow have acquire a partnership -rrb- i frequently go to look at this engine and on one occasion have the extreme felicity of examine some of its part when it be open for repair in the mean time my education be advance at playford the first record i believe which i have of my attention to mechanic there be the plan of a threshing-machine which i draw but i be acquire valuable information of all kind from the encyclopedia londinensis a work which without be high in any respect be one of the most generally useful that i have see but i well remember one of the most important step that i ever make i have try experiment with the object-glass of a opera-glass and be greatly astonish at the appearance of the image of object see through the glass under different condition by these thing my thought be turn to accurate optics and i read with care rutherford 's lecture which my uncle possess the acquisition of a accurate knowledge of the effect of optical construction be one of the most charming attainment that i ever reach long before i go to college i understand the action of the lens of a telescope better than most optician i also read with great zeal nicholson 's dictionary of chemistry and occasionally make chemical experiment of a inexpensive kind : indeed i grow so fond of this subject that there be some thought of apprentice I to a chemist i also attend to survey and make a tolerable survey and map of my uncle 's farm at school i be go on successfully and distinguish myself particularly by my memory it be the custom for each boy once a week to repeat a number of line of latin or greek poetry the number depend very much on he own choice i determine on repeat 100 every week and i never once fall below that number and be sometimes much above it it be no distress to I and great enjoyment at michaelma 1816 i repeat 2394 line probably without miss a word i do not think that i be a favorite with mr crosse but he certainly have a high opinion of my power and express this to my father my father entertain the idea of send I to college which mr crosse recommend : but he hear from some college man that the expense would be _ # 200 _ a year and he lay aside all thought of it the farm of playford hall be in 1813 or 1814 hire by thoma clarkson the slave-trade abolitionist my uncle transact much business for he -lrb- as a neighbor and friend -rrb- in the management of the farm & c for a time and they become very intimate my uncle beg he to examine I in classical knowledge and he do so i think twice he also give some better information about the probable expense & c at college the result be a strong recommendation by my uncle or through my uncle that i should be send to cambridge and this be adopt by my father i think it likely that this be in 1816 in December 1816 dealtry 's fluxion be buy for I and i read it and understand it well i borrow hutton 's course of mathematics of old mr ransome who have come to reside at greenstead near colchester and read a good deal of it about ladyday 1817 i begin to read mathematics with mr roger -lrb- formerly i think a fellow of sidney college and a indifferent mathematician of the cambridge school -rrb- who have succeed a mr tweed as assistant to mr crosse in the school i go to he house twice a week on holiday afternoon i do not remember how long i receive lesson from he but i think to June 1818 this course be extremely valuable to I not on account of mr roger 's ability -lrb- for i understand many thing better than he do -rrb- but for its training I both in cambridge subject and in the cambridge accurate method of treat they i go through euclid -lrb- as far as usually read -rrb- wood 's algebra wood 's mechanic vince 's hydrostatic wood 's optics trigonometry -lrb- in a geometrical treatise and also in woodhouse 's algebraical form -rrb- fluxion to a good extent newton 's principium to the end of the 9th section this be a large quantity but i read it accurately and understand it perfectly and could write out any one of the proposition which i have read in the most exact form my connexion with mr roger be terminate by _ he _ give I notice that he could not undertake to receive I any longer : in fact i be too much for he i generally read these book in a garret in we house in george lane which be indefinitely appropriate to my brother and myself i find that i copy out vince 's conic section in February 1819 the first book that i copy be the small geometrical treatise on trigonometry in may 1817 : to this i be urge by old mr ransome upon my complain that i could not purchase the book : and it be no bad lesson of independence to I during the same period 1817-1819 he be occupy at school on translation into blank verse from the aeneid and iliad and read through the whole of sophocle very carefully the classical knowledge which he thus gain at school and subsequently at cambridge be sound and he take great pleasure in it : throughout he life he make a practice of keep one or other of the classical author at hand for occasional relaxation he terminate he schooling in June 1819 shortly afterwards he father leave colchester and go to reside at bury st edmund 's the autobiography proceed as follow : mr clarkson be at one time inclined to recommend I to go to st peter 's college -lrb- which have be much enrich by a bequest from a mr gisborne -rrb- but on give some account of I to he friend mr jame d hustler tutor of trinity college mr hustler urge upon he that i be exactly the proper sort of person to go to trinity college and thus it be settle -lrb- mainly by mr clarkson -rrb- that i should be enter at trinity college i think that i be send for purposely from colchester to playford and on march 6th 1819 i ride in company with mr clarkson from playford to sproughton near ipswich to be examine by the rev mr roger incumbent of sproughton a old ma of trinity college and be examine and my certificate duly send to mr hustler and i be enter on mr hustler 's side as sizar of trinity college in the summer of 1819 i spend some time at playford on July 27th 1819 -lrb- my birthday 18 year old -rrb- mr clarkson invite I to dinner to meet mr charle musgrave fellow of trinity college who be reside for a short time at grundisburgh take the church duty there for dr ramsden the rector it be arrange that i should go to grundisburgh the next day -lrb- i think -rrb- to be examine in mathematics by mr musgrave i go accordingly and mr musgrave set before I a paper of question in geometry algebra mechanic optics & c end with the first proposition of the principium i know nothing more about my answer at the time but i find long after that they excite so much admiration that they be transmit to cambridge -lrb- i forget whether to mr musgrave 's brother a fellow of trinity college and afterwards archbishop of york or to mr peacock afterwards dean of ely -rrb- and be long preserve the list of the classical subject for the first year in trinity college be transmit to I as usual by mr hustler they be -- the hippolytus of euripide the 3rd book of thucydide and the 2nd philippic of cicero these i read carefully and note before go up mr hustler 's family live in bury and i call on he and see he in October introduce by mr clarkson on the morning of October 18th 1819 i go on the top of the coach to cambridge know nobody there but mr hustler but have letter of introduction from mr charle musgrave to professor sedgwick mr thoma musgrave and mr george peacock all fellow of trinity college i be set down at the hoop see trinity college for the first time find mr hustler be conduct by he servant to the robe-maker 's where i be invest in the cap and blue gown and after some further waiting be install into lodgings in bridge street at 4 o'clock i go to the college hall and be introduce by mr hustler to several undergraduate generally clever man and in the evening i attend chapel in my surplice -lrb- it be st luke 's day -rrb- and witness that splendid service of which the occasional exhibition well befit the place as soon as possible i call on mr peacock mr musgrave and professor sedgwick by all i be receive with great kindness : my examination papers have be send to they and a considerable reputation precede I mr peacock at once desire that i would not consider mr c musgrave 's letter as a ordinary introduction but that i would refer to he on all occasion and i do so for several year and always receive from he the greatest assistance that he could give i think that i do not become acquaint with mr whewell till the next term when i meet he at a breakfast party at mr peacock 's mr peacock at once warn I to arrange for take regular exercise and prescribe a walk of two hour every day before dinner : a rule to which i attend regularly and to which i ascribe the continuance of good general health i shewed mr peacock a manuscript book which contain a number of original proposition which i have investigate these much increase my reputation -lrb- i really have sense enough to set no particular value on it -rrb- and i be soon know by sight to almost everybody in the university a ridiculous little circumstance aid in this the former rule of the university -lrb- strictly enforce -rrb- have be that all student should wear drab knee-breeches : and i at mr clarkson 's recommendation be so fit up the struggle between the old dress and the trowser customary in society be still go on but almost terminate and i be one of the very few freshman who retain the old habiliment this make I in some measure distinguishable : however at the end of my first three term i lay these aside the college lecture begin on oct 22 : mr evan at 9 on the hippolytus and mr peacock at 10 on euclid -lrb- these be the assistant tutor on mr hustler 's side -rrb- : and then i feel myself establish i write in a day or two to my uncle arthur biddell and i receive from he a letter of the utmost kindness he enter gravely on the consideration of my prospects my want & c : and offer at all time to furnish I with money which he think my father 's parsimonious habit might make he unwilling to do i never have occasion to avail myself of this offer : but it be make in a way which in no small degree strengthen the kindly feeling that have long exist between we i carefully attend the lecture take note as appear necessary in mathematics there be geometrical problem algebra trigonometry -lrb- which latter subject the lecture do not reach till the term of 1820 -rrb- mr peacock give I a copy of lacroix 's differential calculus as translate by himself and herschel and babbage and also a copy of they example at this time the use of differential calculus be just prevail over that of fluxion -lrb- which i have learn -rrb- i betook myself to it with great industry i also make myself master of the theory of rectangular coordinate and some of the differential process apply to they which only a few of the best of the university mathematician then wholly possess in classical subject i read the latin -lrb- seneca 's -rrb- and english hippolytus racine 's phdre -lrb- which my sister translate for I -rrb- and all other book to which i be refer aristotle longinus horace bentley dawe & c make verse translation of the greek hippolytus and be constantly on the watch to read what might be advantageous early in December mr hustler send for I to say that one of the company of fishmonger mr r sharp have give to mr john h smyth mp for norwich the presentation to a small exhibition of _ # 20 _ a year which mr smyth have place in mr hustler 's hand and which mr hustler immediately confer on I this be my first step towards pecuniary independence i retain this exhibition till i become a fellow of the college i stay at cambridge during part of the winter vacation and to avoid expense i quit my lodgings and go for a time into somebody 's room in the bishop 's hostel -lrb- it be customary for the tutor to place student in room when they right owner be absent -rrb- i take with I thucydide and all relate to it and read the book upon which the next term 's lecture be to be found very carefully the latter part of the vacation i spend at bury where i begin with the assistance of my sister to pick up a little french : as i perceive that it be absolutely necessary for enable I to read modern mathematics during a part of the time i employ myself in write out a paper on the geometrical interpretation of the algebraical expression sqrt -lrb- -1 -rrb- i think that the original suggestion of perpendicular line come from some book -lrb- i do not remember clearly -rrb- and i work it out in several instance pretty well especially in de moivre 's theorem i have speak of it in the precede term to mr peacock and he encourage I to work it out the date at the end be 1820 January 21 when some time afterwards i speak of it to mr hustler he disapprove of my employ my time on such speculation about the last day of January i return to cambridge take up my abode in my former lodgings i shewed my paper on sqrt -lrb- -1 -rrb- to mr peacock who be much pleased with it and shew it to mr whewell and other on February 1 i commence two excellent custom the first be that i always have upon my table a quire of large-sized scribbling-paper sew together : and upon this paper everything be enter : translation into latin and out of greek mathematical problem memorandum of every kind -lrb- the latter transfer when necessary to the subsequent page -rrb- and generally with the date of the day this be a most valuable custom the other be this : as i perceive that to write latin prose well would be useful to I i write a translation of english into latin every day however much press i might be with other business i endeavor to write at least three or four word but if possible i write a good many sentence i may fix upon this as the time when my daily habit be settle in the form in which they continue for several year i rise in time for the chapel service at 7 it be the college regulation that every student should attend chapel four morning and four evening -lrb- Sunday be one of each -rrb- in every week : and in this i never fail after chapel service i come to my lodgings and breakfast at 9 i go to college lecture which last to 11 most of my contemporary be intend for the church attend also divinity lecture : but i never do i then return put my lecture note in order write my piece of latin prose and then employ myself on the subject which i be read for the time : usually take mathematics at this hour at 2 or a little sooner i go out for a long walk usually 4 or 5 mile into the country : sometimes if i find companion i row on the cam -lrb- a practice acquire rather later -rrb- a little before 4 i return and at 4 go to college hall after dinner i lounge till evening chapel time 1\/2 past 5 and return about 6 i then have tea then i read quietly usually a classical subject till 11 and i never even in the time when i might seem most severely press sit up later from this time to the close of the annual examination -lrb- beginning of June -rrb- i remain at cambridge stop there through the easter vacation the subject of the mathematical lecture be ordinary algebra and trigonometry : but mr peacock always have some private problem of a higher class for I and see I i believe every day the subject of the classical lecture be the termination of hippolytus the book of thucydide and the oration of cicero in mathematics i read whewell 's mechanic then just publish -lrb- the first innovation make in the cambridge system of physical science for many year -rrb- : and i find in my scribbling-paper note integral central force finite difference steam-engine construction and power plan of bridge spherical trigonometry optical calculation relate to the achromatism of eye-piece and achromatic object-glass with lens separate mechanical problem transit of venus various problem in geometrical astronomy -lrb- i think it be at this time that mr peacock have give I a copy of woodhouse 's astronomy 1st edition -rrb- the rainbow plan for anemometer and for a wind-pumping machine clearing lunar & c with a great number of geometrical problem i remark that my idea on the differential calculus have not acquire on some important point the severe accuracy which they acquire in a few month in classic i read the persa of aeschylus greek and roman history very much -lrb- mitford hooke ferguson -rrb- and the book of thucydide introductory to that of the lecture subject -lrb- the 3rd -rrb- : and attend to chronology on the scribbling-paper be verse-translation from euripide careful prose-translation from thucydide map note on point of grammar & c i have also little m book with abundant note on all these subject : i usually make a little book when i pursue any subject in a regular way on may 1st mr dobree the head lecturer send for I to say that he appoint I head-lecturer 's sizar for the next year the stipend of this office be _ # 10 _ a sum upon which i set considerable value in my anxiety for pecuniary independence : but it be also gratify to I as shew the way in which i be regard by the college authority on Wednesday may 24th 1820 the examination begin i be anxious about the result of the examination but only in such a degree as to make my conduct perfectly steady and calm and to prevent I from attempt any extraordinary exertion when the class be publish the first class of the freshman 's year -lrb- alphabetically arrange as be the custom -rrb- stand thus : airy boileau childer drinkwater field iliff malkin myer romilly strutt tate win it be soon know however that i be first of the class it be generally expect -lrb- and certainly by I -rrb- that consider how great a preponderance the classic be understand in the known system of the college to have in determine the order of merit field would be first however the number of mark which field obtain be about 1700 and that which i obtain about 1900 no other competitor i believe be near we -- in a letter to airy from he college tutor mr j d hustler there be the following passage : it be a matter of extreme satisfaction to I that in the late examination you stand not only in the first class but first of the first i trust that you future exertion and success will be commensurate with this honorable beginning of the man whom i have name drinkwater -lrb- bethune -rrb- be afterwards legal member of the supreme court of indium field be afterwards rector of reepham romilly -lrb- afterwards lord romilly -rrb- become solicitor-general strutt -lrb- afterwards lord belper -rrb- become mp for derby and first commissioner of railway tate be afterwards master of richmond endowed school childer be the father of childer who be subsequently first lord of the admiralty i return to bury immediately while there some student -lrb- some of they man about to take they ba degree at the next January -rrb- apply to I to take they as pupil but i decline this year of my life enable I to understand how i stand among man i return to cambridge about July 11th as a general rule undergraduate be not allow to reside in the university during the long vacation i believe that before i leave after the examination i have make out that i should be permit to reside : or i write to mr hustler i apply to mr hustler to be lodge in room in college : and be put first into room in bishop 's hostel and subsequently into room in the great court the first affair that i have in college be one of disappointment by no means deserving the importance which it assume in my thought i have be enter a sizar but as the list of foundation sizar be full my dinner in hall be pay for some vacancy have arise : and as these be to be fill up in order of merit i expect one : and in my desire for pecuniary independence i wish for it very earnestly however as in theory all of the first class be equal and as there be some sizar in it senior in entrance to I they obtain place first : and i be not actually appoint till after the next scholarship examination -lrb- easter 1821 -rrb- however a special arrangement be make allow I -lrb- i forget whether other -rrb- to sit at the foundation-sizar ' table whenever any of the number be absent : and in consequence i receive practically nearly the full benefit mr peacock who be go out for the vacation allow I access to he book i have also -lrb- by the assistance of various fellow who all treat I with great kindness almost to a degree of respect -rrb- command of the university library and trinity library : and spend this long vacation like several other very happily indeed the only non-mathematical subject of the next examination be the gospel of st luke paley 's evidence and paley 's moral and political philosophy thus my time be leave more free to mathematics and to general classic than last year i now begin a custom which i maintain for some year generally i read mathematics in the morning and classic for lecture in the afternoon : but invariably i begin at 10 o'clock in the evening to read with the utmost severity some standard classic -lrb- unconnected with the lecture -rrb- and at 11 precisely i leave off and go to bed i continue my daily translation into latin prose as before on August 24th 1820 rosser a man of my own year engage I as private tutor pay at the usual rate -lrb- _ # 14 _ for a part of the vacation and _ # 14 _ for a term -rrb- : and immediately afterwards he friend bedingfield do the same this occupied two hour every day and i feel that i be now completely earn my own living i never receive a penny from my friend after this time i find on my scribbling-paper various word which shew that in read poisson i be struggle with french word there be also finite difference and they calculus figure of the earth -lrb- force to the center -rrb- various attraction -lrb- some evidently refer to maclaurin 's -rrb- integral conic section kepler 's problem analytical geometry d'alembert 's theorem spherical aberration rotation round three axis -lrb- apparently i have be read euler -rrb- float body evolute of ellipse newton 's treatment of the moon 's variation i attempt to extract something from vince 's astronomy on the physical explanation of precession : but in despair of understand it and have make out a explanation for myself by the motion round three axis i put together a little treatise -lrb- sept 10 1820 -rrb- which with some correction and addition be afterwards print in my mathematical tract on sept 14th i buy woodhouse 's physical astronomy and this be quite a epoch in my mathematical knowledge first i be compel by the process of change the independent variable to examine severely the logic of the differential calculus secondly i be now able to enter on the theory of perturbation which for several year have be the desire land to I at the fellowship election of oct 1st sydney walker -lrb- among other person -rrb- be elect fellow he then quit the room in which he have live -lrb- almost the worst in the college -rrb- and i immediately take they they suit I well and i live very happily in they till i be elect scholar they be small room above the middle staircase on the south side of neville 's court -lrb- mr peacock 's room be on the same staircase -rrb- i have access to the lead on the roof of the building from one of my window this be before the new court be build : my best window look upon the garden of the college butler i have bring to cambridge the telescope which i have make at colchester and about this time i have a stand make by a carpenter at cambridge : and i find repeat observation of jupiter and saturn make in this October term other mathematical subject on my scribbling-paper be : geometrical astronomy barometer -lrb- for elevation -rrb- maclaurin 's figure of the earth lagrange 's theorem integral differential equation of the second order particular solution in general mathematics i have much discussion with atkinson -lrb- who be senior wrangler January 1821 -rrb- and in physics with rosser who be a friend of sir richard phillip a vain objector to gravitation in classic i read aeschylus and herodotus on October 5th i receive notice from the head lecturer to declaim in english with win -lrb- this exercise consist in prepare a controversial essay learn it by heart and speak it in chapel after the Thursday evening 's service -rrb- on October 6th we agree on the subject be natural difference to be ascribe to moral or to physical cause i take the latter side i speak the declamation -lrb- recite it without miss a word -rrb- on October 25th on October 26th i receive notice of latin declamation with myer : subject agree on utrum civitatus plus utilitati a incommodus afferant lex quae ad vitas privatorum hominum ordinanda pertinent i take the former the declamation be recite on November 11 when a curious circumstance occur my declamation be rather long : it be the first Saturday of the term on which a declamation have be speak : and it be the day on which arrive the news of the withdrawal of the bill of pain and penalty against queen caroline -lrb- this trial have be go on through the summer but i know little about it -rrb- in consequence the impatience of the undergraduate be very great and there be such a uproar of cough & c in the chapel as probably be never know the master -lrb- dr wordsworth appoint in the beginning of the summer on the death of dr mansell and to whom i have be indirectly introduce by mr clarkson -rrb- and tutor and dean try in vain to stop the hubbub however i go on steadily to the end not at all frighten on the Monday the master send for I to make a sort of apology in the name of the authority and letter to the tutor be read at the lecture and on the whole the transaction be nowise disagreeable to I on the commemoration day December 15th i receive my prize -lrb- mitford 's greece -rrb- as first-class man after dinner in the college hall after a short vacation spend at bury and playford i return to cambridge walk from bury on jan 22nd 1821 during the next term i find in mathematics partial differential equation tide sound calculus of variation composition of rotary motion motion in resist medium lhuillier 's theorem brightness of a object as see through a medium with any possible law of refraction -lrb- a good investigation -rrb- star-reduction numerical calculation connect with they equilibrium of chain under centripetal force -lrb- geometrically treat as a improvement upon whewell 's algebraical method -rrb- investigation of the magnitude of attractive force of glass & c require to produce refraction i forget about mathematical lecture but i have a impression that i regularly attend mr peacock 's lecture and that he always set I some private problem i attend mr evan 's lecture on st luke : and i find many note about the history of the jew cerinthus and various heresy paley 's moral philosophy paley 's evidence and biblical map : also speculation about ancient pronunciation for a week or more before the annual examination i be perfectly lazy the class of my year -lrb- junior soph -rrb- be not publish till June 11 it be soon know that i be first with 2000 mark the next be drinkwater with 1200 mark after a short holiday at bury and playford i return to cambridge on July 18th 1821 my daily life go on as usual i find that in write latin i begin cicero de senectute -lrb- retranslate melmoth 's translation and compare -rrb- some time in the long vacation the name of the prizeman for declamation be publish : i be disappoint that not one english or latin be assign to I : but it be foolish for my declamation be rather trumpery my former pupil rosser come again on August 14th on August 29th dr blomfield -lrb- afterwards bishop of london -rrb- call to engage I as tutor to he brother george beecher blomfield and he commence attendance on sept 1st with these two pupil i finish at the end of the long vacation : for the next three term i have one pupil gibson a newcastle man recommend by mr peacock i believe as a personal friend -lrb- mr peacock be of durham -rrb- the only classical subject appoint for the next examination be the 5th 6th and 7th book of the odyssey : the mathematical subject all the apply mathematics and newton there be to be however the scholarship examination -lrb- sizar be allow to sit for scholarship only in they 3rd year : and the scholarship be a kind of little fellowship necessary to qualify for be a candidate for the real fellowship -rrb- when the October term begin mr hustler who usually give lecture in mathematics to he third-year pupil say to I that it be not worth my while to attend he lecture and he or mr peacock suggest that drinkwater myer and i should attend the questionist ' examination the questionist be those who be to take the degree of ba in the next January : and it be customary not to give they lecture but three time a week to examine they by set mathematical question as the best method of prepare for the ba examination accordingly it be arrange that we should attend the say examination : but when we go the questionist of that year refuse to attend they be report to be a weak year and we to be a strong one : and they be dispose to take offence at we on any occasion from some of the scholar of we year who sit at table with scholar of that year i hear that they distinguish we as ` the impudent year ' ` the annus mirabili ' & c on this occasion they pretend to believe that the plan of we attendance at the questionist ' examination have be suggest by a undergraduate and no explanation be of the least use so the tutor agree not to press the matter on they : and instead of it drinkwater myer and i go three time a week to mr peacock 's room and he set we question i think that this system be also continue during the next two term -lrb- end in June 1822 -rrb- or part of they but i be not certain in August 1821 i copy out a m on optics i think from mr whewell : on August 24th one on the figure of the earth and tide and at some other time one on the motion of a body round two center of force both from mr whewell on my scribble paper i find -- a problem on the vibration of a gig as depend on the horse 's step -lrb- like that of a pendulum whose support be disturbed -rrb- maclaurin 's attraction effect of separate the lens of a achromatic object-glass -lrb- suggest by my old telescope -rrb- barlow 's theory of number and division of the circle into 17 part partial differential theory of eye-pieces epicycloid figure of the earth time of body in arc of parabola problem of sound tide refraction of lens include thickness & c ivory 's

theory well work out ordinary differential equation calculus of variation interpolation like laplace 's for comet kepler 's theorem in September i have my old telescope mount on a short tripod stand and make experiment on its adjustment i be possess of white 's ephemeri and i find observation of jupiter and saturn in October i plan a engine for describe ellipsis by the polar equation a \/ -lrb- 1 + e cos theta -rrb- and try to make a micrometer with silk thread converge to a point mr cubitt call on oct 4 and nov 1 he be engage in erect a treadmill at cambridge gaol and have some thought of send plan for the cambridge observatory the erection of which be then propose on nov 19 i find that i have receive from cubitt a nautical almanac the first that i have on dec 11 i make some experiment with drinkwater : i think it be whirling a glass contain oil on water in classic i be chiefly engage upon thucydide and homer on October 6th i have a letter from charle musgrave introduce challi who succeed I in the cambridge observatory in 1836 at this time my poor afflict father be suffer much from a severe form of rheumatism or pain in the leg which sometimes prevent he from go to bed for week together on the commemoration day dec 18th i receive my prize as first-class man in hall again the next day i walk to bury and pass the winter vacation there and at playford i return to cambridge on jan 24th 1822 on feb 12th i keep my first act with great compliment from the moderator and with a most unusually large attendance of auditor these disputation on mathematics in latin be now discontinue on march 20th i keep a first opponency against sandy about this time i receive buckle a trinity man of my own year who be generally suppose to come next after drinkwater as pupil on my sheet i find integral and differential equation of every kind astronomical correction -lrb- of which i prepare a book -rrb- chance englefield 's comet investigation of the brightness within a rainbow proof of clairaut 's theorem in one case metacentre change of independent variable apply to a complicated case generate function principal axis on apr 8th i intend to write a account of my eye : i be then torment with a double image i suppose from some disease of the stomach : and on may 28th i find by a drawing of the appearance of a lamp that the disease of my eye continue on feb 11th i give mr peacock a paper on the alteration of the focal length of a telescope as direct with or against the earth 's orbital motion -lrb- on the theory of emission -rrb- which be write out for read to the cambridge philosophical society on feb 24th and 25th -lrb- this society i think be then about a year old -rrb- on feb 1 my m on precession solar inequality and nutation be make complete the important examination for scholarship be now approach as i have say this one opportunity only be give to sizar -lrb- pensioner have always two opportunity and sometimes three -rrb- and it be necessary to be a scholar in order to be competent to be a candidate for a fellowship on apr 10th i address my formal latin letter to the senior there be 13 vacancy and 37 candidate the election take place on apr 18th 1822 i be by much the first -lrb- which i hardly expect -rrb- and be compliment by the master and other write the formal letter of thanks as usual i be now entitle to claim better room and i take the room on the ground floor on the east side of the queen 's gate of the great court even now i think of my quiet residence in the little room above the staircase in neville 's court with great pleasure i take possession of my new room on may 27th the annual examination begin on may 30th the class be publish on June 5th when my name be separate from the rest by two line it be understand that the second man be drinkwater and that my number of mark be very nearly double of he have at this time be disappoint of a propose walk excursion into derbyshire with a college friend who fail I at the last moment i walk to bury and spend a short holiday there and at playford i return to cambridge on July 12th 1822 i be steadily busy during this long vacation but by no means oppressively so : indeed my time pass very happily the scholar ' table be the only one in college at which the regular possessor of the table be sure never to see a stranger and thus a sort of family intimacy grow up among the scholar moreover the scholar feel themselves to be a privileged class ` on the foundation ' and this feeling give they a sort of conceited happiness it be the duty of scholar by turn to read grace after the fellow ' dinner and supper and at this time -lrb- 1848 -rrb- i know it by heart they also read the lesson in chapel on week day : but as there be no daily chapel-service during the summer vacation i have not much of this in the intimacy of which i speak i become much acquaint with drinkwater buckle rothman and sutcliffe : and we form a knot at the table -lrb- first the undergraduate scholar ' table and afterwards the bachelor scholar ' table -rrb- for several year during this vacation i have for pupil buckle and gibson i write my daily latin as usual beginning with the retranslation of cicero 's epistle but i interrupt it from sept 27th to feb 8th i believe it be in this vacation or in the October term that i begin every evening to read thucydide very carefully as my note be marked 1822 and 1823 on August 27 i find that i be read ovid 's fastus in mathematics i find the equation x + y = a x ^ q + y ^ q = b caustic calculus of variation partial differential aberration of light motion of comet various optical construction compute with spherical aberration particular solution mechanic of solid body attraction of shell chance ivory 's attraction-theorem lunar theory -lrb- algebraical -rrb- degree across meridian theoretical refraction newton 's 3rd book investigation of the tide in a shallow equatoreal canal from which i find that there would be low-water under the moon metacentre rotation of a solid body round three axis attraction of spheroid of variable density finite difference and complete figure of the earth there be also a good deal of investigation of a mathematical nature not connect with college study as musical chord organ-pipes sketch for a computing machine -lrb- suggest by the publication relate to babbage 's -rrb- sketch of machine for solve equation in August there be a plan of a m on the differential calculus which it appear i write then : one on the figure of the earth write about August 15th one on tide sept 25th one on newton 's principium with algebraical addition nov 1st on sept 6th and 10th there be lunar distance observe with rothman 's sextant and completely work out for these i prepare a print skeleton form i believe my first on December 13th there be reference to book on geology -lrb- conybeare and phillip and parkinson -rrb- which i be begin to study on July 27th be the day on which i complete my 21st year i carefully do nothing another subject partly occupy my thought which though not -lrb- with reference to practical science -rrb- very wise yet give I some cambridge celebrity in July 1819 i have -lrb- as before mention -rrb- sketch a plan for construct reflect telescope with silvered glass and have shew it afterwards to mr peacock i now complete the theory of this construction by correct the aberration spherical as well as chromatic on July 13th 1822 i draw up a paper about it for mr peacock he approve it much and in some way communicate it to mr -lrb- afterwards sir john -rrb- herschel i be soon after introduce to herschel at a breakfast with mr peacock : and he approve of the scheme generally on August 5th i draw up a complete mathematical paper for the cambridge philosophical society which i entrust to mr peacock the aberration both spherical and chromatic be here work out very well on nov 25th it be read at the meeting of the philosophical society and be afterwards print in they transaction : this be my first print memoir before this time however i have arrange to try the scheme practically mr peacock have engage to bear the expense but i have no occasion to ask he partly -lrb- i think -rrb- through drinkwater i communicate with a optician name banck in the strand who construct the optical part i subsequently try my telescope but it would not do the fault as i have not and have not the smallest doubt depend in some way on the crystallization of the mercury silver it must have be about this time that i be introduce to mr -lrb- afterwards sir jame -rrb- south at a party at mr peacock 's room he advise I to write to tulley a well-known practical optician who make I some new reflector & c -lrb- so that i have two specimen one gregorian the other cassegrainian -rrb- however the thing fail practically and i be too busy ever after to try it again during the October term i have no pupil i keep my second act on nov 6 -lrb- opponent hamilton rusby field -rrb- and a opponency against jeffry on nov 7 i attend the questionist ' examination i seem to have live a very comfortable idle life the commemoration day be dec 18th when i receive a prize and the next day i walk to bury on jan 4th 1823 i return to cambridge and until the ba examination i read novel and play card more than at any other time in college on Thursday jan 9th 1823 the preliminary class for arrangement of detail of the ba examination be publish the first class airy drinkwater jeffry mason as far as i remember the rule be then that on certain day the class be group -lrb- in regard to identity of question give to each group -rrb- thus : 1st -lcb- 2nd\/3rd -rcb- -lcb- 4th\/5th -rcb- & c and on certain other day thus : -lcb- 1st\/2nd -rcb- -lcb- 3rd\/4th -rcb- & c on Saturday jan 11th i pay fee on Monday jan 13th the proceedings of examination begin by a breakfast in the combination room after this gibson give I breakfast every day and buckle give I and some other a glass of wine after dinner the hour be sharp the season a cold one and no fire be allow in the senate house where the examination be carry on -lrb- my place be in the east gallery -rrb- and altogether it be a severe time the course of examination be as follow : Monday jan 13th 8 to 9 print paper of question by mr hind -lrb- moderator -rrb- half-past 9 to 11 question give orally 1 to 3 ditto 6 to 9 paper of problem at mr higman 's room Tuesday jan 14th 8 to 9 higman 's paper half-past 9 to 11 question give orally 1 to 3 ditto 6 to 9 paper of problem in sidney college hall Wednesday jan 15th question give orally 8 to 9 and 1 to 3 with paper of question on paley and locke -lrb- one question only in each be answer -rrb- Thursday jan 16th we go in at 9 and 1 but there seem to have be little serious examination Friday jan 17 on this day the bracket or class as result from the examination be publish 1st bracket airy 2nd bracket jeffry 3rd bracket drinkwater fisher foley mason myer on Saturday jan 18th the degree be confer in the usual way it have be arrange that my brother and sister should come to see I take my degree of ba and i have ask gibson to conduct they to the senate house gallery : but mr hawke -lrb- a trinity fellow -rrb- find they and station they at the upper end of the senate house after the preliminary arrangement of papers at the vice-chancellor 's table i as senior wrangler be lead up first to receive the degree and rarely have the senate house ring with such applause as then fill it for many minute after i be bring in front of the vice-chancellor it be impossible to proceed with the ceremony on account of the uproar i give notice to the smith 's prize elector of my intention to ` sit ' for that prize and dine at rothman 's room with drinkwater buckle and other on Monday jan 20th i be examine by professor woodhouse for smith 's prize from 10 to 1 i think that the only competitor be jeffry on Tuesday i be examine by prof turton 10 to 1 and on Wednesday by prof lax 10 to 1 on Thursday jan 23rd i go to bury by coach on one of the coldest evening that i ever feel mr peacock have once recommend I to sit for the chancellor 's medal -lrb- classical prize -rrb- but he now seem to be cool in he advice and i lay aside all thought of it \* \* \* \* \* it seem not out of place to insert here a copy of some cambridge reminiscence write by airy which will serve to explain the act and opponency refer to in the previous narrative and other matter the act the examination for ba degree be precede in my time by keep two act in the school under the university library : the second of they in the October term immediately before the examination the first -lrb- i think -rrb- in the October term of the preceding year these act be relique of the disputation of the middle age which probably hold a very important place in the discipline of the university -lrb- there seem to be something like they in some of the continental university -rrb- the preside authority be one of the moderator i apprehend that the word moderator signify president in which sense it be still use in the kirk of scotland and that it be peculiarly apply to the presidency of the disputation the most important educational arrangement in the university the moderator send a summons to the respondent to submit three subject for argument and to prepare to defend they on a give day : he also name three opponent this and all the follow proceedings be conduct in latin for my act of 1822 nov 6 i submit the following subject : recte statuit newtonus in principii sui mathematici libro primo sectione undecim recte statuit woodius de iride recte statuit paleius de obligationibus the opponent name to attack these assertion be hamilton of st john 's rusby of st catharine 's field of trinity it be customary for the opponent to meet at tea at the room of the senior opponent in order to discuss and arrange they argument the respondent be also invite but he be warn that he must depart as soon as tea would be finish : then the three opponent proceed with they occupation as i have act in both capacity i be able to say that the matter be transact in a earnest and business-like way indeed in the time precede my own -lrb- i know not whether in my own time -rrb- the assistance of a private tutor be frequently engage and i remember hear a senior ma remark that my college tutor -lrb- jame d hustler -rrb- be the best crammer for a act in the university at the appoint time the party meet in the school : the respondent first read a latin thesis on any subject -lrb- i think i take some metaphysical subject -rrb- but nobody pay any attention to it : then the respondent read he first dogma and the first opponent produce a argument against it in latin after this there be repeat reply and rejoinder all in viv voce latin the moderator sometimes interpose a remark in latin when he consider that one argument be dispose of he call for another by the word probe aliter the argument be sometimes shape with considerable ingenuity and require a clear head in the respondent when all be finish the moderator make a complimentary remark to the respondent and one to the first opponent -lrb- i forget whether to the second and third -rrb- in my respondency of 1822 November 6 the compliment be quaestiones tua summo ingenio et acumine defendisti et in rebus mathematici scientiam plan mirabilem ostendistus in a opponency -lrb- i forget when -rrb- the compliment be magno ingenio argumenta tua et construxisti et defendisti the act of the high man excite much interest among the student at my act the room be crowd with undergraduate i imagine that at a time somewhat distant the maintenance of the act be the only regulation by which the university act on the study of the place when the act have be properly keep license be give to the father of the college to present the undergraduate to the vice-chancellor who then solemnly admit he ad respondendum quaestionus there be no appearance of collective examination before this presentation : what the quaestio might be i do not know still the undergraduate be not ba the quaestio however be finish and approve before the day of a certain congregation and then the undergraduate be declare to be actualiter in artibus baccalaureum probably these regulation be find to be insufficient for the control of education and the January examination be institute i conjecture this to have be at or shortly before the date of the earliest tripos record in the cambridge calendar 1748 the increase importance of the January examination naturally diminish the value of the act in the eye of the undergraduate and a few year after my ma degree it be find that the opponent meet not for the purpose of conceal they argument from the respondent but for the purpose of reveal they to he this lead to the entire suppression of the system the most active man in this suppression be mr whewell : its date must have be near to 1830 the shape in which the argument be deliver by a opponent reading from a write paper be si -lrb- quote something from the respondent 's challenge -rrb- & c & c cadit quaestio sed -lrb- cite something else bear on the subject of discussion -rrb- valet consequentium ergo -lrb- combine these to prove some inaccuracy in the respondent 's challenge -rrb- valent consequentium et argumentum nobody pretend to understand these mystical termination apparently the original idea be that several act should be keep by each undergraduate for to keep up the number -lrb- as it seem -rrb- each student have to gabble through a ridiculous form si quaestiones tuae falsae sint cadit quaestio : -- sed quaestione tuae falsae sunt ergo valent consequentium et argumentum i have forget time and place when this be utter the senate-house examination the questionist as the undergraduate prepare for ba be call in the October term be consider as a separate body collect at a separate table in hall attend no lecture but invite to attend a system of trial examination conduct by one of the tutor or assistant-tutor from the act from the annual college examination and -lrb- i suppose -rrb- from enquiry in the separate college the moderator acquire a general idea of the relative merit of the candidate for honor guide by this the candidate be divide into six class the moderator and assistant examiner be provide each with a set of question in manuscript -lrb- no print papers be use for honor in the senate house in regard to the -lrb- greek : hous pollous -rrb- i can not say -rrb- on the Monday on which the examination begin the father of the college receive all the questionist -lrb- i believe -rrb- at any rate all the candidate for honor at breakfast in the combination room at 8 o'clock and march they to the senate house my place with other honour-man be in the east gallery there one examiner take charge of the 1st and 2nd class unite another examiner take the 3rd and 4th class unite and a third take the 5th and 6th unite on Tuesday one examiner take the 1st class alone a second take the 2nd and 3rd class unite a third take the 4th and 5th class unite and a fourth take the 6th class alone on Wednesday Thursday and Friday the change be similar and in all the question be thus conduct the examiner read from he manuscript the first question those who could answer it proceed to write out they answer and as soon as one have finish he give the word do then the examiner read out he second question repeat it when necessary for the understanding by those who take it up more lately and so on i think that the same process be repeat in the afternoon but i do not remember precisely in this manner the examination be conduct through five day -lrb- Monday to Friday -rrb- with no interruption except on Friday afternoon it be principally perhaps entirely bookwork but on two _ evening _ there be print papers of problem : and the examination in these be conduct just as in the print papers of the present day : but in the private college room of the moderator and there wine and other refreshment be offer to the examinee how this singular custom begin i know not the order of merit be work out on Friday afternoon and evening and be in some measure know through the university late in the evening i remember mr peacock come to a party of examinee and give information on several place i do not remember he mention mine -lrb- though undoubtedly he do -rrb- but i distinctly remember he give the wooden spoon on the Saturday morning at 8 o'clock the manuscript list be nail to the door of the senate-house the form of further proceedings in the presentation for degree -lrb- ad respondendum quaestionus -rrb- i imagine have not be much alter the kneel before the vice-chancellor and place hand in the vice-chancellor 's hand be those of the old form of do homage the form of examination which i have describe be complicate and perhaps troublesome but i believe that it be very efficient possibly more so than the modern form -lrb- established i suppose at the same time as the abolition of the act -rrb- the proportion of question now answer to the whole number set be ridiculously small and no accurate idea of relative merit can be form from they the college hall when i go up in 1819 and for several year later the dinner be at 1\/4 past 3 there be no supplementary dinner for special demand boat-club i think be not invent even in a plain social way till about 1824 or 1825 and not in connection with the college till some year later some of the senior fellow speak of the time when dinner be at 2 and regret the change there be supper in hall at 9 o'clock : i have know it to be attend by a few undergraduate when tire by examination or by evening walk and there be always some senior at the upper table : i have occasionally join they and have have some very interesting conversation the supper be cold but hot addition be make when require one little arrangement amuse I as shew the ecclesiastical character of the college the fast of the church be to be strictly keep and there be to be no dinner in hall it be thus arrange the evening chapel service which be usually at 5-1\/2 -lrb- i think -rrb- be hold at 3 and at 4 the ordinary full meal be serve in hall but as it follow the chapel attendance it be hold to be supper and there be no subsequent meal there be no chair whatever in hall except the single chair of the vice-master at the head of the table on the dais and that of the senior dean at the table next the east wall all other sit on bench and i have hear allusion to a ludicrous difficulty which occur when some princess -lrb- of the royal family -rrb- dine in the hall and it be a great puzzle how to get they to the right side of the bench the sizar dine after all the rest they dinner usually begin soon after 4 for the non-foundationist a separate dinner be provide as for pensioner but for the foundationist the remains of the fellow ' dinner be bring down and i think that this provision be generally prefer to the other the dish at all the table of undergraduate be of pewter till a certain day when they be change for porcelain i can not remember whether this be at the time when they become questionist -lrb- in the October term -rrb- or at the time when they be declare actualiter esse in artibus baccalaureo -lrb- in the lend term -rrb- up to the questionist time the undergraduate scholar have no mixture whatever they be the only pure table in the hall : and i look on this as a matter very valuable for the ultimate state of the college society but in the October term those who be to proceed to ba be draft into the mixed body of questionist : and they greatly dislike the change they continue so till the lend term when they be formally invite by the bachelor scholar to join the upper table mathematical subject of study and examination in the October term 1819 the only book on pure mathematics be : -- euclid generally algebra by dr wood -lrb- formerly tutor but in 1819 master of st john 's college -rrb- vince 's fluxion and dealtry 's fluxion woodhouse 's and other trigonometry not a whisper pass through the university generally on the subject of differential calculus although some papers -lrb- subsequently much value -rrb- on that subject have be write by mr woodhouse fellow of caius college but they style be repulsive and they never take hold of the university whewell 's mechanic -lrb- 1819 -rrb- contain a few and easy application of the differential calculus the book on apply mathematics be wood 's mechanic whewell 's mechanic wood 's optics vince 's hydrostatic vince 's astronomy woodhouse 's plane astronomy -lrb- perhaps rather later -rrb- the first book of newton 's principium : i do not remember any other these work be undoubtedly able and for the great proportion of university student go into active life i do not conceal my opinion that book construct on the principle of those which i have cite be more useful than those exclusively found on the more modern system for those student who aim at the mastery of result more difficult and -lrb- in the intellectual sense -rrb- more important the older book be quite insufficient more aspiring student read and generally with much care several part of newton 's principium book i and also book iii -lrb- perhaps the noblest example of geometrical form of cosmical theory that the world have see -rrb- i remember some question from book iii propose in the senate-house examination 1823 in the October term 1819 i go up to the university the work of wood and vince which i have mention still occupy the lecture-room but a great change be in preparation for the university course of mathematics during the great continental war the intercourse between man of science in england and in france have be most insignificant but in the autumn of 1819 three member of the senate -lrb- john herschel george peacock and charle babbage -rrb- have enter into the mathematical society of pari and bring away some of the work on pure mathematics -lrb- especially those of lacroix -rrb- and on mechanic -lrb- principally poisson 's -rrb- in 1820 they make a translation of lacroix 's differential calculus and they prepare a volume of example of the differential and integral calculus these be extensively study : but the form of the college examination or the university examination be not i think influence by they in the winter 1820-1821 or the two follow term but in the winter 1821-1822 peacock be one of the moderator and in the senate-house examination January 1822 he boldly propose a paper of important question entirely in the differential calculus this be consider as establish the new system in the university in January 1823 i think the two system be mingle though i be myself subject to that examination i grieve to say that i have forget much of the detail except that i well remember that some of the question refer to newton book iii on the lunar theory to these i have already allude no other work occur to I as worthy of mention except woodhouse 's lunar theory entirely found on the differential calculus the style of this book be not attractive and it be very little read chapter iii at trinity college cambridge from he take he ba degree to he take charge of the cambridge observatory as plumian professor from January 18th 1823 to march 15th 1828 on jan 30th 1823 i return to cambridge i have already hear that i have gain the 1st smith 's prize and one of the first notification to I on my return be that the walker 's good-conduct prize of _ # 10 _ be award to I i remember that my return be not very pleasant for we table in hall be half occupy by a set of irregular man who have lose term and be oblige to reside somewhat longer in order to receive the ba degree but at the time of my complete the ba degree -lrb- which be not till some week after the examination and admission -rrb- i with the other complete bachelor be duly invite to the table of the ba scholar and that annoyance end the liberation from undergraduate study leave I at liberty generally to pursue my own course -lrb- except so far as it be influence by the preparation for fellowship examination -rrb- and also leave I at liberty to earn more money in the way usual with the graduate by take undergraduate pupil mr peacock recommend I to take only four which occupy I four hour every day and for each of they i receive 20 guinea each term my first pupil for the lend and easter term be williamson -lrb- afterwards head master of westminster school -rrb- jame parker -lrb- afterwards qc and vice-chancellor -rrb- bissett and clinton of caius to all these i have be engage before take my ba degree i keep up classical subject i have a set of note on the -lrb- greek : plouto -rrb- and -lrb- greek : nephelaus -rrb- of aristophane finish on mar 15th 1823 and i begin my daily writing of latin as usual on feb 8th in mathematics i work very hard at lunar and planetary theory i have two m book of lunar theory to the 5th order of small quantity which however answer no purpose except that of make I perfectly familiar with that subject i work well upon my quire the figure of saturn suppose homogeneous as affect by the attraction of he ring and the figure of the earth as heterogeneous and the calculus of variation i think it be now that i write a m on constrain motion on mar 17th 1823 i be elect fellow of the cambridge philosophical society on may 9th a cast of my head be take for dr elliotson a active phrenologist by deville a tradesman in the strand i have long think that i should like to visit scotland and on my once say so to my mother she -lrb- who have a most kindly recollection of alnwick -rrb- say in a few word that she think i could not do better i have therefore for some time past fully determine that as soon as i have sufficient spare time and money enough i would go to scotland the interval between the end of easter term and the usual beginning with pupil in the long vacation offer sufficient time and i have now earn a little money and i therefore determine to go and invite my sister to accompany I i have no private introduction except one from jame parker to mr reach a writer of inverness : some which drinkwater send be too late on may 20th we go by coach to stamford thence by pontefract and oulton to york where i see the cathedral which _ then _ disappointed I but i suppose that we be tire with the night journey then by newcastle to alnwick where we stop for the day to see my birthplace on may 24th to edinburgh on this journey i remember well the stone wall between the field the place -lrb- in yorkshire -rrb- where for the first time in my life i see rock the hambleton kyloe cheviot and pentland hill arthur 's seat but still more strikingly the revolving inch keith light at edinburgh i hire a horse and gig for we journey in scotland and we drive by queensferry to kinross -lrb- where for the first time in my life i see cloud on the hill viz on the lomond hill -rrb- and so to perth thence by dunkeld and killicrankie to blair athol -lrb- the dreariness of the drumochter pass make a strong impression on I -rrb- and by aviemore -lrb- where i see snow on the mountain -rrb- to inverness here we receive much kindness and attention from mr reach and after visit the fall of foyer and other sight we go to fort augustus and fort william we ascend ben nevi on which there be a great deal of snow and visit the vitrify fort in glen nevi then by inverary to tarbet and ascend ben lomond from whence we have a magnificent view we then pass by loch achray to glasgow where we find jame parker 's brother -lrb- he father of the house of macinroy and parker be a wealthy merchant of glasgow -rrb- on June 15th to mr parker 's house at blochairn near glasgow -lrb- on this day i hear dr chalmer preach -rrb- and on the 17th go with the family by steamer -lrb- the first that i have see -rrb- to fairly near larg i return the gig to edinburgh visit arran and bute and we then go by coach to carlisle and by penrith to keswick -lrb- by the old road : never shall i forget the beauty of the approach to keswick -rrb- after visit ambleside and kendal we return to cambridge by way of leed and post to bury on the 28th June the expense of this expedition be about _ # 81 _ it open a completely new world to I i have little time to rest at bury in the precede term drinkwater buckle and myself have engage to go somewhere into the country with pupil during the long vacation -lrb- as be customary with cambridge man -rrb- buckle however change he mind drinkwater go to look for a place fix on swansea and engage a house -lrb- call the cambrian hotel keep by a captain jenkin -rrb- on the morning of July 2nd i leave bury for london and by mail coach to bristol on the morning of July 3rd by steamer to swansea and arrive late at night i have then five pupil : parker harman lewi -lrb- afterwards professor in king 's college london -rrb- pierce morton gibson and guest of caius -lrb- afterwards master of the college -rrb- drinkwater have four viz two malkin -lrb- from bury -rrb- elphinstone -lrb- afterwards mp -rrb- and farish -lrb- son of professor farish -rrb- we live a hard-working strange life my pupil begin with I at six in the morning : i be myself read busily we live completely _ en famille _ with two men-servant besides the house establishment one of we first act be to order a four-oared boat to be build fit with a lug-sail : she be call the granta of swansea in the meantime we make sea excursion with boat borrow from ship in the port on July 23rd with a borrow boat we go out when the sea be high but soon find we boat unmanageable and at last get into a place where the sea be break heavily over a shoal and the two of the crew who be nearest to I -lrb- a malkin and lewi -rrb- one on each side be carry out : they be good swimmer and we recover they though with some trouble : the breaker have pass quite over my head : we gain the shore and the boat be take home by land when we own boat be finish we have some most picturesque adventure at the mumble aberavon caswell bay ilfracombe and tenby from all this i learn navigation pretty well the mixture of hard study and open-air exertion seem to affect the health of several of we -lrb- i be one -rrb- : we be cover with painful boil my latin-writing begin again on July 25th : i have note on demosthene lucretius and greek history in mathematics i find chance figure of the earth with variable density differential equation partial differential sketch for a instrument for shew refraction and optical instrument with effect of chromatic aberration in August there occur a absurd quarrel between the fellow of trinity and the undergraduate on the occasion of commence the building of king 's court when the undergraduate be not invite to wine and absent themselves from the hall there be vacant this year -lrb- 1823 -rrb- five fellowship in trinity college in general the ba 's of the first year be not allow to sit for fellowship : but this year it be think so probable that permission would be give that on sept 2nd mr higman then appoint as tutor to a third ` side ' of the college write to I to engage I as assistant mathematical tutor in the event of my be elect a fellow on oct 1st and i provisionally engage myself about the same time i have write to mr peacock who recommend I to sit and to mr whewell who after consultation with the master -lrb- dr wordsworth -rrb- discourage it as there be no absolute prohibition i leave swansea on sept 11th -lrb- before my engagement to my pupil be quite finish -rrb- and return to cambridge by gloucester oxford and london i give in my name at the buttery as candidate for fellowship but be inform in a day or two that i should not be allow to sit on sept 19th i walk to bury i walk back to cambridge on oct 17th 1823 during this October term i have four pupil : neate cankrein turner -lrb- afterwards 2nd wrangler and treasurer of guy 's hospital -rrb- and william hervey -lrb- son of the marquis of bristol -rrb- in the lend term i have four -lrb- neate cankrein turner clinton -rrb- in the easter term i have three -lrb- neate cankrein turner -rrb- my daily writing of latin commence on oct 27th in November i begin re-read sophocle with my usual care in mathematics i find investigation of motion in a resist medium form of saturn draft of a paper about a instrument for exhibit the fundamental law of refraction -lrb- read at the philosophical society by mr peacock on nov 10th 1823 -rrb- optics solid geometry figure of the earth with variable density and much about attraction i also in this term write a m on the calculus of variation and one on wood 's algebra 2nd and 4th part i have also note of the temperature of mine in cornwall something on the light of oil-gas and reminiscence of swansea in a view of oswick bay in November i attend professor sedgwick 's geological lecture at some time in this term i have a letter from mr south -lrb- to whom i suppose i have write -rrb- regard the difficulty of my telescope : he be intimately acquaint with tulley and i suppose that thus the matter have become more fully know to he he then enquire if i could visit he in the winter vacation i accordingly go from bury and be receive by he at he house in blackman street for a week or more with great kindness he introduce I to sir humphrey davy and many other london savan and shew I many london sight and the greenwich observatory i also have a little practice with he own instrument he be then on intimate term with mr herschel -lrb- afterwards sir john herschel -rrb- then live in london who come occasionally to observe double star this be the first time that i see practical astronomy it seem that i borrow he mountain barometer in the lend term i write to he regard the deduction of the parallax of mar from a comparison of the relative position of mar and 46 leoni as observe by he and by rumker at paramatta my working be on loose papers i see that i have work out perfectly the interpolation the effect of uncertainty of longitude & c but i do not see whether i have a final result in jan 1824 at playford i be work on the effect of separate the two lens of a object-glass and on the kind of eye-piece which would be necessary : also on spherical aberration and saturn 's figure on my quire at cambridge i be work on the effect of separate the object-glass lens with the view of correct the secondary spectrum : and on jan 31st i receive some number -lrb- index of refraction -rrb- from mr herschel and reference to fraunhofer 's number about this time it be contemplate to add to the royal observatory of greenwich two assistant of superior education whether this scheme be entertain by the admiralty the board of longitude or the royal society i do not know somehow -lrb- i think through mr peacock -rrb- a message from mr herschel be convey to I acquaint I of this and suggest that i should be a excellent person for the principal place to procure information i go to london on Saturday feb 7th sleeping at mr south 's to be present at one of sir humphrey davy 's Saturday evening soires -lrb- they be then hold every Saturday -rrb- and to enquire of sir h davy and dr young when i find that succession to the post of astronomer royal be not consider as distinctly a consequence of it i take it coolly and return the next night the whole proposal come to nothing at this time i be engage upon differential equation mountain barometer problem and determination of the height of the gogmagog and several other point investigation connect with laplace 's calculus spherical aberration in different plane geology -lrb- especially regard derbyshire which i propose to visit -rrb- and much of optics i write a draft of my paper on the figure of saturn and on mar 15th 1824 it be read at the philosophical society under the title of ` on the figure assume by a fluid homogeneous mass whose particle be act on by they mutual attraction and by small extraneous force ' and be print in they memoirs i also write a draft of my paper on achromatic eye-piece and on may 17th 1824 it be read at the philosophical society under the title of ` on the principle and construction of the achromatic eye-piece of telescope and on the achromatism of microscope ' include also the effect of separate the lens of the object-glass it be print in they memoirs amongst miscellaneous matter i find that on mar 22nd of this year i begin regularly make extract from the book of the book society a practice which i continue to march 1826 on mar 27th a very rainy day i walk to bury to attend the funeral of my uncle william biddell near diss and on mar 30th i walk back in rain and snow on feb 24th i dine with cubitt in cambridge on may 21st i give a certificate to roger -lrb- the assistant in crosse 's school and my instructor in mathematics -rrb- which my mother amplify much and which i believe procure he election as master of walsall school on June 23rd i go to bury the speech at bury school which i wish to attend take place next day at this point of he autobiography the writer continue now come one of the most important occurrence in my life the important event in question be he acquaintance with richarda smith the lady who afterwards become he wife the courtship be a long one and in the autobiography there be various passage relate to it all write in the most natural and unaffected manner but of somewhat too private a nature for publication it will therefore be convenient to digress from the straight path of the narrative in order to insert a short memoir of the lady who be destine to influence he life and happiness in a most important degree richarda smith be the eldest daughter of the rev richard smith who have be a fellow of trinity college cambridge but be at this time private chaplain to the duke of devonshire and hold the small living of edensor near chatsworth in derbyshire he have a family of two son and seven daughter whom he have bring up and educate very carefully several of he daughter be remarkable both for they beauty and accomplishment richarda smith be now in she 20th year and the writer of the autobiography record that at matlock we receive great attention from mr chenery : in speaking of mr smith i remember he say that mr smith have a daughter whom the duke of devonshire declare to be the most beautiful girl he ever see this be before he have make the acquaintance of the family airy be at this time on a walk tour in derbyshire with he brother william and they be receive at edensor by mr smith to whom he have letter of introduction he seem to have fall in love with miss smith at first sight and within two day of first see she he make she a offer of marriage neither he means nor he prospects at that time permit the least idea of a immediate marriage and mr smith would not hear of any engagement but he never have the least doubt as to the wisdom of the choice that he have make : he work steadily on win fame and position and recommend he suit from time to time to miss smith as opportunity offer and finally marry she nearly six year after he first proposal he constancy have its reward for he gain a most charming and affectionate wife as he record at the time of he marriage my wife be aged between 25 and 26 but she scarcely appear more than 18 or 20 she beauty and accomplishment she skill and fidelity in sketch and above all she exquisite singing of ballad make a great sensation in cambridge they married life last 45 year but the last six year be sadden by the partial paralysis and serious illness of lady airy the entire correspondence between they be most carefully preserved and be a record of a most happy union the letter be write during he numerous journey and excursion on business or pleasure and it be evident that he thought be with she from the moment of they parting every opportunity of write be seize with a energy and avidity that shew how much he heart be in the correspondence nothing be too trivial or too important to communicate to he wife whether relate to family or business matter the letter on both side be always full of affection and sympathy and be write in that spirit of confidence which arise from a deep sense of the value and necessity of mutual support in the trouble of life and with he active and vary employment and he numerous family there be no lack of trouble they be both of they simple-minded sensible and practical people and be very grateful for such comfort and advantage as they be able to command but for nothing in comparison with they deep respect and affection for one another both by natural ability and education she be well qualify to enter into the pursuit of she husband and in many case to assist he she always welcome she husband 's friend and by she skill and attractive courtesy keep they well together she be a admirable letter-writer and in the midst of she numerous domestic distraction always find time for the duty of correspondence in conversation she be very attractive not so much from the wit or brilliancy of she remark as from the brightness and interest with which she enter into the topic under discussion and from the unfailing grace and courtesy with which she attend to the view of other this be especially recognize by the foreign astronomer and man of science who from time to time stay as guest at the observatory and to whom she act as hostess although she be not a accomplished linguist yet she be well able to express herself in french and german and she natural good sense and kindliness place she guest at they ease and make they feel themselves -lrb- as indeed they be -rrb- welcome and at home she father the rev richard smith be a man of most cultivate mind and of the highest principle with a keen enjoyment of good society which the confidence and friendship of he patron the duke of devonshire amply secure to he both at chatsworth and in london he have a deep attachment to he alma mater of cambridge and though not himself a mathematician he have a great respect for the science of mathematics and for eminent mathematician during the long courtship already related mr smith conceive the highest respect for airy 's character as well as for he great repute and attainment and express he lively satisfaction at he daughter 's marriage thus on January 20th 1830 he write to he intended son-in-law as follow : i have little else to say to you than that i continue with heartfelt satisfaction to reflect on the important change about to take place in my dear daughter 's situation a father must not allow himself to dilate on such a subject : of course i feel confident that you will have no reason to repent the irrevocable step you have take but from the manner in which richarda have be bring up you will find such a helpmate in she as a man of sense and affection would wish to have and that she be well prepare to meet the duty and trial -lrb- for such must be meet with -rrb- of domestic life with a firm and cultivate mind and the warm feeling of a kind heart she habit be such as by no means to lead she to expensive wish nor will you i trust ever find it necessary to neglect those study and pursuit upon which you reputation and subsistence be chiefly found to seek for idle amusement for you companion i must indulge no further in speaking of she and have only at present to add that i commit in full confidence into you hand the guardianship of my daughter 's happiness and on April 5th 1830 shortly after they marriage he write to he daughter thus : if thinking of you could supply you place amongst we you would have be with we unceasingly for we have all of we make you the principal object of we thought and we talk since you leave we and i travel with you all you journey to you present delightful home we have all but one feeling of the purest pleasure in the prospect of the true domestic comfort to which we fully believe you to be now go and we rejoice that all you endearing quality will now be employ to promote the happiness of one whom we think so worthy of they as you dear husband who have leave we in the best opinion of he good heart as well as he enlighten and sound understand he late stay with we have endear he to we all never do man enter into the married state from more honorable motive or from a heart more truly seek the genuine happiness of that state than mr airy and he will i trust find he reward in you from all that a good wife can render to the best of husband and he happiness be reflect on yourself it would be difficult to find letter of more genuine feeling and satisfaction or more eloquently express than these the narrative of the autobiography will now be resume i have be disappointed two year before of a expedition to derbyshire i have wish still to make it and my brother wish to go : and we determine to make it this year -lrb- 1824 -rrb- we be prepare with walk dress and knapsack i have well consider every detail of we route and be well provide with letter of introduction include one to the rev r smith of edensor on June 29th we start by coach to newmarket and walk through the fen by ramsay to peterborough then by stamford and ketton quarry to leicester and derby here we be recognize by a mr calvert who have see I take my degree and he invite we to breakfast and employ himself in shew we several manufactory & c to which we have be deny access when present ourselves unsupported we then go to belper with a introduction from mr calvert to jedediah strutt : see the great cotton mill and in the evening walk to matlock up to this time the country of greatest interest be the region of the fen about ramsay -lrb- a most remarkable district -rrb- but now begin beauty of scenery on July 9th we walk by rowsley and haddon hall over the hill to edensor where we stay till the 12th with mr smith we next visit hathersage castleton and marple -lrb- where i wish to see the canal aqueduct -rrb- and go by coach to manchester and afterwards to liverpool here dr traill recommend we to see the pontycyssylte aqueduct and we go by chester and wrexham to rhuabon see the magnificent work and proceed to llangollen thence by chester and northwich -lrb- where we descend a salt-mine -rrb- to macclesfield then to the ecton mine -lrb- of which we see but little -rrb- through dovedale to ashbourn and by coach to derby on July 24th to birmingham where we find mr guest lodge in he house and be join by my pupil guest here we be fully employ in visit the manufacture and then go into the iron country where i descend a pit in the staffordshire main thence by coach to cambridge where i stop to prepare for the fellowship examination i have two pupil in this portion of the long vacation turner and dobb on August 2nd my writing of latin begin regularly as before my principal mathematics on the quire be optics on August 25th i make experiment on my left eye with good measure and on aug 26th order a cylindrical lens of peter a silversmith in the town which i believe be never make subsequently while at playford i order cylindrical lens of a artist name fuller living at ipswich and these be complete in November 1824 my letter to the examiner announce my intention of sit for fellowship -lrb- which like all other such document be preserve on my quire -rrb- be deliver on sept 21st the examination take place on sept 22nd and the two follow day on oct 1st 1824 at the usual hour of the morning i be elect fellow there be elect at the same time tb macaulay -lrb- afterwards lord macaulay -rrb- who be a year senior to I in college and i think field of my own year i draw up my letter of acknowledgment to the elector on oct 2nd at 9 in the morning i be admit fellow with the usual ceremony and at 10 i call on the elector with my letter of acknowledgment i immediately journey to derbyshire pay a visit at edensor and return by sheffield on oct 11th -lrb- it have be understand with mr higman that my engagement as assistant mathematical tutor stand -rrb- the master send for I to appoint I and to say what be expect as duty of the office he hold out to I the prospect of ultimately succeed to the tutorship and i tell he that i hope to be out of college before that time about this time the ` athenaeum ' a club of a scientific character be establish in london and i be nominate on it but i decline -lrb- oct 14th -rrb- in this year -lrb- 1824 -rrb- i commence account with a banker by place _ # 110 _ in the hand of messr mortlock and co on oct 16th i walk to bury and after a single day 's stay there return to cambridge on oct 23rd 18241 begin my lecture as mathematical assistant tutor i lecture the senior soph and junior soph on higman 's side the number of senior soph be 21 besides this i take part in the ` examination of the questionist ' a series of exercise for those who be to take the bachelor 's degree in the next January i examine in mechanic newton and optics i have also as private pupil turner dobb and cooper i now cease from the exercise which i have follow with such regularity for five year namely that of daily write latin in its stead i engage a french master -lrb- goussel -rrb- with whom i study french with reasonable assiduity for the three term to June 1825 among mathematical investigation i find : theory of the moon 's brightness motion of a body in a ellipse round two centre of force various differential equation numerical computation of sin pi from series numerical computation of sine of various arc to 18 decimal curvature of surface in various direction generate function problem of sound i begin in the winter a latin essay as compete for the middle bachelor ' prize but do not proceed with it i afterwards wish that i have follow it up : but my time be fully occupy on jan 28th 1825 i start for edensor where i pay a visit and return on feb 2nd on feb 4th i write to mr clarkson ask he advice about a profession or mode of life -lrb- the care of life be now begin to press I heavily and continue to do so for several year -rrb- he reply very kindly but he answer amount to nothing about the same time i have some conversation of the same kind with mr peacock which be equally fruitless on feb 4th i have investigation of the density of light near a caustic -lrb- on the theory of emission -rrb- on feb 5th i finish a paper about the defect in my eye which be communicate to the cambridge philosophical society on feb 21st mr peacock or mr whewell have some time previously apply to I to write a paper on trigonometry for the encyclopedia metropolitana and i have be collect some material -lrb- especially in regard to its history -rrb- at every visit to london where i read sometimes at the british museum : also in the cambridge library i begin this paper -lrb- roughly -rrb- on feb 8th and finish it on mar 3rd the history of which i speak by some odd management of the editor of the encyclopedia be never publish the m be now amongst the mss of the royal observatory greenwich other subject on my quire be : theory of musical concord many thing relate to trigonometry and trigonometrical table achromatic eye-pieces equation to the surface bound the ray that enter my left eye experiment on percussion also note on cumberland and wale -lrb- i have already propose to myself to take a party of pupil in the long vacation to keswick -rrb- and note on history and geology i have be in correspondence with dr malkin -lrb- master of bury school -rrb- who on feb 8th send a certificate for my brother william whom i enter at trinity on peacock 's side on mar 25th i change my room quit those on the ground-floor east side of queen mary 's gate for first-floor room in neville 's court south side the easternmost room in this term my lecture last from apr 18th to may 14th apparently i have only the senior soph 19 in number and the same four pupil -lrb- turner dobb cooper hovenden -rrb- as in the precede term the only scientific subject on which i find note be a paper on the form of the tooth of wheel communicate to the philosophical society on may 2nd some note about musical concord and some examination of a strange piece of iceland spar on apr 29th i be elect to the northern institution -lrb- of inverness -rrb- the first compliment that i receive from a extraneous body on may 14th i have a most careful examination of my money account to see whether i can make a expedition with my sister into wale my sister come to cambridge and on Monday may 23rd 1825 we start for wale equip in the lightest way for a walk expedition we go by birmingham to shrewsbury : then to the pontycyssylte aqueduct and by various place to balum and thence by llanrwst to conway here the suspension bridge be under construction : the mole be make and the pier but nothing else then on to bangor where nine chain of the suspension bridge be in place and so to holyhead then by carnarvon to bethgelert ascend snowdon by the way and in succession by festiniog dolgelly and aberystwyth to hereford -lrb- the first time that i have visit it since my father leave it -rrb- from thence we go by coach to london and i go on to cambridge on the 23rd of June i have arrange to take a party of pupil to keswick and to take my brother there mr clarkson have provide I with introduction to mr southey and mr wordsworth on Wednesday June 29th 1825 we start and go by leicester sheffield leed and kendal to keswick call at edensor on the way my pupil be cleasby marshman clinton wigram tottenham and m smith at keswick i pass three month very happily i see mr southey 's family frequently and mr wordsworth 's occasionally by continual excursion in the neighborhood and by a few excursion to place as distant as bowness calder bridge & c -lrb- always climb the intermediate mountain -rrb- i become well acquaint with almost the whole of that beautiful country except some of the s w dale a geological hammer and a mountain barometer be very interesting companion i have plenty of work with my pupil : i work a little lunar theory a little of laplace 's equation something of the figure of the earth and i write out very carefully my trigonometry for the encyclopedia metropolitana i read a little of machiavellus and various book which i borrow of mr southey on Friday sept 30th my brother and i leave for kendal and after a stay of a few day at edensor arrive at cambridge on oct 11th on oct 21st my lecture to the junior soph begin 39 name last to dec 13th those to the senior soph 16 name oct 29th to dec 10th i also examine questionist as last year i have note about a paper on the connection of impact and pressure read at the philosophical society on nov 14th but not print dipping-needle problem curve describe round three centre of force barometer observation theory of the figure of the earth with variable density and effect on the moon correction to the madras pendulum wedge with friction spot see in my eye density of ray near a caustic in this term i accomplish the preparation of a volume of mathematical tract on subject which either from they absolute deficiency in the university or from the unreadable form in which they have be present appear to be want the subject of my tract be lunar theory -lrb- begin oct 26th finish nov 1st -rrb- figure of the earth -lrb- 1st part finish nov 18th -rrb- precession and nutation -lrb- my old m put in order -rrb- and the calculus of variation i apply as be frequently do to the syndicate of the university press for assistance in publish the work and they agree to give I paper and printing for 500 copy this notice be receive from professor turton on nov 29th 1825 it be probably also in this year that i draw up a imperfect ` review ' of coddington 's optics a work which deserve severe censure : my review be never finish in the long vacation at keswick i have six pupil at _ # 42 _ each in the October term i have marshman and ogilby at _ # 105 _ for three term and dobb at _ # 75 _ for three term i have at mr peacock 's suggestion raise my rate from 60 to 100 guinea for three term : this prevent some from apply to I and induce some to withdraw who have be connect with I : but it do I no real hurt for engrossment by pupil be the worst of all thing that can happen to a man who hope to distinguish himself on dec 17th i go to bury and return to cambridge on jan 30th 1826 i have the attendance-bill of my lecture to senior soph -lrb- 16 -rrb- from feb 3rd to feb 23rd and to freshman -lrb- 40 -rrb- from feb 27th to mar 15 it would appear that i give but one college-lecture per day -lrb- my belief be that i always have two -rrb- the tutor 's stipend per term be _ # 50 _ on my quire i find investigation for the ellipticity of a heterogeneous spheroid when the density be express by sin _ qc _ \/ _ qc _ -lrb- the remarkable property of which i believe i discover entirely myself although they have be discover by other person -rrb- theoretical number for precession nutation & c some investigation use laplace 's y hard work on the figure of the earth to the 2nd order ` woodhouse 's remain apparatus ' note about lambton 's and kater 's error depolarization note of papers on depolarization in the phil trans magnetic investigation for lieut foster isochronous oscillation in a resist medium observation on a strange piece of iceland spar on mar 7th forward preface and title page for my mathematical tract some time in this term i begin to think of the possibility of observe the diminution of gravity in a deep mine and communicate with whewell who be dispose to join in experiment my first notion be simply to try the rate of a clock and the ecton mine be first thought of i make enquiry about the ecton mine through mr smith -lrb- of edensor -rrb- and visit the mine but in the meantime whewell have make enquiry in london and find -lrb- principally from dr pari -rrb- that the mine of dolcoath near camborne in cornwall would be a better place for the experiment dr pari write to I repeatedly and ultimately we resolve on try it there in my papers on mar 21st be various investigation about attraction in both mine on apr 3rd i go to london principally to arrange about dolcoath and during April and may i be engage in correspondence with sir h davy -lrb- president of the royal society -rrb- mr herschel and dr young -lrb- secretary of the board of longitude -rrb- about the loan of instrument and pendulum on apr 23rd i be practise pendulum-observation -lrb- by coincidence -rrb- and about this time repeatedly practice transit with a small instrument lend by mr sheepshank -lrb- with whom my acquaintance must have begin no long time before -rrb- which be erect under a tent in the fellow ' walk on my quire i find various scheme for graduate thermometer for pendulum experiment i find also note of examination of my brother william who have come to college last October and a great deal of correspondence with my mother and sister and mr case a lawyer about a troublesome business with mr cropley a old friend of g biddell to whom my father have lend _ # 500 _ and whose affair be in chancery my lecture in this term be to the junior soph from apr 10th to may 13th : they be six in number and not very regular on apr 28th i send to mawman the copy of my trigonometry for the encyclopedia metropolitana for which i receive _ # 42 _ i receive notice from the press syndicate that the price of my mathematical tract be fix at _ 6 6d _ : i sell the edition to deighton for _ # 70 _ and it be immediately publish about this time i have letter from mr herschel and sir h davy about a paper to be present to the royal society -- i suppose about the figure of the earth to the 2nd order of ellipticity which be read to the royal society on June 15th on Saturday may 13th 1826 i go to london on the way to dolcoath and receive four chronometer from the royal observatory greenwich i travel by devonport and falmouth to camborne where i arrive on may 20th and dine at the count-house dinner at the mine i be accompany by ibbotson who be engage as a pupil and intend for a engineer on may 24th whewell arrive and we take a pendulum and clock down and on the 30th commence the observation of coincidence in earnest this work with the change of the pendulum and sundry short expedition occupy nearly three week we have continue the computation of we observation at every possible interval it be to be understand that we have one detach pendulum swing in front of a clock pendulum above and another similarly mount below and that the clock be compare by chronometer compare above carry down and compare compare before leave and bring up and compare the upper and lower pendulum have be interchange it be find now that the reliance on the steadiness of the chronometer be too great and a new method be devise in which for each series the chronometer should make four journey and have four comparison above and two below this arrangement commence on the 19th June and continue till the 20th on the 26th we pack the lower instrument intend to compare the pendulum directly with the upper one and send they up the shaft : when a inexplicable occurrence stop all proceedings the basket contain all the important instrument be bring up to the surface -lrb- in my presence -rrb- on fire some of the instrument have fall out with they case burn whether a superstitious miner have intentionally fire it or whether the snuff of a candle have be throw into it be not know we labor be now render useless on the 28th i pack up what remain of instrument leave for truro and arrive at bury on July 1st during we stay in cornwall i have attend a ` ticket ' or sale of ore at camborne and we have make expedition to the nw coast to portreath and illogan to marazion and st michael 's mount and to penzance and the land 's end on July 3rd i see mr cropley in bury gaol and go to cambridge on the 4th i be admit be and on the 5th be admit major fellow i have engage with four pupil to go to orlans in this long vacation : my brother william be also to go one of my pupil dobb do not join : the other three be tinkler ogilby and ibbotson we leave london on July 9th and travel by brighton dieppe rouen and pari to orlans at paris i see bouvard pouillet laplace and arago i have introduction from mr peacock mr south mr herschel dr young and from professor sedgwick to a english resident mr underwood on the 19th i be establish in the house of m lagarde protestant minister here i receive my pupil on the 28th i commence italian with a italian master : perhaps i might have do more prudently in adhering to french for i make no great progress on aug 2nd i see a murderer guillotine in the place martrous the principal investigation on my quire be -- investigation about pendulum calculus of variation note for the figure of the earth -lrb- encyc metrop -rrb- and commencement of the article steam-engine machinery & c i pick up various french ballad read various book get copy of the marseillaise -lrb- this i be oblige to obtain rather secretly as the legitimist power under charle x be then at its height -rrb- and other music and particulars of farm wages for whewell and r jone the summer be intensely hot and i believe that the heat and the work in dolcoath have weaken I a good deal the family be the old clergyman he wife he daughter and finally he son we live together very amicably my brother lodge in a caf in the place martrous the other in different family i leave orlans on sept 30th for pari here i attend the institut and be present at one of ampre 's lecture i arrive at cambridge on oct 14th on oct 16th whewell mention to I that the lucasian professorship would be immediately vacate by turton and encourage I to compete for it shortly afterwards mr higman mention the professorship and joshua king -lrb- of queen ' -rrb- speak on the restriction which prevent college tutor or assistant tutor from hold the office about this time mr peacock render I a very important service as the emolument of the lucasian professorship be only _ # 99 _ and that of the assistant tutorship _ # 150 _ i have determine to withdraw from the candidature but mr peacock represent to I the advantage of position which would be gain by obtain the professorship -lrb- which i then instantly see -rrb- and i continue to be a candidate i write letter to the head of college -lrb- the elector -rrb- and canvass they personally only dr davy the master of caius college at once promise I he vote dr french master of jesus college be a candidate and several of the head have promise he they vote mr babbage the third candidate threaten legal proceedings and dr french withdraw the course be now open for mr babbage and I in the meeting of the philosophical society a new mode of proceeding be introduce this term to enliven the meeting private member be request to give oral lecture mine be the second i think and i take for subject the machinery of the steam engine in the cornish mine and especially of the pump engine and pump it make a excellent lecture : the subject be at that time undescribed in book and unknown to engineer in general out of cornwall my college lecture seem to have be oct 21st to dec 14th to 31 junior soph dec 4th to 12th to 12 senior soph i assist at the examination of the questionist i have no private pupil on nov 26th i communicate to the cambridge philosophical society a paper on the theory of pendulum balance and escapement : and i find application of babbage 's symbolism to a escapement which i propose i have various investigation about the earth suppose to project at middle latitudes above the elliptical form in November a account of the dolcoath failure -lrb- by whewell -rrb- be give to the royal society at length on dec 7th 1826 the election to the lucasian professorship take place : i be elect -lrb- i think unanimously -rrb- and admit i believe that this give great satisfaction to the university in general my uncle arthur biddell be in cambridge on that evening and be the first of my friend who hear of it on the same page of my quire on which this be mention there be a great list of apparatus to be construct for lucasian lecture note of experiment with atwood 's machine & c in December correspondence with dollond about prism i immediately issue a print notice that i would give professorial lecture in the next term on dec 13th i have a letter from mr smith inform I of the dangerous illness -lrb- fever -rrb- which have attack nearly every member of he family richarda worst of all on dec 23rd i go to bury the affair with cropley have be settle by the sale of he property under execution and my father do not lose much of he debt but he have decline much in body and mind and now have strange hallucination the commencement of 1827 find I in a better position -lrb- not in money but in prospects -rrb- than i have before stand in : yet it be far from satisfactory i have resign my assistant tutorship of _ # 150 _ per annum together with the prospect of succeed to a tutorship and gain only the lucasian professorship of _ # 99 _ per annum i have a great aversion to enter the church : and my lay fellowship would expire in 7 year my prospects in the law or other profession might have be good if i could have wait : but then i must have be in a state of starvation probably for many year and marriage would have be out of the question : i much prefer a moderate income in no long time and i be sure that in this i judge rightly for my happiness i have now in some measure take science as my line -lrb- though not irrevocably -rrb- and i think it best to work it well for a time at least and wait for accident the acceptance of the lucasian professorship prevent I from be press by sedgwick -lrb- who be proctor this year -rrb- to take the office of moderator : which be a great relief to I as lucasian professor i be ipso facto member of the board of longitude a stipend of _ # 100 _ a year be attach to this on condition of attend four meeting : but i have good reason -lrb- from intimation by south and other person in london -rrb- for believe that this would not last long the fortnightly notice of the meeting of the board be give on jan 18th mar 22nd may 24th and oct 18th on jan 2nd 1827 i come from london to bury i find my father in a very decline state -lrb- the painful rheumatism of some year have change to ulceration of the leg and he be otherwise helpless and have distressing hallucination -rrb- on jan 8th i walk to cambridge at both place i be occupy in preparation for the smith 's prize examination and for lecture -lrb- for the latter i obtain at bury gaol some numerical result about tread-mill -rrb- of the smith 's prize i be officially a examiner : and i determine to begin with -- what have never be do before -- make the examination public by print the papers of question the prize be the highest mathematical honor in the university : the competitor be incept bachelor of art after the examination for that degree my day of examination -lrb- apparently -rrb- be jan 21st the candidate be turner cankrein cleasby and mr gordon the first three have be my private pupil : mr gordon be a fellow-commoner of st peter 's college and have just pass the ba examination as senior wrangler turner be second my situation as examiner be rather a delicate one and the more so as when i come to examine the papers of answer turner appear distinctly the first late at night i carry the papers to whewell 's room and he on inspection agree with I the other examiner -lrb- professor lax and woodhouse lowndean and plumian professor -rrb- generally support I : and turner have the honor of first smith 's prize on jan 30th my mother write ask if i could see cropley in london where he be imprison for contempt of chancery i attend the meeting of the board of longitude on feb 1st and afterwards visit cropley in the fleet prison he die there some time later it be by the sale of he effect under execution that my father 's debt be pay on feb 15th i communicate to the royal society a paper on the correction of the solar table from south 's observation i believe that i have allude to this at the February meeting of the board of longitude and that in consequence mr pond the astronomer royal have be request to prepare the error of the sun 's place from the greenwich observation : which be supply some month later with the exception of south 's solar error and some investigation about dipping-needle i do not find anything go on but matter connect with my approach lecture there be bridge truss and other mechanical matter theoretical and practical without end several tradesman in cambridge and london be well employ on feb 13th i have a letter from cubitt about groin : i remember study those of the custom-house and other place on feb 20th my syllabus of lecture be finish : this in subsequent year be greatly improve i apply to the royal society for the loan of huyghen 's object-glass but they decline to lend it about this time i find observation of the spectrum of sirius there have be no lecture on experimental philosophy -lrb- mechanic hydrostatic optics -rrb- for many year the university in general i believe look with great satisfaction to my vigorous beginning : still there be considerable difficulty about it there be no understand term for the lecture : no understand hour of the day : no understand lecture room i begin this year in the lend term but in all subsequent year i take the easter term mainly for the chance of sunlight for the optical experiment which i soon make important i could get no room but a private or retire room -lrb- not a regular lecture room -rrb- in the building at the old botanic garden : in follow year i have the room under the university library the lecture commence on some day in February 1827 : i think that the number who attend they be about 64 i remember very well that the matter which i have prepare as a introductory lecture do not last above half the time that i have expect but i manage very well to fill up the hour on another occasion i be so ill-prepared that i have contemplate give notice that i be unable to complete the hour 's lecture but i saw in the front row some stranger introduce by some of my regular attendant very busy in take note and as it be evident that a break-down now would not do i silently exert myself to think of something and make a very good lecture on mar 1st as official examiner i receive notice from 14 candidate for bell 's scholarship and prepared my paper of question i do not remember my day of examination but i have all the answer to all the examiner ' question in my hand when on mar 27th i receive notice that my father have die the precede evening this stop my lecture : they be conclude in the next term i think that i have only mechanic and imperfect optics this term no hydrostatic and that the resume lecture be principally optical they terminate about may 14th with my brother i at once go to bury to attend my father 's funeral he be bury on mar 31st 1827 in the churchyard of little whelnetham on the north side of the church shortly afterwards i go to london and on apr 5th i attend a meeting of the board of longitude at which herschel produce a paper regard improvement of the nautical almanac herschel and i be in fact the leader of the reform party in the board of longitude : dr young the secretary resist change as much as possible after the meeting i go to cambridge i find then calculation of achromatic eye-piece for a very nice model with silk thread of various color which i make with my own hand for my optical lecture on apr 7th herschel write to I that the professorship hold by dr brinkley -lrb- then appoint bishop of cloyne -rrb- at dublin would be vacant and recommend it to my notice and send I some introduction i reach dublin on apr 15th where i be receive with great kindness by dr brinkley and dr macdonnell -lrb- afterwards provost -rrb- i there meet the then provost dr bartholomew lloyd dr lardner mr hamilton -lrb- afterwards sir w r hamilton -rrb- and other in a few day i find that they greatly desire to appoint hamilton if possible -lrb- they do in fact overcome some difficulty and appoint he in a few month -rrb- and that they would not make such a augmentation as would induce I to offer myself as a candidate and i withdraw i have always remember with gratitude dr macdonnell 's conduct in carefully put I on a fair footing in this matter i return by holyhead and arrive at birmingham on apr 23rd while wait there and look over some papers relate to the spherical aberration of eye-piece in which i have be stop some time by a geometrical difficulty i do in the coffee-room of a hotel overcome the difficulty and this be the foundation of a capital paper on the spherical aberration of eye-piece this paper be afterwards present to the cambridge philosophical society about this time a circumstance occur of a disagreeable nature which however do not much disconcert I mr ivory who have a good many year before make himself favourably know as a mathematician especially by he acquaintance with laplace 's peculiar analysis have adopt -lrb- as not unfrequently happen -rrb- some singular hydrostatical theory in my last paper on the figure of the earth i have say that i could not receive one of he equation in the philosophical magazine of may he attack I for this with great heat on may 8th i write a answer and i think it soon become know that i be not to be attack with impunity long before this time there have be some proposal about a excursion to the lake district with my sister and i now arrange to carry it out on may 23rd i go to bury and on to playford : while there i sketch the cumberland excursion on June 5th i go to london i believe to the visitation of the greenwich observatory to which i be invite i also attend the meeting of the board of longitude i think it be here that pond 's error of the sun 's place in the nautical almanac from greenwich observation be produce on June 7th i go by coach to rugby where i meet my sister and we travel to edensor we make a number of excursion in derbyshire and then pass on by penrith to keswick where we arrive on June 22nd from keswick we make many excursion in the lake district visit mr southey and mr wordsworth descend a coal mine at whitehaven and return to edensor by the way of ambleside kendal and manchester with sundry excursion in derbyshire we trip end and we return to cambridge on the 21st July during this long vacation i have one private pupil crawford the only pupil this year and the last that i ever have at this time there be on my papers a infinity of optical investigation : also a plan of a eye-piece with a concave lens to destroy certain aberration on aug 20th i go to woodford to see messr gilbert 's optical work from aug 13th i have be prepare for the discussion of the greenwich solar error and i have a man at work in my room engage on the calculation of the error i write to bouvard at paris for observation of the sun but he recommend I to wait for the table which bessel be prepare i be busy too about my lecture : on sept 29th i have a set of plan of printing press from hansard the printer -lrb- who in a visit to cambridge have find I make enquiry about they -rrb- and i correspond with messr gilbert about optical construction and with w and s jone easton and other about pump hydraulic rams & c on sept 25th occur a very magnificent aurora boreali i do not find when the investigation of correction of solar element be finish or when my extract from burckhardt connaissance des temps 1816 be make but these lead I to suspect a unknown inequality in the sun 's motion on sept 27th and 28th i find the first suspicion of a inequality depend on 8  mean longitude of venus -- 13  mean longitude of earth the thing appear so promising that i commence the investigation of the perturbation related to this term and continue it -lrb- a very laborious work -rrb- as fast as i be able though with various interruption which in fact be necessary to keep up my spirit on oct 30th i go to london for the board of longitude meeting here i exhibit the result of my sun investigation and urge the correction of the element use in the nautical almanac dr young object and propose that bouvard should be consult professor woodhouse the plumian professor be present and behave so captiously that some member meet afterwards to consider how order could be maintain i believe it be during this visit to london that i take measure of hammersmith suspension bridge for a intended lecture-model frequently but not always when in london i reside at the house of mr sheepshank and he sister miss sheepshank 30 woburn place my quire at this time abound with suggestion for lecture and examination on some day about the end of November or beginning of December 1827 when i be walk with mr peacock near the outside gate of the trinity walk on some mention of woodhouse the plumian professor mr peacock say that he be never likely to rise into activity again -lrb- or use some expression import mortal illness -rrb- instantly there have pass through my mind the certainty of my succeed he the good position in which i stand towards the university the probability of that position be improve by improve lecture & c & c and by increase reputation from the matter in which i be now engage the power of thus command a increase of income i should then have independent of my fellowship some competent income and a house over my head i be quite aware that some time might elapse but now for the first time i see my way clearly the care of the observatory have be for two or three year attach to the plumian professorship a grace be immediately prepared entrust the temporary care of the observatory to dr french to I mr catton mr sheepshank and mr king -lrb- afterwards master of queen ' college -rrb- on dec 6th i have a note from mr king about go to the observatory on dec 6th my paper on correction of the element of the solar table be present to the royal society on dec 9th at 1 h 4 m be -lrb- Sunday morning -rrb- i arrive at the result of my calculation of the new inequality i have go through some fluctuation of feeling usually the important part of a inequality of this kind depend entirely on the eccentricity of the orbit but it so happen that from the position of the axis of the orbit & c these term very nearly destroy each other after this come the consideration of inclination of orbit and here be sensible term which be not destroy finally i arrive at the result that the inequality would be about 3 just such a magnitude as be require i slip this into whewell 's door this be to the time of write -lrb- 1853 -rrb- the last improvement of any importance in the solar theory some little remain work go on to dec 14th and then be thoroughly tired i lay by the work for revision at some future time i however add a postscript to my royal society paper on solar error notify this result on dec 19th i go to bury while there i hear from whewell that woodhouse be dead i return to cambridge and immediately make know that i be a candidate for the now vacant plumian professorship of miscellaneous scientific business i find that on oct 13th professor barlow of woolwich prepare a memorial to the board of longitude concern he fluid telescope -lrb- which i have see at woodford -rrb- which be consider on nov 1st and i have some correspondence with he in December in June and August my trigonometry be print on jan 5th 1828 i come from london it seem that i have be speculate truly ` without book ' on perturbation of planetary element for on jan 17th and 18th i write a paper on a suppose error of laplace and just at the end i discover that he be quite right : i fold up the paper and mark it ' a lesson ' i set two papers of question for smith 's prize -lrb- there be a deficiency of one examiner viz the plumian professor -rrb- before the beginning of 1828 whewell and i have determine on repeat the dolcoath experiment on jan 8th i have a letter from davy gilbert -lrb- then president of the royal society -rrb- congratulating I upon the solar theory and allude to we intended summer 's visit to cornwall we have somehow apply to the board of longitude for pendulum but dr young wish to delay they have with capt basil hall concoct a scheme for make lieut foster do all the work : whewell and i be indignant at this and no more be say about it on jan 24th dr young in give notice of the board of longitude meeting inform I that the clock and pendulum be ready i have make know that i be a candidate for the plumian professorship and nobody think it worth while to oppose I one person at least -lrb- earnshaw -rrb- have intend to compete but he call on I to make certain that i be a candidate and immediately withdraw i go on in quality of syndic for the care of the observatory ingraft myself into it but meantime i tell everybody that the salary -lrb- about _ # 300 _ -rrb- be not sufficient for I and on jan 20th i draft a manifesto or application to the university for a increase of salary the day of election to the professorship be feb 6th as i be officially -lrb- as lucasian professor -rrb- a elector i be present and i explain to the elector that i could not undertake the responsibility of the observatory without augmentation of income and that i request they express sanction to my application to the university for that purpose they agree to this generally and i be elect i go to london immediately to attend a meeting of the board of longitude and return on feb 8th on feb 15th i begin my lecture -lrb- which this year include mechanic optics pneumatic and hydrostatic -rrb- in the room below the university library the number of name be 26 the lecture terminate on mar 22nd on feb 25th i receive from mr pond information on the emolument at greenwich observatory i draw up a second manifesto and on feb 26th i write and sign a formal copy for the plumian elector on feb 27th i meet they at caius lodge -lrb- the master dr davy be vice-chancellor -rrb- i read my paper which be approve and they sanction be give in the form of a request to the vice-chancellor to permit the paper to be print and circulate my paper with this request at the head be immediately print and a copy be send to every resident ma -lrb- more than 200 go out in one day -rrb- the statement and composition of the paper be generally approve but the university have never before be take by storm in such a manner and there be some commotion about it i believe that very few person would have take the same step mr sheepshank write to I on mar 7th intimate that it be desperate i have no doubt of success whewell tell I that some people accuse I of bad faith in omit allusion to the _ # 100 _ a year receive as member of the board of longitude and to the profit of lecture i write he a note tell he that i have most certain information of the intention to dissolve the board of longitude -lrb- which be do in less than six month -rrb- and that by two year ' lecture i have gain _ # 45 _ -lrb- the expense be _ # 200 _ receipt _ # 245 _ -rrb- this letter be send to the complain people and no more be say by the activity of sheepshank and the kindness of dr davy the business gradually grow into shape and on mar 21st a grace pass the senate for appoint a syndicate to consider of augmentation sheepshank be one of the syndicate and be understand to represent in some measure my interest the progress of the syndicate however be by no mean a straightforward one member of the senate soon begin to remark that before give anything they ought to know the amount of the university revenue and another syndicate be then appoint to enquire and report upon it it be more than a year before my syndicate could make they recommendation : however in fact i lose nothing by that delay as i be rise in the estimation of the university the observatory house be furnished partly from woodhouse 's sale and partly from new furniture my mother and sister come to live with I there on mar 15th 1828 i begin the observatory journal on mar 27th i sleep at the observatory for the first time and on apr 15th i come to reside there permanently and give up my college room chapter iv at cambridge observatory from he take charge of the cambridge observatory to he residence at greenwich observatory as astronomer royal from march 15th 1828 to jan 1st 1836 1828 i attend a meeting of the board of longitude on apr 3rd and again on June 4th this be the last meeting : sheepshank have previously give I private information of the certainty of its dissolution -- on apr 4th i visit mr herschel at slough where one evening i see saturn with he 20-foot telescope the best view of it that i have ever have -- in June i attend the greenwich observatory visitation -- before my election -lrb- as plumian professor -rrb- there be various scheme on my quire for computation of transit correction & c after apr 15th there be correction for deficient wire inequality of pivot & c and i begin a book of propose regulation for observation in this be plan for group of star for ra -lrb- the transit instrument be the only one finish -rrb- : order of preference of class of observation : no reduction to be make after dinner or on Sunday : no loose papers : observation to be stop if reduction be two month in arrear : star select for parallax -- the reduction of transit begin on apr 15th on may 15th mr pond send I some moon-transit to aid in determine my longitude -- dr young in a letter to I of may 7th enquire whether i will accept a free admission to the royal society which i decline on may 9th i be elect to the astronomical society -- towards the end of the year i observe encke 's comet : and determine the latitude of the observatory with sheepshank 's repeat circle -- on my papers i find a sketch of a article on the figure of the earth for the encyclopedia metropolitana as early as feb 23rd i have be in correspondence with t jone the instrument-maker about pendulum for a repetition of the dolcoath experiment invitation have be receive and everything be arrange with whewell sheepshank my brother and mr jackson of ipswich -lrb- caius coll -rrb- be to go and we be subsequently join by sedgwick and lodge -lrb- magdalene coll -rrb- on July 3rd sheepshank and i start by salisbury take sherborne on we way to look at the church which have alarm the people by sign of a crack and arrive at camborne on July 8th on the 14th we set up the pendulum and at once commence observation we plan be to have no intermission in the pendulum observation so that as soon as the arc become too small a fresh series be start on July 29th we raise the instrument and sheepshank who manage much of the upper operation both astronomical and of pendulum mount the pendulum together in he observatory we go on with we calculation and on August 8th on return from a visit to john william at barncoose we hear that there be a ` run ' in dolcoath that be a sinking of the whole mass of rock where it have be set free by the mine excavation : probably only a few inch but enough to break the rock much and to stop the pump on aug 10th the calculation of we observation shew that there be something wrong and on the 13th i perceive a anomaly in the form of the knife edge of one pendulum and of its agate plane and suggest caution for repeat the observation we determine at once to repeat they : and as the water be rise in the mine there be no time to be lose we again send the instrument down and make observation on the 16th 17th and 18th on the 19th i send the instrument up for the water be near we station and sedgwick whewell and i go on a geological expedition to the lizard on we return we meet sheepshank and the other and find the result of the last observation unsatisfactory the result of compare the pendulum be discordant and the knife edge of the faulty pendulum have very sensibly alter we now give up observation with the feeling that we time have be totally lose mainly through the fault of the maker of the pendulum -lrb- t jone -rrb- on the 28th we make a expedition to penzance and other place and arrive at cambridge on the 17th of September in the course of the work at dolcoath we make various expedition as opportunity offer thus we walk to carn brea and witness the wrestle the common game of the country on another occasion sedgwick whewell and i have a capital geological expedition to trewavas head to examine granite vein we visit at pendarve and trevince and make the expedition to the lizard already refer to and see many of the sight in the neighborhood after visit penzance on the conclusion of we work we see cape cornwall -lrb- where whewell overturn I in a gig -rrb- and return homewards by way of truro plymouth -lrb- where we see the watering-place and breakwater : also the dockyard and descend in one of the work diving-bell -rrb- exeter salisbury and portsmouth in return from camborne in 1826 i lose the principal of we papers it be a odd thing that in go through exeter on we way to camborne in 1828 i find they complete at exeter identify to the custodian by the drop out of a letter with my address on my return to cambridge i be immediately immerse in the work of the observatory the only instrument then mount at the observatory be the transit i have no assistant whatever -- a mr galbraith of edinburgh have question something in one of my papers about the figure of the earth i draw up a rather formal answer to it : whewell see my draft and draw up a much more pithy one which i adopt and send to the philosophical magazine -- for compare we clock at the upper and lower station of dolcoath we have borrow from the royal observatory greenwich six good pocket chronometer : they be still in the care of mr sheepshank i arrange with he that they should be send backwards and forwards a few time for determine the longitude of cambridge observatory this be do on oct 21st 22nd 23rd : the result be 23  54 and this have be use to the present time -lrb- 1853 -rrb- it evince a error in the trigonometrical survey the origin of which be find i think afterwards -lrb- dr pearson in a letter of dec 17th speak of the mistake of a may-pole for a signal-staff -rrb- i draw up a paper on this and give it to the cambridge philosophical society on nov 24th -lrb- my only academical paper this year -rrb- -- i have several letter from dr young partly supply I with calculation that i want partly on reform or extension of the nautical almanac -lrb- which dr young resist as much as possible -rrb- he consider I very unfairly treat in the dissolution of the board of longitude : professor lax wish I to join in some effort for its restoration but i decline as my reduction of observation be keep quite close i now begin to think of printing in regard to the form i determine to adopt a plan totally different from that of any other observation which i have see the result be to be the important thing : i be desirous of suppress the separate wire of transit but upon consult herschel and other person they would not agree to it and i assent to keep they i apply to the press syndicate to print the work and on nov 10th at the request of t musgrave -lrb- afterwards archbishop of york -rrb- i send a specimen of my m : on nov 11th they grant 250 copy and the printing soon commence 1829 during a winter holiday at playford i write out some investigation about the orbit of comet and on jan 23rd 1829 i return to cambridge the smith 's prize examination soon follow in which i set a paper of question as usual on feb 18th i make note on liesganig 's geodetic work at the british museum i be naturally anxious now about the settlement of my salary and of the observatory establishment i do not know when the syndicate make they report but it must have be in the last term of 1828 it recommend that the salary should be annually make up -lrb- by grace -rrb- to _ # 500 _ : that a assistant should be appoint with the assent of the vice-chancellor and dismissable by the plumian professor : and that a visit syndicate should be appoint partly official and partly of person to be name every year by grace the grace for adopt this report be to be offer to the senate on feb 27th the passing of the grace be expose to two considerable peril first i find out -lrb- just in time -rrb- that a senior fellow of trinity -lrb- ga browne -rrb- be determine to oppose the whole on account of the insignificant clause regard dismissal of assistant which he regard as tyrannical i at once undertake that that clause should be reject secondly by the absurd constitution of the ` caput ' at cambridge a single ma have the power of stop any business whatever and a ma actually come to the senate house with the intention of throw out all the grace on various business that day present to the senate luckily he mistake the hour and come at 11 instead of 10 and find that all be dispatch the important part of the grace pass without any opposition : but i muster some friend who negative that part which have alarm ga browne and it be correct to he satisfaction by a new grace on mar 18th i be now almost set at rest on one of the great object of my life : but not quite i do not regard and i determine not to regard the addition to my salary as absolutely certain until a payment have be actually make to I : and i carefully abstain for the present from take any step base upon it i find for assistant at the observatory a old lieutenant of the royal navy mr baldrey who come on mar 16 on may 4th i begin lecture : there be 32 name the lecture be improve especially in the optical part i do not find note of the day of termination -- i do not know the actual day of publication of my first small volume of cambridge observation 1828 and of circulation the date of the preface be apr 27th 1829 i have letter of approval of it from davy gilbert rigaud and lax the system which i endeavor to introduce into print astronomical observation be partially introduce into this volume and be steadily improve in subsequent volume i think that i be justify by letter and other remark in believe that this introduction of a orderly system of exhibition not merely of observation but of the step for bring they to a practical result -- quite a novelty in astronomical publication -- have a markedly good effect on european astronomy in general -- in feb and march i have letter from young about the nautical almanac : he be unwilling to make any great change but glad to receive any small assistance south who have be keep up a series of attack on young write to I to enquire how i stand in engagement of assistance to young : i reply that i should assist young whenever he ask I and that i disapprove of south 's course -- the date of the first visitation of the -lrb- cambridge -rrb- observatory must have be near may 11th : i invite south and baily to my house south and i be very near quarrel about the treatment of young -- in a few day after dr young die : i apply to lord melville for the superintendence of the nautical almanac : mr croker reply that it devolve legally upon the astronomer royal and on may 30th pond write to ask my assistance when i could give any on June 6th i be invite to the greenwich visitation to which i believe i go on the 10th i have long desire to see switzerland and i wish now to see some of the continental observatory i be therefore glad to arrange with mr lodge of magdalene college -lrb- perhaps 10 year senior to myself -rrb- to make a little tour capt wh smyth and other give I introduction i meet lodge in london and we start for calai on July 27th 1829 we visit a number of town in belgium -lrb- at brussels i see the beginning of the observatory with quetelet -rrb- and pass by cologne frankfort fribourg and basle to zurich thus far we have travel by diligence or post : we now procure a guide and travel generally on foot from the 13th to the 31st August we travel diligently through the well-known mountainous part of switzerland and arrive at geneva on the 31st August here i see m gautier m gambard and the beginning of the observatory mr lodge be now compel to return to cambridge and i proceed alone by chambry to turin where i make the acquaintance of m plana and see the observatory i then make a tour through north italy look over the observatory at milan padua bologna and florence at leghorn i take a passage for marseille in a xebeque but after sail for three day the weather prove very unfavourable and i land at spezium and proceed by genoa and the cornicus road to marseille at marseille i see m gambart and the observatory and pass by avignon lyon and never to orlans where i visit my old host m legarde thence by pari beauvai and calai to london and cambridge where i arrive on the 30th October i have start with more than _ # 140 _ and return with _ 2 6d _ the expedition be in many way invaluable to I on my return i find various letter from scientific man : some approve of my method for the mass of the moon : some approve highly of my print observation especially d gilbert who inform I that they have produce good effect -lrb- i believe at greenwich -rrb- and herschel -- on nov 13th i give the royal astronomical society a paper about deduce the mass of the moon from observation of venus : on nov 16th a paper to the cambridge philosophical society on a correction to the length of a ball-pendulum : and on dec 14th a paper on certain condition under which perpetual motion be possible -- the engraving for my figure of the earth in the encyclopedia metropolitana be dispatch at the end of the year some of the paper -lrb- perhaps much -rrb- be write after my return from the continent -- i begin but never finish a paper on the form of the earth suppose to be project at middle latitudes in this i refer to the print paper which nicollet give I at paris i believe that the investigation for my paper in the encyclopedia metropolitana lead I to think the supposition unnecessary -- on nov 6th i be elect member of the geological society on nov 16th 1829 notice be give of a grace to authorize payment to I of _ # 157 9 1d _ in conformity with the regulation adopt on feb 27th and on nov 18th the grace pass the senate on nov 19th the vice-chancellor write I a note enclose the cheque on nov 23rd -lrb- practically the first day on which i could go -rrb- i go to london and travel to edensor where i arrive on the 26th here i find richarda smith propose to she and be accept i stay there a few day and return to cambridge 1830 on jan 25th 1830 the smith 's prize paper be prepared i be -lrb- with my assistant mr baldrey -rrb- vigorously work the transit instrument and its reduction and gradually form a course of proceeding which have have a good effect on european astronomy and i be prepare for my marriage on mar 11th i start with my sister to london and arrive at edensor on the

comet paper -- one of the desideratum which i have point out in my report on astronomy be the determination of the mass of jupiter by elongation of the 4th satellite : and as the equatoreal of the cambridge observatory be on the point of come into use i determine to employ it for this purpose it be necessary for the reduction of the observation that i should prepare table of the motion of jupiter 's 4th satellite in a form applicable to computation of difference of right-ascension the date of my table be oct 3rd 1832 -- in October the observatory syndicate make they report : quite satisfactory on oct 20th sheepshank write ask my assistance in the penny cyclopaedia : i do afterwards write ` gravitation ' and ` greenwich ' -- capt beaufort write in November to ask my opinion on

winter i have well employ the equatoreal in observe elongation in ra of the 4th satellite to make these available it be necessary to work up the theory carefully in which i discover some remarkable error of laplace some of these for verification i submit to mr lubbock who entirely agree with I the date of my first calculation of the mass of jupiter be mar 1st : and shortly after that i give a oral account of they to the cambridge philosophical society the date of my paper for the astronomical society be April 12th the result of my investigation -lrb- which be subsequently confirm by bessel -rrb- entirely remove the difficulty among astronomer and the mass which i obtain have ever since be receive as the true one on apr 9th my wife 's two sister elizabeth and georgiana smith come to stay

\* \* on march 18th 1835 i start -lrb- meeting sheepshank at kingstown -rrb- for ireland we visit dublin observatory and then go direct to markree near sligo to see mr cooper 's telescope -lrb- we principal object -rrb- we pass on we return by enniskillen and ballyjamesduff where my former pupil p morton be live and return on apr 3rd -- on apr 20th i be elect to the royal society edinburgh -- apr 22nd my wife write I from edensor that she sister florence be very ill : she die shortly after -- on may 4th i begin lecture and finish on may 29th : there be 58 name -- my former pupil guest ask my interest for the recordership of birmingham -- in June be circulate the syndicate report on the observatory -- the date of the preface to the 1834 observation be June 16th the ministry have be again change in the spring and the whig be again in power on June 11th lord auckland who be again first lord of the admiralty -lrb- as last year -rrb- again write to I to offer I the office of astronomer royal or to request my suggestion on the fill up of the office on June 15th i write my first reply and on June 17th write to accept it on June 18th lord auckland acknowledge and on June 22nd the king approve lord auckland appoint to see I on Friday June 23rd but i be unwell i have various correspondence with lord auckland principally about building and have a appointment with he for August 13th as lord auckland be just quit office to go to indium i be introduce to mr charle wood the secretary of the admiralty with whom principally the subsequent business be transact at this meeting lord auckland and mr wood express they feeling that the observatory have fall into such a state of disrepute that the whole establishment ought to be clear out i represent that i could make it efficient with a good first assistant and the other assistant be keep but the establishment be in a queer state the royal warrant under the sign manual be send on August 11th it be understand that my occupation of office would commence on October 1st but repair and alteration of building would make it impossible for I to reside at greenwich before the end of the year on oct 1st i go to the observatory and enter formally upon the office -lrb- though not reside for some time -rrb- oct 7th be the date of my official instruction i have make it a condition of accept the office that the then first assistant should be remove and accordingly i have the charge of seek another i determine to have a man who have take a respectable cambridge degree i make enquiry first of mr bowstead -lrb- brother to the bishop -rrb- and mr steventon : at length consulting mr hopkin -lrb- a well-known private tutor at cambridge -rrb- he recommend to I mr robert main of queen ' college with whom i correspond in the month -lrb- principally -rrb- of August and whom on August 30th i nominate to the admiralty on oct 21st fw simm one of the assistant -lrb- who apparently have hope for the office of first assistant for which he be quite incompetent -rrb- resign and on dec 4th i appoint in he place mr jame glaisher who have be at cambridge from the beginning of 1833 and on dec 10th the admiralty approve during this quarter of a year i be reside at cambridge observatory visit greenwich once a week -lrb- at least for some time -rrb- the immediate superintendence of the observatory be place with mr main i be however engage in reform the system of the greenwich observatory and prepared and print 30 skeleton form for reduction of observation and other business on dec 14th i resign my professorship to the vice-chancellor but i continue the reduction of the observation so that not a single figure be leave to my successor : the last observation be those of halley 's comet the preface to my 1835 cambridge observation be date aug 22nd 1836 in regard to the northumberland telescope i have for some time be speculate on plan of mount and enclose the instrument and have correspond with simm a biddell cubitt and other on the subject on apr 24th tulley the younger be endeavor to adjust the object-glass on may 31st i plainly ask the duke of northumberland whether he would defray the expense of the mount and build on June 4th he assent and money be place at a banker 's to my order i then proceed in earnest : in the autumn the building be erect and the dome be cover before the depth of winter i continue in 1836 to superintend the mount of the instrument in regard to the planetary reduction : to July 11th j glaisher have be employ 27 week and from July 11th to jan 16th 1836 25 week mr spring rice when chancellor of the exchequer have promise money but no official minute have be make and no money have be grant on aug 21st i apply to mr bare -lrb- secretary of the treasury -rrb- after another letter he answer on oct 15th that he find no official minute after write to vernon harcourt and to spring rice the matter be arrange : my outlay be refund and another sum grant -- in regard to groombridge 's observation i find that on dec 16th certain trial reduction have be make under my direction by j glaisher -- i have attempt some optical experiment in the summer especially on the polarization of sky-light but have be too busy with the observatory to continue they in August my wife be in a critical state of health -- in December i receive information regard merchant ship ' chronometer for which i have apply to mr charle parker of liverpool -- on dec 8th mr spring rice and lord john russell offer I knighthood but i decline it -- on July 23rd i go into suffolk with my wife 's sister elizabeth and georgiana and return on August 3rd : this be all the holiday that i get in this year -- on the 14th of August i see mr taylor the admiralty civil architect in london and the extension of building at greenwich observatory be arrange -- i make various journey to greenwich and on dec 17th have send off we furniture we all quit the cambridge observatory and stay for some day at the house of miss sheepshank thus end a busy and anxious year \* \* \* \* \* with reference to the offer of knighthood above-mentioned airy 's reply be characteristic and the short correspondence relate to it be therefore insert -- the offer itself be a additional proof of the high estimation in which he stand at this time down street _ dec 8th 1835 _ my dear sir i have be in communication with my colleague lord john russell which have make I feel rather anxious to have the pleasure of see you but on second thought it have occur to I that the subject of my communication would render it more satisfactory to you to receive a letter than to pay a visit in testimony of the respect which be feel for you character and acquirement there would be every disposition to recommend you to he majesty to receive the distinction of knighthood i be quite aware that to you individually this may be a matter of small concern but to the scientific world in general it will not be indifferent and to foreign country it will mark the consideration feel for you personally as well as for the position which you occupy among you learn contemporary from a knowledge of the respect and esteem which i feel for you lord john russell have wish that the communication should be make through I rather than through any person who have not the pleasure of you acquaintance pray let I hear from you and believe I my dear sir with compliment to mr airy very truly yours t spring rice p -- it may be right to add that when a title of honor be confer on grounds like those which apply to you case no fee or charge of any kind would be payable observatory cambridge _ 1835 dec 10th _ my dear sir i beg to acknowledge you letter of the 8th which i have receive at this place convey to I a intimation of the wish of he majesty 's minister to recommend I to the king for the honor of knighthood i beg to assure you that i be most sensible to the liberality which i have experience from the government in other as well as in pecuniary matter and that i be very highly gratify by the consideration -lrb- undeserved by I i fear -rrb- which they have display in the present instance and if i now request permission to decline the honor offer to I i trust i may make it fully understand that it be not because i value it lightly or because i be not anxious to receive honor from such a source the unalterable custom of this country have attach a certain degree of light consideration to title of honor which be not support by considerable fortune or at least it call for the display of such a establishment as may not be conveniently support by even a comfortable income the provision attach to my official situation and the liberality of the king towards one of the member of my family have place I in a position of great comfort these circumstance however have bind I to consider myself as the devoted servant of the country and to debar myself from effort to increase my fortune which might otherwise have be open to I i do not look forward therefore to any material increase of income and that which i enjoy at present be hardly sufficient in my opinion to support respectably the honor which you and lord john russell have propose to confer upon I for this reason only i beg leave most respectfully to decline the honor of knighthood at the present time i have only to add that my service will always be at the command of the government in any scientific subject in which i can be of the smallest use i be my dear sir you very faithful servant gb airy _ the right honorable t spring rice _ \* \* \* \* \* in brief revision of the year from 1827 to 1835 i may confine myself to the two principal subject -- my professorial lecture and my conduct of the cambridge observatory the lecture as begin in 1827 include ordinary mechanic ordinary hydrostatic and pneumatic -lrb- i think that i do not touch or touch very lightly on the subject connect with the hydraulic ram -rrb- and ordinary optics -lrb- with a very few word on polarization and depolarization -rrb- in 1828 the two first be generally improve and for the third -lrb- optics -rrb- i introduce a few word on circular polarization i believe that it be in 1829 that i make a addition to the syllabus with a small engrave shew the interference of light in the best practical experiment -lrb- that of the flat prism -rrb- and i go thoroughly into the main point of the undulatory theory interference diffraction & c in 1830 i believe i go -lrb- in addition to what be mention above -rrb- into polarization and depolarization of all kind my best lecture diagram be draw and paint by my wife the lecture be universally pronounced to be valuable the subject undergo no material change in 1831 2 3 4 5 and i believe it be a matter of sincere regret to many person that my removal to greenwich terminate the series each lecture nominally occupy a hour but i always encouraged student to stop and talk with I and this supplement be usually consider a valuable part of the lecture practically the lecture on most day occupy two hour i enjoy the lecture much : yet i feel that the labor -lrb- in addition to other work -rrb- make a impression on my strength and i become at length desirous of terminate they the observatory when i take charge of it have only one instrument -- the transit-instrument the principle however which i lay down for my own direction be adapt to the expect complete equipment planet -lrb- totally neglect at greenwich -rrb- be to be observe observation be to be reduce completely and the reduction be to be exhibit in a orderly way : this be a novelty in astronomy i consider it so important that i actually propose to omit in my publication the original observation but be dissuade by herschel and other i sometimes suspend observation for a short time in order to obtain leisure for the reduction i have at first no intention of correct the place of the fundamental star as settle at greenwich but i find myself compel to do so because they be not sufficiently accurate and then i take the course of observe and reduce as a independent observer without reference to any other observatory i introduce the principle of not correct instrumental error but measure they and apply numerical correction i determine my longitude by chronometer and my latitude by a repeat circle borrow from mr sheepshank which i use so well that the result be only half a second in error the form of my reduction in the publish volume for 1828 be rather irregular but the matter be good : it soon attract attention in 1829 the process be much the same : i have a assistant mr baldrey in 1830 still the same with the addition : -- that i formally give the correction of relative right-ascension of fundamental star -lrb- without alteration of equinox which i have not the means of obtain -rrb- to be use in the year 1831 and that i reduce completely the observe occultation -lrb- with a small error subsequently correct -rrb- in 1831 the system of correction of broken transit be improve : the error of assume ra of fundamental star be exhibit : mean solar time be obtain from sidereal time by time of transit of -lrb- symbol : aries -rrb- -lrb- compute by myself -rrb- : the method of compute occultation be improve in 1832 the small equatoreal be erect and be soon employ in observation of the elongation of the 4th satellite of jupiter for determine the mass of jupiter the mural circle be erect at the end of the year but not use the calculation of ra of fundamental star be make homogeneously with the other : separate result of all be include in ledger : a star-catalogue be form : all as to the present time -lrb- 1871 -rrb- with the equatoreal the difference of npd of mar and star be observe with the beginning of 1833 the mural circle be establish at work a second assistant -lrb- mr glaisher -rrb- be appoint and the observatory might be consider complete i make experiment on the graduation of the circle i detect and be annoy by the r -- d i determine the latitude i exhibit the separate result for npd of star in ledger and they means in catalogue i investigate from my observation the place of equinox and the obliquity of the ecliptic i make another series of observation of jupiter 's 4th satellite for the mass of jupiter i observe the solar eclipse with the equatoreal by a method then first introduce which i have since use several time at cambridge and greenwich with excellent effect the moon and the planet be usually observe till near two in the morning correction for defective illumination apply when necessary the volume be very complete the only deficiency be in the observation of moon and planet through the severe morning hour in 1834 the only novelty be -- examination of the graduation of the declination circle of the equatoreal -lrb- excessively bad -rrb- : observation of a spot on jupiter for rotation and of mar and star in 1835 -lrb- include January 1836 -rrb- there be a more complete examination of the equatoreal graduation : parallax and refraction for equatoreal observation : a spot on jupiter : a series of observation on jupiter 's 4th satellite for the mass of jupiter : mar and star : halley 's comet -lrb- the best series of observation which could be make in the season -rrb- : and a short series of meteorological observation on a plan suggest by sir john herschel then at the cape of good hope i can not tell precisely in which year i introduce the follow useful custom towards the end of each year i procure a pocket-book for the following year with a space for every day and carefully examine all the source of element of observation and determine the observation to be make every day i insert they in the pocket-book this system give wonderful steadiness to the plan of observation for the next year the system have be maintain in great perfection at the observatory of greenwich -lrb- the first of these pocket-book which prof adam have find be that for 1833 -rrb- print skeleton form be introduce for all calculation from 1828 in the greenwich observatory library there be a collection i believe complete of print papers commence with my manifesto and contain all syndicate report except for 1833 -lrb- when perhaps there be none -rrb- it seem from these that my first write report on observation & c be on may 30th 1834 the first syndicate report be on may 25th 1829 \* \* \* \* \* a few remark on airy 's private life and friend during he residence at cambridge observatory may be here appropriately insert amid the laborious occupation record in the foregoing page he social life and surroundings appear to have be most pleasant and congenial at that period there be in residence in cambridge and particularly at trinity a large number of very brilliant man airy be essentially a cambridge man he have come up poor and friendless : he have gain friend and fame at the university and he whole work have be do there from the frequent reference in after time both by he and he wife to they life at cambridge it be clear that they have a very pleasant recollection of it and that the social gathering there be remarkably attractive he have himself record that with whewell and sedgwick and he accomplished sister-in-law who be frequently on long visit at the observatory they form pretty nearly one family he friendship with whewell be very close although whewell be at time hasty and rough-mannered and even extremely rude yet he be generous and large-minded and thoroughly upright -lrb- footnote : the following passage occur in a letter from airy to he wife date 1845 sept 17th : i be sorry that -- speak in such term of the ` grand master ' as she use to be so proud of he : it be only those who have _ well _ go through the ordeal of quarrel with he and almost insult from he like sheepshank and I that thoroughly appreciate the good that be in he : i be sure he will never want a good word from I -rrb- in power of mind in pursuit and interest airy have more in common with whewell than with any other of he friend it be with whewell that he undertake the experiment at dolcoath : it be to whewell that he first communicate the result of he remarkable investigation of the long inequality of venus and the earth and some of he optical research be conduct jointly with whewell whewell take he degree in 1816 seven year before airy and he reputation both for mathematical and all-round knowledge be extremely and deservedly great but he be always most generous in he recognition of airy 's power thus in a letter of mar 16th 1823 -lrb- life of william whewell by mr stair dougla -rrb- he say airy be certainly a most extraordinary man and deserve everything that can be say of he and again in the autumn of 1826 he write to he aunt you mention a difficulty which have occur to you in one of you late letter how airy should be make professor while i be here who be you nephew must of course on that account deserve it better than he could now it be a thing which you will think odd but it be nevertheless true that airy be a better mathematician than you nephew and have moreover be much more employ of late in such study seriously speak airy be by very much the best person they could have choose for the situation and few thing have give I so much pleasure as he election how much whewell depend upon he friend at the observatory may be gather from a letter which he write to he sister on dec 21st 1833 we have lately be in alarm here on the subject of illness two very near friend of mine prof and mr airy have have the scarlet fever at the same time she more slightly he very severely they be now i be thankful to say do well and recover rapidly you will recollect that i be stay with they at she father 's in derbyshire in the summer they be i think two of the most admirable and delightful person that the world contain and again on dec 20th 1835 he write to he sister ann my friend -- i may almost say my dearest friend -- professor airy and he family have leave cambridge he be appoint astronomer royal at greenwich -- to I a irreparable loss but i shall probably go and see how they look in they new abode they close intercourse be naturally interrupt by airy 's removal to greenwich but they friendly feeling and mutual respect continue without material break till whewell 's death there be frequent correspondence between they especially on matter connect with the conduct and teaching of the university in which they both take a keen interest and a warm welcome at trinity lodge always await mr and mr airy when they visit cambridge in a letter write to mr stair dougla on feb 11th 1882 enclose some of whewell 's letter there occur the following passage : after the decease of mr whewell whewell write to my wife a mournful letter tell she of he melancholy state and ask she to visit he at the lodge for a few day and she do go and do the honor of the house for several day you will gather from this the relation in which the family stand whewell die on mar 6th 1866 from the effect of a fall from he horse and the follow extract be from a letter write by airy to whewell 's niece mr sumner gibson on hearing of the death of he old friend : the master be i believe my oldest survive friend -lrb- beyond my own family -rrb- and after a acquaintance of 46 year i must have be one of he oldest friend we have during that time be connect privately and officially : we travel together and experiment together : and as opportunity serve -lrb- but i need not say in very different degree -rrb- we both labor for we college and university a terrible blank be leave on my mind sedgwick be probably 15 year older than airy : he take he degree in 1808 but the astonishing buoyancy of spirit and bonhomie of sedgwick fit he for all age alike he be undoubtedly the most popular man in cambridge in modern time he ability he brightness and wit he fearless honesty and uprightness he plain-speaking and good humor render he a universal favorite he close alliance with airy be much more social than scientific it be true that they make some geological excursion together but at any rate with airy it be far more by way of recreation than of serious study and sedgwick 's science be entirely geological they friendship continue till sedgwick 's death though it be once or twice imperil by sedgwick 's impulsive and hasty nature peacock take he degree in 1813 -lrb- herschel 's year -rrb- and be therefore probably 10 year older than airy he be the earliest and staunchest friend of airy in he undergraduate year encourage he in every possible way lend he book assist he in he study help he with wise advice on many occasion and take the greatest interest in he success he be a good and advanced mathematician and with a great deal of shrewdness and common-sense he unite a singular kindness and gentleness of manner it be therefore not to be wonder at that he be regard by airy with the greatest esteem and affection and though they be afterwards separate by peacock become dean of ely and airy astronomer royal yet they warm friendship be never break the follow letter write by airy to mr peacock on receive the news of the death of the dean well express he feeling towards he old friend : trinity lodge cambridge _ 1858 dec 4 _ my dear madam i have desire for some time to express to you my sympathy on occasion of the sad bereavement which have come upon I perhaps as strongly as upon any one not connect by family tie with my late friend but i can scarcely give you a idea how every disposable moment of my time have be occupy i be now call to cambridge on business and i seize the first free time to write to you my late friend be the first person whom i know in college -lrb- i have a introduction to he when i go up as freshman -rrb- from the first he desire I to consider the introduction not as entitle I to a mere formal recognition from he but as authorize I at all time to call on he for any assistance which i might require and this be fully carry out : i refer to he in every difficulty : i have the entire command of he room and library -lrb- a very important aid in follow the new course of mathematics which he have be so instrumental in introduce into the university -rrb- in he occasional absence : and in all respects i look to he as to a parent all my debt to other friend in the university add together be not comparable to what i owe to the late dean latterly i need not say that i owe much to he and that i owe much to you for you kind notice of my two son even since the sad event which have put it out of he power to do more in the past summer look to my custom of make a visit to cambridge in some part of the October term i have determine that a visit to ely this year should not depend on the chance of be free to leave cambridge but that if it should be find convenient to yourself and the dean the first journey should be make to ely i wish that i have form the same resolution one or two year ago with many thanks for you kindness and with deep sympathy on this occasion i be my dear madam yours very faithfully gb airy sheepshank be a fellow of trinity in order : he be probably seven year older than airy -lrb- he take he degree in 1816 -rrb- he be not one of airy 's earliest friend but he have a great taste and liking for astronomy and the friendship between they when once establish become very close he be a very staunch and fearless friend a able and incisive writer and remarkably energetic and diligent in astronomical investigation he or he sister miss sheepshank have a house in london and sheepshank be very much in london and busy himself extremely with the work of the royal observatory that of the board of longitude and miscellaneous astronomical matter he be most hospitable to he friend and while airy reside at cambridge he house be always open to receive he on he frequent visit to town in the various polemical discussion on scientific matter in which airy be engage sheepshank be a invaluable ally and after airy 's removal to greenwich have more or less separated he from he cambridge friend sheepshank be still associate with he and take a keen interest in he greenwich work and this continue till sheepshank 's death the warmest friendship always subsist between the family at the observatory and mr and miss sheepshank there be many other friend able and talented man but these four be the chief and it be curious to note that they be all much older than airy it would seem as if airy 's knowledge have mature in so remarkable a manner and the original work that he produce be so brilliant and copious that by common consent he rank with man who be much he senior : and the natural gravity and decorum of he manners when quite a young man well support the idea of a age considerably greater than be actually the case chapter v at greenwich observatory -- 1836 to 1846 1836 through the last quarter of 1835 i have keep everything go on at the greenwich observatory in the same manner in which mr pond have carry it on with the beginning of 1836 my new system begin i have already prepared 30 print skeleton form -lrb- a system totally unknown to mr pond -rrb- which be now bring into use and have see the utility of the copying press in merchant ' office i procure one from this time my correspondence public and private be exceedingly perfect at this time the dwelling house be still unconnected with the observatory it have no staircase to the octagon room four new room have be build for I on the western side of the dwelling house but they be not yet habitable the north-east dome ground floor be still a passage room the north terrace be the official passage to the north-west dome where there be a miserable equatoreal and to the 25-foot zenith tube -lrb- in a square tower like a steeple which connect the nw dome with flamsteed 's house -rrb- the southern boundary of the garden run down a hollow which divide the peninsula from the site of the present magnetic observatory in such a manner that the principal part of the garden be fully expose to the public the computing room be a most pitiful little room there be so little room for I that i transport the principal table to a room in my house where i conduct much of my own official business a large useless reflect telescope -lrb- ramage 's -rrb- on the plan and nearly of the size of sir w herschel 's principal telescope encumber the center of the front court on jan 11th i address mr buck agent of the princess sophium of gloucester ranger of greenwich park for leave to enclose a portion of the ground overlook my garden this be soon grant and i be partially deliver from the inconvenience of the public gaze the liberation be not complete till the magnetic ground be enclose in 1837 in the inferior department of the admiralty especially in the hydrographic office -lrb- then represent by captain beaufort -rrb- with which i be principally connect the observatory be consider rather as a place for manage government chronometer than as a place of science the precede first assistant -lrb- taylor -rrb- have keep a book of letter reference and i find that out of 840 letter 820 related to government chronometer only on jan 17th i mentally sketched my regulation for my own share in chronometer business i have some correspondence with captain beaufort but we could not agree and the matter be refer to the admiralty finally arrangement be make which put the chronometer business in proper subordination to the scientific charge of the observatory in my first negociation with the admiralty refer to acceptance of the office of astronomer royal in 1834 lord auckland be then first lord of the admiralty i have stipulate that as my successor at cambridge would be unprepared to carry on my lecture i should have permission to give a final course of lecture there at the end of 1835 lord auckland be succeed by lord minto : i claim the permission from he and he refuse it when this be know in cambridge a petition be present by many cambridge resident and lord minto yield on April 18th i go to cambridge with my wife reside at the bull inn and begin lecture on April 21st : they continue -lrb- apparently -rrb- to may 27th my lecture-room be crowd -lrb- the number of name be 110 -rrb- and the lecture give great satisfaction i offer to the admiralty to put all the profit in they hand and transmit a cheque to the accountant general of the navy : but the admiralty decline to receive they on June 4th the annual visitation of the observatory be hold mr f baily in the chair i present a write report on the observatory -lrb- a custom which i have introduce at cambridge -rrb- in which i do not suppress the expression of my feeling about chronometer business the hydrographer captain beaufort who be one of the official visitor be irritated : and by he influence the report be not print i keep it and succeed report safe for three year and then the board of visitor agree to print they and four report be print together and bind with the greenwich observation of 1838 in the course of this year i complete the volume of observation make at cambridge observatory in 1835 and on nov 10th the print copy be distribute about the end of 1835 the dome for the northumberland telescope be erect : but apparently the polar frame be not erect the follow account of a accident which occur during the construction of the dome be extract from a letter by airy to he wife date 1836 jan 31st the workman 's account of the dome blow off be very curious : it must have be a strange gust it start suddenly when the man be all inside and beaumont be look up at it : the cannon ball be throw in with great violence -lrb- one of they go between the spoke of ransome ' large casting -rrb- and instantly after the dome have start the board of the outside scaffolding which have be toss up by the same gust drop down into the gap which the dome have leave it be a wonder that none of the man be hurt and that the iron be not break the dome be quite covered and i think do not look so well as when the hooping be visible previous to 1836 i have begin to contemplate the attachment of magnetic observation to the observatory and have correspond with prof christie prof lloyd prof j d forbe and mr gauss on the subject on jan 12th 1836 i address a formal letter to the admiralty and on jan 18th receive they answer that they have refer it to the board of visitor on march 25th i receive authority for the expenditure of _ # 30 _ and i believe that i then order merz 's 2-foot magnet the visitor meet on feb 26th and after some discussion the site be choose and the extent of ground generally define and on dec 22nd mr spring rice -lrb- lord monteagle -rrb- as chancellor of the exchequer virtually effect the transfer of the ground but no further step be take in 1836 a letter on a systematic course of magnetic observation in various part of the world be address by baron alexander humboldt to the duke of sussex president of the royal society and be refer to prof christie and I we report on it on June 9th 1836 strongly recommend the adoption of the scheme a plan have be propose by the promoter of the london and gravesend railway -lrb- col landman engineer -rrb- for carry a railway at high level across the bottom of the park on jan 9th i receive order from the admiralty to examine into its possible effect in produce vibration in the observatory after much correspondence examination of ground & c i fix upon a part of the greenwich railway -lrb- not yet open for traffic -rrb- near the place where the croydon trunk line now join it as the place for train to run upon while i make observation with a telescope view a collimator by reflection in mercury at the distance of 500 foot the experiment be make on jan 25th and i report on feb 4th it be shewn that there would be some danger to the observatory on nov 2nd mr jame walker engineer bring a model of a railway to pass by tunnel under the lower part of the park : apparently this scheme be not press in addition to the routine work of the observatory a special set of observation be make to determine the mass of jupiter -- also the solar eclipse of may 15th be observe at greenwich in the manner which i have introduce at cambridge -- the ordnance zenith sector and the instrument for the st helena observatory be bring for examination -- much attention be give to chronometer and various step be take for they improvement -- i have some important correspondence with mr -lrb- sir john -rrb- lubbock upon the lunar theory generally and he proposed empirical lunar table this be the first germ of the great reduction of lunar observation which i subsequently carry out -- in October i be nominate on the council of the royal society have be admit a fellow on feb 18th 1836 i be president of the astronomical society during this and the precede year -lrb- 1836 and 1835 -rrb- my connection with groombridge 's catalogue of star begin in 1832 and the examination in concert with mr baily of the edition print by mr henry taylor result in its condemnation in 1834 i volunteer to the admiralty to prepare a new edition and receive they thanks and they authority for proceed it require a great deal of examination of detail and much time be spend on it in 1836 : but it be not bring to the state of readiness for press my predecessor mr pond die on sept 7th 1836 and be inter in halley 's tomb in lee churchyard \* \* \* \* \* the follow letter be write by airy in support of the application for a pension to mr pond who have be leave in great distress : to henry warburton esq the point upon which in my opinion mr pond 's claim to the gratitude of astronomer be found be principally the follow _ first _ and chief the accuracy which he introduce into all the principal observation this be a thing which from its nature it be extremely difficult to estimate now so long after the change have be make and i can only say that so far as i can ascertain from book the change be one of very great extent : for certainty and accuracy astronomy be quite a different thing from what it be and this be mainly due to mr pond the most striking exemplification of this be in he laborious work out of every conceivable cause or indication of error in the circle and the two circle : but very great praise be also due for the new system which he introduce in work the transit in compare mr pond 's system of observation with dr maskelyne 's no one can avoid be impress with the inferiority of dr maskelyne 's it be very important to notice that the continental observatory which have since attract so much attention do not at that time exist or do not exist in vigor _ secondly _ the attention bestow by mr pond on those point -lrb- chiefly of sidereal astronomy -rrb- which he regard as fundamental : to which such mass of observation be direct as entirely to remove the doubt from probable error of individual observation or chance circumstance which have injure many other determination _ thirdly _ the regularity of observation the effect of all these have be that since the commencement of mr pond 's residence at greenwich astronomy consider as a accurate representation of the state of the heaven in the most material point have acquire a certainty and a extent which it never have before there be no period in the history of the science so clean on some matter -lrb- in regard to the choice of observation -rrb- i might say that my own judgment would have differ in some degree from mr pond 's but one thing could have be gain only by give up another and upon the general accuracy no improvement could have be make mr pond understand nothing of physical astronomy but neither do anybody else in england the suppose decrease of general efficiency in the last few year be to be ascribe to the follow cause : 1 mr pond 's ill health 2 the inefficiency of he first assistant 3 the oppression of business connect with chronometer the last of these as i have reason to think operate very far business of this nature which -lrb- necessarily -rrb- be _ daily _ and _ peremptory _ will always prevail over that which be _ general _ and _ confidential _ i will not trouble you with a account of the various way in which the chronometer business teaze the astronomer royal -lrb- several alteration have be make at my representation -rrb- but shall merely remark that much of the business have no connection whatever with astronomy i beg to submit these remark to you perusal request you to point out to I _ what part _ of they should be lay before any of the king 's minister _ at what time in what shape _ and to whom address i be quite sure that mr pond 's claim require nothing to ensure favourable consideration but the impression of such a feeling of mr pond 's astronomical merit as must be entertain by any reasonable astronomer and i be most anxious to assist in convey this impression of private history : i go to suffolk for a week on mar 25th on sept 19th my son wilfrid -lrb- my fourth child -rrb- be bear in October i make a excursion for a week round the coast of kent in November i go to my brother 's house at keysoe in bedfordshire : i be much expose to cold on the return-journey which probably aggravate the illness that soon follow from nov 27th i be ill make the last journal entry of the year on dec 6th the next be on jan 14th 1837 i find that in this year i have introduce arthur biddell to the tithe commutation office where he be soon favourably receive and from which connection he obtain very profitable employment as a valuer 1837 my connection with cambridge observatory be not yet finish i have determine that i would not leave a figure to be compute by my successor in October i have -lrb- at my private expense -rrb- set mr glaisher to work on reduce the observation of sun moon and planet make in 183318341835 and subsequently have the calculation examine by mr hartnup this employ I at time through 1837 i state here once for all that every calculation or other work in reference to the cambridge observatory in this and subsequent year be do at my private expense the work of the northumberland telescope be go on through the year : from nov 24th to 29th i be at cambridge on these work a object-glass of 6-3\/4 inch aperture -lrb- a most unusual size at this time when it be difficult to find a 4-inch or 5-inch glass -rrb- have be present to the greenwich observatory by my friend mr sheepshank and on mar 29th i receive from the admiralty authority for mount it equatoreally in the empty south dome which have be intend for a copy of the palermo circle -- in the month of July the admiralty wish for my political assistance in a greenwich election but i refuse to give any -- on jan 3rd i give notice to the admiralty that i have finish the computation of groombridge 's catalogue and be ready to print the printing be authorize and proceed -lrb- the introduction be finish on nov 22nd -rrb- but the book be not quite ready till the beginning of 1838 -- in connection with the cavendish experiment : on June 10th i write to spring rice -lrb- chancellor of the exchequer -rrb- for _ # 500 _ which be soon grant : and from this time there be a great deal of correspondence -lrb- mainly with mr baily -rrb- upon the detail of the experiment and the theory of the calculation -- on July 24th i see the descent of the parachute by which mr cocking be kill i attend the coroner 's inquest and give evidence a few day later the planetary reduction from 1750 to 1830 have be go on : the computer -lrb- glaisher hartnup and thoma -rrb- work in the octagon room and considerable advance be make -- in consequence of the agitation of the proposal by mr lubbock to form empirical table of the moon for which i propose to substitute complete reduction of the observation of the moon from 1750 the british association at york -lrb- oct 23rd 1837 -rrb- appoint a deputation -lrb- include myself -rrb- to place the matter before the government i write on the matter to mr wood -lrb- lord halifax -rrb- state that it would be proper to raise the first assistant 's salary and to give I more indefinite power about employ computer in all these thing i receive cordial assistance from mr wood the chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- mr spring rice -rrb- receive we on dec 20th : statement be furnish by I and the business be sanction immediately -- during this year i be very much engage in correspondence with lubbock and other on improvement of the lunar theory in the operation of 1836 and 1837 a great quantity of papers have be accumulate i have keep they in reasonably good order tie up in bundle : but this method begin to fail in convenience as the number increase the great line of classification be however now well understand i believe it be in the latter part of the year 1837 that i finally settle on the principle of arrange papers in packet and subordinate packet every paper be flat by the use of four punch hole in every paper i have never see any principle of arrangement comparable to this it have be adopt with the greatest ease by every assistant and be use to the present time -lrb- 1871 -rrb- without alteration on jan 3rd i be inform unofficially by mr wood -lrb- admiralty secretary -rrb- that the addition of the magnetic ground be sanction on feb 16th mr rhode -lrb- a officer of the department of wood and work -rrb- come to put I formally in possession of the ground between apr 26th and may 13th the ground be enclose and my garden be completely protect from the public the plan of the building be settle and numerous experiment be make on various kind of concrete : at last it be decide to build with wood after a dinner give by lord burlington chancellor the first meeting of the london university be hold on mar 4th and other follow on apr 18th i hand to the chancellor a write protest against a vote of a salary of _ # 1000 _ to the registrar : which salary in fact the government refuse to sanction dissension on the question of religious examination be already begin but i take little part in they in 1833 mr henderson have resign the superintendance of the cape of good hope observatory and mr maclear be appoint i recommend the same official instruction for he -lrb- they have include a allusion to la caille 's arc of meridian -rrb- with a addition on the probability of trigonometrical survey on aug 8th 1837 on feb 24th 1837 i write to beaufort suggest that bradley 's sector should be use for verify the astronomical determination and subsequently receive the approval of the admiralty in June sir j herschel and i have a interview with mr wood on the cape equipment generally the sector be erect with its new mount careful drawing be make of every part instruction be prepare for its use and on aug 10th it be send to woolwich dockyard and ship for the cape of private history : on aug 23rd i start with my wife for a excursion in south wales & c on sept 9th i give a lecture in the town hall of neath while at swansea we receive news of the death of my wife 's father the rev richard smith and return at once -- in this year arthur biddell buy the little eye estate for I 1838 cambridge observatory : -- on dec 29th 1837 i have set mr glaisher to work in collect the annual result for star-place from the cambridge observation to form one catalogue : i examine the calculation and the deduce catalogue and on dec 14 1838 present it to the royal astronomical society under the title of ` the first cambridge catalogue ' -- for the northumberland telescope i be engage with simm about the clockwork from time to time up to apr 30th and go to cambridge about it the instrument be bring to a useable state but some small part be still want at greenwich : -- in April i draw up a little history of the observatory for the penny cyclopaedia -- on June 30th the lord of the admiralty pay a short visit to the observatory : on this occasion mr wood suggest a passage connect the observatory with the dwelling-house and i subsequently prepared sketch for it it be make in the next year -- in the course of the year the sheepshank equatoreal be mount and encke 's comet be observe with it from oct 26th to nov 13th -- on mar 31st & c i report to the admiralty on the selection of chronometer for purchase from a long list : this be a important beginning of a new system -- the magnetic observatory be build in the form originally plan for it -lrb- a four-armed cross with equal arm one axis be in the magnetic meridian -rrb- in the beginning of this year -lrb- no alteration have since be make in form up to the present time 1871 except that the north arm have be lengthen 8 foot a few year ago -rrb- on may 21st a magnet be suspend for the first time mr baily and lieut -lrb- afterwards sir william -rrb- denison be present -- groombridge 's catalogue be finish and on mar 3rd i arrange for send out copy -- the planetary reduction be carry on vigorously on may 31st 1838 the treasury assent to the undertaking of the lunar reduction and allotted _ # 2000 _ for it : preparation be make and in the autumn 7 computer be employ upon it it will easily be see that this undertaking add much to my labor and care -- the geodetic affair of the cape of good hope begin to be actively press and in February beaufort write to I in consequence of a application from maclear ask about a standard of length for maclear -lrb- as foundation for a geodetic survey -rrb- i make enquiry and on mar 13th write to mr wood alluding also generally to the want of a national english standard after the destruction of the house of parliament on apr 24th the admiralty sanction my procure proper standard bar -- in connection with the cavendish experiment i have a immense quantity of correspondence with mr baily and all the mathematics be furnish by I : the experiment be not finish at the end of the year -- the perturbation of uranus be now attract attention i have have some correspondence on this subject with dr hussey in 1834 and in 1837 with eugne bouvard on feb 24th of 1838 i write to schumacher regard the error in the tabular radius-vector of uranus which my mode of reduce the observation enable I to see the national standard of length and weight have be destroy in the fire of the house of parliament on may 11th i receive a letter from mr spring rice request I to act -lrb- as chairman -rrb- with a committee consist of f baily je drinkwater bethune davy gilbert jg lefevre jw lubbock g peacock and r sheepshank to report on the step now to be take i accept the charge and the first meeting be hold at the observatory on may 22nd all subsequent meeting in london usually in the apartment of the royal astronomical society i act both as chairman and as work secretary we enquiry go into a very wide field and i have much correspondence on jan 4th mr wood write to I mention that capt johnson have make some observation on the magnetism of iron ship and ask whether they ought to be continue a steamer be offer at _ # 50 _ per week i apply to beaufort for a copy of johnson 's observation and on jan 7th reply very fully discourage such observation but recommend a train of observation expressly direct to theoretical point on feb 17th i report that i have examine the deptford basin and find that it would do fairly well for experiment on July 14th 1838 capt beaufort write to I that the admiralty wish for experiment on the ship the ` rainbow ' then in the river and enquire whether i would undertake they and what assistance i desire as for instance that of christie or barlow i reply that one person should undertake it either christie barlow or myself and that a basin be desirable on July 16th and 17th i look at the basin of woolwich and deptford approve the latter on July 21st the admiralty give I full power from July 23rd i be almost entirely employ on preparation the course of operation be describe in my print paper : the original map curve and graphical projection be in the bind mss : ` correction of compass in iron ship -- rainbow ' at the greenwich observatory the angular disturbance be find on July 26th and 30th require some further work on a raft so that they be finally work out on aug 11th i struggle hard with the number but should not have succeed if it have not occur to I to examine the horizontal magnetic intensity this be do on aug 14th and the explanation of the whole be suggest at once : graphical projection be make on aug 16th and 17th for comparison of my explanation with observation and the business be complete on aug 17th and 18th i measure the intensity of some magnet to be use in the ship for correction it be to be remark that besides the effect of polar magnetism there be no doubt of the existence of a effect of induce magnetism require correction by other induce magnetism : and experiment for this be make in the magnetic observatory all be ready for trial : and on aug 20th i carry my magnet and iron corrector to deptford mount they in the proper place try the ship and the compass which have be disturb 50 degree to the right and 50 degree to the left be now sensibly correct on aug 21st i report this to the admiralty and on aug 24th i try the ship to gravesend on aug 30th i have the loan of she for a expedition with a party of friend to sheerness and on sept 9th i accompany she to gravesend on she first voyage to antwerp -- on oct 5th application be make to I by the owner of the ` ironside ' to correct she compass in consequence of this i go to liverpool on oct 25th and on this occasion make a very important improvement in the practical mode of perform the correction -- on nov 16th i report to the admiralty in considerable detail on dec 4th i have a interview with lord minto -lrb- first lord of the admiralty -rrb- and mr wood they refuse to sanction any reward to I -- the follow be a copy of the report of the captain of the ` rainbow ' after she voyage to antwerp : ` have have the command of the rainbow steamer the two voyage between london and antwerp i have the pleasure to inform you that i be perfectly satisfy as to the correctness of the compass and feel quite certain they will continue so i take particular notice from land to land from we departure and find the bearing by compass to be exact ' -- the follow extract from letter to he wife refer to the ironside : on oct 28th 1838 he write i work up the observation so much as to see that the compass disturbance be not so great as in the ` rainbow ' -lrb- 35  instead of 50  -rrb- but quite enough to make the vessel worthless and that it be quite different in direction from that in the ` rainbow ' -- so that if they have steal one of the ` rainbow ' corrector and put it into this ship it would have be much worse than before and on nov 1st he write on Wednesday i again go to the ship and try small alteration in the corrector : i be confident now that the thing be very near but we be most abominably baffle by the sluggishness of the compass the university of london : -- on jan 6th i attend a sub-committee meeting on the minimum of acquirement for ba degree and various meeting of the senate on July 14th i intimate to mr spring rice my wish to resign i have various correspondence especially with mr lubbock and on dec 13th i write to he on the necessity of stipend to member of senate the dissension on religious examination become very strong i take a middle course demand examination in the language and book but absolutely refuse to claim any religious assent i express this to dr jerrard the principal representative on the religious side by call on he to substitute the word ` recognition of christian literature ' for ` recognition of christian religion ' : i address a print letter to lord burlington -lrb- chancellor -rrb- and the member of the senate on this subject of private history : in January i make a short excursion in norfolk and suffolk and visit prof sedgwick at norwich in April i pay a short visit to mr courtney at sanderstead with my wife on June 14th my son hubert be bear in September i go with my sister by cambridge & c to luddington where i make much enquiry concern my father and the family of airy who have long be settle there we then visit various place in yorkshire and arrive at brampton near chesterfield where mr smith my wife 's mother now reside and return by rugby i have much correspondence with my brother and for he about private pupil and a better church living i complain to the bishop of norwich about the mutilation of a celebrated monument in playford church by the incumbent and curate the following extract be from letter to he wife relate to the above-mentioned journey : close norwich _ 1838 jan 21 _ i do not know what degree of cold you may have have last night but here it be -lrb- i believe -rrb- colder than before -- thermometer close to the house at 3  i have not suffer at all however i do not intend to go to lowestoft brampton _ 1838 sept 30th _ we begin to think that we have see enough of scarborough so we take a chaise in the afternoon to picker a small agricultural town and lodge in a comfortable inn there on Wednesday morning at 8 we start by the railroad for whitby in a huge carriage denominate the lady hilda capable of contain 40 person or more draw by one horse or in the steep part of the railway by two horse the road go through a set of defile of the eastern moorland of yorkshire which be extremely pretty : at first woody and rich then gradually poorer and at last opening on a black moor with higher moor in sight : descend in one part by a long crooked inclined plane the carriage draw up another load by its weight : through a little tunnel : and then along a valley to whitby the rate of travel be about 10 mile a hour betsy declare that it be the most agreeable travel that she ever have yesterday -lrb- Saturday -rrb- caroline drive betsy and miss barne drive I to clay cross to see the work at the great railroad tunnel there come from the north the railroad pass up the chesterfield valley close by the town and continue up the same valley till it be necessary for it to enter the valley which run the opposite way towards buttersley : the tunnel pass under the high ground between these two vally : so that it be in reality at the water-shed : it be to be i think more than a mile long and when finish 27 foot clear in height so it be a grand place we see the preparation for a blast and hear it fire : the lady stop they ear in due form 1839 cambridge observatory : -- on mar 7th i go to cambridge on the business of the northumberland telescope : i be subsequently engage on the account and on aug 16th i finally resign it to prof challi who accept it on aug 19th on sept 11th i communicate its completion and the settlement of account to the duke of northumberland the total expense be _ # 1938 9 2d _ + 15000 franc for the object-glass at greenwich observatory : -- on jan 3rd i receive the last revise of the 1837 observation and on jan 8th the first sheet for 1838 -- in July i report on selection from a long list of chronometer which have be on trial and on sept 2nd i point out to capt beaufort that the system of offer only one price would be ruinous to the manufacture of chronometer and to the character of those supply to the admiralty : and that i would undertake any trouble of classify the chronometer try this letter introduce the system still in use -lrb- 1871 -rrb- which have be most beneficial to the manufacture on sept 11th i propose that all trial begin in the first week of January : this also have be in use as a established system to the present time -- it be point out to I that a certain chronometer be affect by external magnetic power i remedy this by place under it a free compass magnet : a stand be specially prepare for it i have never find another chronometer sensibly affect by magnetism -- in November and December i try my new double-image micrometer -- between may 16th and oct 13th a fireproof room be construct in the southern part of the quadrant room and in November a small shed be erect over the entrance to the north terrace -- the position of the free meridional magnet -lrb- now mount in the magnetic observatory -rrb- be observe at every 5 m through 24 hour on feb 22nd and 23rd may 24th and 25th aug 30th and 31st and nov 29th and 30th this be do in cooperation with the system of the magnetic union establish by gauss in germany -- the reduction of the greenwich planetary and lunar observation 1750 to 1830 go on steadily i have six and sometimes seven computer constantly at work in the octagon room -- as in 1838 i have a great amount of correspondence with mr baily on the cavendish experiment -- i attend as regularly as i could to the business of the university of london the religious question do not rise very prominently i take a very active part and have a great deal of correspondence on the nature of the intended examination in hydrography and civil engineering -- on the standard commission the chief work be in external enquiry -- on June 6th i have enquiry from john quincey adam -lrb- usa -rrb- on the expense & c of observatory : a observatory be contemplate in america -- i have correspondence about the propose establishment of observatory at durham glasgow and liverpool i have in this year a great deal of troublesome and on the whole unpleasant correspondence with the admiralty about the correction of the compass in iron ship i naturally expect some acknowledgment of a important service render to navigation : but the admiralty peremptorily refuse it my account of the experiment & c for the royal society be date April 9th the general success of the undertaking soon become notorious and -lrb- as i understand -rrb- lead immediately to extensive building of iron ship : and it lead also to application to I for correction of compass on jan 9th i be address in reference to the royal sovereign and royal george at liverpool July 18th the orwell may 11th two russian ship build on the thame sept 4th the ship of the lancaster company i have much work in connection with the cape of good hope observatory chiefly relate to the instrumental equipment and to the geodetical work as it be consider advisable that any base measure in the cape colony should be measure with compensation bar i apply to major jervi for the loan of those belong to the east indian survey but he positively refuse to lend they on jan 20th i apply to col colby for the compensation bar of the british survey and he immediately assent to lend they col colby have suggest to the ordnance department that capt henderson and several sapper should be send to use the measure bar and it be so arrange it still appear desirable to have the command of some soldier from the garrison of cape town and this matter be soon arrange with the military authority by the admiralty the follow be the principal point of my private history : it be a very sad year on jan 24th i go with my wife to norwich on a visit to prof sedgwick and in June i visit sir j herschel at slough on June 13th my dear boy arthur be take ill : he malady soon prove to be scarlet fever of which he die on June 24th at 7 in the morning it be arrange that he should be bury in playford churchyard on the 28th and on that day i proceed to playford with my wife and my eldest son george richard at chelmsford my son be attack with slight sickness and be a little unwell do not attend he brother 's funeral on July 1st at 4h15m in the morning he also die : he have some time before suffer severely from a attack of measles and it seem probable that he brain have suffer on July 5th he be bury by the side of he brother arthur in playford churchyard -- on July 23rd i go to colchester on my way to walton-on-the-naze with my wife and all my family all my child have be touch though very lightly with the scarlet fever -- it be near the end of this year that my mother quit the house -lrb- luck 's -rrb- at playford and come to live with I at greenwich observatory where she live till she death have she own attendant and living in perfect confidence with my wife and myself and be i trust as happy as she year and widowhood permit my sister also live with I at the observatory 1840 in the latter part of 1839 and through 1840 i have much correspondence with the admiralty in which i obtain a complete account of the transfer of the observatory from the ordnance department to the admiralty and the transfer of the visitation of the observatory from the royal society to the present board of visitor in 1840 i find that the papers of the board of longitude be divide between the royal society and the admiralty : i obtain the consent of both to bring they to the observatory in this year i begin to arrange about a annual dinner to be hold at the visitation -- my double-image micrometer be much use for observation of circumpolar double star -- in magnetism and meteorology certain quarterly observation be keep up but in November the system of incessant eye-observation be commence i refuse to commence this until i have secure a ` watchman 's clock ' for mechanical verification of the regular attendance of the assistant -- with regard to chronometer : in this year for the first time i take the very important step of publish the rate obtain by comparison at the observatory i confine myself on this occasion to the chronometer purchase by the admiralty in march a pigeon-house be make for exposure of chronometer to cold -- the lunar and planetary reduction be go on steadily -- i be consult about a observatory at oxford where i support the introduction of the heliometer -- the stipend of the bakerian lecture be pay to I for my explanation of brewster 's new prismatic fringe -- the business of the cape observatory and survey occupy much of my time -- in 1838 the rev h j rise -lrb- editor of the encyclopedia metropolitana -rrb- have propose my write a paper on tide & c in oct 1840 i give he notice that i must connect tide with wave and in that way i will take up the subject much correspondence on tide & c with whewell and other follow with regard to the magnetical and meteorological establishment on June 18th mr lubbock report from the committee of physics of the royal society to the council in favor of a magnetic and meteorological observatory near london after correspondence with sheepshank lord northampton and herschel i write to the council on July 9th point out what the admiralty have do at greenwich and offer to cooperate in a letter to lord minto i state that my estimate be _ # 550 _ include _ # 100 _ to the first assistant : lubbock 's be _ # 3000 _ on aug 11th the treasury assent limit it to the duration of ross 's voyage on aug 17th wheatstone look at we building and be satisfied my estimate be send to the admiralty viz _ # 150 _ outfit _ # 520 _ annual expense and glaisher to be superintendent i believe this be allow for the present for the following year it be place on the estimate most of the contemplated observation be begin before the end of 1840 : as much as possible in conformity with the royal society 's plan mr hind -lrb- subsequently the superintendent of the nautical almanac -rrb- and mr paul be the first extra assistant of private history on feb 29th i go to cambridge with my paper on the go fusee on mar 27th i go to visit mr smith my wife 's mother at brampton near chesterfield i make a short visit to playford in April and a short expedition to winchester portsmouth & c in June from sept 5th to oct 3rd i be travel in the north of england and south of scotland -lrb- this be a extremely active and interesting journey in the course of which a great number of place be visit by airy especially place on the border mention in scott 's poem which always have a great attraction for he he also attend a meeting of the british association at glasgow and make a statement regard the planetary and lunar reduction : and look at a site for the glasgow observatory -rrb- in November i go for a short time to cambridge and to keysoe -lrb- my brother 's residence -rrb- on dec 26th my daughter hilda be bear -lrb- subsequently marry to ej routh -rrb- in this year i have a loss of _ # 350 _ by a fire on my eye estate \* \* \* \* \* the follow extract be from letter to he wife some of they relate to matter of general interest they be all of they characteristic and serve to shew the keen interest which he take in matter around he and especially in architecture and scenery the first letter relate to he journey from chesterfield on the previous day flamsteed house _ 1840 April 2 _ i be oblige to put up with a outside place to derby yesterday much against my will for i be apprehensive that the cold would bring on the pain in my face of that i have not much but i have catch something of sore throat and catarrh the coach come up at about 22 minute past 8 it arrive in derby at 20 minute or less past 11 -lrb- same guard and coachman who bring we -rrb- and draw up in the street opposite the inn at which we get no dinner abreast of a omnibus i have to go to a coach office opposite the inn to pay and be book for london and be duly set down in a way-bill with _ name _ and then enter the omnibus : be transfer to the railway station and then receive the railway ticket by shout out my name if you should come the same way you would find it convenient to book you place at chesterfield to london by you name -lrb- pay for the whole namely coach fare omnibus fare _ - \/ 6 _ and railway fare _ # 1 15s 0d _ first class -rrb- then you will only have to step out of the coach into the omnibus and to scream out once or twice to the guard to make sure that you be enter in the way-bill and that you luggage be put on the omnibus \* \* \* \* \* flamsteed house greenwich _ 1840 April 15 _ i forget to tell you that at lord northampton 's i see some specimen of the daguerrotype picture make by the camera obscura and they surpass in beauty of execution anything that i could have imagine baily who have two or three have promise to lend they for you inspection when you return also i see some post-office stamp and stamped envelope : i do not much admire the latter \* \* \* \* \* the follow relate to the fire on he eye farm refer to above : playford _ 1840 April 23 _ on Wednesday -lrb- yesterday -rrb- go with my uncle to the eye estate to see the effect of the fire the farming building of every kind be as completely clear away as if they have be mow down : not a bit of anything but one or two short brick wall and the brick foundation of the barn and stack the aspect of the place be much change because in approach the house you do not see it upon a back-ground of barn & c but standing alone the house be in particularly neat and good order i do not think it at all worth while to make troublesome enquiry of the people who reside there but take mr case 's account there seem no doubt that the fire be cause by the maid-servant throw cinder into a sort of muck-place into which they have be commonly throw i suppose there be after all this dry weather straw or muck drier than usual and the cinder be hotter than usual the whole be on fire in a exceedingly short time and everything be down in less than a hour two engine come from eye and all the population of the town -lrb- as the fire begin shortly after two o'clock in the afternoon -rrb- it be entirely owe to these that my house and the farm -lrb- sewell 's -rrb- on the opposite side of the road be not burn down at the beginning of the fire the wind be ne which blow directly towards the opposite farm -lrb- sewell 's -rrb- : although the nearest part of it -lrb- tiled dwelling house -rrb- be 100 yard off or near it and the great barn -lrb- thatched roof -rrb- considerably further yet both be set on fire several time all this while the tail of my house be grow very hot : and shortly after the building fall in burn ruin the wind change to nw blow directly to my house if this change have happen while the building be stand and burn there would have be no possibility of save the house as it be the solder be melt from the window next the farm-yard and the roof be set on fire in three or four place one engine be keep work on my house and one on the opposite farm a large pond be pretty nearly empty mr case 's horse and bullock be get out not without great difficulty as the progress of the fire be fearfully rapid a sow and nine pig be burnt and a large hog run out burnt so much that the people kill it immediately \* \* \* \* \* george inn winchester _ 1840 June 21 _ at winchester we establish ourselves at the george and then without delay proceed to st cross i do not know before the nature of its hospital establishment but i find that it be a veritable set of alms-house the church be a most curious specimen of the latest norman i never see one so well mark before -- norman ornament on pointed arch pilaster detach with cushion capital and various sign : and it be clearly a instance of that state of the style when people have be force by the difficulty and inelegancy of the round arch in groin to adopt pointed arch for groin but have not learn to use they for windowsthi morning after breakfast go to the cathedral -lrb- look by the way at a curious old cross in the street -rrb- i think that its inside be wholly norman and be most agreeably surprise by find the whole inside groin in every part with excellent late decorate or perpendicular work yet there be several sign about it which lead I to think that the whole inside have be norman and even that the pilaster now work up into the perpendicular be norman the transept be most massive old norman with side-aisle run round they end -lrb- which i never see before -rrb- the groining of the side aisle of the nave very effective from the strength of the cross rib the clerestory window of the quire very large the organ be on one side but the best thing about the quire be the wooden stall-work of early decorate very beautiful a superb lady chapel of early english \* \* \* \* \* portsmouth _ 1840 June 23 _ we leave winchester by evening train to the dolphin southampton and sleep there at nine in the morning we go by steamboat down the river to ryde in the isle of wight : we steamer be go on to portsmouth but we think it better to land at ryde and take a boat for ourselves we then sail out -lrb- rather a blow day -rrb- to the vessel attend col pasley 's operation and after a good deal of go from one boat to another -lrb- the sea be so rough that we boat could not be get up to the ship -rrb- and a good deal of wait we get on board the barge or lump in which col pasley be here we have the satisfaction of see the barrel of gunpowder lower -lrb- there be more than a ton of gunpowder -rrb- and see the diver go down to fix it dress in they diving helmet and supply with air from the great air-pump above when all be ready and the diver have ascend again the barge in which we be be warped away and by a galvanic battery in another barge -lrb- which we have see carry there and whose connection with the barrel we have see -rrb- upon signal give by sound of trumpet the gunpowder be fire the effect be most wonderful the firing follow the signal instantaneously we be at between 100 and 200 yard from the place -lrb- as i judge -rrb- and the effect be as follow as soon as the signal be give there be a report louder than a musket but not so loud as a small cannon and a severe shock be feel at we foot just as if we barge have strike on a rock almost immediately a very slight swell be perceive over the place of the explosion and the water look rather foamy : then in about a second it begin to rise and there be the most enormous outbreak of spray that you can conceive it rise in one column of 60 or 70 foot high and broad at the base resemble a stumpy sheaf with jagged mass of spray spread out at the side and seem to grow outwards till i almost fear that it be come to we it sink i suppose in separate part for it do not make any grand squash down and then there be see log of wood rise and a dense mass of black mud which spread gradually round till it occupy a very large space fish be stun by it : we boatman pick up some it be say by all present that this be the best explosion which have be see : it be truly wonderful then we sail to portsmouththe explosion be a thing worth go many mile to see there be many yacht and sailing boat out to see it -lrb- i count 26 before they be at the fullest -rrb- so that the scene be very gay \* \* \* \* \* here be some note on york cathedral after the fire : red lion hotel redcar _ 1840 sept 7 _ my first letter be close after service at york cathedral as soon as i have post it i walk sedately twice round the cathedral and then i find the sexton at the door who commiserate I of my former vain application and have the hope of lucre before he eye let I in i see the burnt part which look not melancholy but unfinished every bit of wood be carry away clean with scarcely a smoke-daub to mark where it have be : the building look as if the wall be just prepare for a roof but there be some deep dint in the pavement shewing where large mass have fall the lower part of some of the column -lrb- to the height of 8 or 10 foot -rrb- be much scale and crack the window be scarcely touch i also refresh my memory of the chapter-house which be most beautiful and which have much of its old gilding reasonably bright and some of its old paint quite conspicuous and i look again at the old crypt with its late norman work and at the still older crypt of the pre-existing church \* \* \* \* \* 1841 the routine work of the observatory in its several department be carry on steadily during this year -- the camera obscura be remove from the nw turret of the great room to make way for the anemometer -- in magnetism and meteorology the most important thing be the great magnetic storm of sept 29th which reveal a new class of magnetic phenomenon it be very well observe by mr glaisher and i immediately print and circulate a account of it -- in April i report that the planetary reduction be complete and furnish estimate for the printing -- in August i apply for 18000 copy of the great skeleton form for compute lunar tabular place which be grant -- i report as usual on various papers for the royal society and be still engage on the cavendish experiment -- in the university of london i attend the meeting of dec 8th on the reduction of examiner ' salary which be extravagant -- i furnished col colby with a plan of a new sector still use in the british survey -- i appeal to colby about the injury to the cistern on the great gable in cumberland by the pile raise for the survey signal -- on jan 3rd occur a most remarkable tidal disturbance : the tide in the thame be 5 foot too low i endeavor to trace it on the coast and have a vast amount of correspondence : but it elicit little of private history : i be a short time in suffolk in march -- on mar 31st i start with my wife -lrb- whose health have suffer much -rrb- for a trip to bath bristol cardiff swansea & c while at swansea we receive news on apr 24th of the deadly illness of my dear mother we travel by neath and cardiff to bath where i solicit a rest for my wife from my kind friend miss sutcliffe and return alone to greenwich my dear mother have die on the morning of the 24th the funeral take place at little whelnetham -lrb- near bury -rrb- on may 1st where my mother be bury by the side of my father we go to cambridge where my wife consult dr haviland to she great advantage and return to greenwich on may 7th -- on may 14th to 16th i be at sanderstead -lrb- rev j courtney -rrb- with whewell as one sponsor at the christening of my daughter hilda -- in September i go for a trip with my sister to yorkshire and cumberland in the course of which we visit dent -lrb- sedgwick 's birthplace -rrb- and pay visit to mr wordsworth miss southey and miss bristow return to greenwich on the 30th sept -- from June 15th to 19th i visit my brother at keysoe the follow extract be from letter write to he wife while on the above trip in yorkshire and cumberland : red lion inn redcar _ 1841 sept 11 _ we stop at york : go to the tavern hotel in the morning -lrb- Friday -rrb- go into the cathedral i think that it improve on acquaintance the nave be now almost fill with scaffolding for the repair of the roof so that it have not the bare unfinished appearance that it have when i be there last year the tower in which the fire begin seem to be a good deal repair : there be new mullion in its window & c we stop to hear part of the service which be not very effective \* \* \* \* \* here be note of he visit to dentdale in yorkshire the birthplace of he friend sedgwick : king 's head kendal _ 1841 sept 15 _ the day be quite fine and the hill quite clear the ascent out of hawe be dull the little branch dale be simple and monotonous and so be the hill about the great dale which be in sight the only thing which interested we be the sort of bird 's - eye view of hardraw dell which appear a most petty and insignificant opening in the great hill side but when we get to the top of the pass there be a magnificent view of ingleborough the dale which be most nearly in front of we be that which go down to ingleton past the side of ingleborough the mountain be about nine mile distant we turn to the right and immediately descend dent-dale the three dale -lrb- to hawe to ingleton and to dent -rrb- lay they head together in a most amicable way so that when at the top it be equally easy to descend down either of they we find very soon that dent-dale be much more beautiful than that by which we have ascend the side of the hill be steeper and perhaps higher : the bottom be richer the road be also better the river be a continued succession of very pretty fall almost all of which have scoop out the lower stratum of the rock so that the water shoot clear over for several mile -lrb- perhaps 10 -rrb- it run upon bare limestone without a particle of earth from the head of the dale to the village of dent be eight mile at about half-way be a new chapel very neat with a transept at its west end the village of dent be one of the strangest place that i ever see narrow street up and down with no possibility of two carriage bigger than child 's cart pass each other we stop at the head inn and enquire about the geolog : but he be not in the country we then call on he brother who be much surprised and pleased to see we he wife come in soon after -lrb- he daughter have go with a party to see some waterfall -rrb- and they urge we to stop and dine with they so we walk about and see every place about the house church and school connect with the history of the geolog : and then dine i promise that you should call there some time when we be in the north together and spend a day or two with they mr sedgwick say it be report that whewell will take sedbergh living -lrb- which be now vacant : trinity college be patron -rrb- then we have we chaise and go to sedbergh the very mouth of dent-dale be more contract than its higher part sedbergh be embosome among lump hill then we have another carriage to drive to kendal \* \* \* \* \* here be a recollection of wordsworth : salutation ambleside _ 1841 sept 19 _ we then get we dinner at lowwood and walk straight to ambleside change we shoe and walk on to rydal to catch wordsworth at tea miss wordsworth be be draw about in a chair just as she be seven year ago i do not recollect she appearance then so as to say whether she be much altered but i think not mr wordsworth be as full of good talk as ever and seem quite strong and well mr wordsworth look older they son william be at tea but he have come over only for the day or evening there be also a little girl who i think be mrs wordsworth 's niece 1842 in this year i commence a troublesome work the description of the northumberland telescope on sept 9th i write to the duke of northumberland suggest this send he a list of plate and submit a estimate of expense _ # 120 _ on sept 19th i receive the duke 's assent i apply to prof challi -lrb- at the cambridge observatory -rrb- request he to receive the draughtsman sly in he house which he kindly consent to do with regard to estimate i now begin to point out to the admiralty the inconvenience of furnish separate estimate viz to the admiralty for the astronomical establishment and to the treasury for the magnetical and meteorological establishment -- the great work of the lunar reduction proceed steadily : 14 computer be employ on they -- with regard to the magnetical and meteorological establishment : i suppose that jame ross 's expedition have return : and with this accord to the term of the original grant the magnetical and meteorological establishment expire there be much correspondence with the royal society and the treasury and ultimately sir r peel consent to the continuation of the establishment to the end of 1845 -- in this year begin my correspondence with mr mitchell about the cincinnatus observatory on aug 25 mr mitchell settle himself at greenwich and work for a long time in the computing room -- and in this year mr aiken of liverpool first write to I about the liverpool observatory and a great deal of correspondence follow : the plan be in fact entirely entrust to I -- July 7th be the day of the total eclipse of the sun which i observe with my wife at the superga near turin i write a account of my observation for the royal astronomical society -- on jan 10th i notify to mr goulburn that we report on the restoration of the standard be ready and on jan 12th i present it after this follow a great deal of correspondence principally concern the collection of authenticated copy of the old standard from all side -- in some discussion with capt shirreff then captain superintendent of the chatham dockyard i suggest that machinery might be make which would see ship-timber to they proper form and i send he some plan on nov 8th this be the beginning of a correspondence which last long but which lead to nothing as will appear hereafter -- on dec 15th be on a visit to dean peacock at ely i examine the drainage scoop wheel at prickwillow and make a report to he by letter which obtain circulation and be well know -- on may 26th the manuscript of my article ` tide and wave ' for the encyclopedia metropolitana be send to the printer i have extensive correspondence principally on local tide with whewell and other tide be observe for I by colby 's officer at southampton by myself at christchurch and poole at ipswich by ransome 's man and a great series of observation of irish tide be make on my plan under colby 's direction in June July and August -- on sept 15th mr goulburn chancellor of the exchequer ask my opinion on the utility of babbage 's calculate machine and the propriety of expend further sum of money on it i reply enter fully into the matter and give my opinion that it be worthless -- i be elect a honorary member of the institution of civil engineer london the reduction and printing of the astronomical observation have be get into arrear : the last revise of the 1840 observation go to press on may 18th 1842 on aug 18th come into operation a new organization of assistant ' hour of attendance & c require for bring up reduction i work hard myself and my example have good effect he reference to this subject in he report to the visitor be as follow : i have in one of the precede article allude to the backwardness of we reduction in those which follow it i trust that i have sufficiently explain it to say nothing of the loss from ill health of the service of most efficient assistant i be certain that the quantity of current work will amply explain any backwardness perhaps i may particularly mention that in the observation of 1840 there be a unusual quantity of equatoreal observation and the reduction attend these occupy a very great time but as regard myself there have be another cause the reduction of the ancient lunar and planetary observation the attention to chronometer construction the propose management of the printing of papers relate to important operation at the cape of good hope these and similar operation have take up much of my time i trust that i be do well in render greenwich even more distinctly than it have be heretofore the place of reference to all the world for the important observation and result of observation on which the system of the universe be found as regard myself i have be accustom in these matter to lay aside private consideration to consider that i be not a mere superintendent of current observation but a trustee for the honor of greenwich observatory generally and for its utility generally to the world nay to consider myself not as mere director of greenwich observatory but -lrb- however unworthy personally -rrb- as british astronomer require sometimes by my office to interfere -lrb- when no personal offence be give -rrb- in the concern of other establishment of the state if the board support I in this view there can be little doubt that the present delay of computation relate to current observation will be consider by they as a very small sacrifice to the important advantage that may be gain by proper attention to the observation of other time and other place of private history : in February i go for a week to playford and norwich visit prof sedgwick at the latter place on mar 1st my third daughter christabel be bear in march i pay a short visit to sir john herschel at hawkhurst from June 12th to aug 11th i be travel with my wife on the continent be partly occupy with the observation of the total eclipse of the sun on July 7th the journey be in switzerland and north italy in December i go to cambridge and ely visit dr peacock at the latter place from feb 23rd to 28th airy be engage on observation of tide at southampton christchurch poole and weymouth during this expedition he write frequently -lrb- as he always do -rrb- to he wife on the incident of he journey and the follow letter appear characteristic : king 's arm christchurch or xchurch _ 1842 feb 24 _ the lower of the above description of my present place of abode be the correct one as i fearlessly assert on the authority of diver direction-post on the road lead to it -lrb- by the bye this support my doctrine that x in latin be not pronounced ek but khi because the latter be the first letter of christ for which x be here traditionally put -rrb- find this morning that yolland -lrb- who call on I as soon as i have close the letter to you -rrb- be perfectly incline to go on with the tide observation at southampton and that he corporal of sapper be conduct they in the most exemplary manner i determine on start at once however we first go to look at the new dock -lrb- mud up to the knee -rrb- and truly it be a very great work there be to be enclose a good number of acre of water 22 foot deep : one dock lock in the other a tidal dock or basin with that depth at low water they be surround by brick wall eight foot thick at top 10 or more at bottom and all the part that ever can be expose be face with granite the people reckon that this work when finish will attract a good deal of the london commerce and i should not be surprise at it for it be very much easier for ship to get into southampton than into london and the railway carriage will make they almost one a very large steamer be lie in southampton water : the oriental which go to alexandria the lady mary wood a large steamer for lisbon and gibraltar be lie at the pier the say pier be a very pleasant place of promenade the water and bank be so pretty and there be so much liveliness of ship about it well i start in a gig in a swashing rain which continue off and on for a good while of the 21 mile i should think that 15 be across the new forest i do not much admire it as for norman william 's destruction of house and church to make it hunting ground that be utter nonsense which never could have be write by anybody that ever see it : but as to hunting except he horse wear something like mud-patten or snow-shoe it be difficult to conceive it almost the whole forest be like a great sponge water standing in every part in the part nearer to xchurch forest tree especially beech seem to grow well we stop to bait at lyndhurst a small place high up in the forest : a good view such as it be from the churchyard the hill of the isle of wight occasionally in sight on approach xchurch the chalk cliff of the west end of the isle of wight -lrb- lead to the needle -rrb- be partly visible and as the sun be shine on they they fairly blaze xchurch be a small place with a magnificent-looking church -lrb- with lofty clerestory double transept & c but with much irregularity -rrb- which i propose to visit to-morrow also a ruin which look like a abbey but the people call it a castle there be a good deal of low land about it and the part between the town and the sea remind I a good deal of the estuary above cardigan flat ill-looking bog -lrb- generally island -rrb- among the water i walk to the mouth of the river -lrb- more than two mile -rrb- pass a nice little place call sandford with a hotel and a lot of lodgings for summer sea-people at the entrance of the river be a coastguard station and this i find be the place to which i must go in the morning to observe the tide i have some talk with the coastguard people and they assure I that the tide be really double as report as i come away the great full moon be rise and i could read in she unusually broad face -lrb- indicate she nearness to the earth -rrb- that there will be a powerful tide i come in and have have dinner and tea and be now go to bed endeavor to negociate for a breakfast at six o'clock to-morrow morning it be rain cat and dog \* \* \* \* \* luce 's hotel weymouth _ 1842 feb 27 _ this morning when i get up i find that it be blow fresh from sw and the sea be burst over the wall of the eastern extremity of the esplanade very magnanimously so -lrb- the swell not be favourable for tide-observation -rrb- i give they up and determine to go to see the surf on the chesil bank i start with my great-coat on more for defense against the wind than against rain but in a short time it begin to rain and just when i be approach the bridge which connect the mainland with the point where the chesil bank end at portland -lrb- there be a arm of the sea behind the chesil bank -rrb- it rain and blow most dreadfully however i keep on and mount the bank and descend a little way towards the sea and there be the surf in all its glory i can not give you a idea of its majestic appearance it be evidently very high but that be not the most striking part of it for there be no such thing as go within a considerable distance of it -lrb- the occasional outbreak of the water advance so far -rrb- so that its magnitude could not be well see my impression be that the height of the surf be from 10 to 20 foot but the striking part be the cloud of solid spray which form immediately and which completely conceal all the other operation of the water they rise a good deal higher than the top of the surf so the state of thing be this a great swell be see come grow steeper and steeper then it all turn over and you see a face just like the picture of fall of niagara but in a little more than one second this be totally lose and there be nothing before you but a enormous impenetrable cloud of white spray in about another second there come from the bottom of this cloud the foam current of water up the bank and it return grate the pebble together till they jar penetrate the very brain i stand in the face of the wind and rain watch this a good while and should have stand longer but that i be so miserably wet it appear to I that the surf be higher farther along the bank but the air be so thicken by the rain and the spray that i could not tell when i return the bad weather abate i have now borrow somebody else 's trowser while mine be dry -lrb- have get little wet in other part thanks to my great-coat which successfully bring home a hundredweight of water -rrb- and do not intend to stir out again except perhaps to post this letter \* \* \* \* \* flamsteed house _ 1842 may 15 _ yesterday after post the letter for you i go per steamboat to hungerford i then find mr vignole and we trundle off together with another engineer name smith pick up stratford by the way to wormwood scrub there be a party to see the atmospheric railway in action : include -lrb- among other -rrb- sir john burgoyne whom i meet in ireland several year ago and mr pym the engineer of the dublin and kingstown railway whom i have see several time and who be very sanguine about this construction and mr clegg the proposer of the scheme -lrb- the man that invent gas in its present arrangement -rrb- and messr samuda two jew who be the owner of the experiment now go on and sir jame south with the latter hero and mechanician we do not come in contact unfortunately the stationary engine -lrb- for work the air-pump which draw the air out of the pipe and thus suck the carriage along -rrb- break down during the experiment but not till we have see the carriage have one right good run and to be sure it be very funny to see a carriage run all alone as if the devil drive it without any visible cause whatever the mechanical arrangement we be able to examine as well after the engine have break down as at any time and they be very simple and apparently very satisfactory and there be no doubt of the mechanical practicability of the thing even in place where locomotive can hardly be use : whether it will pay or not be doubtful i dare say that the commissioner ' report have take a very good line of discrimination \* \* \* \* \* 1843 in march i write to dr wynter -lrb- vice-chancellor -rrb- at oxford request permission to see bradley 's and bliss 's manuscript observation with the view of take a copy of they this be grant and the book of transit be subsequently copy under mr breen 's superintendence -- the follow paragraph be extract from the report to the visitor : ` in the report of last year i state that we reduction have drop considerably in arrear i have the satisfaction now of state that this arrear and very much more have be completely recover and that the reduction be now in as forward a state as at any time since my connection with the observatory ' in fact the observation of 1842 be send to press on mar 1st 1843 -- about this year the annual dinner at the visitation begin to be more important principally under the management of capt wh smyth rn -- in November i be enquire about a 8-inch object-glass i have already in mind the furnishing of we meridional instrument with greater optical power -- on July 14th the admiralty refer to I a memorial of mr jg ulrich a chronometer maker claim a reward for improvement in chronometer i take a great deal of trouble in the investigation of this matter by book witness & c and finally report on nov 4th that there be no ground for claim -- in April i receive the first application of the royal exchange committee for assistance in the construction of the clock : this lead to a great deal of correspondence especially with dent -- the lunar reduction be go on in full vigor -- i have much work in connection with the cape observatory : partly about a equatoreal require for the observatory but chiefly in get maclear 's work through the press -- in this year i begin to think seriously of determine the longitude of valencium in ireland as a most important basis for the scale of longitude in these latitudes by the transmission of chronometer and in August i go to valencium and examine the locality in September i submit a plan to the admiralty but it be defer -- the new commission for restore the standard be appoint on June 20th i be chairman the work of collect standard and arrange plan be go on mr baily attend to standard of length and prof wh miller to standard of weight we hold two meeting -- a small assistance be render to I by mr charle may -lrb- of the firm of ransome and may -rrb- which have contribute much to the good order of papers in the observatory mr robert ransome have remark my method of punch hole in the paper by a hand-punch the place of the hole be guide by hole in a piece of card and say that they could furnish I with something better accordingly on aug 28th mr may send I the punch machine the prototype of all now use in the observatory on sept 25th be make my proposal for a altazimuth instrument for make observation of the moon 's place more frequently and through part of she orbit where she could never be observe with meridional instrument the most important addition to the observatory since its foundation the board of visitor recommend it to the admiralty and the admiralty sanction the construction of the instrument and the building to contain it the follow passage be quote from the address of the astronomer royal to the board of visitor at the special meeting of nov 10th 1843 : the most important object in the institution and maintenance of the royal observatory have always be the observation of the moon in this term i include the determination of the place of fix star which be necessary for ascertain the instrumental error applicable to the instrumental observation of the moon these as regard the object of the institution be merely auxiliary : the history of the circumstance which lead the government of the day to supply the fund for the construction of the observatory shew that but for the demand of accurate lunar determination as aid to navigation the erection of a national observatory would never have be think of and this object have be steadily keep in view when other -lrb- necessary as fundamental auxiliary -rrb- be pass by thus during the latter part of bradley 's time and bliss 's time -lrb- which two period be the least efficient in the modern history of the observatory -rrb- and during the latter part of maskelyne 's presidency -lrb- when for year together there be scarcely a single observation of the declination of a star -rrb- the observation of the moon be keep up with the utmost regularity and the effect of this regularity as regard its peculiar object have be most honorable to the institution the exist theory and table of the moon be found entirely upon the greenwich observation the observatory of greenwich have be look to as that from which alone adequate observation can be expect and from which they will not be expect in vain : and it be not perhaps venture too much to predict that unless some gross dereliction of duty by the manager of the observatory should occur the lunar table will always be found on greenwich observation with this impression it have long be to I a matter of consideration whether means should not be take for render the series of observation of the moon more complete than it can be make by the means at present recognize in we observatory -- in illustration of the foregoing remark the original inscription still remain on the outside of the wall of the octagon room of the observatory may be quote it run thus : ` carolus ii 's rex optimus astronomiae et nauticae artis patronus maximus speculam hanc in utriusque commodum fecit anno d'nus mdclxxvi regnus sui xxviii curante iona moore milite rtsg ' the ashburton treaty have be settle with the united state for the boundary between canada and the state of maine and one of its condition be that a straight line about 65 mile in length should be draw through dense wood connect definite point it soon appear that this could scarcely be do except by astronomical operation lord canning under secretary of the foreign office request I to nominate two astronomer to undertake the work i strongly recommend that military officer should carry out the work and capt robinson and lieut pipon be detach for this service on mar 1st they take lodgings at greenwich and work at the observatory every day and night through the month my detailed astronomical instruction to they be draw out on mar 29th i prepare all the necessary skeleton form & c and look to they scientific equipment in every way the result will be give in 1844 of private history : in January i go to dover with my wife to see the blasting of a cliff there : we also visit sir j herschel at hawkhurst in April i be at playford on a visit to arthur biddell on apr 9th my daughter annot be bear from July 22nd to August 25th i be travel in the south of ireland chiefly to see valencium and consider the question of determine its longitude : during this journey i visit lord rosse at birr castle and return to weymouth where my family be stay at the time in October i visit cambridge and in December i be again at playford the journey to cambridge -lrb- oct 24th to 27th -rrb- be apparently in order to be present on the occasion of the queen 's visit there on the 25th : the follow letter relate to it be write to he wife : sedgwick 's room trinity college cambridge _ 1843 oct 26 Thursday _ i have this morning receive you letter : i have no time to write yesterday there be more thing to tell of than i can possibly remember the dean of ely yesterday be in a most ludicrous state of misery because he servant have send he portmanteau -lrb- contain he scarlet academical as well as everything else -rrb- to london and it go to watford before it be recover : but he get it in time to shew himself to-day yesterday morning i come early to breakfast with sedgwick then i walk about the street to look at the flag cambridge never have such a appearance before in look along trinity street or trumpington street there be arch and flag as close as they could stand and a cord stretch from king 's entrance to mr deck 's or the next house with flag on all its length : a flag on st mary 's and a huge royal standard ready to hoist on trinity gateway : laurel without end i apply at the registrar 's office for a ticket which be to admit I to trinity court the senate house & c and receive from peacock one for king 's chapel then there be a infinity of stand about and very much i be fatigue till i get some luncheon at blakesley 's room at 1 o'clock this be necessary because there be to be no dinner in hall on account of the address presentation the queen be expect at 2 and arrive about 10 minute after 2 when she drive up to trinity gate the vice-chancellor master and beadle go to meet she and the beadle lay down they stave which she desire they to take again then she come towards the lodge as far as the sundial where whewell as master take the college key -lrb- a bundle of rusty key tie together by a particularly greasy strap -rrb- from the bursar martin and hand they to the queen who return they then she drive round by the turret-corner of the court to the lodge door almost every member of the university be in the court and there be a great hurraing except when the ceremony be go forward presently the queen appear at a window and bow and be loudly cheer then notice be give that the queen and prince would receive the address of the university in trinity hall and a procession be form in which i have a good place as i claim rank with the professor a throne and canopy be erect at the top of the hall but the queen do not sit which be she own determination because if she have sit it would have be proper that everybody should back out before present the address to the prince : which operation would have suffocate at least 100 people the queen wear a blue gown and a brown shawl with a immense quantity of gold embroidery and a bonnet then it be know that the queen be go to service at king 's chapel at half past three : so everybody go there i see the queen walk up the antechapel and she look at nothing but the roof i be not able to see she in chapel or to see the throne erect for she with its back to the table which have give great offence to many people -lrb- i should have say that before the queen come i call on dr haviland also on scholefield also on the master of christ 's -rrb- after this she return to trinity and take into she head to look at the chapel the cloth lay on the pavement be not long enough and the undergraduate lay down they gown several of the undergraduate nobleman carry candle to illuminate newton 's statue after this the prince go by torchlight to the library then i suppose come dinner and then it be make know that at half-past nine the queen would receive some member of the university so i rig myself up and go to the leve at the lodge and be present in my turn by the vice-chancellor as ex-professor airy you majesty 's astronomer royal the queen and the prince stand together and a bow be make to and receive from each the prince recognize I and say i be glad to see you or something like that next to he stand goulburn and next lord lyndhurst who to my great surprise speak very civilly to I -lrb- as i will tell you afterwards -rrb- the queen have she head bare and a sort of french white gown and look very well she have the ribbon of the garter on she breast but like a ninny i forget to look whether she have the garter upon she arm the prince wear he garter i go to bed dead tired and get up with a headache -- about the degree to the prince and the other movement i will write again \* \* \* \* \* here be a note from cubitt relate to the blasting of the round down cliff at dover refer to above : great george street _ jan 20th 1843 _ my dear sir _ Thursday _ next the 26th at 12 be the time fix for the attempt to blow out the foot of the round down cliff near dover the galvanic apparatus have be repeatedly try in place -- that be by explode cartridge in the very chamber of the rock prepare for the powder -- with the battery at 1200 foot distance they be in full form and act admirably so that i see but little fear of failure on that head they have be rehearse the explosion on the plan i most strongly recommend that be -- to fire each chamber by a independent battery and circuit and to discharge the three battery simultaneously by signal or word of command which answer well and no mistake i shall write to sir john herschel to-day and remain my dear sir very truly yours w cubitt gb airy esq \* \* \* \* \* the follow extract be from letter to he wife write in ireland when on he journey to consider the determination of the longitude of valencium skibbereen _ 1843 July 28 _ by the bye to shew the quiet of ireland now i saw in a newspaper at cork this account at some place through which a repeal-association be to pass -lrb- i forget its name -rrb- the repealer of the place set up a triumphal arch the police pull it down and be pelt by the repealer and one of the policeman be much bruised o'connell have denounce this place as a disgrace to the cause of repeal and have move in the full meeting that the inhabitant of this place be strike off the repeal list with no exception but that of the parish priest who be prove to be absent and o'connell declare that he will not pass through this place now for my journey it be a sort of half-mountain country all the way with some bog to refresh my eye valencia hotel _ 1843 August 6 _ it seem that my come here have cause infinite alarm the common people do not know what to conjecture but have some notion that the sapper and miner be to build a bridge to admit the charge of cavalry into the island a attendant of mr fitzgerald express how strange it be that a man look so mild and gentle could meditate such thing but never fear maam those that look so mild be always the worst : then she narrate how that she husband be build some stable but that she be demand of he pat you broth of a boy what be the use of you building stable when these people be come to destroy everything i suspect that the people who see I walk up through the storm yesterday must have think I the prince of the power of the air at least hibernian hotel tralee _ 1843 August 7 _ i sail from valencium to cahersiveen town in a sail-boat up the water -lrb- not cross at the ferry -rrb- i have accommodate my time to the wish of the boatman who desire to be there in time for prayer : so that i have a long wait at cahersiveen for the mail car in walk through the little town i pass the chapel -lrb- a convent chapel -rrb- to which the people be go : and really the scene be very curious the chapel appear to be overflow full and the court in front of it be full of people some sit on the ground some kneel and some prostrate there be also people in the street kneel with they face towards the gate pillar & c it seem to I that the priest and the chapel be of less use here than even in the continental church and i do not see why both party should not have stop at home when the chapel break up it seem as if the street be cram with people the turnout that even a small village in ireland produce be perfectly amazing 1844 in the course of 1843 i have put in hand the engraving of the drawing of the northumberland telescope at cambridge observatory and write the description for letterpress in the course of 1844 the work be complete and the book be bind and distribute the building to receive the altazimuth instrument be erect in the course of the year during the construction a foreman fall into the foundation pit and break he leg of which accident he die this be the only accident that i have know at the observatory -- the electrometer mast and slide frame be erect near the magnetic observatory -- the six-year catalogue of 1439 star be finish this work have be in progress during the last few year -- in may i go to woolwich to correct the compass of the ` dover ' a small iron steamer carry mail between dover and ostend : this i believe be the first iron ship possess by the admiralty -- the lunar reduction be make good progress 16 computer be employ upon they i make application for print they and the require sum -lrb- _ # 1000 _ -rrb- be grant by the treasury -- in this year commence that remarkable movement which lead to the discovery of neptune on feb 13th prof challi introduce mr adam to I by letter on feb 15th i send my observe place of uranus which be want on June 19th i also send place to mr e bouvard -- as regard the national standard mr baily -lrb- who undertake the comparison relate to standard of length -rrb- die soon and mr sheepshank then undertake the work -- i attend the meeting of the british association hold at york -lrb- principally in compliment to the president dr peacock -rrb- and give a oral account of my work on irish tide -- at the oxford commemoration in June the honorary degree of dcl be confer on m struve and on I and then a demand be make on each of we for _ # 6 6 _ for fee we be much disgusted and refuse to pay it and i write angrily to dr wynter the vice-chancellor the fee be ultimately pay out of the university chest in this year the longitude of altona be determine by m struve for the russian government for this purpose it be essential that facility should be give for landing chronometer at greenwich but the consent of the customhouse authority have first to be obtain and this require a good deal of negotiation ultimately the determination be complete in the most satisfactory manner the chronometer forty-two in number cross the german sea sixteen time the transit observer be twice interchange in order to eliminate not only they personal equation but also the gradual change of personal equation on sept 30th otto struve formally write he thanks for assistance render for the determination of the longitude of valencium which be carry out in this year various method be discuss but the plan of send chronometer by mail conveyance be finally approve from london to liverpool the chronometer be convey by the railway from liverpool to kingstown by steamer from dublin to tralee by the mail coach from tralee to cahersiveen by car from cahersiveen to knightstown by boat and from knightstown to the station on the hill the box be carry like a sedan-chair there be numerous other arrangement and all succeed perfectly without a failure of any kind thirty pocket chronometer traverse the line between greenwich and kingstown about twenty-two time and that between kingstown and valencium twenty time the chronometrical longitude of liverpool observatory kingstown station and valencium station be 12m 005 24m 3117 41m 2325 the geodetic longitude compute from element which i publish long ago in the encyclopedia metropolitana be 12m 034 24m 3147 41m 2306 it appear from this that the element to which i have allude represent the form of the earth here as nearly as be possible on the whole i think it probable that this be the best arc of parallel that have ever be measure with regard to the maine boundary : on may 7th col estcourt the british commissioner write to I describe the perfect success of follow out my plan : the line of 64 mile be cut by direction lay out at the two end and the cutting meet within 341 foot the country through which this line be to pass be describe as surpassing in its difficulty the conception of any european it consist of impervious forest steep ravine and dismal swamp a survey for the line be impossible and a tentative process would have break the spirit of the best man i therefore arrange a plan of operation found on a determination of the absolute latitudes and the difference of longitude of the two extremity the difference of longitude be determine by the transfer of chronometer by the very circuitous route from one extremity to the other and it be necessary to divide the whole arc into four part and to add a small part by measure and bearing when this be finish the azimuth of the line for the two end be compute and mark be lay off for start with the line from both end one party after cut more than forty-two mile through the wood be agreeably surprise on the brow of a hill at see directly before they a gap in the wood on the next line of hill it open gradually and prove to be the line of the opposite party on continue the line till they pass abreast of each other they distance be find to be 341 foot to form a estimate of the magnitude of this error it be to be observe that it imply a error of only a quarter of a second of time in the difference of longitude and that it be only one-third -lrb- or nearly so -rrb- of the error which would have be commit if the spheroidal form of the earth have be neglect i must point out the extraordinary merit of the officer who effect this operation transit be observe and chronometer be interchange when the temperature be lower than 19  below zero : and when the native assistant though pay highly desert on account of the severity of the weather the british officer still continue the observation upon whose delicacy everything depend of private history : from July 3rd to aug 13th i be in ireland with my wife this be partly a business journey in connection with the determination of the longitude of valencium on jan 4th i ask lord lyndhurst -lrb- lord chancellor -rrb- to present my brother to the living of helmingham which he decline to do : but on dec 12th he offer binbrooke which i accept for my brother 1845 a map of the building and grounds of the observatory be commence in 1844 and be still in progress -- on mar 19th i be employ on a matter which have for some time occupied my thought viz the re-arrangement of current manuscript i have prepare a sloping box -lrb- still in use -rrb- to hold 24 portfolio : and at this time i arrange papers a and go on with b c & c very little change have be make in these -- in reference to the time give to the weekly report on meteorology to the registrar general the report to the board of visitor contain the follow paragraph : ` the devotion of some of my assistant ' time and labor to the preparation of the meteorological report attach to the weekly report of the registrar general be in my opinion justify by the bearing of the meteorological fact upon the medical fact and by the attention which i understand that report to have excite ' -- on dec 13th the sleep of astronomy be break by the announcement that a new planet astraea be discover by mr hencke i immediately circulate notice -- but in this year begin a more remarkable planetary discussion on sept 22nd challi write to I to say that mr adam would leave with I he result on the explanation of the irregularity of uranus by the action of a exterior planet in October adam call in my absence on nov 5th i write to he enquire whether he theory explain the irregularity of radius-vector -lrb- as well as that of longitude -rrb- i wait for a answer but receive none -lrb- see the papers print in the royal astronomical society 's memoirs and monthly notice -rrb- -- in the royal society the royal medal be award to I for my paper on the irish tide -- in the royal astronomical society i be president and with a speech deliver the medal to capt smyth for the bedford catalogue of double star -- on jan 21st i be appoint -lrb- with schumacher -rrb- one of the referee for the king of denmark 's comet medal : i have the king 's warrant under he sign manual -- the tidal harbor commission commence on apr 5th : on July 21st my report on wexford harbor -lrb- in which i think i introduce important principle -rrb- be communicate one report be make this year to the government -- in the matter of saw mill -lrb- which have begin in 1842 -rrb- i have prepare a second set of plan in 1844 and in this year mr nasmyth make a very favourable report on my plan a machinist of the chatham dock yard sylvester be set to work -lrb- but not under my immediate command -rrb- to make a model : and this produce so much delay as ultimately to ruin the design -- on jan 1st i be engage on my paper ` on the flexure of a uniform bar support by equal pressure at equidistant point ' -lrb- this be probably in connection with the support of standard of length for the commission ed -rrb- -- in June i attend the meeting of the british association at cambridge and on the 20th i give a lecture on magnetism in the senate house the follow quotation relate to this lecture be take from a letter by whewell to he wife -lrb- see life of william whewell by mr stair dougla -rrb- : i do not go to the senate house yesterday evening airy be the performer and appear to have outdo himself in he art of give clearness and simplicity to the hardest and most complex subject he keep the attention of he audience quite enchain for above two hour talk about terrestrial magnetism -- on nov 29th i give evidence before a committee of the house of common on dover harbor pier with respect to the magnetical and meteorological establishment the transaction in this year be most important it have be understand that the government establishment have be sanction twice for three-year period of which the second would expire at the end of 1845 : and it be a question with the scientific public whether they should be continue my own opinion be in favor of stop the observation and carefully discuss they and i be convince that this would have be best except for the subsequent introduction of self-registering system in which i have so large a share there be much discussion and correspondence and on June 7th the board of visitor resolve that ` in the opinion of the visitor it be of the utmost importance that these observation should continue to be make on the most extensive scale which the interest of those science may require ' the meeting of the british association be hold at cambridge in June : and one of the most important matter there be the congress of magnetic philosopher many of they foreigner it be resolve that the magnetic observatory at greenwich be continue permanently at this meeting i propose a resolution which have prove to be exceedingly important i have remark the distress which the continuous two-hourly observation through the night produce to my assistant and determine if possible to remove it i therefore propose ` that it be highly desirable to encourage by specific pecuniary reward the improvement of self-recording magnetical and meteorological apparatus : and that the president of the british association and the president of the royal society be request to solicit the favourable consideration of she majesty 's government to this subject ' which be adopt in October the admiralty express they willingness to grant a reward up to _ # 500 _ mr charle brooke have write to I propose a plan on sept 23rd and he send I he first register on nov 24th on nov 1st the treasury inform the admiralty that the magnetic observatory will be continue for a further period the railway gauge commission in this year be a important employment the railway which have begin with the manchester and liverpool railway -lrb- follow by the london and birmingham -rrb- have advance over the country with some variation in they breadth of gauge the gauge of the colchester railway have be alter to suit that of the cambridge railway and finally there remain but two gauge : the broad gauge -lrb- principally in the system ally with the great western railway -rrb- and the narrow gauge -lrb- through the rest of england -rrb- these come in contact at gloucester and be likely to come in contact at many other point -- to the enormous inconvenience of the public the government determine to interfere begin with a commission on July 3rd mr laing -lrb- then on the board of trade -rrb- ride to greenwich bear a letter of introduction from sir john lefevre and a request from lord dalhousie -lrb- president of the board of trade -rrb- that i would act as second of a royal commission -lrb- col sir frederick smith airy prof barlow -rrb- i assent to this : and very soon begin a vigorous course of business on July 23rd and 24th i go with prof barlow and we secretary to bristol gloucester and birmingham : on dec 17th i go on railway experiment to didcot : and on dec 29th to jan 2nd i go to york with prof barlow and george arthur biddell for railway experiment on nov 21st i finish a draft report of the railway gauge commission which serve in great measure as a basis for that adopt next year of private history : i write to lord lyndhurst on feb 20th request a exchange of the live to which he have present my brother in dec 1844 for that of swineshead : to which he consent -- on jan 29th i go with my wife on a visit to my uncle george biddell at bradfield st george near bury -- on June 9th i go into the mining district of cornwall with george arthur biddell -- from aug 25th to sept 26th i be travel in france with my sister and my wife 's sister georgiana smith i be well introduce and the journey be interesting -- on oct 29th my son osmund be bear -- mr f baily bequeath to I _ # 500 _ which realize _ # 450 _ here be some extract from letter write to he wife relate to the visit to the cornish mine & c -- pearce 's hotel falmouth _ 1845 June 12th Thursday _ then we walk to the unite mine in gwennap the day be very fine and now it be perfectly broiling : and the hill here be long and steep at the unite mine we find the captain and he invite we to join in a rough dinner to which he and the other captain be go to sit down then we examine one of the great pump engine which be consider the best in the country : and some other engine between 3 and 4 there be to be a set out of some work to the man by a sort of dutch auction -lrb- the usual way of set out the work here -rrb- : some refuse ore be to be break up and make marketable and the subject of competition be for how little in the pound on the gross produce the man would work they up while we be here a man be bring up who be hurt in blast : a piece of rock have fall on he at this mine besides the ladder way they have bucket slide in guide by which the man be bring up : and they be just prepare for work another apparatus which they say be try successfully at another mine -lrb- tresavean -rrb- : there be two wooden rod _ a _ and _ b _ reach from the top to the bottom move by crank from the same wheel so that one go up when the other go down and vice vers : each of these rod have small stage at such a distance that when the rod _ a _ be down and the rod _ b _ be up the first stage of _ a _ be level with the first stage of _ b _ : but when the rod _ a _ be up and the rod _ b _ be down the second stage of _ a _ be level with the first stage of _ b _ : so a man who want to descend step on the first stage of _ a _ and wait till it go down : then he step sideways on the first stage of _ b _ and wait till it go down : then he step sideways to the second stage of _ a _ and wait till it go down and so on : or if a man be come up he do just the same while we be here mr r taylor come we walk home -lrb- a long step perhaps seven mile -rrb- in a very hot sun go to tea to mr alfr fox who have a house in a beautiful position look to the outside of falmouth harbor \* \* \* \* \* penzance _ 1845 June 14 Saturday _ yesterday morning we breakfast early at falmouth and before 9 start towards gwennap i have ascertain on Thursday that john william -lrb- the senior of a very wealthy and influential family in this country -rrb- be probably return from london so we drive first to he house burntcoose or barncoose and find he and he wife at home -lrb- they be quaker the rest of the family be not -rrb- sedgwick and whewell and i or some of we party include I have sleep once at they house they receive george and I most cordially and press we to come and dine with they after we visit to tresavean mine of which intention i speak in my last letter : so i name 4 o'clock as hour for dinner after a little stay we drive to tresavean where i find the captain of the mine prepare to send a underground captain and a pit-man to descend with we so we change we clothes and descend by the ladder in the pumpshaft pretty work to descend with the huge pump-rod -lrb- garnish with large iron bolt -rrb- work violently make stroke of 12 foot close to we elbow and with a nearly bottomless pit at the foot of every ladder where we have to turn round the foot of the ladder walk on only a narrow board however we get down to the bottom of the mine with great safety and credit see all the mighty machinery on the way to a greater depth than i ever reach before namely 1900 foot from the bottom of the pump we go aside a short distance into the lowest workings where two man nearly naked be drive a level towards the lode or vein of ore here i feel a most intolerable heat : and upon move to get out of the place i have a dreadful feeling of feebleness and faint such as i never have in my life before the man urge I to climb the ladder to a level where the air be better but they might as well have urge I to lift up the rock i could do nothing but sit down and lean faint against the rock this arise entirely from the badness of the air after a time i feel a trifle better and then i climb one short ladder and sit down very faint again when i recover two man tie a rope round I and go up the ladder before I support a part of my weight and in this way i ascend four or five ladder -lrb- with long rest between -rrb- till we come to a level 260 fathom below the adit or nearly 300 fathom below the surface where there be a tolerable current of pretty good air here i speedily recover though i be a little weak for a short time afterwards george also feel the bad air a good deal but not so much as i he descend to some workings equally low in another place -lrb- towards which the party that i speak of be direct they work -rrb- but say that the air there be by no means so bad we all meet at the bottom of the man-engine 260 fathom below the adit we sit still a little while and i acquire sufficient strength and nerve so that i do not feel the slightest alarm in the operation of ascend by the man-engine this be the funniest operation that i ever see : it be the only absolute novelty that i have see since i be in the country before : it have be introduce 2-1\/2 year in tresavean and one day in the unite mine in my last letter i describe the principle in the actual use there be no other motion to be make by the person who be ascend or descend than that of step sideways each time -lrb- there be proper hand-hold -rrb- with no exertion at all except that of step exactly at the proper instant : and not the shadow of unpleasant feeling in the motion any woman may go with the most perfect comfort if she will but attend to the rule of step and forget that there be a open pit down to the very bottom of the mine in this way we be pump up to the surface and come up as cool as cucumber instead of be drench with perspiration in my description in last letter i forget to mention that between the stage on the move rod which i have there describe there be intermediate stage on the move rod -lrb- for which there be ample room inasmuch as the interval between the stage on each rod use by one person be 24 foot -rrb- and these intermediate stage be use by person _ descend _ : so that there be person _ ascend _ and person _ descend _ at the same time who never interfere with each other and never step on the same stage but merely see each other pass on the other rod -- it be a most valuable invention we then change we clothes and wash and drive to barncoose arrive in good time for the dinner i find myself much restore by some superb sauterne with water when we be propose to go on to camborne mr and mr william press we so affectionately to stop that we at length decide on stop for the night only bargaining for a early breakfast this morning this morning after breakfast we start for redruth and camborne the population between they have increase immensely since i be here before & c & c \* \* \* \* \* here be a letter write to he wife while he be engage on the business of the railway gauge commission it contain reminiscence of some people who make a great figure in the railway world at that time and be precede by a letter which be playfully address from the palace of king hudson york george inn york _ 1845 dec 30 _ i write yesterday from mr hudson 's in time for the late post and hope that my letter might be post by the servant to whom it be give we affair yesterday be simple : we reach euston station properly find watson there find a carriage reserve for we eat pork-pie at wolverton -lrb- not so good as formerly -rrb- dine at derby and arrive in york at 520 on the way watson inform I that the government have award we _ # 500 _ each sir f smith have talk over the matter with we and i lay it down as a principle that we consider the business as a important one and one of very great responsibility and that we wish either that the government should treat we handsomely or should consider we as servant of the state act gratuitously to which they assent i think the government have do very well mr hudson as i have say meet we on the platform and press we to dine with he -lrb- though i have dine twice -rrb- then we find the rival party quarrel and have to arrange between they this prevent I from write for the early post -lrb- i forget to mention that saunder the great western secretary ride with we all the way -rrb- at hudson 's we have really a very pleasant dinner : i sit between vernon harcourt and mr malcolm -lrb- he sister georgiana -rrb- and near to mr hudson this morning we be prepare at 9 at the station for some run brunel and other people have arrive in the night and we have be to darlington and back with a large party in we experimental train george arthur biddell ride on the engine as represent I but the side wind be so dreadfully heavy that as regard the want of the case this day be quite throw away we have since be to lunch with vernon harcourt -lrb- mr harcourt not at home -rrb- and then go with he to look at the cathedral the chapter-house which be a little injured have be pretty well restore : all other thing in good order the cathedral look smaller and lower than french cathedral now that we have come in the lord mayor of york have just call to invite we to dinner to-morrow -- i propose to george arthur biddell that he go to newcastle this evening in order to see glass work and other thing there to-morrow and to return when he can i think that i can persuade barlow to stop to see the experiment out and if so i shall endeavor to return as soon as possible the earliest day would be the day after to-morrow \* \* \* \* \* the follow extract be from a letter write to mr murray for insertion in he handbook of france relate to the breakwater at cherbourg which airy have visit during he journey in france in the autumn of this year royal observatory greenwich _ 1845 oct 8th _ my opinion on the construction i need not say ought not to be quote : but you be quite welcome to find any general statement on it or perhaps it may guide you in further enquiry to make it clear i must speak rather generally upon the subject there be three way in which a breakwater may be construct 1 by build a strong wall with perpendicular face from the bottom of the sea 2 by make a bank with nothing but slope towards the sea 3 by make a sloping bank to a certain height and then build a perpendicular wall upon it -- now if the 1st of these construction could be arrange i have no doubt that it would be the best of all because a sea do not _ break _ against a perpendicular face but recoil in a unbroken swell merely make a slow quiet push at the wall and not make a violent impact but practically it be nearly impossible the 2nd construction make the sea to break tremendously but if the sloping surface be make of square stone put together with reasonable care there be not the smallest tendency to unseat these stone this be the principle of construction of plymouth breakwater in the 3rd construction the slope make the sea to break tremendously and then it strike the perpendicular face with the force of a batter ram : and therefore in my opinion this be the worst construction of all a few face-stone may easily be dislodge and then the sea enter with this enormous force will speedily destroy the whole this be the form of the cherbourg digue from this you will gather that i have a full belief that plymouth breakwater will last very long and that the digue of cherbourg at least its upper wall will not last long the great bank will last a good while gradually suffer degradation but still protect the road pretty well i be assure by the officer reside on the digue that the sea which on breaking be throw vertically upward and then fall down upon the pavement do sometimes push the stone about which be lie there and which weigh three or four ton i see some preparation for the foundation of the fort at the eastern extremity of the digue one artificial stone of concrete measure 12 ' 9  6 ' 7  5 ' 7 and be estimate to weigh 25000 kilogramme chapter vi at greenwich observatory -- 1846 to 1856 1846 on nov 7th i propose a change in the form of estimate for the observatory the original astronomical part be provide by the admiralty and the new magnetical and meteorological part be provide by the treasury : and the whole estimate and account of the observatory never appear in one public paper i propose that the whole should be place on the navy estimate but the admiralty refuse i repeat this in subsequent year with no success meantime i always send to the admiralty a duplicate of my treasury estimate with the proper admiralty estimate -- stephenson 's railway through the lower part of the park in tunnel about 850 foot from the observatory be again bring forward on feb 20th it be put before I by the government and on march 9th i make experiment at kensal green specially on the effect of a tunnel : which i find to be considerable in suppress the tremor on may 6th i make my report generally favourable suppose the railway to be in tunnel on may 13th i with mr stephenson have a interview at the admiralty with lord ellenborough and sir george cockburn the earl appear willing to relax in he scruple about allow a railway through the park when sir george cockburn make a most solemn protest against it on the ground of danger to a institution of such importance as the observatory i have no doubt that this protest of sir george cockburn 's really determine the government on June 10th i be inform that the government refuse they consent after this the south eastern railway company adopt the line through tranquil vale -- in consequence of the defective state of paramatta observatory i have write to sir robert peel on April 16th raise the question of a general superintend board for colonial observatory : and on June 27th i see mr gladstone at the colonial office to enquire about the possibility of establish local board on June 29th a general plan be settle but it never come to anything -- forty volume of the observatory mss be bind -- a important beginning -- deep-sunk thermometer be prepare by prof forbe -- on June 22nd sir robert inglis procure a order of the house of common for print a paper of sir jame south 's ostensibly on the effect of a railway pass through greenwich park but really attack almost everything that i do in the observatory i reply to this on July 21st by a letter in the athenaeum address to sir robert inglis in term so strong and so well support that sir jame south be effectually silence the follow extract from a letter of airy 's to the earl of rosse dated dec 15th 1846 will shew how pronounce the quarrel between airy and south have become in consequence of the above-mentioned attack and previous difference : after the public exposure which he conduct in the last summer compel I to make i certainly can not meet he on equal term and desire not to meet he at all -lrb- ed -rrb- -- in the mag and meet department i be constantly engage with mr charle brooke in the preparation and mount of the self-registering instrument and the chemical arrangement for they use to the end of the year with mr ronald i be similarly engage : but i have the greatest difficulty in transact business with he from he unpractical habit -- the equipment of the liverpool observatory under I be still go on : i introduce the use of siemen 's chronometric governor for give horary motion to a equatoreal there i have since introduce the same principle in the chronograph barrel and the great equatoreal at greenwich : i consider it important -- on feb 13th i receive the astronomical society 's medal for the planetary reduction -- in the university of london : at this time seriously begin the discussion whether there should be a compulsory examination in matter bear on religious subject after this there be no peace -- for discovery of comet three medal be award by schumacher and I : one to peter two to de vico a comet be see by hind and by no other observer : after correspondence principally in 1848 the medal be refuse to he -- with respect to the railway gauge commission : on jan 1st in we experiment near york the engine run off the rail on jan 29th the commissioner sign the report and the business be conclude by the end of April we recommendation be that the narrow gauge should be carry throughout this be oppose most violently by partisan of the broad gauge and they have sufficient influence in parliament to prevent we recommendation from be carry into effect but the policy even of the great western railway -lrb- in which the broad gauge originate -rrb- have support we view : the narrow gauge have be gradually substitute for the broad : and the broad now -lrb- 1872 -rrb- scarcely exist -- on June 20th lord canning enquire of I about maker for the clock in the clock tower of westminster palace i suggest vulliamy dent whitehurst and make other suggestion : i have some correspondence with e b denison about clock -- i have much correspondence with stephenson about the tubular bridge over the menai strait stephenson afterwards speak of my assistance as have much support he in this anxious work : on dec 11th i be request to make a report and to charge a fee as a civil engineer but i decline to do so in January i go with george arthur biddell to portsmouth to examine lord dundonald 's rotary engine as mount in the ` janus ' and make a report on the same to the admiralty : and i make several subsequent report on the same matter the scheme be abandon in the course of next year the real cause of failure as i believe be in the bad mount in the ship the engrossing subject of this year be the discovery of neptune as i have say -lrb- 1845 -rrb- i obtain no answer from adam to a letter of enquiry beginning with June 26th of 1846 i have correspondence of a satisfactory character with le verrier who have take up the subject of the disturbance of uranus and arrive at conclusion not very different from those of adam i write from ely on July 9th to challi beg he as in possession of the largest telescope in england to sweep for the planet and suggest a plan i receive information of its recognition by galle when i be visit hansen at gotha for further official history see my communication to the royal astronomical society and for private history see the papers in the royal observatory i be abused most savagely both by english and french the report to the visitor contain a interesting account of the great lunar reduction from which the follow passage be extract : of the third section contain the comparison of observe place with tabular place three sheet be print from 1750 to 1756 this comparison it be to be observe do not contain a simple comparison of place but contain also the coefficient of the various change in the moon 's place depend on change in the element the process for the correction of the element by means of these comparison be now go on : and the extent of this work even after so much have be prepare almost exceed belief for the longitude ten column be add in group form in thirteen different way each different way have on the average about nine hundred group for the ecliptic polar distance five column be add in group form in seven different way each different way have on the average about nine hundred group thus it will appear that there be not fewer than 150000 addition of column of figure this part of the work be not only complete but be verify so that the book of comparison of observe and tabular place be as regard this work completely clear out the next step be to take the means of these group a process which be now in hand : it will be follow by the formation and solution of the equation on which the correction of the element depend the follow remark extract from the report to the visitor with respect to the instrumental equipment of the observatory embody the view of the astronomer royal at this time : the utmost change which i contemplate as likely to occur in many year in regard to we meridional instrument be the substitution of instrument of the same class carry telescope of larger aperture the only instrument which as i think may possibly be call for by the demand of the astronomer or the astronomical public be a telescope of the largest size for the observation of faint nebula and minute double star whether the addition of such a instrument to we apparatus would be a advantage be in my opinion not free from doubt the line of conduct for the observatory be sufficiently well trace there can be no doubt that we primary object ought to be the accurate determination of place of the fundamental star the sun the planet and above all the moon any addition whatever to we power or we instrumental luxury which should tend to withdraw we energy from these object would be a misfortune to the observatory of private history : in march i visit prof sedgwick at norwich -- on mar 28th the ` sir henry pottinger ' be launch from fairbairn 's yard on the isle of dog where i be throw down and dislocate my right thumb -- from apr 10th to 15th i be at playford -- on June 10th prof hansen arrive and stay with I to July 4th -- from July 6th to 10th i be visit dean peacock at ely -- from July 23rd to 29th i be at playford where for the first time i lodged in my own cottage i have buy it some time before and my sister have superintend alteration and the addition of a room i be much pleased thus to be connect with the happy scene of my youth -- from aug 10th to oct 11th i be with my wife and she sister elizabeth smith on the continent we stay for some time at wiesbaden as my nerve be shake by the work on the railway gauge commission and i want the wiesbaden water we visit various place in germany and make a 10-day ' excursion among the swiss mountain at gotha we lodge with prof hansen for three day and it be while stay here that i hear from prof encke -lrb- on sept 29th -rrb- that galle have discover the expect planet we visit gauss at gttingen and miss caroline herschel at hannover we have a very bad passage from hamburgh to london lasting five day : a crank-pin break and have to be repair : after four day we sea-sickness have go off during the gale -- a valuable discovery for I as i never afterwards fear sea-sickness -- on dec 22nd i attend the celebration of the 300th anniversary of trinity college \* \* \* \* \* the follow extract relate to the engine of the janus be take from letter to he wife date from portsmouth jan 6th and 7th 1846 : as soon as possible we repair to the dock yard and present ourselves to the admiral superintendant -- admiral hyde parker -lrb- not sir hyde parker -rrb- find that the janus have not arrive : the admiral superintendant -lrb- who do not spare a hard word -rrb- express himself curiously thereon but he have get the proper order from the admiralty relate to I : so he immediately send for mr taplin the superintendant of machinery : and we go off to see the small engine of lord d -- d 's construction which be work some pump and other machinery in the yard it be keep at work a little longer than usual for we to see it and i have no hesitation in say that it be work extremely well it have not be open in any way for half a year and not for repair or packing for a much longer time this morning we go to the dock yard and on enter the engine house there be shirreff and lord d -- d soon appear the janus have come to anchor at spithead late last night and have enter the harbor this morning blow weather on Saturday night we have the engine pretty well pull to piece and sit contemplate she a long time before this denison have come to we we then go on board the janus with shirreff but not with lord d -- d the engine be still hot and so they be turn backwards a little for my edification -lrb- this be convenient because the vessel be moor by she head she could thus strain backwards without do mischief -rrb- the vacuum not good then after a luncheon on board it be agree to run out a little way but the engine absolutely stick fast and would not stir a bit this i consider a perfect godsend so the paddle-wheel -lrb- at my desire -rrb- be lash fast and we be to see she open to-morrow morning this morning -lrb- jan 7th -rrb- we all go off to the janus where we expect to find the end of the cylinder -lrb- where we believe yesterday 's block to have take place -rrb- withdraw but it be not near it after a great many bolt be draw it be discover that one bolt could not be draw and in order to get room for work at it it be necessary to take off the end of the other cylinder and such a job three pulley hook be break in my sight and i believe some out of my sight however this auxiliary end be at last get off : and the people begin to act on the refractory bolt but by this time it be get dark and the man be leave the dockyard so i leave arrange that what they could do in preparation for I might be do in good time to-morrow morning 1847 on nov 13th i circulate a address propose to discontinue the use of the zenith tube because it have be find by a long course of comparative trial that the zenith tube be not more accurate than the mural circle the address state that ` this want of superior efficiency of the zenith tube -lrb- which consider in reference to the expectation that have be form of its accuracy must be estimate as a positive failure -rrb- be probably due to two circumstance one be the use of a plumb-line which appear to be affect with various ill-understood cause of unsteadiness the other be the insuperable difficulty of ventilate the room in which the instrument be mount ' -- on December 20th i circulate a address propose a transit circle with telescope of 8 inch aperture the address state as follow : ` the clear aperture of the object-glass of we transit instrument be very nearly 5 inch that of we mural circle be very nearly 4 inch ' -- i have be request by the master-general of ordnance -lrb- i think -rrb- to examine candidate for a mastership in woolwich academy and i be employ on it in February and march in conjunction with prof christie -- in January i apply to lord auckland for money-assistance to make a astronomical journey on the continent but he refuse -- on mar 19th sir jame south address to the admiralty a formal complaint against I for not observe with the astronomical instrument : on mar 31st i be triumphantly acquit by the admiralty -- in June i be request by the commissioner of railway to act as president of a commission on iron bridge -lrb- suggest by the fall of the bridge at chester -rrb- lord auckland object to it and i be not sorry to be spare the trouble of it -- in December i be request and undertake to prepare the astronomical part of the scientific manual for naval officer -- on sept 24th occur a very remarkable magnetic storm to which there have be nothing comparable before mr glaisher have it observe by eye extremely well and i print and circulate a paper concern it -- hansen stimulate by the lunar reduction discover two long inequality in the motion of the moon produce by the action of venus in the report to the visitor this matter be thus refer to : ` in the last summer i have the pleasure of visit prof hansen at gotha and i be so fortunate as to exhibit to he the correction of the element from these reduction and strongly to call he attention to they certainty the peculiarity of they fluctuation and the necessity of seek for some physical explanation i have much pleasure in indulge in the thought that it be mainly owe to this representation that prof hansen undertake that quest which have terminate in the discovery of he two new lunar inequality the most remarkable discovery i think in physical astronomy ' -- in discuss point relate to the discovery of neptune i make a unfortunate blunder in a paper hastily send to the athenaeum -lrb- feb 18th -rrb- i say that arago 's conduct have be indelicate i perceive instantly that i have use a wrong expression and by the very next post i send a altered expression this altered expression be not receive in time and the original expression be print to my great sorrow i could not then apologize but at what appear to be the first opportunity in December i do apologize and my apology be accept but i think that arago be never again so cordial as before -- on July 4th hebe be discover after this iris and flora now commence that train of discovery which have add more than 100 planet to the solar system -- on oct 8th be a annular

to give two medal after two day ' stormy discussion it be reject -- in the university of london : at a meeting in July where the religious question be discuss it be propose to receive some testimonial from affiliated body or to consider that or some other plan for introduce religious literature as the propriety of this be doubtful there be a general feeling for take legal advice : and it be set

-- with respect to the saw mill for ship timber : work be go on under the direction of sylvester to mar 18th it be i believe at that time that the fire occur in chatham dock yard which burn the whole of the saw-machinery i be tire of my machinery : and from the extend use of iron ship the probable value of it be much diminish and i make no effort to restore it of private history : in February i go

celebrate all over the world as the only clay which be fit to make pot for melting glass & c you know that in all these fiery region fire-clay be a thing of very great importance as no furnace will stand if make of any ordinary brick -lrb- and even with the fire-clay the small furnace be examine every week -rrb- but this stourbridge clay be as superior to fire-clay as fire-clay be to common brick-earth then we go to foster ' puddle and roll work near stourbridge these be on a very large scale : of course much that we see be a repetition of what we have see before but there be slit mill machine for roll the puddled bloom instead of hammer they & c and we have the satisfaction of handle the puddle iron ourselves then we go to another work of the foster not far from dudley where part of the work of the tube bridge for the menaus be go on the foster be i believe the largest iron master in the country and the two principal partner the elder mr foster and he nephew accompany we in all we inspection and stepping from one set of work to another the length of tube bridge which they have in hand here be only 120 foot about 1\/4 of the whole length : and at present they be only busy on the bottom part of it : but it be a prodigious thing i shall be anxious about it then we go to other work of the foster ' at king 's wynford where they have blast furnace : and here after see all other usual thing we see the furnace tap in this district the foster work the 10-yard coal in a way different from any body else : they work out the upper half of its thickness and then leave the ground to fall in : after a year or two this ground become so hard as to make a good safe roof and then they work away the other half : thus they avoid much of the danger and difficulty of work the thick bed all at once the ventilation of these mine scarcely ever require fire and then only what they call lamp those little fire-place which be use for give light at night -lrb- in the northumberland and durham pit they constantly have immense roar fire to make a draught -rrb- then we come home through dudley \* \* \* \* \* during he stay in russium there be a great desire manifest by the astronomer and scientific man of russium that he should be present to the emperor this would no doubt have take place have not the movement of the court and he own want of time prevent it the follow letter to the british ambassador lord bloomfield relate to this matter : pulkowa _ 1847 August 25th _ _ Wednesday evening _ my lord i have the honor yesterday to receive you lordship 's note of

court permit it -rrb- it would be agreeable to you lordship to present I to the emperor in explanation of this enquiry i beg leave to state that this be a honor to which personally i could not think of aspire my presence however at pulkowa at this time be in a official character as astronomer royal of england i have think it my duty to make myself perfectly acquaint with the observatory of pulkowa and this be the sole object of my journey to russia it be understand that the emperor take great interest in the reputation of the observatory and i be confident that the remark upon it which i be able to make would be agreeable to he i place these reason before you await entirely you lordship 's decision on the propriety of the step to which i have allude i be to leave st petersburg on

new instrument be under erection when the new transit be completely mount the old transit instrument may be remove and the transit room will be free for any other purpose i propose to take it as private room for the astronomer royal -- on may 12th i make my first proposal of the reflex zenith tube the principle of it be as follow : let the micrometer be place close to the object-glass the frame of the micrometer be firmly connect with the object-glass cell and a reflect eye-piece be use with no material tube pass over the object-glass : and let a basin of quicksilver be place below the object-glass but in no mechanical connection with it at a distance equal to half the focal length of the object-glass such a instrument would at least be free from all uncertainty of twist of plumb-line viscosity of water attachment of upper plumb-line microscope attachment of lower plumb-line microscope and the observation connect with they : and might be expect as a result of this extreme simplicity to give accurate result -- a considerable error be discover in the graduation of troughton 's circle amounting in one part to six seconds which be refer to as follow : ` this instance have strongly confirm I in a opinion which i have long hold -- that no independent division be comparable in general accuracy to engine-division -- where the fundamental division of the engine have be make by troughton 's method and where in any case the determination by the astronomer of error of a few division will suffice in consequence of the uniformity of law of error to give the error of the intermediate division ' -- the method of observe with the altazimuth be carefully describe and the effect of it in increase the number of observation of the moon be thus give for the thirteen lunation between 1847 may 15 and 1848 may 30 ` number of day of complete observation with the meridional instrument 111 number of day of complete observation with altitude and azimuth

\* \* \* \* the follow extract be from letter write to he wife while on he visit to lord rosse at parsonstown in ireland on the way he stop at bangor and look at the tubular bridge work which be thus refer to : stop at bangor settle _ pro tem _ at the castle and then walk past the suspension bridge towards the tube work which be about 1-1\/2 mile south-west of the suspension bridge the way be by a path through field near the water side : and from one or two point in this the appearance of the suspension bridge be most majestic the tube bridge consist of four span two over water and two over sloping land the part for the double tube over the water span -lrb- four length of tube -rrb- be build on a platform as at conway to be float by barge as there : the part over the sloping bank be to be build in they place on a immense scaffolding i suspect that in regard to these part stephenson be sacrifice a great deal of money to uniformity of plan : and that it would have be much cheaper to build out stone arch to the pier touch the water the tube work be evidently the grand promenade of the idler about bangor : i see many score of lady and gentleman walk that way with they basket of provision evidently go to gipsy in the field close by the castle parsonstown _ 1848 aug 29 _ after tea it be vote that the night be likely to be fine so we all turn out the night be uncertain : sometimes entirely cloud sometimes partially but object be pretty well see when the sky be clear : the latter part be much steadier from the interruption by cloud the slowness of find with and manage a large instrument -lrb- especially as they finding apparatus be not perfectly arrange -rrb- and the desire of look well at a object when we have get it we do not look at many object the principal be saturn and the annular nebula of lyra with the 3-feet saturn a remarkable cluster of star and a remarkable planetary nebula with the 6-feet with the large telescope the evidence of the quantity of light be prodigious and the light of a object be see in the field without any color or any spreading of stray light : and it be easy to see that the vision with a reflect telescope may be much more perfect than with a refractor with these large aperture the ring round the star be insensible the planetary nebula look a mass of living and intensely brilliant light : this be a object which i do not suppose can be see at all in we ordinary telescope the definition of the star near the zenith be extremely good : with a high power -lrb- as 800 -rrb- they be point or very nearly so -- indeed i believe quite so -- so that it be clear that the whole light from the great 6-feet mirror be collect into a space not bigger than the point of a needle but in other position of the telescope the definition be not good : and we must look to-day to see what be the cause of this fault it be not a fault in the telescope properly so-called but it be either a tilt of the mirror or a edge-pressure upon the mirror when the telescope point lower down which distort its figure or something of that kind so i could not see saturn at all well for which i be sorry as i could so well have compare he appearance with what i have see before i shall be very much pleased if we can make out what be the fault of adjustment and so correct it as to get good image everywhere it be evident that the figure of the mirror the polishing and the general arrangement be perfectly manage the castle parsonstown _ 1848 aug 30 _ yesterday we be employ entirely about the great telescope beginning rather late the principal object have relation to the fault of definition when the telescope be pointed low -lrb- which i have remark on the precede night -rrb- and be to make ourselves acquaint with the mechanism of the mirror 's mount generally and to measure in various way whether the mirror actually do shift its place when the telescope be set to different angle of elevation for the latter we find that the mirror actually do tilt 1\/4 of a inch when the tube point low this of itself will not account for the fault but it indicate that the lower part be hold fast in a way that may cause a strain which would produce the fault these operation and reasoning take a good deal of time lord rosse be dispose to make a alteration in the mount for the purpose of correct this possible strain the castle parsonstown _ 1848 aug 31 _ the weather here be still vexatious : but not absolutely repulsive yesterday morning lord rosse arrange a new method of suspend the great mirror so as to take its edgewise pressure in a manner that allow the springy support of its flat back to act this employ he workman all day so that the propose finish of polish the new mirror could not go on i take one camera lucida sketch of the instrument in the morning dodge the heavy shower as well as i could then as the afternoon be extremely fine i take another with my head almost roasted by the sun this last view be extremely pretty and characteristic embrace part of the mount not shewn well in the other and also shew the castle the observatory and the 3-feet telescope the night promise exceedingly well : but when we get actually to the telescope it begin to cloud and at length become hopeless however i see that the fault which i have remark on the two precede night be go there be now a slight exhibition of another fault to a much smaller extent we shall probably be look at the telescope to-day in reference to it the castle parsonstown _ 1848 sept 1 _ yesterday we make some alteration in the mount of the great mirror we find that sundry lever be loose which ought to be firm and we conjecture with great probability the cause of this for correction of which a change in other part be necessary the mirror be then find to preserve its position much more fixedly than before at night upon try the telescope we find it very faulty for star near the zenith where it have be free from fault before the screw which we have drive hard be then loosen and immediately it be make very good then we try with some lower object and it be good almost equally good there for saturn it be very greatly superior to what it have be before still it be not satisfactory to we and at this time a strong chain be in preparation to support the mirror edgeway instead of the post that there be at first or the iron hoop which we have on it yesterday nobody would have conceive that a edgewise gripe of such a mass of metal could derange its form in this way last night be the finest night we have have as regard cloud though perhaps not the best for definition of object the castle parsonstown _ 1848 sept 2 _ i can not learn that the fault in the mirror have be notice before but i fancy that the observation have be very much confine to the zenith and its neighborhood 1849 in July the new constant-service water-pipe to the observatory be lay from blackheath before this time the supply of water to the observatory have be make by a pipe lead up from the lower part of the park and be not constant -- in may the new staircase from my dwelling-house to the octagon room be commence -- in the report to the visitor there be a curious account of mr breen 's -lrb- one of the assistant -rrb- personal equation which be find to be different in quantity for observation of the moon and observation of the star -- the most important set of observation -lrb- of planet -rrb- be a series of measure of saturn in four direction at the time when he ring have disappear they appear completely to negative the idea that saturn 's form differ sensibly from a ellipsoid -- among the general remark of the report the follow appear : ` another change -lrb- in prospect -rrb- will depend on the use of galvanism and as a probable instance of the application of this agent i may mention that although no positive step have hitherto be take i fully expect in no long time to make the going of all the clock in the observatory depend on one original regulator the same means will probably be employ to increase the general utility of the observatory by the extensive dissemination throughout the kingdom of accurate time-signal move by a original clock at the royal observatory and i have already enter into correspondence with the authority of the south eastern railway -lrb- whose line of galvanic communication will shortly pass within nine furlong of the observatory -rrb- in reference to this subject ' -- i agree with schumacher in give no medal to mr g p bond he comet be find to be petersen 's five medal be award for comet in 1847 -lrb- hind collum mauvai brorsen schweizer -rrb- -- the liverpool observatory be finish this year : and the thanks of the town council be present to I -- respect fallow 's observation at the cape of good hope : i have receive the admiralty sanction for proceed with calculation in 1846 and i employ computer as be convenient on July 20th of this year i be ready with final result and begin to make enquiry about fallow 's personal history and the early history of the cape observatory on oct 23rd i apply for sanction for printing which be give and the work be soon finish off in the astronomical society 's memoirs -- in the month of march i have commence correspondence with various person on the imperfect state of publication of the british survey sheet of the map be issue by score but not one of they have a indication of latitude or longitude engrave i know that great pain have be take in give to the principal triangulation a degree of accuracy never before reach and in fix the astronomical latitudes of many station with unequalled precision finally i prepare for the council of the royal society a very strong representation on these subject which be adopt and present to the government it be entirely successful and the map be in future furnished with latitude and longitude line -- i be elect president of the royal astronomical society on feb 9th -- in June i go with sheepshank to see some of the operation of measure a base on salisbury plain the follow extract from a letter to he wife date 1849 June 27th relate to this expedition : ` in the morning we start before eight in a open carriage to the plain : look into old sarum on we way the base be measure on what i should think a most unfavourable line its north end -lrb- from which they have begin now in verification of the old measure -rrb- be the very highest point in the whole plain call beacon hill the soldier measure only 252 foot in a day so it will take they a good while to measure the whole seven mile while we be there col hall -lrb- colby 's successor -rrb- and yolland and cosset come ' of private history : i make short visit to playford in January April and July from July 28th to sept 12th i make a expedition with my wife to orkney and shetland -- from dec 24th to 26th i be at hawkhurst on a visit to sir john herschel 1850 the report to the board of visitor open with the follow paragraph : ` in record the proceedings at the royal observatory during the last year i have less of novelty to communicate to the visitor than in the report of several year past still i trust that the present report will not be uninteresting as exhibit i hope a steady and vigorous adherence to a general plan long since mature accompany with a reasonable watchfulness for the introduction of new instrument and new method when they may seem desirable ' -- since the introduction of the self-registering instrument a good many experiment have be make to obtain the most suitable light and the report state that ` no change whatever have be make in these instrument except by the introduction of the light of coal-gas charge with the vapor of coal-naptha for photographic self-registration both of the magnetic and of the meteorological instrument the chemical treatment of the paper be now so well understand by the assistant that a failure be almost unknown and generally speak the photograph be most beautiful and give conception of the continual disturbance in terrestrial magnetism which it would be impossible to acquire from eye-observation ' -- amongst the general remark of the report it be state that ` there be two point which have distinctly engage my attention the first of these be the introduction of the american method of observe transit by complete a galvanic circuit by means of a touch of the finger at the instant of appulse of the transit body to the wire of the instrument which circuit will then animate a magnet that will make a impression upon a move paper after careful consideration of this method i be incline to believe that in prof mitchell 's form it do possess the advantage which have be ascribe to it and that it may possess peculiar advantage in this observatory where the time-connection of transit make with two different instrument -lrb- the transit and the altazimuth -rrb- be of the highest importance the second point be the connection of the observatory with the galvanic telegraph of the south eastern railway and with other line of galvanic wire with which that telegraph communicate i have formerly in mind only the connection of this observatory with different part of the great british island : but i now think it possible that we communication may be extend far beyond its shore the promoter of the submarine telegraph be very confident of the practicability of complete a galvanic connection between england and france : and i now begin to think it more than possible that within a few year observation at pari and brussels may be register on the recording surface at greenwich and vice versa ' -- prof hansen be engage in form lunar table from he lunar theory but be stop for want of money on mar 7th i represent this privately to mr bare first lord of the admiralty and on mar 30th i write officially to the admiralty solicit _ # 150 _ with the prospect if necessary of make it _ # 200 _ on apr 10th the admiralty give they assent the existence of hansen 's lunar table be due to this grant -- the king of denmark 's medal for comet be discontinue owe to the difficulty produce by the hostility of prussium -- on aug 1st i give to the treasury my opinion on the first proposal for a large reflector in australium : it be not strongly favourable -- in August be -lrb- with my wife and otto struve -rrb- on a visit to lady breadalbane at taymouth castle i examine the mountain schehallien -- as in other year i report on several papers for the royal society and take part in various business for they -- in the royal astronomical society i have much official business as president -- in march i communicate to the athenaeum my view on the exodus of the israelite : this bring I into correspondence with miss corbaux robert stephenson capt vetch and prof jd forbe -- in December i go to the london custom house to see sir t freemantle -lrb- chairman of custom -rrb- and to see how far decimal subdivision be use in the custom house of private history : from mar 19th to 22nd i be on a expedition to folkestone dover dungeness & c -- from apr 3rd to 8th at playford and again for short period in June and July -- from aug 1st to sept 5th i be travel in scotland with my wife and otto struve -lrb- for part of the time -rrb- at edinburgh i attend the meeting of the british association and speak a little in section a i be nominate president for 1851 at ipswich we travel to cape wrath and return by inverness and the caledonian canal -- i be at playford for a short time in October and December 1851 in this year the great shed be build -lrb- first erect on the magnetic ground and about the year 1868 transfer to the south ground -rrb- -- the chronometer be take from the old chronometer room -lrb- a room on the upper story front the south now 1872 call library 2 -rrb- and be put in the room above the computing room -lrb- where they remain for 10 or 12 year i think -rrb- : it have a chronometer-oven with gas-heat erect in 1850 -- the following passage be quote from the report to the visitor : -- ` as regard meridional astronomy we equipment may now be consider complete as i have state above a improvement might yet be make in we transit circle nevertheless i do not hesitate to express my belief that no other exist meridional instrument can be compare with it this presumed excellence have not be obtain without much thought on my part and much anxiety on the part of the constructor of the instrument -lrb- messr ransome and may and mr simm -rrb- but it would be very unjust to omit the further statement that the expense of the construction have considerably exceed the original estimate and that this excess have be most liberally defray by the government ' -- in December sir john herschel give he opinion -lrb- to the admiralty i believe -rrb- in favor of procure for the cape observatory a transit circle similar to that at greenwich -- i have much correspondence about send pierce morton -lrb- formerly a pupil of mine at cambridge a clever gentlemanly man and a high wrangler but somewhat flighty -rrb- as magnetic assistant to the cape observatory : he be with I from may to October and arrive at the cape on nov 27th -- i be much engage with the clock with conical motion of pendulum for uniform movement of the chronographic barrel -- regard galvanic communication : on sept 19th i have prepare a draft of agreement with the south eastern railway company to which they agree in November i write to sir t bare -lrb- first lord of the admiralty -rrb- and to the admiralty for sanction which be give on dec 18th in December i have various communication about lay wire through the park & c & c and correspondence about the possibility of use sympathetic clock : in June apparently i have see shepherd 's sympathetic clock at the great exhibition and have see the system of sympathetic clock at pawson 's st paul 's churchyard -- in the last quarter of this year i be engage in a series of calculation of chronological eclipse on sept 30th mr bosanquet write to I about the eclipse of thale and i urge on the computation relate to it through mr breen in October the eclipse of agathocle -lrb- the critical eclipse for the motion of the moon 's node -rrb- be go on in October hansteen refer I to the darkness at stiklastad -- i go to sweden to observe the total eclipse of July 28th have receive assistance from the admiralty for the journey of myself mr dunkin mr humphrey and he friend and capt blackwood i have prepare a map of its track in which a important error of the _ berliner jahrbuch _ -lrb- arise from neglect of the earth 's oblateness -rrb- be correct i give a lecture at the royal institution in preparation for the eclipse and draw up suggestion for observation and i prepare a scheme of observation for greenwich but the weather be bad the official account of the observation of the eclipse with diagram and conclusion be give in full in a paper publish in the royal astr society 's memoirs -- this year i be president of the british association at the ipswich meeting : it necessarily produce a great deal of business i lecture one evening on the come eclipse prince albert be present as guest of sir william middleton : i be engage to meet he at dinner but when i find that the dinner day be one of the principal soire day i break off the engagement -- on may 26th i have the first letter from e hamilton -lrb- whom i have know at cambridge -rrb- regard the selection of professor for the university of sydney herschel maldon and h denison be name as my coadjutor plenty of work be do but it be not finish till 1852 -- in connection with the clock for westminster palace in February there be consideration about provide other clock for the various building and this probably be one reason for my examine shepherd 's clock at the great exhibition and at pawson 's in November i first propose that mr eb denison should be associate with I about the end of the year the plan of the tower be supply to I with reference to the suspension of the weight and other particulars -- in 1850 admiral dunda -lrb- mp for greenwich and one of the board of admiralty -rrb- have request I to aid the trustee of the dee navigation against a attack and on mar 19th 1851 i go to chester to see the state of the river on jan 1st 1852 i go to give evidence at the official enquiry -- at a discussion on the construction of the great exhibition building in the institution of civil engineer i express myself strongly on the faulty principle of its construction -- in this year i write my first paper on the landing of julius caesar in britain and be engage in investigation of the geography tide sand & c relate to the subject of private history : i be several time at playford during January and go there again on dec 23rd -- in this year a very heavy misfortune fall on we my daughter elizabeth have be on a visit to lady herschel at hawkhurst and on apr 2nd sir j herschel write to I say that she be so well in health she return a few day later and from she appearance i be sure that she be suffer under deadly disease after some time a able physician be consult who at once pronounce it to be pulmonary a sea voyage be think desirable and my wife take she to shetland where there be again a kind welcome from mr edmonston but this and the care take on she return avail nothing : and it be determine to take she to madeira my wife and daughter sail in the brig ` eclipse ' from southampton on dec 11th the termination come in 1852 -- on nov 23rd i go to bradfield near bury : my uncle george biddell die and i attend the funeral on nov 29th -- from July 18th to aug 24th i be in sweden for the observation of the eclipse and return through holland -- in October i be about a week at ventnor and torquay and from dec 7th to 11th at southampton on matter connect with my daughter 's illness the follow extract be from letter to he wife relate to the observation of the eclipse he interview with the king of sweden & c and he visit to the pump engine at haarlem : _ July 28 half-past 10 morning _ the weather be at present most perfectly doubtful nearly the whole sky be closely cover yet there be now and then a momentary gleam of sun the chance be greatly against much of the eclipse be see all be arrange to carry off the telescope & c at 11 : they can be cart to the foot of the hill and we have make out a walking-pass then to the top we be to dine with mr dickson afterwards _ July 28 10 at night _ well we have have a glorious day as soon as we start the weather begin to look better we go up the hill and plant my telescope and the sky shew a large proportion of blue at first i place the telescope on the highest rock but the wind blow almost a gale and shake it slightly : so i descend about 8 foot to one side -lrb- the power of do this be one of the element in my choice of this station which make I prefer it to the high hill beyond the river -rrb- the view of scenery be inexpressibly beautiful the beginning of eclipse be well see the sky gradually thicken from that time so that the sun be in whitish cloud at the totality and barely visible in dense cloud at the end of the eclipse the progress of the eclipse bring on the wonderful change that you know : just before the totality i see a large piece of blue sky become pitch black the horror of totality be very great and then flash into existence -lrb- i do not know how -rrb- a broad irregular corona with red flame _ instantly see _ of the most fantastic kind the darkness be such that my assistant have very great trouble in read he box chronometer -lrb- a free-hand explanatory diagram be here give -rrb- some important point be make out from this 1st the red flame certainly belong to the sun 2nd they certainly be in some instance detach 3rd they be sometimes quite crooked 4th they seem to be connect with spot the corona be brilliant white one star brilliant : i believe venus i have no time to make observation of polarization & c although prepared when the totality be more than half over i look to n and nw and in these region there be the fullest rosy day-break light after the sun-light reappear the black shadow go travel away to the se exactly like the thunder-storm from the main the day then grow worse and we come home here -lrb- after dinner -rrb- in pour rain stockholm _ 1851 aug 5 _ i then by appointment with sir edmund lyon go with he to the minister for foreign affair baron stjerneld who receive I most civilly my business be to thank he for the order which have be give to facilitate the landing of we telescope & c & c he be quite familiar with the name of my party humphrey milaud & c so that i trust they have be well receive -lrb- i have have no letter -rrb- he intimate i suppose at sir e lyon 's suggestion that perhaps king oscar might wish to see I but that it would not be on Tuesday so i reply that i be infinitely flattered and he say that he would send a message to sir e lyon by Tuesday evening now all this put I in a quandary : because i want to see upsalum 47 mile off : and the steamboat on the mlar only go in the morning and return in the morning : and this be irreconcileable with wait for he majesty 's appointment which might be for Wednesday morning so after consultation sir e lyon put I in the hand of a sort of courier attach to the embassy and he procure a calche and i post to upsalum yesterday afternoon -lrb- knock the people up at 11 at night -rrb- and post back this afternoon and sure enough a message have come that the king expect I at 11 to-morrow morning post of course be much dearer than steam-boat travel but it be cheap in comparison with england : two horse cost 1 for nearly 7 mile at upsalum there be a very good old cathedral i suppose the only one in sweden : and many thing about the university which interested I i send my card to professor fries and he entirely devoted himself to I : but imagine we conversation -- he speak in _ latin _ and i in french : however we understand each other very well it be on the whole a dreary country except where enliven by lake : some part be pine forest and birch forest but other be featureless ground with boulder stone like the worst part of the highland _ August 6 Wednesday 3 o'clock _ i rig myself in black trowser and white waistcoat and neckcloth this morning sir edmund lyon call baron wrede call on I : he have observe the eclipse at calmar and bring he draw much like mine he conduct I to the palace the minister for foreign affair come to I in the waiting-room i be introduce to the lieutenant-governor of christianstad who have have the charge of humphrey and milaud he have place a _ guard of soldier _ round they while they be observe they see the eclipse well captain blackwood go to helsingborg instead of bornholm and see well i be sorry to hear that it be cloudy at christianium mr dunkin 's station i hear some day ago that hind have lose he telescope but i now hear a very different story : that he land at ystad and find a very bad hotel there : that he learn from murray that the hotel at carlscrona -lrb- or wherever he mean to go -rrb- be much worse and so he grow faint at heart and turn back i be summon in to the king and present by the minister -lrb- stjerneld -rrb- and have a long conversation with he : on the eclipse the arc of meridian the language and the university we speak in french then baron wrede go with I to the rittershus -lrb- house of lord or noble -rrb- in session and to the gallery of scandinavian antiquity which be very remarkable : the collection of stone axis and chisel bronze do iron do ornament & c be quite amazing i be strike with see specimen from a very distant age of the maid of norway 's brooch : the use of which i explain to the director i dine and drive out with sir e lyon and call at the house of the baron stjerneld and of the norwegian minister baron du and have tea at the latter most of these people speak english well and they seem to live in a very domestic family style i should soon be quite at home here : for i perceive that my reception at court & c make people think that i be a very proper sort of person \* \* \* \* \* the extract concern he visit to the pumping-engine at haarlem be as follow : leyden _ 1851 August 20 Wednesday _ i go to see the great north holland canal and go a mile or two in a horse-drawn-boat upon it : a very comfortable conveyance see windmill use for saw timber and other purpose as well as some for grind and many for drain yesterday at half-past one i go by railway to haarlem i do not look at anything in the town except go through it and see that it be a curious fantastic place but i drive at once to the burgomaster to ask permission to visit one of the three great pump engine for drain the immense haarlem lake and then drive to it imagine a round tower with a steam-cylinder in its center and the piston which work up-and-down instead of work one great beam as they usually do work _ eight _ poke out on different side of the round tower and each drive a pump 6 foot in diameter i be glad to have see it then by railway here \* \* \* \* \* 1852 galvanic communication be now establish with lewisham station -lrb- thus give power of communicate with london deal & c -rrb- -- from the report to the board of visitor it appear that in the case of the transit circle the azimuth of the instrument as determine by opposite passage of the pole star have vary four seconds and in the case of the altazimuth there be a discordance in the azimuthal zero of the instrument as determine from observation of star in both case it be conclude that the discordance arise from small movement of the ground -- under the head of ` general remark ' in the report the follow paragraph occur : ` it will be perceive that the number of equatoreal observation make here at present be small : and that they be rarely direct to new comet and similar object which sometimes excite considerable interest this omission be intentional it be not because the instrumental means be want -lrb- for we equatoreal though not comparable to those of either cambridge or of pulkowa be fully equal to those usually direct to such object -rrb- but it be because these observation be most abundantly supply from other observatory public and private and because the gain to those observation from we take a part in they would probably be far less than the loss to the important class of observation which we can otherwise follow so well moreover i be unwilling to take any step which could be interpret as attempt to deprive the local and private observatory of honor which they have so nobly earn and finally in this act of abstinence i be desirous of give a example of adhesion to one principle which i be confident might be extensively follow with great advantage to astronomy : -- the principle of division of labor ' -- discovery of small planet be now not infrequent : but the only one of interest to I be melpomene for the follow reason on 1852 June 24 i lose my most dear amiable clever daughter elizabeth : she die at southampton two day after landing from madeira on that evening mr hind discover the planet and he request I to give a name i remembered horace 's ` praecipe lugubres cantus melpomene ' and cowley 's ' i call the buskin would muse melpomene and tell she what sad story i would write ' and suggest melpomene or pentho : melpomene be adopt -- the first move about the deal time ball be in a letter from commander baldock to the admiralty suggest that a time ball drop by galvanic current from greenwich should be attach to one of the south foreland lighthouse the admiralty send this for my report i go to the place and i suggest in reply -lrb- nov 15th -rrb- that a better place would be at a old signal station on the chalk downs the decisive change from this be make in 1853 -- as the result of my examination and enquiry into the subject of sympathetic clock i establish 8 sympathetic clock in the royal observatory one of which outside the entrance gate have a large dial with shepherd 's name as patentee exception be take to this by the solicitor of a mr bain who have busy himself about galvanic clock after much correspondence i agree to remove shepherd 's name till bain have legally establish he claim this however be never do : and in 1853 shepherd 's name be restore -- in nov 1851 denison have consent to join I in the preparation of the westminster clock in feb 1852 we begin to have little disagreement however on apr 6th i be go to madeira and request he to act with full power from I -- i communicate to the royal society my paper on the eclipse of agathocle thale and xerx -- in the british association i have preside at the ipswich meeting in 1851 and accord to custom i ought to attend at the 1852 meeting -lrb- hold at belfast -rrb- to resign my office but i be break in spirit by the death of my daughter and the thing generally be beyond my willing enterprise i request sir roderick murchison to act generally for I : which he do as i understand very gracefully -- in this year a proposal be make by the government for shift all the meeting room of the scientific society to kensington gore which be stoutly resist by all and be finally abandon of private history : i be at playford in January and go thence to chester on the enquiry about the tide of the dee and make excursion to halton castle and to holyhead -- from apr 8th to may 14th i be on the voyage to and from madeira and on a short visit to my wife and daughter there -- on June 23rd i go to southampton to meet my wife and daughter just land from madeira : on June 24th my dear daughter elizabeth die : she be bury at playford on June 29th -- i be at playford also in July and December -- from sept 16th to 24th i go to cumberland vi fleetwood and peel 1853 on may 3rd 1853 i issue a address to the individual member of the board of visitor propose the extension of the lunar reduction from 1830 from this it appear that ` through the whole period -lrb- from 1830 to 1853 -rrb- the place of the moon deduce from the observation be compare with the place compute in the nautical almanac : that be with burckhardt 's table which have be use for many year in compute the place of the nautical almanacvery lately however mr adam have shew that burckhardt 's parallax be erroneous in formulum and be numerically incorrect sometimes to the amount of seven seconds in consequence of this every reduction of the observation of the moon from 1830 to the present time be sensibly erroneous and the error be of such a nature that it be not easy in general to introduce its correction by any simple process the number of observation to the end of 1851 -lrb- after which time the parallax will be correct in the current reduction -rrb- be about 2560 a expense approach to _ # 400 _ might be incur in they reduction ' subsequently i make application to the admiralty and the _ # 400 _ be grant on dec 12th -- in the report to the visitor it be state that with regard to the transit circle change be under contemplation in its reflection-apparatus : one of these change relate to the material of the trough ` several year ago when i be at hamburgh my revered friend prof schumacher exhibit to I the pacifying effect of a copper dish whose surface have be previously amalgamate with quicksilverthe rev charle pritchard have lately give much attention to this curious property of the metal and have bring the practical operation of amalgamation to great perfection still it be not without difficulty on account of a singular crystallization of the amalgam ' -- with regard to the chronograph the report state : ` the barrel apparatus for the american method of observe transit be not yet bring into use i have however bring it to such a state that i be begin to try whether the barrel move with sufficient uniformity to be itself use as the transit clock this if perfectly secure would be a very great convenience but i be not very sanguine on that point ' -- a change have be make in the electrometer-apparatus : ' a wire for the collection of atmospheric electricity be now stretch from a chimney on the north-west angle of the lead of the octagon room to the electrometer pole there appear to be no doubt that a greater amount of electricity be collect by this apparatus than by that formerly in use ' -- as regard the magnetical observation : ` the visitor at they last meeting express a wish that some attempt should be make to proceed further in the reduction or digest of the magnetical result if any satisfactory plan could be devise i can not say that i have yet satisfied myself on the propriety of any special plan that i have examine i must however confess that in view the capricious form of the photographic curve my mind be entirely bewilder and i sometimes doubt the possibility of extract from they anything whatever which can be consider trustworthy ' -- great progress have be make with the distribution of time ` the same normal clock maintain in sympathetic movement the large clock at the entrance gate two other clock in the observatory and a clock at the london bridge terminus of the south-eastern railway it send galvanic signal every day along all the principal railway diverge from london it drop the greenwich ball and the ball on the office of the electric telegraph company in the strand all these various effect be produce without sensible error of time and i can not but feel a satisfaction in think that the royal observatory be thus quietly contribute to the punctuality of business through a large portion of this busy country i have the satisfaction of state to the visitor that the lord commissioner of the admiralty have decide on the erection of a time-signal ball at deal for the use of the shipping in the downs to be drop every day by a galvanic current from the royal observatory the construction of the apparatus be entrust to I probably there be no roadstead in the world in which the knowledge of true time be so important ' -- the report include a account of the determination of the longitude of cambridge observatory by means of galvanic signal which appear to have be perfectly successful -- under the head of general remark the following passage appear : ` the system of combine the labor of unattached computer with that of attach assistant tend materially to strengthen we power in everything relate to computation we find also among the young person who be engage merely to serve as computer a most laudable ambition to distinguish themselves as observer and thus we be always prepare to undertake any observation which may be require although necessarily by a expenditure of strength which would usually be employ on some other work ' -- considerable work be undertake in prepare a new set of map of we building and grounds -- on apr 23rd there be a small fire in the magnetic observatory which do little mischief -- in December i write my description of the transit circle -- lieut stratford the editor of the nautical almanac die and there be some competition for the office i be willing to take it at a low rate for the addition to my salary : mr main -- and i think mr glaisher -- be desirous of exchange to it : prof adam be anxious for it the admiralty make the excellent choice of mr hind -- in October faraday and i at lothbury witness some remarkable experiment by mr latimer clark on a galvanic current carry four time to and from manchester by subterranean wire -lrb- more than 2000 mile -rrb- shew the retardation of visible current -lrb- at they maximum effect -rrb- and the concentration of active power i make investigation of the velocity of the galvanic current -- i be engage on the preliminary enquiry and arrangement for the deal time ball -- with respect to the westminster clock a angry paper be issue by mr vulliamy in October i expostulate with denison about he conduct towards sir charle barry : on November 7th i resign -- on feb 11th i be elect president of the royal astronomical society -- in the royal institution i lecture on the ancient eclipse -- on dec 15th i be elect to the academy of brussels -- after preliminary correspondence with sir w molesworth -lrb- first commissioner of work & c -rrb- and sir charle barry -lrb- architect of the westminster palace -rrb- i write on may 14th to mr gladstone about deposit the four parliamentary copy of standard at the royal observatory the royal mint the royal society and within a wall of westminster palace mr gladstone assent on June 23rd -- on mar 26th i write to mr gladstone propose to take advantage of the new copper coinage for introduce the decimal system i be always strenuous about preserve the pound sterling on may 10th i attend the committee of the house of common on decimal coinage : and in may and September i write letter to the athenaeum on decimal coinage -- i have always something on hand about tide a special subject now be the cry about intercept the tidal water of the tyne by the formation of the jarrow dock in jarrow slake which fear i consider to be ridiculous of private history : from jan 15th to 24th i be at playford -- on mar 4th i go to dover to try time-signal -- from June 24th to aug 6th i be at little braithwaite near keswick where i have hire a house and make expedition with member of my family in all direction on July 28th i go with my son wilfrid by workington and maryport to rise castle the residence of bishop percy -lrb- the bishop of carlisle -rrb- and on to carlisle and newcastle look at various work mine & c -- on dec 24th i go to playford 1854 the chronograph barrel-apparatus for the american method of transit have be practically bring into use : i have only to add that this apparatus be now generally efficient it be troublesome in use consume much time in the galvanic preparation the preparation of the paper and the translation of the puncture-indication into figure but among the observer who use it there be but one opinion on its astronomical merit -- that in freedom from personal equation and in general accuracy it be very far superior to the observation by eye and ear -- the printing and publication of the observation which be always regard by airy as a matter of the first importance have fall into arrear : i state in my last report that the printing of the observation for 1852 be scarcely commence at the time of the last meeting of the visitor for a long time the printing go on so slowly that i almost despaired of ever again see the observation in a creditable state after a most harassing correspondence the printer be at length persuade to move more actively but the volume be still very much behind its usual time of publication -- the deal time-ball have now be erect by messr maudslay and field and be a admirable specimen of the workmanship of those celebrated engineer the galvanic connection with the royal observatory -lrb- through the telegraph wire of the south eastern railway -rrb- be perfect the automatic change of wire-communication be so arrange that when the ball at deal have drop to its lowest point it send a message to greenwich to acquaint I not with the time of the beginning of its fall -lrb- which can not be in error -rrb- but with the fact that it have really fall the ball have several time be drop experimentally with perfect success and some small official and subsidiary arrangement alone be want for bring it into constant use -- the operation for the galvanic determination of the longitude of brussels be describe with the follow conclusion : thus about 3000 effective signal be make but only 1000 of these be admissible for the fundamental object of the operation the result i need scarcely remark claim a degree of accuracy to which no precede determination of longitude could ever pretend i apprehend that the probable error in the difference of time correspond to not more than one or two yard upon the earth 's surface -- a careful scheme have be arrange for the determination of the longitude of lerwick but ` unfortunately the demand for chronometer cause by we large naval armament have be so considerable that i can not reckon on have at my disposal a sufficient number to carry on this operation successfully and i have therefore unwillingly defer it to a more peaceful time ' -- the cover stone of halley 's tomb in lee churchyard be much shatter and i apply to the admiralty for fund for its complete restoration : these be grant on feb 3rd -- in this year under my cognizance _ # 100 _ be add to the hansen grant -- i have much correspondence and work in connection with the printing of maclear 's work at the cape of good hope in June all account & c about the transit circle be close at the admiralty and the instrument be completely mount at the cape -- dr scoresby -lrb- who in he own way be very imperious -rrb- have attack my method of correct the compass in iron ship : i reply in a letter to the athenaeum on oct 17th -- i make enquiry about operation for determine the longitude of vienna but be utterly repel by the foreign telegraph office -- in the royal astronomical society i prepare the address on present the medal to rmker -- in melbourne university : the first letter receive be from the chancellor of the university date jan 26th request that sir john herschel prof malden mr lowe -lrb- subsequently chancellor of the exchequer -rrb- and i would select professor we have a great deal of correspondence meeting examination of testimonial & c and on August 14th we agree on wilson rowe mccoy and hearn -- on feb 17th i receive the prussian order of merit -- i have correspondence with the treasury on the scale to be adopt for the map of the british survey i propose 1\/3000 and for some purpose 1\/600 -- i print a paper on the deluge in which i shewed -lrb- i believe to certainty -rrb- that the deluge of genesis be merely a destructive flood of the nile -- be well acquaint with the mountain of cumberland i have remark that a ` man ' or cairn of stone erect by the ordnance surveyor on the great gable have cover up a curious natural stone trough know as one of the remarkable singularity of the country this year without give any notice to the ordnance surveyor i send two waller from borrowdale to the mountain top to remove the ` man ' about 10 foot and expose the trough sir henry jame afterwards approve of my act and refund the expense -- i investigate the optical condition of a eye with conical cornea the harton colliery experiment : i have long wish to repeat the experiment which i have attempt unsuccessfully in 1826 and 1828 of determine by pendulum-vibration the measure of gravity at the bottom of a mine residing near keswick this summer and have the matter in my mind i availed myself of a introduction from dr leitch to some gentleman at south shield for inspection of the harton colliery i judge that it would answer pretty well i find that on aug 11th i write to mr anderson -lrb- lessee of the mine -rrb- and on the same day to the admiralty request authority to employ a greenwich assistant and request _ # 100 _ for part payment of expense on August 16th the admiralty assent there be many preparation to be make both personal and instrumental my party consist of dunkin -lrb- superintendant -rrb- elli criswick simmon pogson and rmker : i do not myself attend the detail of observation the observation begin on oct 2nd and end on oct 21st : supplementary observation be subsequently make at greenwich for examine the coefficient of temperature-correction on oct 24th i give a lecture at south shield on the whole operation in ` punch ' of nov 18th there be a excellent semi-comic account of the experiment which as i afterwards find be write by mr percival leigh of private history : on jan 18th i return from playford from mar 10th to 13th i be at deal and visit sir john herschel at hawkhurst -- from June 28th to aug 7th i be stay with my family at the grange in borrowdale near keswick : and also make a expedition to penrith carlisle newcastle jarrow & c and descend the harton pit -- in September and also in October i be at south shield on the harton experiment -- from dec 14th to 18th i be at cambridge and on the 26th i go to playford the following letter write in answer to a lady who have ask he to procure permission from lord rosse for she to observe with he telescope be characteristic : royal observatory greenwich _ 1854 September 20 _ dear madam the state of thing with regard to lord rosse 's telescope be this if a night be fine it be want for he use or for the use of professional astronomer if it be not fine it be of no use to anybody now consider this and consider that the appropriation of the telescope on a fine night to any body but a technical astronomer be a misapplication of a enormous capital of money and intellect which be invest in this unique instrument -- it be against my conscience to ask lord rosse to place it at the service of any person except a experienced astronomer no introduction i believe be necessary for see it in the day-time the instrument stand unenclosed in the castle demesne to which stranger be admit without question i believe faithfully yours gb airy 1855 on may 9th it be notify to I -lrb- i think through the hydrographer -rrb- that the admiralty be not unwilling to increase my salary i make application therefore and on jan 21st 1856 sir charle wood notify to I that the admiralty consent to have it raise from _ # 800 _ to _ # 1000 _ -- in the report to the board of visitor it appear that ` at the instance of the board of trade act on this occasion through a committee of the royal society a model of the transit circle -lrb- with the improvement of perforated cube & c introduce in the cape transit circle -rrb- have be prepare for the great exhibition at pari ' -- under the head of reduction of astronomical observation it be state that ` during the whole time of which i have speak the galvanic-contact method have be employ for transit with the exception of a few day when the galvanic apparatus be out of order from the clock error i have deduce the personal equation of the observer in we usual way the result be that the magnitude of the personal equation in the galvanic-touch method be not above half of that in the eye and ear method ' -- with regard to the reduction of the magnetical observation ' i have not yet feel sufficiently satisfy with any propose method of discuss the magnetic result to devote any time to they further treatment ' -- ` the time-signal ball at deal be bring into regular use at the beginning of the present year in a short time however its action be interrupted partly by derangement of the apparatus and partly by the severity of the weather which freeze the sulphuric acid to the state of jelly i send a assistant and workman to put it in order and since that time it have generally act very well -- application have be make to I from one of the important office of government -lrb- the post office -rrb- for the galvanic regulation of they clock -- on consider the risk to which various galvanic communication be liable and the financial necessity for occupy wire as little as possible i perceive that it be necessary to devise construction which should satisfy the following condition first that a current send once a day should suffice for adjust the clock even if it have go ten or more seconds wrong secondly that a occasional failure of the current should not stop the clock i have arrange construction which possess these character and the artist -lrb- mr c shepherd -rrb- be now engage in prepare estimate of the expense i think it likely that this may prove to be the beginning of a very extensive system of clock regulation -- with respect to the operation for determine the longitude of paris it be state that the whole number of day of signal transmission be eighteen and the whole number of signal transmit be 2530 the number of day consider available for longitude in consequence of transit of star have be observe at both observatory be twelve and the number of signal be 1703 very great care be take on both side for the adjustment of the instrument the result difference of longitude 9m 2063 be probably very accurate it be less by nearly 1 of time than that determine in 1825 by rocket-signal under the superintendance of sir john herschel and col sabine the time occupy by the passage of the galvanic current appear to be 1\/12th of a second -- with regard to the pendulum experiment in the harton colliery after mention that personal assistance have be seek and obtain from the observatory of cambridge oxford durham and red hill the report state that the experiment appear to have be in every point successful shew beyond doubt that gravity be increase at the depth of 1260 foot by 1\/10000th part i trust that this combination may prove a valuable precedent for future association of the different observatory of the kingdom when object require extensive personal organization shall present themselves -- on oct 18th the astronomer royal print a address to the individual member of the board of visitor on the subject of a large new equatoreal for the observatory after a brief statement of the exist equipment of the observatory in respect of equatoreal instrument the address continue thus : it be know to the visitor that i have uniformly object to any luxury of extrameridional apparatus which would materially divert we from a steady adherence to the meridional system which both reason and tradition have engraft on this observatory but i feel that we present instrument be insufficient even for my wish and i can not overlook the consideration that due provision must be make for future interest and that we be nearer by twenty year to the time when another judgment must decide on the direction which shall be give to the force of the observatory -- in August i have some correspondence about the egyptian wooden astronomical tablet with mr gresswell and other : they be fully examine by mr elli -- in this year i be much engage on scheme for compass and in June i send my paper on discussion of ship ' magnetism to the royal society -- on dec 6th the mast of the observatory time-ball break and the ball fall in the front court -- on aug 4th my value friend mr sheepshank die and on aug 14th i go to london to see the standard bar as leave by he afterwards on oct 25th i go to read to collect the papers about standard leave by mr sheepshank -- i make a mechanical construction for euclid i 47 with which i be well satisfied -- on apr 13th i join a deputation to the chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- sir g cornewall lewi -rrb- on decimal coinage of private history : i be at playford for a large part of January -- on mar 26th i go to read to visit mr sheepshank and afterwards to silchester and hereford -- on June 21st i go with my wife and two eldest son to edinburgh and other place in scotland but reside principally at oban where i hire a house amongst other expedition i and my son wilfrid go with the ` pharo ' -lrb- northern light steamer -rrb- to the skerry vohr lighthouse & c i also visit newcastle & c and return to greenwich on aug 2nd -- from oct 12th to 17th i be at cambridge -- on dec 24th i go to playford chapter vii at greenwich observatory -- 1856 to 1866 1856 in the report to the visitor there be a interesting account of the difficulty experience with the reflex zenith tube in consequence of the tremor of the quicksilver transmit through the ground attempt be make to reduce the tremor by support the quicksilver trough on a stage found at a depth of 10 foot below the surface but it be not in the smallest degree diminish and the report state that ` the experience of this investigation justify I in believe that no practicable depth of trench prevent the propagation of tremor when the soil be like that of greenwich hill a gravel in all place very hard and in some cement to the consistency of rock ' -- with respect to the regulation of the post office clock ` one of the galvanic clock in the post office department lombard street be already place in connection with the royal observatory and be regulate at noon every day other clock at the general post office be nearly prepare for the same regulation and i expect that the complete system will soon be in action ' -- under the head of general remark a careful summary be give of the work of the observatory and the paragraph conclude as follow : ` lastly there be employment which connect the scientific observatory with the practical world the distribution of accurate time the improvement of marine time-keeper the observation and communication which tend to the advantage of geography and navigation and the study in a practical sense of the modification of magnetism a careful attention to these be likely to prove useful to the world and conducive to the material prosperity of the observatory : and these ought not to be banish from we system ' -- in September i prepare the first specification for the building to carry the se dome -- in September learn that hansen 's lunar table be finish in manuscript i apply to lord clarendon and they be convey to I through the foreign office : in October i submit to the admiralty the proposal for print the table and in November i learn that the treasury have assent to the expense -- lieut daynou 's eclipse and occultation for longitude of point in south africa observe in 1854 and 1855 be calculate here in this year -- on feb 16th i make my first application to sir c wood -lrb- first lord of the admiralty -rrb- for assistance to c piazzus smyth to carry out the teneriffe experiment : ground it in part on the failure of attempt to see the solar prominence he give encouragement and on mar 18th i transmit piazzus smyth 's memorial to the admiralty : on may 2nd the admiralty authorize a expense of _ # 500 _ i draw up suggestion -- the sheepshank fund : after the death of my friend richard sheepshank he sister miss anne sheepshank wish to bestow some fund in connection with the university of cambridge trinity college and astronomy to which he name should be attach there must have be some conversation with I but the first letter be one from de morgan in August in September i have a conversation with miss sheepshank and send she my first draft of a scheme to which she assent on sept 30th i write to whewell -lrb- master of trinity -rrb- who be much trust by miss sheepshank : he consent to take part and make some suggestion there be further correspondence but the business do not get into shape in this year -- in connection with the correction of the compass in iron ship : i discuss the observation make in the voyage of the royal charter on feb 13th i propose to the admiralty a system of mount the compass with adjustable magnet and it be order to be try in the trident and transit -- in February i report to the admiralty that the deal time-ball have be successful and i propose time-ball at portsmouth plymouth and sheerness there be much correspondence in various direction about portsmouth and devonport and in march i go to devonport and specially examine mount wise and the devonport column -- i have correspondence with sir howard dougla about the sea break over the unfinished dover pier i have a idea that this follow evidence give by I to a harbor commission in which i express as a certainty that the sea will not be make to break by a vertical wall of private history : i return from playford on jan 18th -- from June 16th to August 5th i be with my son wilfrid on a expedition to south italy and sicily : on we return from sicily we remain for three day ill at marseille from a touch of malaria -- on dec 22nd i go to playford -- in acknowledgment of the pleasure which i have derive from excursion in the cumberland pass i make a foot-bridge over a troublesome stream on the pass of the sty head 1857 in the report to the visitor when on the subject of the altazimuth the follow paragraph occur : ' i allude in a precede section to the cut away of a very small portion of one of the ray of the three-armed pier which carry the altazimuth the quality of the brickwork be the best that i have ever see and not a single brick be disturb beyond those actually remove yet the effect be to give the altazimuth a inclination of about 23 this inclination evidently depend on the elasticity of the brickwork ' -- with reference to the new se equatoreal the report state that ` the support of the north or upper end of the polar axis have be receive and be plant within the wall of the building in a position convenient for raise it to its ultimate destination it be one piece of cast-iron and weigh nearly 5 ton ' -- small change as previously mention have be notice with regard to the zero of azimuth of the transit circle and the report state that ` in regard to the azimuth of the transit circle and the azimuth of its collimator mr main have bring together the result of several year and the follow law appear to hold there be a well-marked annual periodical change in the position of the transit circle the southerly movement of the eastern pivot have its minimum value in September and its maximum in march the extreme range be about 14 seconds and there be a similar change but of smaller amount in the position of the collimator i can not conjecture any cause for these change except in the motion of the ground there be also a well-marked connection between the state of level of the axis and the temperature the eastern pivot always rise when the temperature rise the extreme range be about 6 seconds i can not offer any explanation of this ' -- under the head of extraneous work the report state that ` the british government have for some year past contribute by pecuniary grant to the preparation of prof hansen 's lunar table in the last winter they undertake the entire expense of print a large impression of the table the reading of the proof-sheet -lrb- a very considerable labor -rrb- have be effect entirely at the observatory i may take this opportunity of state that the use of these table have enable I as i think incontestably to fix the capture of larissa to the date bc 557 may 19 this identification promise to prove valuable not merely for its chronological utility but also for its accurate determination of a astronomical epoch the point eclipse be exactly know and the shadow have be very small ' -- in April i give a lecture to the royal astronomical society on the method available through the next 25 year for the determination of the sun 's parallax -- dr livingstone 's observation for african longitude be compute at the observatory -- the admiralty enquire of I about the feasibility of adopt piazzus smyth 's construction for steadying telescope on board ship : i give a report of mixed character on the whole discourage -- i have correspondence with gp bond and other about photograph the star and moon -- on feb 17th piazzus smyth 's book & c relate to the teneriffe experiment be send to I : i recommend that a abridged report should be send to the royal society -- respect the sheepshank fund : there be correspondence with miss sheepshank and whewell but nothing get into shape this year : miss sheepshank transfer to I _ # 10000 _ lie at overend and gurney 's -- in November experiment be make for the longitude of edinburgh which fail totally from the bad state of the telegraph wire between deptford and the admiralty -- in June the first suggestion be make to I by capt washington for time-signal on the lizard point : which in no long time i change for the start point -- the admiralty call for estimate for a time-ball at portsmouth : on receive they they decline further proceeding -- i be engage in speculation and correspondence about the atlantic submarine cable -- in the royal astronomical society i present memoirs and give lecture on the three great chronological eclipse -lrb- agathocle thale larissa -rrb- -- on dec 5th airy write

-- on dec 26th i go to playford 1858 in the minute of the visitor it be note that the new queen 's warrant be receive the principal change be the exclusion of the astronomer royal and the other observatory officer from the board -- in the report to the visitor it be state that ` the papers of the board of longitude be now finally stitch into book they will probably form one of the most curious collection of the result of scientific enterprise both normal and abnormal which exist ' -- it appear that the galvanic communication external to the observatory have be in a bad state the four wire to london bridge have probably be injure by a thunderstorm in the last autumn and the report state that ` the state of the wire have not enable we to drop the ball at deal the feeble current which arrive there have be use for some month merely as give a signal by which a attendant be guide in drop the ball by hand ' -- regard the new equatoreal the report state that ` for the new south-east equatoreal the object-glass be furnish by messr merz and son in the summer of last year and i make various trial of it in a temporary tube carry by the temporary mount which i have provide and finally i be well satisfy with it i can not yet say that i have certainly divide the small star of gamma andromeda but for such a test a combination of favourable circumstance be require from what i have see i have no doubt of its prove a first-rate object-glass ' -- on march 15th be a annular eclipse of the sun for the observation of which i send party fully equip to bedford wellingborough and market harborough the observation fail totally in consequence of the bad weather : i myself go to harrowden near wellingborough -- respect the altazimuth the report state that with due caution as to the zero of azimuth ` the result of observation be extremely good very nearly equal to those of the meridional instrument perhaps i might say that three observation with the altazimuth be equivalent to two with the transit circle ' -- respect meteorological observation the report state that ` the observation of the maximum and minimum thermometer in the thame interrupt at the date of the last report have be resume and be most regularly maintained regard the thame as the grand climatic agent on london and its neighborhood i should much regret the suppression of these observation ' -- after much trouble the longitude of edinburgh have be determine : ` the retard of the current be 004s very nearly and the difference of longitude 12m 4305 subject to personal equation ' -- the report conclude thus : ` with regard to the direction of we labor i trust that i shall always be support by the visitor in my desire to maintain the fundamental and meridional system of the observatory absolutely intact this however do not impede the extension of we system in any way whatever provide that such means be arrange for carry out the extension as will render unnecessary the withdrawal of strength from what be now the engrossing object of the observatory ' -- i have much correspondence on comet of which donatus 's great comet be one : the tail of this comet pass over arcturus on October 5th -- respect the sheepshank fund : in September i meet whewell at leed and we settle orally the final plan of the scheme on oct 27th i see messr sharp miss sheepshank 's solicitor and draw up a draft of the deed of gift there be much correspondence and on nov 20th i write to the vice-chancellor of cambridge university a counter-scheme be propose by dr philpott master of st catharine 's college by arrangement i attend the council of the university on dec 3rd and explain my view to which the council assent on dec 9th the senate accept the gift of miss sheepshank -- i have much correspondence throughout this year with the treasury herschel sabine and the royal society about the continuation of the magnetic establishment the reduction of the magnetic observation 1848-1857 be commence in February of this year under the direction of mr luca a computer who have be engage on the lunar reduction -- in this year i come to a final agreement with the south eastern railway company about define the term of we connection with they for the passage of time signal i be authorize by the admiralty to sign the ` protocol ' or memorandum of agreement and it be sign by the south eastern railway director -- on aug 28th i make my first proposal to sir john packington -lrb- first lord of the admiralty -rrb- for hourly time signal on the start point and in September i go to the start to examine locality & c on dec 23rd the admiralty decline to sanction it -- i present to the royal society a paper about draw a great-circle trace on a mercator 's chart -- in October i give a lecture on astronomy in the assembly room at bury -- on jan 25th i be busy with my mathematical tract for republication -- in this year airy publish in the athenaeum very careful and critical remark on the commissioner ' draft of statute for trinity college he be always ready to take action in the interest of he old college this paper procure he the warmest gratitude from the fellow of the college of private history : on jan 23rd i return from playford from July 5th to aug 6th i be on a expedition in switzerland with my two eldest son at pari we visit le verrier and at geneva we visit gautier de la rive and plantamor we return by brussels -- on dec 23rd i go to playford -- in this year be erect in playford churchyard a granite obelisk in memory of thoma clarkson it be build by subscription amongst a few friend of clarkson 's and the negociation and arrangement be chiefly carry out by airy who zealously exert himself in the work which be intend to honor the memory of he early friend it give he much trouble during the year 1856 to 1858 here be a letter to the editor of the athenaeum on some other trinity matter : _ 1858 November 22 _ dear sir in the athenaeum of November 20 page 650 column 3 paragraph 4 there be a account of the erection of the statue of barrow in trinity college antechapel -lrb- cambridge -rrb- conceive in a spirit hostile to the university and write in great ignorance of the fact on the latter i can give the writer some information the marquis of lansdowne who be a trinity man and whose son be of trinity intimate to the authority of the college that he be desirous of place in the antechapel a statue of _ milton _ this regard be have to the custom and the college-feeling of cambridge be totally impossible the antechapel of every college be sacredly reserve for memorial of the man of that college only and milton be of christ 's college the marquis of lansdowne on hearing this objection leave the choice of the person to be commemorate to certain person of the college one of whom -lrb- a literary character of the highest eminence and a profound admirer of milton -rrb- have not reside in cambridge for many year several name be carefully consider and particularly one -lrb- not mention by you correspondent -rrb- of very great literary celebrity but in whose writings there be ingrain so much of ribaldry and licentiousness that he be at length give up finally the choice rest on barrow not as comparable to milton but as a person of reputation in he day and as the best who could be find under all the circumstance cromwell never be mention he be a member of sidney college : moreover it would have be very wrong to select the exponent of a extreme political party but cromwell have i believe many admirer in cambridge to which list i attach myself i have no part in the negociation above mention but i see the original letter and i answer for the perfect correctness of what i have state but as i be not a principal i decline to appear in public it be much to be desire both for the athenaeum and for the public that such a erroneous statement should not remain uncorrected and i would suggest that a correction by the editor would be just and graceful and would tend to support the athenaeum in that high position which it have usually maintain i be dear sir yours very faithfully gb airy _ hepworth dixon esq _ 1859 the report to the visitor state that ` the lunar reduction with amend element -lrb- especially parallax -rrb- for correction of observation from 1831 to 1851 be now complete it be i think matter of congratulation to the observatory and to astronomy that there be now exhibit the result of uninterrupted lunar observation extend through more than a century make at the same place reduce under the same superintendence and on the same general principle and compare throughout with the same theoretical table ' -- after reference to the great value of the greenwich lunar observation to prof hansen in construct he table and to the liberality of the british government in they grant to hansen the report continue thus : ' a strict comparison of hansen 's table with the greenwich observation of late year both meridional and extra-meridional be commence the same observation have in the daily routine of the observatory be compare with the nautical almanac or burckhardt 's table the result for one year only -lrb- 1852 -rrb- have yet reach I but it be most remarkable the sum of square of residual error with hansen 's table be only one-eighth part of that with burckhardt 's table when it be remember that in this be include the entire effect of error and irregularity of observation we shall be justify in consider hansen 's table as nearly perfect so great a step to the best of my knowledge have never be make in numerical physical theory i have cite this at length not only as interesting to the visitor from the circumstance that we have on we side contribute to this great advance but also because a innovation peculiar to this observatory have in no small degree aid in give a decisive character to the comparison i have never conceal my opinion that the introduction and vigorous use of the altazimuth for observation of the moon be the most important addition to the system of the observatory that have be make for many year the largest error of burckhardt 's table be put in evidence almost always by the altazimuth observation in portion of the moon 's orbit which could not be touch by the meridional instrument they amount sometimes to nearly 40 of arc and they naturally become the crucial error for distinction between burckhardt 's and hansen 's table those error be in all case correct with great accuracy by hansen 's table ' -- the report conclude with the follow paragraph : ` with the inauguration of the new equatoreal will terminate the entire change from the old state of the observatory there be not now a single person employ or instrument use in the observatory which be there in mr pond 's time nor a single room in the observatory which be use as it be use then in every step of change however except this last the ancient and traditional responsibility of the observatory have be most carefully consider : and in the last the substitution of a new instrument be so absolutely necessary and the importance of tolerate no instrument except of a high class be so obvious that no other course be open to we i can only trust that while the use of the equatoreal within legitimate limit may enlarge the utility and the reputation of the observatory it may never be permit to interfere with that which have always be the staple and standard work here ' -- concern the sheepshank fund : there be much correspondence about settle the gift till about feb 21st i take part in the first examination for the scholarship in October of this year and take my place with the trinity seniority as one of they number on this foundation for some general business of the fund -- with respect to the correction of the compass in iron ship : i send mr elli to liverpool to see some practice there in the correction of the compass in September i urge mr rundell to make a voyage in the great eastern -lrb- just float -rrb- for examination of she compass and lend he instrument : very valuable result be obtain mr archibald smith have edit scoresby 's voyage in the royal charter with a introduction very offensive to I : i reply fully in the athenaeum of nov 7th -- the sale of gas act : a act of parliament promote by private member of the house of common have be pass without the knowledge or recollection of the government it impose on the government various duty about the preparation of standard suddenly at the very expiration of the time allow this come to the knowledge of government on oct 1st lord monteagle apply to I for assistance on oct 15th and 22nd i write to mr hamilton secretary of the treasury and receive authority to ask for the assistance of prof wh miller -- i make a examination of mr ball 's eye -lrb- long-sighted and short-sighted i think -rrb- -- in February i make a analysis of the cambridge tripos examination which i communicate to some cambridge resident in a letter on this subject to one of he cambridge friend airy give he opinion as follow : i have look very carefully over the examination papers and think they on the whole very bad they be utterly pervert by the insane love of problem and by the foolish importance give to wholly useless part of algebraical geometry for the sake of these every physical subject and every useful application of pure mathematics be cut down or not mention this lead to much discussion at cambridge in this year the smith 's prize be award to the 4th and 6th wrangler of private history : on apr 29th mr smith -lrb- my wife 's mother -rrb- die at brampton -- from July 4th to aug 2nd i be in france -lrb- auvergne and the vivarai -rrb- with my two eldest son maclear travel with we to paris -- on dec 23rd i go to playford -- antiquity and historical question connect with military movement have a very great attraction for airy on he return from the expedition in france above-mentioned he engage in considerable correspondence with military authority regard point connect with the battle of toulouse and in this year also he have much correspondence with the duke of northumberland concern he map of the roman wall and the military point relate to the same 1860 in June mr main accept the office of radcliffe observer at oxford -lrb- mr johnson have die -rrb- and resign the first assistancy at greenwich : in October mr stone be appoint first assistant -- at a adjourn meeting of the visitor on June 18th there be very heavy discussion on hansen 's merit and about the grant to he papers be read from sir j lubbock babbage south whewell and I finally it be recommend to the government to grant _ # 1000 _ to hansen which be pay to he -- in the report to the board of visitor the following remark occur : ` the apparent existence of a discordance between the result of direct observation and reflection observation -lrb- after the application of correction for flexure found upon observation of the horizontal collimator wire -rrb- to a extent far greater than can be explain by any disturbance of the direction of gravity on the quicksilver by its distance from the vertical or by the attraction of neighbouring mass perplex I much ' -- with respect to the discordance of dip of the dipping-needle which for year past have be a source of great trouble and puzzle the report state that ` the dipping-needle be still a source of anxiety the form which they anomaly appear to take be that of a special or peculiar value of the dip give by each separate needle with one of the 9-inch needle the result always differ about a quarter of a degree from that of the other i can see nothing in its mechanical construction to explain this -- reference be make to the spontaneous current through the wire of telegraph company which be frequently violent and always occur at the time of magnetic storm and the report continue ` it may be worth consider whether it would ever be desirable to establish in two direction at right angle to each other -lrb- for instance along the brighton railway and along the north kent railway -rrb- wire which would photographically register in the royal observatory the current that pass in these direction exhibit they indication by photographic curve in close juxtaposition with the register of the magnetic element ' -- in connection with the reduction of the greenwich lunar observation from 1831 to 1851 the report state that ` the comparison of hansen 's lunar table with the greenwich observation which at the last visitation have be complete for one year only have now be finish for the twelve year 1847 to 1858 the result for the whole period agree entirely in they general spirit with those for the year 1852 cite in the last report the greatest difference between the merit of burckhardt 's and hansen 's table appear in the meridional longitude 1855 when the proportion of the sum of square of error be as 31 -lrb- burckhardt -rrb- to 2 -lrb- hansen -rrb- the nearest approach be in the altazimuth latitude 1854 when the proportion of the sum of square of error be as 12 -lrb- burckhardt -rrb- to 5 -lrb- hansen -rrb- ' -- a special address to the member of the board of visitor have reference to the proposal of m struve for -lrb- amongst other matter -rrb- the improve determination of the longitude of valencium and the galvanic determination of the extreme eastern station of the british triangle -- on sept 13th i circulate amongst the visitor my remark on a paper entitle ` on the polar distance of the greenwich transit-circle by a marth ' print in the astronomische nachrichten the paper by mr marth be a elaborate attack on the greenwich method of observation and my remark be a detailed refutation of he statement -- on oct 20th i make enquiry of sabine as to the advantage of keep up magnetic observation on oct 22nd he write avoid my question in some measure but say that we instrument must be change for such as those at kew -lrb- he observatory -rrb- : i reply generally decline to act on that advice -- in march and April i be in correspondence with mr cowper -lrb- first commissioner of work & c -rrb- about the bell of the westminster clock also about the smoky chimney of the various apartment of the palace on apr 21st i make my report on the clock and bell 20 foolscap page i employ a professional musician to examine the tone of the bell -- in November i be write my book on probable error & c -- i be engage on the tide of kurrachee and bombay -- the first examination of navy telescope be make for the admiralty -- hoch 's paper on aberration appear in the astronomische nachrichten this -lrb- with other -rrb- lead to the construction of the water-telescope several year later -- in September i write in the athenaeum against a notion of sir h jame on the effect of a upheaval of a mountain in change the earth 's axis in October i have draw up a list of day for a possible evagation of the earth 's pole : but apparently nothing be do upon they in this year i be a good deal occupy for the lighthouse commission on feb 21st admiral hamilton -lrb- chairman -rrb- apply to I for assistance in April i go to chance 's factory in birmingham on this business in may i make my report on the start lighthouse after inspection with the commission in June with my son hubert i visit the whitby lighthouse and discover a fault of a singular kind which most materially diminish they power this discovery lead to a general examination of lighthouse by the trinity board to a modification of many and to a general improvement of system on June 25th i report on the light at calai cap de valde grisnez south foreland and north foreland in August i have be to the north foreland again and in September to calai and the cap d'ailly in October i go with my son hubert to aberdeen to see the girdleness lighthouse on nov 10th i make a general report this be the year of the great total solar eclipse visible in spain at my representation the admiralty place at my command the large steamship ` himalaya ' to carry about 60 astronomer british and foreign some be land at santander : i with many at bilbao the eclipse be fairly well observe : i personally do not do my part well the most important be mr de la rue 's photographic operation at greenwich i have arrange a very careful series of observation with the great equatoreal which be fully carry out the eclipse expedition to spain shortly refer to above be most interesting not merely from the importance of the result obtain -lrb- and some of the party be very fortunate in the weather -rrb- but from the character of the expedition it be a wonderful combination of the astronomer of europe who be all receive on board the ` himalaya ' and be convey together to the coast of spain the polyglot of language be most remarkable but the utmost harmony and enthusiasm prevail from first to last and this have much to do with the general success of the expedition those who land at bilbao be receive in the kindest and most hospitable manner by mr cb vignole the engineer-in-chief of the bilbao and tudelum railway which be then under construction this gentleman make arrangement for the conveyance of party to point in the interior of the country which be judge suitable for the observation of the eclipse and place all the resource of he staff at the disposal of the expedition in the most liberal manner the universal opinion be that very great difficulty would have be experience without the active and generous assistance of mr vignole it be needless to say that the vote of thanks to mr vignole propose by the astronomer royal during the return voyage be pass by acclamation and with a very sincere feeling of gratitude : it be to the effect that ` without the great and liberal aid of mr cb vignole and the disinterested love of science evince by he on this occasion the success of the himalaya eclipse expedition could not have be ensure ' there be a graphic and interesting account of the reception of the party at bilbao give in the ` life of cb vignole fr soldier and civil engineer ' by oj vignole ma of private history : on may 26th my venerable friend arthur biddell die he have be in many respects more than a father to I : i can not express how much i owe to he especially in my youth -- from June 12th to 15th i visit the whitby lighthouse with my son hubert -- from July 6th to 28th i be in spain on the ` himalaya ' expedition to observe the total eclipse : i be accompany by my wife my eldest son and my eldest daughter -- from oct 5th to 18th i go with my son hubert to aberdeen to see the girdleness lighthouse make lateral trip to cumberland in go and return -- on dec 21st i go to playford 1861 in the report to the visitor there be great complaint of want of room ` with increase of computation we want more room for computer with we greatly increase business of chronometer and time-distribution we be in want of a nearly separate series of room for the time-department : we want room for book-store and we require room for the photographic operation and the computation of the magnetic department ' -- the report give a curious history of dr bradley 's observation which in 1776 have be transfer to the university of oxford and proceed thus : ` more lately i apply -lrb- in the first instance through lord wrottesley -rrb- to the vice-chancellor dr jeune in reference to the possibility of transfer these manuscript to the royal observatory finally a decree for the transfer of the manuscript observation to the royal observatory without any condition be propose to convocation on may 2nd and be pass unanimously and on may 7th my assistant mr dunkin be send to oxford to receive they and thus after a delay of very nearly a century the great work of justice be at length complete and the great gap in we manuscript observation be at length fill up ' -- with reference to the transit circle it have be remark that the collimator be slightly disturb by the proximity of the gas-flame of they illuminator and after various experiment as to the cause of it the report proceed thus : ` to my great surprise i find that the disturbance be entirely due to the radiation of the flame upon a very small corner -lrb- about 16 square inch -rrb- of the large and massive stone on which the collimator be plant the tin plate be subsequently shape in such a manner as to protect the stone as well as the metal and the disturbance have entirely cease ' -- regard the large se equatoreal the report state that ` on the character of its object-glass i be now able to speak first from the examination of mr otto struve make in a favourable state of atmosphere secondly from the examination of my assistant -lrb- i have not myself obtain a sight of a test-object on a night of very good definition -rrb- it appear to be of the highest order the small star of gamma andromeda be so far separate as to shew a broad dark space between its component some blue color be shewn about the bright planet ' -- it be note in the report that ` the equatoreal observation of the solar eclipse be completely reduce and the result be valuable it appear from they that the error in right ascension of burckhardt 's lunar table at the time of the eclipse amount to about 38 while that of hansen 's -lrb- ultimately adopt by mr hind for the calculation of the eclipse -rrb- do not exceed 3 ' -- with regard to chronometer it be state that ` by use of the chronometer oven to which i have formerly allude we have be able to give great attention to the compensation i have reason to think that we be produce a most beneficial effect on the manufacture and adjustment of chronometer in general ' -- with regard to the cape of good hope observatory and survey the admiralty enquire of I when the survey work will be complete and i enquire of maclear ` how be the printing of you survey work ' in 1862 i begin to press it strongly and in 1863 very strongly -- i introduce a method -lrb- constantly pursue since that time at the royal observatory -rrb- for compute interpolation without change of sign -- i have correspondence with herschel and faraday on the possible effect of the sun 's radiant heat on the sea as explain the curve of diurnal magnetic inequality -lrb- that diurnal inequality be infer from the magnetic reduction 1848-1857 which be terminate in 1860 -rrb- -- regard the proposal of hourly time-signal on the start point i consult telegraph engineer upon the practical point and on dec 21st i propose a formal scheme in complete detail -lrb- the matter have be repeatedly bring before the admiralty but have be uniformly reject -rrb- -- i be engage on the question of the bad ocular vision of two or three person -- the british association meeting be hold at manchester : i be president of section a i give a lecture on the eclipse of 1860 to a enormous attendance in the free trade hall the follow record of the lecture be extract from dr ej routh 's obituary notice of airy write for the proceedings of the royal society at the meeting of the british association at manchester in 1861 mr airy deliver a lecture on the solar eclipse of 1860 to a assembly of perhaps 3000 person the writer remember the great free trade hall crowd to excess with a immense audience whose attention and interest notwithstanding a weak voice he be able to retain to the very end of the lecturethe charm of professor airy 's lecture lay in the clearness of he explanation the subject also of he lecture be generally those to which he attention have be turn by other cause so that he have much that be new to tell he manner be slightly hesitate and he use frequent repetition which perhaps be necessary from the newness of the idea as the lecturer proceed he hearer forget these imperfection and find they whole attention rivet to the subject matter of private history : on jan 2nd there be a most remarkable crystallization of the ice on the flood meadow at playford : the frost be very severe -- from June 20th to aug 1st i be at the grange near keswick -lrb- where i hire a house -rrb- with my wife and most of my family -- from nov 5th to 14th i be on a expedition in the south of scotland with my son wilfrid : we walk with we knapsack by the roman road across the cheviot to jedburgh -- on dec 21st i go to playford 1862 the report to the board of visitor state that ' a new range of wooden building -lrb- the magnetic office -rrb- be in progress at the sse extremity of the magnetic ground it will include seven room ' -- also ' i take this opportunity -lrb- the relaying of the water-main -rrb- of establish two powerful fire-plug -lrb- one in the front court and one in the magnetic ground -rrb- a stock of fire-hose adapt to the brigade-screw have be previously secure in the observatory ' -- ` two wire intend for the examination of spontaneous earth-current have be carry from the magnetic observatory to the railway station in the town of greenwich from this point one wire be to be lead to a point in the neighborhood of croydon the other to a point in the neighborhood of dartford each wire be to be connect at its two extremity with the earth the angle include between the general direction of these two line be nearly a right angle ' -- ` the kew unifilar magnetometer adapt to the determination of the horizontal part of terrestrial magnetic force in absolute measure be mount in the summer of 1861 and till 1862 February occasional observation -lrb- 14 in all -rrb- be take simultaneously with the old and with the new instrument the comparison of result shew a steady but very small difference not greater probably than may correspond to the omission of the inverse seventh power of distance in the theoretical investigation prove that the old instrument have be quite efficient for its purpose ' -- great effort have be make to deduce a law from the diurnal inequality in declination and horizontal force as shewn by the magnetic observation but without success : the report state that ` the result be most amazing for the variation in magnitude as well as in law what cosmical change can be indicate by they be entirely beyond my power of conjecture ' -- ' i have allude in the two last report to the step necessary on the english side for complete the great arc of parallel from valencium to the volga the russian portion of the work be far advance and will be finish -lrb- it be understand -rrb- in the come summer it appear to I therefore that the repetition of the measure of astronomical longitude between greenwich and valencium could be no longer delay two assistant of the royal observatory -lrb- mr dunkin and mr criswick -rrb- will at once proceed to valencium for the determination of local time and the management of galvanic signal ' -- ' i now ask leave to press the subject of hourly time signal at the start point on the attention of the board and to submit the advantage of they address the board of admiralty upon it the great majority of outward-bound ship pass within sight of the start and if a hourly signal be exhibit would have the means of regulate they chronometer at a most critical part of they voyage the plan of the entire system of operation be completely arrange the estimate expense of outfit be _ # 2017 _ and the estimate annual expense be _ # 326 _ both liable to some uncertainty but sufficiently exact to shew that the outlay be inconsiderable in comparison with the advantage which might be expect from it i know no direction of the power of the observatory which would tend so energetically to carry out the great object of its establishment viz the find out the so much desire longitude at sea ' -- the attention of the visitor be strongly draw to the pressure on the strength of the observatory cause by the observation of the numerous small planet and the paragraph conclude thus : ' i shall however again endeavor to effect a partition of this labor with some other observatory ' -- a small fire have occur in the magnetic observatory a new building of zinc for the operation of naphthalize the illuminating gas be in preparation external to the observatory : and thus one of the possible source of accidental fire will be remove -- miss sheepshank add through I _ # 2000 _ to she former gift : i transfer it i believe to the master and senior of trinity college -- in this year airy contribute to the royal society two papers one on the magnetic property of hot-rolled and cold-rolled malleable iron the other on the strain in the interior of beam he give evidence before the select committee on weight and measure and also before the public school commission in the latter part of 1862 a difference arise between airy and major-general sabine in consequence of remark make by the latter at a meeting of the committee of recommendation of the british association these remark be to the effect that it be necessary to maintain the complete system of self-registration of magnetic phenomenon at the kew observatory because no sufficient system of magnetic record be maintain elsewhere in england imply pointedly that the system at the royal observatory of greenwich be insufficient this matter be take up very warmly by airy and after a short and acrimonious correspondence with sabine he issue a private address to the visitor enclose copy of the correspondence with he remark and request the board to take the matter of this attack into they careful consideration this address be date November 1862 and it be follow by another dated January 1863 which contain a careful reply to the various point of general sabine 's attack and conclude with a distinct statement that he -lrb- the astronomer royal -rrb- can no longer act in confidence with sabine as a member of the board of visitor of private history : there be the usual short visit to playford at the beginning and end of the year -- from June 28th to aug 5th he be in scotland -lrb- chiefly in the western highland -rrb- with he wife and he son hubert and osmund in the course of this journey he visit the corryvreckan whirlpool near the island of scarba and the follow paragraph relate to this expedition be extract from he journal : land in black mile bay island of luing at 1030 here by previous arrangement with mr a brown agent of the steam-boat company a 4-oared boat be wait to take we to scarba and the corryvreckan we be pull across to the island of lunga and row along its length till we come to the first channel opening from the main sea which the sailor call the little gulf here the sea be rush inwards in a manner of which i have no conception stream be run with rave speed sometimes in opposite direction side by side with high broken-headed billow where the stream touch be sometimes great whirl -lrb- one not many yard from we boat -rrb- that look as if they would suck anything down sometimes among all this be great smooth part of the sea still in a whirling trouble which be surround by the mad current we seem entirely powerless among all these in the beginning of this year -lrb- 1862 -rrb- the duke of manchester in write to the rev w airy have say i wish you brother the astronomer royal could be induce to have investigation make as to whether the aspect of the planet have any effect on the weather this enquiry produce the following reply : a subject like that of the occult influence of the planet -lrb- use the word occult in no bad sense but simply as mean not _ thoroughly _ trace -rrb- can be approach in two way -- either by the  priori probability of the existence of such influence or by the  posteriori evidence of they effect if the two can be combine the subject may be consider as claim the dignity of a science even if the effect alone be certain it may be consider that we have a science of inferior degree want however that definiteness of law and that general plausibility which can only be give when true cause in accordance with antecedent experience in other case can be suggest now in regard to the  priori probability of the existence of planetary influence i be far from say that such a thing be impossible the discovery of modern philosophy have all tend to shew that there may be many thing about we unknown even to the scientific world but which well-followed accident reveal with the most positive certainty it be know that every beam of light be accompany by a beam of chemical agency totally undiscoverable to the sens of light or warmth but admit of separation from the luminous and warm ray and produce photogenic effect we know that there be disturbance of magnetism go on about we affect whole continent at a time unknown to man in general but traceable with facility and certainty and which doubtless affect even we brain and nerve -lrb- which be indisputably subject to the influence of magnetism -rrb- now in the face of these thing i will not undertake to say that there be any impossibility or even any want of plausibility in the supposition that body external to the earth may affect we it may well be cite in its favor that it be certain that the sun affect we magnetism -lrb- it be doubtful whether it do so _ im_mediately or mediately by give different degree of warmth to different part of the earth -rrb- and it be believe on inferior evidence that the moon also affect it it may therefore seem not impossible or unplausible that other celestial body may affect perhaps other of the power of nature about we but there i must stop the denial of the impossibility be no assertion of the truth or probability and i absolutely decline to take either side -- either that the influence be real or that the influence be unreal -- till i see evidence of they effect such evidence it be extremely difficult to extract from ordinary fact of observation i have allude to the sun 's daily disturbance of the magnet as one of the most certain of influence yet if you be to observe the magnet for a single day or perhaps for several day you might see no evidence of that influence so completely be it involve with other disturbance whose cause and law be totally unknown i believe that in addition to the effect ascribable to newtonian gravitation -lrb- as general motion of the earth precession of the equinox and tide -rrb- this magnetic disturbance be the only one yet establish as depend on a external body man in general however do not think so it appear to be a law of the human mind to love to trace a effect to a cause and to be ready to assent to any specious cause thus all practical man of the lower class even those whose pecuniary interest be concern in it believe firmly in the influence of the moon upon the wind and the weather i believe that every careful examiner of recorded fact -lrb- among whom i place myself as regard the wind -rrb- have come to the conclusion that the influence of the moon be not discoverable i point out these two thing -lrb- magnetic disturbance and weather -rrb- as tend to shew that notoriety or the assume consent of practical man be of no value the unnotorious matter may be quite certain the notorious matter may have no foundation everything must stand on its own evidence as completely digest and examine of such evidence the planetary influence have not a particle my intended short note have in the course of write grow up into a discourse of very unreasonable length and it be possible that a large portion of it have only increase obscurity at any rate i can add nothing i believe which can help to explain more fully my view on this matter \* \* \* \* \* in this year -lrb- 1862 June 9th -rrb- airy receive the honorary degree of lld in the university of cambridge he be nominate by the duke of devonshire as appear from the follow letter : lismore castle ireland _ April 19th 1862 _ my dear sir it be propose accord to usage to confer a considerable number of honorary degree on the occasion of my first visit to cambridge as chancellor of the university i hope that you will allow I to include you name in that portion of the list which i have be invite to draw up the ceremony be fix for the 10th of June i be my dear sir yours very truly devonshire _ the astronomer royal _ \* \* \* \* \* airy 's reply be as follow : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1862 April 21 _ my lord duke i be exceedingly gratify by you communication this day receive convey a proposal which i doubt not be suggest by you grace 's recollection of transaction now many year past i have always be desirous of maintain my connection with my university and have in various way interested myself practically in its concern it would give I great pleasure to have the connection strengthen in the flattering way which you propose i have conceive that alumnus of the university be not admissible to honorary degree but upon this point the information possess by you grace as chancellor of the university can not be dispute i be my lord duke you grace 's very faithful servant gb airy _ he grace the duke of devonshire _ \* \* \* \* \* there be in all 19 honorary degree of doctor of law confer on the 9th of June include man of such eminence as armstrong faraday and fairbairn 1863 in this year there be several scheme for a railway through the lower part of greenwich park the most important be the scheme of the london chatham and dover railway company in reference to this scheme the report to the visitor state i may say briefly that i believe that it would be possible to render such a railway innocuous to the observatory it would however be under restriction which might be feel annoying to the authority of the railway but whose relaxation would almost ensure ruin to the observatory -- the meridional observation of mar in the autumn of 1862 have be compare with those make at the observatory of williamstown near melbourne australium and they give for mean solar parallax the value 8932 exceed the receive value by about 1\/24th part -lrb- a value nearly identical with this 893 have also be find by compare the pulkowa and cape of good hope observation -rrb- -- the result of the new dip-instrument in 1861 and 1862 appear to give a firm foundation for speculation on the state and change of the dip as a general result i may state as probable that the value of dip in the middle of 1843 be about 69  1 ' and in the middle of 1862 about 68  11 ' the decrease of dip appear to be more rapid in the second half of this interval than in the first the dip at beginning of 1853 be about 68  44 ' -- with reference to the re-determination of the longitude of valencium it be state that the conclude longitude agree almost exactly with that determine by the transmission of chronometer in 1844 and entitle we to believe that the longitude of kingstown and liverpool step in the chronometer conveyance be determine with equal accuracy -- the computation for infer the direction and amount of movement of the solar system in space from the observe proper motion of 1167 star have be complete the result be that the sun be move towards a point ra 264  npd 65  -lrb- not very different from sir w herschel 's but depend much in npd on the accuracy of bradley 's quadrant observation -rrb- and that its annual motion subtend at the distance of a star of the first magnitude the angle 04 but the comparison of the sum of square of apparent proper motion uncorrected with the sum of square of apparent proper motion correct for motion of sun shew so small a advance in the explanation of the star 's apparent movement as to throw great doubt on the certainty of result the sum of square be diminish by only 1\/25th part -- i have be write strongly to maclear on the delay in publish both the geodetic work and the star catalogue at the cape of good hope : he resolve to go on with these work in December i be still very urgent about the geodesy of private history : there be the usual short visit to playford at the beginning and end of the year -- from June 27th to August 10th i be travel in the north and west of scotland with my wife my youngest son osmund and my daughter annot \* \* \* \* \* in this year the offer of knighthood -lrb- for the third time -rrb- be make to airy through the rt hon sir george c lewi bart the offer be accept on feb 12th 1863 but on the same day a second letter be write as follow : _ 1863 feb 12 _ dear sir i be extremely ignorant of all matter connect with court ceremonial and in reference to the propose knighthood would ask you : -- 1 i trust that there be no expense of fee to person like myself of small fortune a honor may sometimes be somewhat dear 2 my highest social rank be that give by my academical degree of dcl which i hold in the university of oxford and cambridge in regard to costume would it be proper that i should appear in the scarlet gown of that degree or in the ordinary court dress i be dear sir yours very faithfully gb airy _ the right honorable sir george c lewi bart & c & c & c _ to this letter sir gc lewi reply that the fee would amount to about _ # 30 _ a intimation which produce the following letter : royal observatory greenwich se _ 1863 feb 19th _ dear sir i have to acknowledge you letter of yesterday : and i advert to that part of it in which it be state that the fee on knighthood amount to about _ # 30 _ twenty-seven year ago the same rank be offer to I by lord john russell and mr spring rice -lrb- then minister of the crown -rrb- with the express notice that no fee would be payable i suppose that the usage -lrb- whatever it be -rrb- on which that notice be found still subsist to a person whose annual income little more than suffice to meet the annual expense of a very moderate establishment a unsought honor may be a incumbrance it appear at any rate oppose to the spirit of such a honor that it should be load with court expense in its very creation i hope that the principle state in 1835 may serve as precedent on this occasion i be dear sir you very faithful servant gb airy _ the right honorable sir g c lewi bart & c & c & c _ no intimation however be receive that the fee would be remit on the present occasion and after consideration the propose knighthood be decline in the follow letter : royal observatory greenwich se _ 1863 April 15 _ dear sir i have frequently reflect on the proposal make by you of the honor of knighthood to myself i be very grateful to you for the favourable opinion which you entertain in regard to my suppose claim to notice and for the kindness with which you propose publicly to express it but on consideration i be strongly impressed with the feeling that the condition attach by established regulation to the confer of such a honor would be unacceptable to I and that the honor itself would in reality under the circumstance of my family-establishment and in my social position be a incumbrance to I and finally i have think it best most respectfully and with a full sense of the kindness of yourself and of the queen 's government towards I to ask that the proposal might be defer there be another direction in which a step might be make affect my personal position in a smaller degree but not tend to incommode I which i would ask leave to submit to you consideration it be the definition of the rank of the astronomer royal the singular character of the office remove it from ordinary rule of rank and sometimes may produce a disagreeable contest of opinion the only office of similar character correspond in other condition to that of the british astronomer royal be those of the imperial astronomer at pulkowa -lrb- st petersburg -rrb- and pari in russium where every rank be clearly define by that of military grade the imperial astronomer have the rank of major-general in france the definition be less precise but the present imperial astronomer have be create -lrb- as a attachment of rank to the office -rrb- a senator of the empire i be dear sir you very faithful servant gb airy _ the rt hon sir george c lewi bart & c & c & c _ sir g c lewi die before receive this letter and the letter be afterwards forward to lord palmerston some correspondence follow between lord palmerston and airy on the subject of attach a definite rank to the office of astronomer royal as propose in the above letter but the home office -lrb- for various reason set forth -rrb- state that the suggestion could not be comply with and the whole subject drop 1864 the follow remark be extract from the report of the astronomer royal to the board of visitor -- in a very heavy squall which occur in the gale of December 2 of last year the stay of the lofty iron pillar outside of the park rail which carry we telegraph wire give way and the pillar and the whole system of wire fall -- a important alteration have be make in the magnetic observatory for several year past various plan have be under consideration for prevent large change of temperature in the room which contain the magnetic instrument at length i determine to excavate a subterraneous room or cellar under the original room the work be begin in the last week in January and in all important point it be now finish -- in the late spring some alarm be occasion by the discovery that the parliamentary standard of the pound weight have become coated with a extraneous substance produce by the decomposition of the lining of the case in which it be preserve it be decide immediately to compare it with the three parliamentary copy of which that at the observatory be one the national standard be find to be entirely uninjured -- on November 16 of last year the transit instrument narrowly escape serious injury from a accident the plate chain which carry the large western counterpoise break the counterpoise fall upon the pier destroy the massive gun-metal wheel of the lifting machinery but be prevent from fall further by the iron stay of the gas-burner flue -- the prismatic spectrum-apparatus have be complete in 1863 achromatic object-glass be place on both side of the prism so that each pencil of light through the prism consist of parallel ray and breadth be give to the spectrum by a cylindrical lens the spectral line be see straighter than before and generally it be believe that they definition be improve -- for observation of the small planet a convention have be make with m le verrier from new moon to full moon all the small planet visible to 13h be observe at the royal observatory of greenwich from full moon to new moon all be observe at the imperial observatory of paris the relief gain in this way be very considerable -- in determine the variation in the power of the horizontal-force and vertical-force magnet depend on temperature it be find by experiment that this depend materially on whether the magnet be heat by air or by water and ` the result of these experiment -lrb- with air -rrb- be to give a coefficient for temperature correction four or five time as great as that give by the water-heating ' -- with regard to the discordance of the result of observation of dip-needles experiment have be make with needle whose breadth be in the plane pass through the axis of rotation and it appear that the means of extreme discordance be for a ordinary needle 11 ' 45 and for a flat needle 3 ' 27 and the report continue thus : after this i need not say that i consider it certain that the small probable error which have be attribute to ordinary needle be a pure delusion -- the report state that in the various operation connect with the trial and repair of chronometer and the system of time-signal transmit to various time-ball and clock about one-fourth of the strength of the observatory be employ and it continue thus : view the close dependence of nautical astronomy upon accurate knowledge of time there be perhaps no department of the observatory which answer more completely to the original utilitarian intention of the founder of the royal observatory -- with regard to the proposal of time-signal at the start point it appear that communication refer to this proposal have pass between the board of admiralty and the board of trade of which the conclusion be that the board of trade possess no fund applicable to the defray of the expense attend the execution of the scheme and the admiralty do not at present contemplate the establishment of these time-signal under they own authority -- amongst other papers in this year airy 's paper entitle first analysis of 177 magnetic storm & c be read before the royal society of private history : there be the usual visit to playford in the beginning of the year -- from June 8th to 23rd i make a excursion with my son hubert to the isle of man and the lake district -- from sept 7th to 14th i be on a trip to cornwall with my two eldest son chiefly in the mining district -- in August of this year my eldest -lrb- survive -rrb- daughter hilda be marry to mr ej routh fellow of st peter 's college cambridge at greenwich parish church they afterwards reside at cambridge 1865 we telegraphic communication of every kind be again destroy by a snow-storm and gale of wind which occur on jan 28th and which break down nearly all the post between the royal observatory and the greenwich railway station -- the report to the visitor state that ` the only change of building which i contemplate as at present require be the erection of a fire-proof chronometer room the pecuniary value of chronometer store in the observatory be sometimes perhaps as much as _ # 8000 _ ' -- the south eastern and london chatham and dover scheme for a railway through the park be again bring forward there be a meeting of sir j hanmer 's committee at the observatory on may 26th mr stone be send hastily to dublin to make observation on earth-disturbance by railway there i have be before the committee on may 25th on sept 1st i approve of a amend plan in reference to this matter the report state that ` it be proper to remark that the shake of the altazimuth feel in the earthquake of 1863 oct 5th when no such shake be feel with instrument nearer to the ground -lrb- a experience which as i have hear on private authority be support by observation of artificial tremor -rrb- give reason to fear that at distance from a railway which would sufficiently defend the lower instrument the loftier instrument -lrb- as the altazimuth and the equatoreal -rrb- would be sensibly affect ' -- some of the magnet have be suspend by steel wire instead of silk of no greater strength than be necessary for safety and the report state that ` under the pressure of business the determination of various constant of adjustment be defer to the end of the year the immediate result of observation however begin to excite suspicion and after a time it be find that in spite of the length of the suspend wire -lrb- about 8 foot -rrb- the torsion-coefficient be not much less than 1\/6 the wire be promptly dismount and silk skein substitute for they with these the torsion-coefficient be about 1\/210 ' -- the dip-instrument which have give great trouble by the irregularity of the dip-result have be compare with two dip-instrument from kew observatory which give very good and accordant result ` it happen that mr simm by whom we instrument now in use be prepared and who have personally witness we former difficulty be present during some of these experiment we own instrument be place in he hand -lrb- nov 10th to 19th -rrb- for another purpose he spontaneously re-polish the apparently faultless agate-bearing to my great astonishment the inconsistency of every kind have nearly or entirely vanish on raise and lower the needle they return to the same reading and the dip with the same needle appear generally consistent ' some practical detail of the polish process by which this result have be secure be then give -- after numerous delay the apparatus for the self-registration of spontaneous earth current be bring into a work state in the month of march a description of the arrangement adopt be give in the report -- ` all chronometer on trial be rate every day by comparison with one of the clock sympathetic with the motor clock every chronometer whether on trial or return from a chronometer-maker as repair be try at least once in the heat of the chronometer-oven the temperature be usually limit to 90  fahrenheit and guide by the result of very long experience we have establish it as a rule that every trial in heat be continue through three week ' -- ` the only employment extraneous to the observatory which have occupy any of my time within the last year be the give three lecture on the magnetism of iron ship -lrb- at the request of the lord of the committee of council on education -rrb- in the theater of the south kensington museum the preparation however for these lecture to be give in a room ill-adapted to they occupy a great deal of my own time and of the time of a assistant of the observatory ' -- ` refer to a matter in which the interest of astronomy be deeply concerned i think it right to report to the visitor my late representation to the government to the effect that in reference to possible observation of the transit of venus in 1882 it will be necessary in no long time to examine the coast of the great southern continent ' of private history : there be the usual visit to playford at the beginning and end of the year -- from June 18th to 26th i be on a trip in wale with my son hubert and osmund -- from sept 6th to oct 2nd i be stay with most of my family at portinscale near keswick : we return by barnard castle rokeby & c chapter viii at greenwich observatory -- 1866 to 1876 1866 in this year the cube of the transit circle be pierce to permit reciprocal observation of the collimator without raise the instrument this involve the construction of improve collimator which form the subject of a special address to the member of the board of visitor on oct 21st 1865 -- from the report to the visitor it appear that on may 23rd 1865 a thunderstorm of great violence pass very close to the observatory after one flash of lightning i be convince that the principal building be strike several galvanometer in the magnetic basement be destroy lately it have be remark that one of the old chimney of the principal building have be dislocate and slightly twist at a place where it be surround by a iron stay-band lead from the telegraph pole which be plant upon the lead of the octagon room -- on consideration of the serious interruption to which we have several time be expose from the destruction of we open-air park-wire -lrb- through snow-storm and gale -rrb- i have make a arrangement for lead the whole of we wire in underground pipe as far as the greenwich railway station -- the committee of the house of common to whom the greenwich and woolwich line of the south eastern railway be refer finally assent to the adoption of a line which i indicate pass between the building of the hospital school and the public road to woolwich -- the galvanic chronometer attach to the s e equatoreal often give we a great deal of trouble at last i determine on the proposal of mr elli to attempt a extension of mr r l jone 's regulate principle it be well know that mr jone have with great success introduce the system of apply galvanic current originate in the vibration of a normal pendulum not to drive the wheelwork of other clock but to regulate to exact agreement the rate of they pendulum which be independently nearly in agreement each clock be drive by weight-power as before the same principle be now apply to the chronometer the construction be perfectly successful the chronometer remain in coincidence with the transit clock through any length of time with a small constant error as be require by mechanical theory -- the print volume of observation for 1864 have two appendix one contain the calculation of the value of the moon 's semi-diameter deduce from 295 occultation observe at cambridge and greenwich from 1832 to 1860 and shew that the occultation semi-diameter be less than the telescopic semi-diameter by 2 the other contain the reduction of the planetary observation make at the royal observatory in the year 1831-1835 fill up the gap between the planetary reduction 1750-1830 make several year ago under my superintendence and the reduction contain in the greenwich volume 1836 to the present time : and conduct on the same general principle -- some trouble have be find in regulate the temperature of the magnetic basement but it be anticipate that in future there would be no difficulty in keep down the annual variation within about 5  and the diurnal variation within 3  -- longitude in america be determine in this year by way of valencium and newfoundland : finish by nov 14th of private history : in April he make a short visit to ventnor in the isle of wight -- from June 15th to July 23rd he be on a expedition in norway with he son osmund and he nephew gorell barne -- there be probably a short stay at playford in the winter in this and in the previous year -lrb- 1865 -rrb- the free-thinking investigation of colenso the bishop of natal have attract much notice and have procure he the virulent hostility of a numerous section he income be withhold from he and in consequence a subscription fund be raise for he support by he admirer airy who always take the liberal side in such question be a subscriber to the fund and write the following letter to the bishop : royal observatory greenwich se _ 1865 July 24 _ my lord with many thanks i have to acknowledge you kind recollection of I in send as a presentation copy the work on joshua judge and especially on the divide authorship of genesis a work whose investigation found in great measure on severe and extensive verbal criticism will apparently bear comparison with you lordship 's most remarkable examination of deuteronomy i should however not do justice to my own appreciation if i do not remark that there be other point consider which have long be matter of interest to I on several matter some of they important my present conclusion do not absolutely agree with you lordship 's but i be not the less grateful for the amount of erudition and think carefully direct to definite point and above all for the noble example of unwearied research and freedom in state its consequence in reference to subject which scarcely ever occupy the attention of the clergy in we country i be my lord yours very faithfully gb airy _ the lord bishop of natal _ \* \* \* \* \* here also be a letter on the same subject write to professor selwyn professor of divinity at cambridge : -- royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1866 may 5 _ my dear sir the m concern colenso duly arrive i note you remark on the merit of colenso i do not write to tell you that i differ from you but to tell you why i differ i think that you do not make the proper distinction between a person who invent or introduce a tool and the person who use it the most resolute antigravitationist that ever live might yet acknowledge he debt to newton for the method of prime and ultimate ratio and the principle of fluxion by which newton seek to establish gravitation so let it be with colenso he have give I a power of trace out truth to a certain extent which i never could have obtain without he and for this i be very grateful as to the further employment of this power you know that he and i use it to totally different purpose but not the less do i say that i owe to he a new intellectual power i quite agree with you that the sudden disruption of the old traditional view seem to have unhinge he mind and to have send he too far on the other side i would not give a pin for he judgment nevertheless i wish he would go over the three remain book of the tetrateuch i know something of myer but i should not have think he likely to produce anything sound on such thing as the hebrew scripture i never see he thought i be my dear sir yours very truly gb airy _ professor selwyn _ \* \* \* \* \* the follow letter have reference to airy 's proposal to introduce certain physico-mathematical subject into the senate-house examination for ba honor at cambridge on various occasion he sharply criticize the papers set for the senate-house examination and the smith 's prize examination and greatly lament the grow importance of pure mathematics and the comparative exclusion of physical question in those examination he proposal as finally submit in the letter that follow be somewhat modify -lrb- as regard the mode of introduce the subject -rrb- from he original draft in deference to the opinion of whewell adam routh and other friend to whom he have submit it he proposal be favourably receive by the mathematical board and recommendation be make in the direction though not to the extent that he desire and he subsequently submit a memorandum on those recommendation : royal observatory greenwich _ 1866 may 11 _ my dear sir you will perceive from perusal of the enclosed paper that i have act on the permission which you kindly give I to transmit to you my proposal for extension of the mathematical education of the university in the physical direction it be a unavoidable consequence of the structure of the university that study there will have a tendency to take a unpractical form depend much on the personal taste of special examiner i trust that as a person whose long separation from the daily business of the university have enable he to see in some measure the want of the external scientific and practical world i may be forgive this attempt to bring to the notice of the university my idea on the point towards which they attention might perhaps be advantageously turn i be my dear sir very faithfully yours gb airy _ the rev dr cartmell master of christ 's college and vice-chancellor _ royal observatory greenwich _ 1866 may 11 _ my dear mr vice-chancellor about two year ago by the kindness of the university a opportunity be present to I of orally state what i conceive to be deficiency in the educational course of the university as regard mathematical physics since that time the consideration of those deficiency which have long be present to I have urge itself on my attention with greater force : and finally i have entertain the idea that i might without impropriety communicate to you my opinion in a less fugitive form than on the occasion to which i have allude : with the request that if you should deem such a course appropriate you would bring it before the board of mathematical study and perhaps ultimately make it know to the resident member of the senate i will first give the list of subject which i should wish to see introduce and to the prosecution of which the generally admirable course of the university be remarkably well adapt : and i will then without enter into every detail advert to the process by which i think it probable the introduction of these subject could be effect in the follow list the first head be purely algebraical and the second nearly so : but they be closely related to observational science and to the physical subject which follow some of the subject which i exhibit on my list be partially but in my opinion imperfectly teach at present i entirely omit from my list physical optics geometrical astronomy and gravitational astronomy of point : because to the extent to which academical education ought to go i believe that there be no teaching on these science comparable to that in the university of cambridge -lrb- it be of course still possible that improvement may be make in the book commonly use -rrb- it might however be a question whether as regard the time and manner of teach they some part of these subject might ultimately be associate with the other subject include in my list i _ list of subject propose for consideration _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- partial differential equation to the second order with they arbitrary function : select principally with reference to the physical subject -lrb- 2 -rrb- the theory of probability as apply to the combination of observation -lrb- 3 -rrb- mechanic -lrb- include hydraulic power -rrb- in the state which verge upon practical application and especially include that part in which the abstract idea of _ power _ and _ duty _ occur -lrb- 4 -rrb- attraction this subject be recognize in the exist course of the university : but so far as i can infer from examination-papers it appear to be very lightly pass over -lrb- 5 -rrb- the figure of the earth and its consequence precession & c i believe that the proposal be sanction of adopt some part of this theory in the ordinary course but perhaps hardly so far as be desirable -lrb- 6 -rrb- the tide -lrb- 7 -rrb- wave of water -lrb- 8 -rrb- sound -lrb- beginning with newton 's investigation -rrb- echo pipe and vibrate string acoustic the mathematical part of music -lrb- 9 -rrb- magnetism terrestrial and experimental and they connection -lrb- i omit for the present mineralogy and mathematical electricity -rrb- this list of subject appear formidable : but they be in reality easy and would be master in a short time by the higher wrangler ii _ mode of introduce these subject into the university _ after much consideration and after learn the opinion of several person whose judgment claim my deepest respect i propose the gradual introduction of these subject into the examination for honor at admission to the ba degree as soon as the preparation of book and the readiness of examiner shall enable the university to take that step i conceive that by a judicious pruning of the somewhat luxuriant growth of pure algebra analytical geometry and mere problem sufficient leisure may be gain for the study of the undergraduate and sufficient time for the question of the examiner i do not contemplate that the student could advance very far into the subject but i know the importance of begin they and judge from the train of thought of reading and of conversation among the bachelor with whom i associate many year ago i believe that there be quite a sufficient number who will be anxious to go deep into the subject if they have once enter into they if six wrangler annually would take they up my point would be gain the part which these gentleman might be expect in a short time to take in the government of the university would enable they soon to act steadily upon the university course : the efficiency of the university instruction would be increase and the external character of the university would be raise the real difficulty and they be not light one would probably be find in provide examiner and book at present both be want within the university where there be a great and well-founded objection to intrust examination to person foreign to the university and where the book have to be create with labor and with absolute outlay of money -lrb- for they sale could never be remunerative -rrb- the progress must be slow still progress would be certain if the authority of the university should think the matter deserving of they hearty encouragement request that you and the member of the university will accept this proposal as a indication of my deep attachment to my university i be my dear mr vice-chancellor you very faithful servant gb airy _ the rev dr cartmell & c & c vice-chancellor of the university of cambridge _ 1867 in this year it be arrange that my treasury account be to be transfer to the admiralty make the simplification which i have so long desire -- from the report to the visitor it appear that a relic of the geodetic operation commence in 1787 for connect the observatory of greenwich and pari in the shape of a observe cabin on the roof of the octagon room be shift and support in such a manner that the pressure on the flat roof be entirely avoid -- with regard to the transit circle the new collimator with telescope of seven inch aperture have be mount when the transit telescope direct vertically be interpose the interruption in the central cube impair the sharpness of definition still leave it abundantly good for general use it have be regard as probable that the astronomical flexure of the telescope after cut away small portion of the central cube would be find sensibly change : and this prove to be the case the difference of flexure of the two end have be alter more than a second of arc -- refer to a new portable altazimuth which have lately be test the report state as follow : ' i may mention that a study of defect in the vertical circle of a small altazimuth formerly use by I and a inspection of the operation in the instrument-maker 's work-shop have convince I that the principal error to be fear in instrument of this class be ovality of the graduate limb this can not be eliminate by two microscope and such a instrument should never be fit with two only we instrument have four ' -- ` in osler 's anemometer a surface of 2 square foot be now expose to the wind instead of one foot as formerly and the plate be support by weak vertical spring instead of rod run on roller its indication be much more delicate than formerly ' -- ` the meteor on nov 14th be well observe eight thousand and three hundred be register the variation of frequency at different time be very well note the point of divergence be carefully determine ' -- refer to the gradual improvement in the steadiness of chronometer from 1851 to 1866 it appear that from 1851 to 1854 the ` trial number ' -lrb- which be a combination of change of weekly rate represent the fault of the chronometer -rrb- vary from 348 to 525 while from 1862 to 1866 it vary from 212s to 258s -- the follow statement will shew the usual steadiness of the great clock on the westminster palace : on 38 per cent of day of observation the clock 's error be below 1 on 38 per cent the error be between 1 and 2 on 21 per cent it be between 2 and 3 on 2 per cent between 3 and 4 on 1 per cent between 4 and 5 -- the report contain a account of the determination of the longitude of cambridge we by dr b a gould by means of galvanic current through the atlantic cable in the spring of 1867 : and advantage be take of this opportunity for re-determine the longitude of feagh main near valencium in ireland the longitude of feagh main find by different method be as follow : by chronometer in 1844 41m 2323 by galvanic communication with knight 's town in 1862 41m 2337 by galvanic communication with foilhommerum in 1866 41m 2319 the collect result for longitude of cambridge we from different source be : by moon-culminator -lrb- walker in 1851 and newcomb in 1862-3 -rrb- 4h 44m 2842 and 4h 44m

have commence print they observation in detail the report continue thus : ` whether the effect of this movement will be that million of useless observation will be add to the million that already exist or whether something may be expect to result which will lead to a meteorological theory i can not hazard a conjecture this only i believe that it will be useless at present to attempt a process of mechanical theory and that all that can be do must be to connect phenomenon by law of induction but the induction must be carry out by numerous and troublesome trial in different direction the greater part of which would probably be failure ' -- there be this year a annular eclipse i make large preparation at the limit of the annularity fail entirely from very bad weather -- in this year airy contribute a paper to the institution of civil engineer ` on the use of the suspension bridge with stiffened roadway for railway and other bridge of great span ' for which a telford medal be award to he by the council of the institution and he communicate several papers to the royal society and the royal astronomical society of private history : there be the usual visit to playford in

fellow elect by the college the announcement be make in a letter from the master of trinity -lrb- wh thompson -rrb- and airy 's reply be as follow : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1867 June 12th _ my dear master i be very much gratify by you kind note receive this morning convey to I the notice that the master and sixteen senior fellow have elect I under they new power as honorary fellow of the college it have always be my wish to maintain a friendly connection with my college and i be delighted to receive this response from the college the peculiar form in which the reference to the statute enable they to put it render it doubly please as the statute be new i should be oblige by a copy of it and at any convenient time i should be glad to know the name of the person with whom i be so honorably associate i be my dear master very faithfully yours gb airy \* \* \* \* \* consequent on airy 's proposal in 1866 for the introduction of new physical subject into the senate-house examination and he desire that the large number of question set in pure mathematics or as he term it useless algebra should be curtail there be a smart and interesting correspondence between he and prof cayley who be the great exponent and advocate of pure mathematics at cambridge both of they be man of the highest mathematical power but diametrically oppose in they view of the use of mathematics airy regard mathematics as simply a useful machine for the solution of practical problem and arrive at practical result he have a great respect for pure mathematics and all the process of algebra so far as they aid he to solve he problem and to arrive at useful result but he have a positive aversion to mathematical investigation however skilful and elaborate for which no immediate practical value could be claim cayley on the contrary regarded mathematics as a useful exercise for the mind apart from any immediate practical object and he consider that the general command of mathematics gain by handle abstruse mathematical investigation -lrb- though barren in themselves -rrb- would be valuable for whatever purpose mathematics might be require : he also think it likely that he research and advance in the field of pure mathematics might facilitate the solution of physical problem and tend to the progress of the practical science they different view on this subject will be see from the letter that follow : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1867 nov 8 _ my dear sir i think it best to put in write the purport of what i have say or have intend to say in reference to the mathematical study in the university first i will remark on the study of partial differential equation i do not know that one branch of pure mathematics can be consider higher than another except in the utility of the power which it give measure thus the partial differential equation be very useful and therefore stand very high as far as the second order they apply to that point in the most important way to the great problem of nature concern _ time _ and _ infinite division of matter _ and _ space _ : and be worthy of the most careful study beyond that order they apply to nothing it be for the purpose of limit the study to the second order and at the same time work it carefully philosophically and practically up to that point that i draw up my little work on the general question of mathematical study i will first give my lead idea on what i may call the moral part i think that a heavy responsibility rest on the person who influence most strongly the course of education in the university to direct that course in the way in which it will be most useful to the student -- in the two way of discipline they power and habit and of give they scientific knowledge of the highest and most accurate order -lrb- apply to the phenomenon of nature -rrb- such as will be useful to they through life i do not think that the mere personal taste of a teacher be sufficient justification for a special course unless it have be adopt under a consideration of that responsibility now i can say for myself that i have for some year inspect the examination papers and have consider the bearing of the course which they imply upon the education of the student and be firmly convince that as regard man below the very few first -- say below the ten first -- there be a prodigious loss of time without any permanent good whatever for the great majority of man such subject as abstract analytical geometry perish at once with man like adam and stoke they remain and be advantageous but probably there be not a single man -lrb- beside they -rrb- of they respective year who remember a bit or who if he remember they have the leisure and other opportunity of apply they i believe on the other hand that a careful selection of physical subject would enable the university to communicate to its student a vast amount of information of accurate kind and require the most logical treatment but so bear upon the natural phenomenon which be constantly before we that it would be feel by every student to possess a real value that -lrb- from that circumstance -rrb- it would dwell in he mind and that it would enable he to correct a great amount of flimsy education in the country and so far to raise the national character the consideration of the education of the reasoning habit suggest idea far from favourable to the exist course i be old enough to remember the time of mere geometrical process and i do not hesitate to say that for the cultivation of accurate mental discipline they be far superior to the operation in vogue at the present day there be no subject in the world more favourable to logical habit than the differential calculus in all its branch _ if logically work in its element _ : and i think that its application to various physical subject compelling from time to time a attention to the elementary grounds of the calculus would be far more advantageous to that logical habit than the simple application to pure equation and pure algebraical geometry now occupy so much attention i be my dear sir yours very truly gb airy _ professor cayley _ \* \* \* \* \* dear sir i have be intend to answer you letter of the 8th November so far as it be -lrb- if at all -rrb- personal to myself i would remark that the statutory duty of the sadlerian professor be that he shall explain and teach the principle of pure mathematics and apply himself to the advancement of the science as to partial differential equation they be high as be a inverse problem and perhaps the most difficult inverse problem that have be deal with in regard to the limitation of they to the second order whatever other reason exist for it there be also the reason that the theory to this order be as yet so incomplete that there be no inducement to go beyond it there could hardly be a more valuable step than anything which would give a notion of the form of the general integral of a partial differential equation of the second order i can not but differ from you _ in toto _ as to the educational value of analytical geometry or i would rather say of modern geometry generally it appear to I that in the physical science depend on partial differential equation there be scarcely anything that a student can do for himself : -- he find the integral of the ordinary equation for sound -- if he wish to go a step further and integrate the non-linear equation -lrb- dy\/dx -rrb-  -lrb- d  y\/dt  -rrb- = a  -lrb- d  y\/dx  -rrb- he be simply unable to do so and so in other case there be nothing that he can add to what he find in he book whereas geometry -lrb- of course to a intelligent student -rrb- be a real inductive and deductive science of inexhaustible extent in which he can experiment for himself -- the very trace of a curve from its equation -lrb- and still more the consideration of the case belong to different value of the parameter -rrb- be the construction of a theory to bind together the fact -- and the selection of a curve or surface proper for the verification of any general theorem be the selection of a experiment in proof or disproof of a theory i do not quite understand you reference to stoke and adam as type of the man who alone retain they abstract analytical geometry if a man when he take he degree drop mathematics he drop geometry -- but if not i think for the above reason that he be more likely to go on with it than with almost any other subject -- and any mathematical journal will shew that a very great amount of attention be in fact give to geometry and the subject be in a very high degree a progressive one quite as much as to physics one may apply to it the line yet i doubt not thro ' the age one increase purpose run and the thought of man be widen with the progress of the sun i remain dear sir yours very sincerely a cayley cambridge _ 6 dec 1867 _ \* \* \* \* \* royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1867 December 9 _ my dear sir i have receive with much pleasure you letter of December 6 in this university discussion i have act only in public and have not make private communication to any person whatever till require to do so by private letter address to I you few word in queen ' hall seem to expect a little reply now as to the modern geometry with you praise of this science -- as to the room for extension in induction and deduction & c and with you fact -- as to the amount of space which it occupy in mathematical journal i entirely agree and if man after leave cambridge be design to shut themselves up in a cavern they could have nothing better for they subjective amusement they might have other thing as good enormous complication and probably beautiful investigation might be find in vary the game of billiards with novel island on a newly shape billiard table but the person who devote themselves to these subject do thereby separate themselves from the world they make no step towards natural science or utilitarian science the two subject which the world specially desire the world could go on as well without these separatist now if these person live only for themselves no other person would have any title to question or remark on they devotion to this barren subject but a cambridge examiner be not in that position the university be a national body for education of young man : and the power of a cambridge examiner be omnipotent in direct the education of the young man and he responsibility to the cause of education be very distinct and very strong and the question for he to consider be -- in the sense in which mathematical education be desire by the best authority in the nation be the course take by this national institution satisfactory to the nation i express my belief that it be _ not _ satisfactory i believe that many of the best man of the nation consider that a great deal of time be lose on subject which they esteem as puerile and that much of that time might be employ on noble and useful science you may remember that the commission which have visit cambridge originate in a memorial address to the government by man of respected scientific character : sabine be one and i may take he as the representative he be a man of extensive knowledge of the application of mathematics as it have be employ for many year in the science of the world but he have no profundity of science he as i believe desire to find person who could enter accurately into mathematical science and naturally look to the great mathematical university but he must have be much disappointed so much time be swallow up by the forced study of the pure mathematics that it be not easy to find anybody who can really enter on these subject in which man of science want assistance and so sabine thought that the government ought to interfere probably without any clear idea of what they could do i be my dear sir yours very truly gb airy _ professor cayley _ \* \* \* \* \* dear sir i have to thank you for you last letter i do not think everything should be subordinate to the educational element : my idea of a university be that of a place for the cultivation of all science therefore among other science pure mathematics include whatever be interesting as part of this science i be bind therefore to admit that you propose extension of the problem of billiards _ if it _ be find susceptible of interesting mathematical development would be a fit subject of study but in this case i do not think the problem could fairly be object to as puerile -- a more legitimate objection would i conceive be its extreme speciality but this be not a objection that can be bring against modern geometry as a whole : in regard to any particular part of it which may appear open to such a objection the question be whether they be or be not for they own sake or they bearing upon other part of the science to which they belong worthy of be enter upon and pursued but admit -lrb- as i do not -rrb- that pure mathematics be only to be study with a view to natural and physical science the question still arise how be they best to be study in that view i assume and admit that as to a large part of modern geometry and of the theory of number there be no present probability that these will find any physical application but among the remain part of pure mathematics we have the theory of elliptic function and of the jacobian and abelian function and the theory of differential equation include of course partial differential equation now take for instance the problem of three body -- unless this be to be go on with by the mere improvement in detail of the present approximate method -- it be at least conceivable that the future treatment of it will be in the direction of the problem of two fixed centre by means of elliptic function & c and that the discovery will be make not by search for it directly with the mathematical resource now at we command but by prospect for it in the field of these function even improvement in the exist method be more likely to arise from a study of differential equation in general than from a special one of the equation of the particular problem : the material for such improvement which exist in the writings of hamilton jacobus bertrand and bour have certainly so arise and the like remark would apply to the physical problem which depend on partial differential equation i think that the course of mathematical study at the university be likely to be a better one if regulate with a view to the cultivation of science as if for its own sake rather than directly upon consideration of what be educationally best -lrb- i mean that the best educational course will be so obtain -rrb- and that we have thus a justification for a thorough study of pure mathematics in my own limited experience of examination the fault which i find with the man be a want of analytical power and that whatever else may have be in defect pure mathematics have certainly not be in excess i remain dear sir yours sincerely a cayley cambridge _ 10th dec 1867 _ \* \* \* \* \* _ 1867 December 17 _ my dear sir since receive you letter of 9th i positively have not have time to express the single remark which i propose to make on it you state you idea that the educational element ought not to be the predominate element in the university i do not think that every thing should be subordinate to the educational element i can not conceal my surprise at this sentiment assuredly the founder of the college intend they for education -lrb- so far as they apply to person in statu pupillarus -rrb- the statute of the university and the college be frame for education and father send they son to the university for education if i have not have you word before I i should have say that it be impossible to doubt this it be much to be desire that professor and other who exercise no control by force should take every method not only of promote science in themselves but also of place the promote science before student : and it be much to be desire that student who have pass the compulsory curriculum should be encourage to proceed into the novelty which will be most agreeable to they but this be a totally different thing from use the compulsory force of examination to drive student in path trace only by the taste of the examiner for they i conceive the obligation to the nation and the duty to follow the national sense on education -lrb- as far as it can be gather from its best representative -rrb- to be undoubted and to be in the intensity of the obligation and duty most serious i be my dear sir yours very truly gb airy _ professor cayley _ \* \* \* \* \* 1868 in the south-east dome the alteration propose last year for render the building fire-proof have be completely carry out the middle room which be to be appropriate to chronometer be be fit up accordingly -- from the report it appear that ` we subterranean telegraph wire be all break by one blow from a accident in the metropolitan drainage work on groom 's hill but be speedily repair ' -- in my office as chairman of successive commission on standard i have collect a number of standard some of great historical value -lrb- as ramsden 's and roy 's standard of length kater 's scale-beam for weigh great weight and other -rrb- & c these have be transfer to the newly-created standard department of the board of trade -- in the report be give a detailed account of the system of preserving and arrange the manuscript and correspondence of the observatory which be always regard by airy as a matter of the first importance -- from a careful discussion of the result of observation mr stone have conclude that the refraction ought to be diminish ` rely on this we have now compute we mean refraction by diminish those of bessel 's fundamenta in the proportion of 1 to 099797 ' -- the magnetometer-indication for the period 1858-1863 have be reduce and discuss with remarkable result it be infer that magnetic disturbance both solar and lunar be produce mediately by the earth and that the earth in period of several year undergo change which fit it and unfit it for exercise a powerful mediate action -- the earth-current record have be reduce and the magnetic effect which the current would produce have be compute the result be that the agreement between the magnetic effect so computed and the magnetic disturbance really record by the magnetometer be such as to leave no doubt on the general validity of the explanation of the great storm-disturbance of the magnet as consequence of the galvanic current through the earth -- refer to the difficulty experience in make the meteorological observation practically available the report state thus : ` the want of meteorology at the present time be principally in suggestive theory ' -- in this year airy communicate to the royal astronomical society a paper ` on the preparatory arrangement for the observation of the transit of venus 1874 and 1882 ' : this subject be now well in hand -- the first report of the commissioner -lrb- of whom he be chairman -rrb- appoint to enquire into the condition of the exchequer standard be print : this business take up much time -- he be in this year much engage on the coinage commission of private history : there be the usual winter visit to playford and a short visit to cambridge in June -- from about aug 1st to sept 3rd he be travel in switzerland with he youngest son and he two youngest daughter in the course of this journey they visit zermatt there have be much rain the river be greatly flood and much mischief be do to the road during the journey from visp to zermatt near st nichola in a steep part of the gorge a large stone roll from the cliff and knock they baggage horse over the lower precipice a fall of several hundred foot the package be all burst and many thing be lose but a good deal be recover by man suspend by rope in this year also airy be busy with the subject of university examination which in previous year have occupy so much of he attention as will be see from the follow letter : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1868 march 12 _ my dear master i have have the pleasure of correspond with you on matter of university examination so frequently that i at once turn to you as the proper person to whom i may address any remark on that important subject circumstance have enable I lately to obtain private information of a most accurate kind on the late mathematical tripos : and among other thing i have receive a statement of every individual question answer or partly answer by five honour-man i have collect the number of these in a small table which i enclose i be strike with the _ almost _ nugatory character of the five day ' honor examination as apply to senior optime and i do not doubt that it be _ totally _ nugatory as apply to junior optime it appear to I that for all that depend on these day the rank of the optime be mere matter of chance in the examination of the civil service the whole number of mark be publish and also the number of mark gain by each candidate i have none of they papers at hand but my impression be that the lowest candidate make about 1 in 3 and the fair candidate about 2 in 3 instead of 1 in 10 or 1 in 13 as we good senior optime i be my

petition parliament against the abolition of religious declaration require of person admit to fellowship or proceed to the degree of ma the document be send to airy for he signature and he reply be as follow : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1868 march 18 _ my dear sir though i sympathize to a great extent with the prayer of the petition to parliament which you send to I yesterday and assent to most of the reason i do not attach my signature to it for the follow consideration : 1 i understand from the introductory clause and from the unqualified character of the phrase any such measure in the second clause that the petition object to grant the ma degree without religious declaration i do not see any adequate necessity for this objection and i can not join in it 2 it appear to I that the college be intend for two collateral object : -- instruction by part of the fellow on a religious basis and support of certain fellow for scientific purpose without the same ostentatious connection with religion i like this spirit well and should be glad to maintain it 3 i therefore think -lrb- as i have publicly state before -rrb- that the master of the college ought to be in holy order and so ought those of the fellow who may be expect to be usually resident and to take continuous part in the instruction but there be many who upon take a fellowship at once lay aside all thought of this : and i think that such person ought not to be trammel with declaration 4 my modification of exist regulation if it once get into shape would i dare say be but a small fraction of that propose by the measure in contemplation still i do not like to join in unqualified resistance to interference in the affair of the established college with that generality of opposition to interference which the petition seem to intimate i agree with article 3 4 and 5 and i be please with the graceful allusion in article 4 to the assistance which have be render by the college and by none perhaps so honourably as trinity to the parish connect with it and i could much wish that the spirit of 3 and 5 could be carry out with some concession to my idea in _ my _ paragraph 3 above i be my dear sir yours very truly gb airy _ rev dr lightfoot _ \* \* \* \* \* 1869 from the report to the board of visitor it appear that application have be make for a extension of the grounds of the observatory to a distance of 100 foot south of the magnetic ground and that a warrant for the annexation of this space be sign on 1868 dec 8 the new dept for the print production of the observatory have be transfer to its position in the new ground and the foundation for the great shed be complete -- the course of we wire for the registration of spontaneous terrestrial galvanic current have be entirely change the line to croydon and deptford be abandon and for these be substitute a line from angerstein wharf to lady well station and a line from north kent junction to morden college tunnel at each of these point the communication with earth be make by a copper plate 2 foot square the straight line connect the extreme point of the first station intersect that connect the two point of the second station nearly at right angle and at little distance from the observatory -- the question of dependence of the measurable amount of sidereal aberration upon the thickness of glass or other transparent material in the telescope -lrb- a question which involve theoretically one of the most delicate point in the undulatory theory of light -rrb- have lately be agitate on the continent with much earnestness i have calculate the curvature of the lens of crown and flint glass -lrb- the flint be exterior -rrb- for correct spherical and chromatic aberration in a telescope whose tube be fill with water and have instruct mr simm to proceed with the preparation of a instrument carry such a telescope i have not finally decide whether to rely on zenith-distance of gamma draconi or on right-ascension of polari in any form the experiment will probably be troublesome -- the transit of mercury on 1868 nov 4th be observe by six observer the atmospheric condition be favourable and the singular appearance usually present in a planetary transit be well see -- mr stone have attach to the south-east equatoreal a thermo-multiplier with the view of examine whether heat radiate from the principal star can be make sensible in we instrument the result hitherto obtain be encouraging but they shew clearly that it be vain to attempt this enquiry except in the most superb weather and there have not be a night deserving that epithet for some month past -- the preparation for observe the transit of venus be now begin in earnest i have come to the conclusion that after every reliance be place on foreign and colonial observatory it would be necessary for the british government to undertake the equipment of five or six temporary station on feb 15th i send a pamphlet on the subject to mr childer -lrb- first lord of admiralty -rrb- and in April i write to the secretary ask authority for the purchase of instrument on June 22nd authority be give to I for the instrument : the treasury assent to _ # 10500 _ on August 9th i have purchase 3 equatoreal -- i have give a short course of lecture in the university of cambridge on the subject of magnetism with the view of introduce that important physical science into the study of the university the want of book available to student and the novelty of the subject make the preparation more laborious than the duration of the lecture would seem to imply -- in this year there be much work on the standard commission chiefly regard the suggest abolition of troy weight and several papers on the subject be prepare by airy -- he also write a long and careful description of the great equatoreal at greenwich of private history : there be the usual visit to playford in the winter mr airy be now become feebler and do not now leave greenwich : since April of this year she letter be write in pencil and with difficulty but she still make great effort to keep up the accustomed correspondence -- in April airy go to cambridge to deliver he lecture on magnetism to the undergraduate : the following passage occur in one of he letter at this time : i have a mighty attendance -lrb- there be 147 name on my board yesterday -rrb- and though the room be large with plenty of bench i have be oblige to bring in some chair the man be exceedingly attentive and when i look up i be quite strike to see the number of face stare into mine i go at 12 and find man at the room copying from my big papers : i lecture from 1 to 2 and stop till after 3 and through the last hour some man be talk to I and other be copy from the papers and i usually leave some man still at work the man applaud and shew they respect very gracefully there be present some two or three person who attend my former lecture and they say that i lecture exactly as i do formerly one of my attendant be a man that they say can not from year and infirmity and habit be induce to go anywhere else : dr archdall the master of emmanuel i find that some of my old lecturing habit come again on I i drink a great deal of cold water and be very glad to go to bed early -- from June 10th-30th he be travel in scotland and stay at barrow house near keswick -lrb- the residence of mr langton -rrb- with he son hubert -- subsequently from aug 17th to 31st he be again in the lake district with he daughter christabel and be join there by he son hubert on the 24th the first part of the time be spend at tarn bank near carlisle the residence of mr isaac fletcher mp from thence he make several expedition especially to barrow in furness and seascale where he witness with great interest the bessemer process of make steel from barrow house he make continual excursion among the cumberland mountain which he know so well 1870 in this year mr stone the first assistant be appoint to the cape of good hope observatory and resign he post of first assistant mr christie be appoint in he place -- from the report to the visitor it appear that ' a few month since we be annoy by a failure in the illumination of the field of view of the transit circle the reflector be clean but in vain at last it be discover that one of the lens -lrb- the convex lens -rrb- of the combination which form the object-glass of a reversed telescope in the interior of the transit-axis and through which all illuminating light must pass have become so corrode as to be almost opaque ' -- the south-east equatoreal have be partly occupy with the thermo-multiplier employ by mr stone for the measure of heat radiate from the principal star mr stone 's result for the radiation from arcturus and alpha lyra appear to be incontrovertible and to give basis for distinct numerical estimation of the radiant heat of these star -- in my last report i allude to a propose systematic reduction of the meteorological observation during the whole time of they efficient self-registration have receive from the admiralty the fund necessary for immediate operation i have commence with the photographic register of the thermometer dry-bulb and wet-bulb from 1848 to 1868 -- we chronometer-room contain at present 219 chronometer include 37 chronometer which have be place here by chronometer-maker as compete for the honorary reputation and the pecuniary advantage to be derive from success in the half-year 's trial to which they be subject i take this opportunity of state that i have uniformly advocate the policy of offer good price for the chronometer of great excellence and that i have give much attention to the decision on they merit and i be convince that this system have greatly contribute to the remarkably steady improvement in the performance of chronometer in the trial which terminate in August 1869 the best chronometer -lrb- take as usual the average of the first six -rrb- be superior in merit to those of any preceding year -- with the fund place at my disposal for the transit of venus 1874 i purchase three 6-inch equatoreal and have order two : i have also order altazimuth -lrb- with accurate vertical circle only -rrb- and clock sufficient as i expect to equip five station for method of observation i rely generally on the simple eye-observation possibly relieved of some of its uncertainty by the use of my colour-correcting eyepiece but active discussion have take place on the feasibility of use photographic and spectroscopic method and it will not be easy for some time to announce that the plan of observation be settle -- there can be no doubt i imagine that the first and necessary duty of the royal observatory be to maintain its place well as a observe establishment and that this must be secure at whatever sacrifice if necessary of other pursuit still the question have not unfrequently present itself to I whether the duty to which i allude have not by force of circumstance become too exclusive and whether the cause of science might not gain if as in the imperial observatory of pari for instance the higher branch of mathematical physics should not take they place by the side of observatory routine i have often feel the desire practically to refresh my acquaintance with what be once favorite subject : lunar theory and physical optics but i do not at present clearly see how i can enter upon they with that degree of freedom of thought which be necessary for success in abstruse investigation of private history : there be a longer visit than usual to playford lasting till jan 27th -- in April he make a short excursion -lrb- of less than a week -rrb- with he son hubert to monmouth & c -- from June 14th to July 2nd he be stay at barrow house near keswick with he son hubert : during this time he be much trouble with a painful skin-irritation of he leg and back which last in some degree for a long time afterwards -- from sept 25th to oct 6th he make a excursion with he daughter christabel to scarborough whitby & c and again spend a few day at barrow house 1871 in April 1870 the assistant have apply for a increase of salary a request which i have urge strongly upon the admiralty on jan 27 of this year the admiralty answer that on account of mr childer 's illness the consideration must be defer to next year the assistant write bitterly to I : and with my sanction they write to the first lord on jan 31st i request a interview with mr baxter -lrb- secretary of the admiralty -rrb- and see he on feb 3rd when i obtain he consent to a addition of _ # 530 _ there be still a difficulty with the treasury but on June 27th the liberal scale be allow -- experiment make by mr stone shew clearly that a local elevation like that of the royal observatory on the hill of greenwich park have no tendency to diminish the effect of railway tremor -- the correction for level error in the transit circle have become inconveniently large a sheet of very thin paper 1\/270 inch in thickness be place under the eastern y which be raise from its bed for the purpose the mean annual value of the level-error appear to be now sensibly zero -- as the siege and war operation in pari seriously interfere with the observation of small planet make at the pari observatory observation of they be continue at greenwich throughout each entire lunation during the investment of the city -- the new water-telescope have be get into work order and perform most satisfactorily observation of gamma draconi have be make with it when the star pass between 20h and 17h with some observation for adjustment at a still more advanced time as the astronomical latitude of the place of observation be not know the bearing of these observation on the question of aberration can not be certainly pronounced until the autumn observation shall have be make but suppose the geodetic latitude to be accordant with the astronomical latitude the result for aberration appear to be sensibly the same as with ordinary telescope -- several year since i prepare a barometer by which the barometric fluctuation be enlarged for the information of the public its indication be exhibit on the wall near to the entrance gate of the observatory a card be now also exhibit in a glass case near the public barometer give the highest and lowest reading of the thermometer in the precede twenty-four hour -- those who have give attention to the history of terrestrial magnetism be aware that halley 's magnetic chart be very frequently cite but i could not learn that any person at least in modern time have see it at last i discover a copy in the library of the british museum and have be allow to take copy by photolithography these be append to the magnetical and meteorological volume for 1869 -- the trial and certificate of hand-telescope for the use of the royal navy have lately be so frequent that they almost become a regular part of the work of the observatory i may state here that by avail myself of a theory of eyepiece which i publish long since in the cambridge transaction i have be able to effect a considerable improvement in the telescope furnish to the admiralty -- the occurrence of the total eclipse of the sun in December last have bring much labor upon the observatory as regard the assistant and computer the actual observation on a complicated plan with the great equatoreal -lrb- a plan for which few equatoreal be sufficiently steady but which when properly carry out give a most complete solution of the geometrical problem -rrb- have require in observation and in computation a large expenditure of time -- my preparation for the transit of venus have respect only to eye-observation of contact of limb with all the liability and defect to which it be subject this method possess the inestimable advantage of place no reliance on instrumental scale i hope that the error of observation may not exceed four seconds of time correspond to about 013 of arc i shall be very glad to see in a detailed form a plan for make the proper measure by heliometric or photographic apparatus and should take great interest in combine these with the eye-observation if my select station can be make available but my present impression be one of doubt on the certainty of equality of part in the scale employ a error depend on this cause could not be diminish by any repetition of observation -- after refer to the desirability of vigorously prosecute the meteorological reduction -lrb- already begin -rrb- and of discuss the magnetic observation the report conclude thus : there be another consideration which very often present itself to my mind the waste of labor in the repetition of observation at different observatory i think that this consideration ought not to be put out of sight in plan the course of different observatory -- in this year de launay 's lunar theory be publish this valuable work be of great service to airy in the preparation of the numerical lunar theory which he subsequently undertake -- in the latter part of this year airy be elect president of the royal society and hold the office during 1872 and 1873 at this time he be much press with work and could ill afford to take up additional duty as the follow quotation from a letter to one of he friend shew : the election to the presidency of r be flattering and have bring to I the friendly remembrance of many person but in its material and laborious connection i could well have dispense with it and should have do so but for the respectful way in which it be press on I of private history : there be the usual winter visit to playford -- in April he make a short trip to cornwall with he daughter annot -- in June he be appoint a companion of the bath and be present at court on he appointment -- mr airy be stay with she daughter mr routh at hunstanton during June she state of health be somewhat improve -- from August 1st to 28th he be chiefly in cumberland at barrow house and at grange borrowdale where he son osmund be stay for a holiday 1872 from the report to the board of visitor it appear that ` the normal siderial clock for give sidereal time by galvanic communication to the astronomical observatory be establish in the magnetic basement in 1871 June that locality be adapt for it on account of the uniformity of temperature the daily change of temperature rarely exceed 1  fahrenheit its escapement be one which i suggest many year ago in the cambridge transaction a detach escapement very closely analogous to the ordinary chronometer escapement the pendulum receive a impulse only at alternate vibration the steadiness of rate be very far superior to any that we have previously attain ' -- the aspect of railway enterprise be at present favourable to the park and to the observatory the south-eastern railway company have make a arrangement with the metropolitan board of work for shift the course of the great southern outfall sewer this enable the company to trace a new line for the railway pass on the north side of london street at such a distance from the observatory as to remove all cause of alarm i understand that the bill which be unopposed have pass the committee of the house of common i trust that the contest which have last thirty-seven year be now terminate -- the observation of 7 draconi with the water-telescope make in the autumn of 1871 and the spring of 1872 be reduce the latter only in they first step use the value of the level scale as determine by mr simm -lrb- which i have no reason to believe to be inaccurate -rrb- the spring and autumn observation of 1871 absolutely negative the idea of any effect be produce on the constant of aberration by the amount of refract medium traverse by the light -- the great aurora of 1872 feb 4 be well observe on this occasion the term boreali would have be a misnomer for the phenomenon begin in the south and be most conspicuous in the south three time in the evening it exhibit that umbrella-like appearance which have be call -lrb- perhaps inaccurately -rrb- a corona i have very carefully compare its momentary phenomenon with the corresponding movement of the magnetometer in some of the most critical time the comparison fail on account of the violent movement and consequent faint trace of the magnetometer i have not be able to connect the phase of aurora and those of magnetic disturbance very distinctly -- the report contain a detailed account of the heavy preparation for the observation of the transit of venus 1874 include the portable building for the instrument the instrument themselves -lrb- be a transit-instrument a altazimuth and a equatoreal for each station -rrb- and first class and second-class clock all sufficient for the equipment of 5 station and continue thus : i be make aware of the assent of the government to the wish of the board of visitor as express at they last meeting that provision should be make for the application of photography to the observation of the transit of venus it be unnecessary for I to remark that we hope of success be found entirely on we confidence in mr de la rue under he direction mr dallmeyer have advance far in the preparation of five photoheliograph the subject be recognize by many astronomer as not wholly free from difficulty but it be generally believe that these difficulty may be overcome and mr de la rue be give careful attention to the most important of they -- i take this opportunity of report to the board that the observatory be honor by a visit of he majesty the emperor of brazil who minutely examine every part -- after refer to various subject which in he opinion might be usefully pursue systematically at the observatory the report proceed thus : ` the character of the observatory would be somewhat change by this innovation but not as i imagine in a direction to which any objection can be make it would become pro tanto a physical observatory and possibly in time its operation might be extend still further in a physical direction ' -- the consideration of possible change in the future of the observatory lead I to the recollection of actual change in the past in my annual report to the visitor i have endeavor to chronicle these but still there will be many circumstance which at present be know only to myself but which ought not to be beyond the reach of history i have therefore lately employ some time in draw up a series of skeleton annals of the observatory -lrb- which unavoidably partake in some measure of the form of biography -rrb- and have carry it through the critical period 1836-1851 if i should command sufficient leisure to bring it down to 1861 i think that i might then very well stop -lrb- the skeleton annals here refer to be undoubtedly the manuscript note which form the basis of the present biography ed -rrb- -- on feb 23rd in this year i first -lrb- privately -rrb- form the notion of prepare a numerical lunar theory by substitute delaunay 's number in the proper equation and see what would come of it of private history : there be the usual visit to playford -- in this year later than usual -- from feb 4th to mar 4th the letter write during this visit be as usual full of freshness and delight at find himself in he favorite country village -- on June 5th he go to barrow house near keswick to be present at the marriage of he second son hubert to miss s c langton daughter of z langton esq of barrow house -- after the wedding he make a trip through the trossach district of scotland with he daughter annot and return to greenwich on June 17th on the 26th June 1872 airy be appoint a knight commander of the most honorable order of the bath : he be knight by the queen at osborne on the 30th of July in the course of he official career he have three time be offer knighthood and have each time decline it : but it seem now as if he scruple on the subject be remove and it be probable that he feel gratify by the public recognition of he service of course the occasion produce many letter of congratulation from he friend : to one of these he reply as follow : the real charm of these public compliment seem to be that they excite the sympathy and elicit the kind expression of private friend or of official superior as well as subordinate in every way i have derive pleasure from these from the assistant of the royal observatory he receive a hearty letter of congratulation contain the follow paragraph we position have naturally give we peculiar opportunity for perceive the high and broad purpose which have characterize you many and great undertaking and of witness the untiring zeal and self-denial with which they have be pursue \* \* \* \* \* on the 18th of march 1872 airy be nominate a foreign associate of the institut de france to fill the place vacant by the death of sir john herschel the follow letter of acknowledgment shew how much he be gratify by this high scientific honor : royal observatory greenwich _ 1872 march 23 _ _  _ monsieur messieur elie de beaumont _ et _ jb dumas _ secrtaires perpetuels de l'acadmie des science institut de france _ gentleman i be honor with you letter of march 18 communicate to I my nomination by the academy of science to the place render vacant in the class of foreign associate of the academy by the decease of sir john herschel and enclose copy of the decree of the president of the french republic approve the election it be almost unnecessary for I to attempt to express to you the pride and gratification with which i receive this announcement by universal consent the title of _ associ etranger de l'acadmie des science _ be recognize as the highest distinction to which any man of science can aspire and i can scarcely imagine that unless by the flattering interpretation of my friend in the academy i be entitle to bear it but in any case i be delighted to feel that the band of friendship be draw closer between myself and the distinguished body whom partly by personal intercourse partly by correspondence and in every instance by reputation i have know so long i beg that you will convey to the academy my long-felt esteem for that body in its scientific capacity and my deep recognition of its friendship to I and of the honor which it have confer on I in the late election i have the honor to be gentleman you very faithful servant gb airy \* \* \* \* \* on the 20th November 1872 airy be nominate a grand cross in the imperial order of the rose of brazil : the insignia of the order be accompany by a autograph letter from the emperor of brazil of which the follow be a transcript monsieur vous tes un des doyens de la science et le prsident de l'illustre socit qui a eu la bienveillance d'inscrire mon nom parmi ceux de ses associs la manire dont vous m ` avez fait les honneurs de votre observatoire m ' a impos aussus l'agrable devoir d'indiquer votre nom

_ sire i be honor with you imperial majesty 's autograph letter of October 22 inform I that on consider the attention which the royal society of london have be able to offer to you majesty as well as the explanation of the various part of the establishment of this observatory which i have the honor and the high gratification to communicate you have be please to place my name in the imperial order of the rose and to present to I the decoration of grand cross of that order with pride i receive this proof of you majesty 's recollection of you visit to the scientific institution of great britain the diploma of the appointment to the order of the rose under the imperial sign manual together with the decoration of the order have be transmit to I by he excellency don pereira de andrada you majesty 's representative at the british court you majesty have be please to advert to the approach transit of venus on the preparation for which you find I engage it be unfortunate that the transit of 1874 will not be visible at rio de janeiro for that of 1882 rio will be a favourable position and we reckon on the observation to be make there you majesty may be assure that i shall loyally bear in mind you desire to be inform of any remarkable enterprise of this observatory or of any principal step in the preparation for the transit of venus and of its result i have the honor to be sire you imperial majesty 's very faithful servant gb airy _ to he majesty the emperor of brazil _ \* \* \* \* \* airy 's old friend adam sedgwick be now very aged and infirm but he spirit be still vigorous and he be warm-hearted as ever the follow letter from he -lrb- probably the last of they long correspondence -rrb- be write in this year and appear characteristic : trinity college cambridge _ may 10 1872 _ my dear airy i have receive you card of invitation for the 1st of June and with great joy should i count upon that day if i think that i should be able to accept you invitation : but alas i have no hope of the kind for that humiliating malady which now have fasten upon I for a full year and a half have not let go its hold nor be it likely to do so a man who be journey in the 88th year of he pilgrimage be not likely to throw off such a chronic malady indeed be i well enough to come i be deaf as a post and half blind and if i be with you i should only be able to play dummy several year have pass away since i be last at you visitation and i have great joy in see mr airy and some lady friend at the observatory but i could not then attend the dinner at that meeting be many face that i know but strangely alter by the rude handling of old time and there be many new face which i have never see before at a royal society meeting but worse than all all the old face be away in vain i look round for wollaston davy davy gilbert barrow troughton & c & c and the merry companion admiral smyth be also away so that my last visit have its sorrowful side but why should i bother you with these old man 's moping i send a old man 's blessing and a old man 's love to all the member of you family especially to mr airy the oldest and dearest of my lady friend i remain my dear airy you true-hearted old friend he adam x sedgwick mark p shall i ever again gaze with wonder and delight from the great window of you observatory the body of the above letter be in the handwriting of a amanuensis but the signature and postscript be in sedgwick 's handwriting -lrb- ed -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* 1873 chronographic registration have be establish at the pari observatory mr hilgard principal officer of the american coast survey have make use of it for determine the longitude of harvard from greenwich through pari brest and st pierre for this purpose mr hilgard 's transit instrument be plant in the magnetic court i understand that the result do not sensibly differ from that obtain by mr gould through valentium and newfoundland -- it be know to the scientific world that several of the original thermometer construct by mr sheepshank -lrb- in the course of he preparation of the national standard of length -rrb- by independent calibration of the bore and independent determination of the freezing and boil point on arbitrary graduation be still preserve at the royal observatory it be lately state to I by m tresca the principal officer of the international metrical commission that in the late unhappy war in paris the french original thermometer be destroy and m tresca request that if possible some of the original thermometer make by mr sheepshank might be appropriate to the use of the international commission i have therefore transfer to m tresca the three thermometer a6 s1 s2 with the documentary information relate to they which be find in mr sheepshank 's papers retain six thermometer of the same class in the royal observatory -- the sidereal standard clock continue to give great satisfaction i be consider -lrb- with the aid of mr buckney of the firm of e dent and co -rrb- a arrangement for barometric correction found on the principle of action on the pendulum by means of a magnet which can be raise or lower by the agency of a large barometer -- the altazimuth have receive some important alteration a examination of the result of observation have make I dissatisfied with the bearing of the horizontal pivot in they y 's mr simm at my request change the bearing in y 's for bear in segment of circle a construction which have work admirably well in the pivot of the transit circle -lrb- and in various other respects the instrument appear to have receive a thorough overhaul ed -rrb- -- with the consent of the royal society and of the kew committee the kew heliograph have be plant in the new dome look over the south ground it be not yet finally adjust -- some magnetic observation in the britannium and conway tubular bridge be make last autumn for this purpose i detach a assistant -lrb- mr carpenter -rrb- who be aid by capt tupman rma in other respects the enterprise be private and at private expense -- the rate of the first six chronometer -lrb- in the annual trial -rrb- be publish in a form which appear most likely to lead to examination of the cause that influence they merit or demerit this report be extensively distribute to british and foreign horologist and instrument-maker all these artist appear to entertain the conviction that the careful comparison make at this observatory and the orderly form of they publication have contribute powerfully to the improvement of chronometer -- very lately application have be make to I through the board of trade for plan and other information regard time-signal-ball to assist in guide the authority of the german empire in the establishment of time signal at various port of that state in other foreign country the system be extend and be refer to greenwich as its origin -- the arrangement and preparation for the observation of the transit of venus occupy much attention with regard to the photoheliograph it be propose to make trial of a plan propose by m janssen for numerous photograph of venus when very near to the sun 's limb on apr 26th the engaging of photographic teacher be sanction observer be select and engage a work model of the transit be prepare and the use of de la rue 's scale be practice there be some hostile criticism of the station select for the observation of the transit which necessitate a formal reply -- reference be make to the increase of facility for make magnetical and meteorological observation the inevitable result of it be that observation be produce in number so great that complete reduction become almost impossible the labor of reduction be very great and it be conclude that of the enormous number of meteorological observation now make at numerous observatory very few can ever possess the smallest utility -- refer to my numerical lunar theory : on June 30th 1873 a theory be form nearly but not perfectly complete numerical development of power of a  r and r  a factor of correction to delaunay first attempt but entirely in numerical form -- in march of this year airy be consult by mr wh barlow ce and mr thoma bouch -lrb- the engineer of the tay bridge which be blow down in 1879 and of a propose scheme for a forth bridge in 1873 -rrb- on the subject of the wind pressure & c that should be allow for in the construction of the bridge airy 's report on this question be date 1873 apr 9th : it be subsequently much refer to at the official enquiry into the cause of the failure of the tay bridge -- at the end of this year airy resign the presidency of the royal society in he address to the society on dec 1st he state he reason in full as follow : the severity of official duty which seem to increase while vigor to discharge they do not increase and the distance of my residence another cause be a difficulty of hearing which unfit I for effective action as chairman of council of private history : there be the usual visit to playford in January : also a short visit in may : and a third visit at christmas -- there be a short run in June of about a week to coniston with one of he daughter -- and there be a trip to weymouth & c for about 10 day with one of he daughter in the beginning of August -- on he return from the last-mentioned trip airy find a letter from the secretary of the swedish legation enclose the warrant under the royal sign manual of he majesty -lrb- oscar -rrb- the king of sweden and norway by which he be nominate as a first class commander of the order of the north star and accompany the decoration of that order 1874 in this year mr glaisher resign he appointment : i place he department -lrb- magnetical and meteorological -rrb- under mr elli -- a balance of peculiar construction have be make by mr oertle from my instruction and fix near the public barometer at the entrance gate this instrument enable the public to test any ordinary pound weight shewing on a scale the number of grain by which it be too heavy or too light -- fresh counterpoise have be attach to the great equatoreal to balance the additional weight of the new spectroscope which be finally receive from mr browning 's hand on may 2nd of the present year the spectroscope be specifically adapt to sweeping round the sun 's limb with a view to map out the prominence and be also available for work on star and nebula the dispersive power be very readily vary a induction-coil capable of give a six-inch spark have be make for this instrument by mr browning -- some new class of reduction of the meteorological observation from 1848 to 1868 have be undertake and complete in the past year the general state of this work be as follow : the diurnal change of the dry-bulb thermometer as depend on the month on the temperature wave on the barometric wave on the overcast and cloudless state of the sky and on the direction of the wind have be compute and examine for the whole period and the exhibition of the result be ready for press the similar reduction for the wet-bulb thermometer be rapidly approach completion -- regard the preparation for the transit of venus expedition originally five station be select and fully equip with equatoreal transit altazimuths photoheliograph and clock but i have since think it desirable to supplement these by two branch station in the sandwich island and one in kerguelen 's island and the additional instrument thus require have be borrow from various source so that there be now a abundant supply of instrumental means there will thus be available for observation of the transit of venus 23 telescope nine of which will be provide with double-image-micrometer and five photoheliograph and for determination of local time and latitude and longitude there will be nine transit and six altazimuth all the observer have undergo a course of training in photography first under a professional photographer mr reynold and subsequently under capt abney re whose new dry-plate process be to be adopt at all the british station a janssen slide capable of take 50 photograph of venus and the neighbouring part of the sun 's limb at interval of one second have be make by mr dallmeyer for each of the five photoheliograph -- attach to the report to the visitor be a copy of the instruction to observer engage in the transit of venus expedition prepare with great care and in remarkable detail -- in the past spring i publish in the monthly notice of the royal astronomical society a statement of the fundamental point in a new treatment of the lunar theory by which avail myself of all that have be do in the best algebraical investigation of that theory i trust to be able by numerical operation only to give greater accuracy to final result considerable progress have be make in the extensive numerical development the work be do at my private expense entirely by a junior computer and i hope at any rate to put it in such a state that there will be no liability to its entire loss when this be report to the board of visitor it be resolve on the motion of prof stoke that this work as a public expense ought to be bear by the government and this be forward to the admiralty on June 24th i write to the secretary of the admiralty ask for _ # 100 _ for the present year which after the usual enquiry and explanation be sanction on aug 29th of private history : there be short visit to playford in January June and October but only for a few day in each case -- in march there be a run of two or three day to newnham -lrb- on the severn -rrb- to see the bear on the severn and to malvern -- in July he go to newcastle to observe with mr newall 's great telescope but the weather be unfavourable : he then go on to barrow house near keswick and spend a few day there with excursion among the mountain -- on aug 13th he go with he daughter christabel to the isle of arran and then by glasgow to the trosach where he make several excursion to verify the locality mention in the lady of the lake -- while in scotland he hear of the death of he brother the rev william airy and travel to keysoe in bedfordshire to attend the funeral and return to greenwich on aug 24th 1875 in October of this year i write to the admiralty that i have grounds for ask for a increase of my salary : because the pension which have be settle on my wife and which i have practically recognize as part of my salary have be terminate by she death so that my salary now stand lower by _ # 200 _ than that of the director of study of the royal naval college the admiralty reply favourably and on nov 27th the treasury raise my salary to _ # 1_200 -- for the service of the clock movement of the great equatoreal a water-cistern have be establish in the highest part of the ball-turret the necessity for which arise from the follow circumstance : the water clock be supply by a small pipe about 80 foot in length connect with the 3-inch observatory main -lrb- which pass through the park -rrb- at a distance of about 250 foot from any other branch pipe in spite of this distance i have see that on stop the water-tap in the battery-basement under the north-east turret the pressure in the gauge of the water clock have be instantly increase by more than 40 lb per square inch the consequent derangement of the water clock in its now incessant daily use become intolerable since the independent supply be provide its performance have be most satisfactory -- with the spectroscope the solar prominence have be map on 28 day only but the weather of the past winter be exceptionally unfavourable for this class of observation after map the prominence as see on the c line the other line especially f and b have be regularly examine whenever practicable great care have be take in determine the position angle and height of the prominence in all case the spectrum of coggium 's comet be examine at every available opportunity last July and compare directly with that of carbon dioxide the band of the two spectrum be sensibly coincident fifty-four measure of the displacement of line in the spectrum of 10 star as compare with the corresponding line in the spectrum of terrestrial element -lrb- chiefly hydrogen -rrb- have be make but some of these appear to be affect by a constant error depend on faulty adjustment of the spectroscope -- photograph of the sun have be take with the kew photoheliograph on 186 day and of these 377 have be select for preservation the moon jupiter saturn and several star -lrb- include the pleiade and some double star -rrb- have be photograph with the great equatoreal with fairly satisfactory result though further practice be require in this class of work -- i would mention a supplemental mechanism which i have myself introduce into some chronometer i have long remark that in ordinary good chronometer the freedom from irregularity depend on mechanical cause be most remarkable but that after all the effort of the most judicious maker there be in nearly every case a perceptible defect of thermal compensation there be great difficulty in correct the residual fault not only because a inconceivably small movement of the weight on the balance-curve be require but also because it endanger the equilibrium of the balance the mechanism adopt to remedy the defect be describe in a paper in the horological journal of July 1875 by mr w elli and have receive the approval of some able chronometer-maker -- with respect to the transit of venus expedition : the party from egypt and rodriguez be return i be in continual expectation of the arrival of the other party i believe the eye-observation and the ordinary photograph to be quite successful i doubt the advantage of the janssen one of the double-image-micrometers seem to have fail and the zenith-telescope give some trouble at three station at rodriguez and three at kerguelen the observation appear to have be most successful at the sandwich island two of the station appear to have be perfectly successful -lrb- except that i fear that the janssen have fail -rrb- and a rich series of lunar observation for longitude be obtain at new zealand i grieve to say the observation be totally lose entirely in consequence of bad weather there have be little annoyance from the dreaded ` black drop ' greater inconvenience and doubt have be cause by the unexpected luminous ring round venus -- with regard to the progress of my propose new lunar theory : three computer be now steadily employ on the work it will be remember that the detail and mass of this work be purely numerical every numerical coefficient be accompany with a symbolical correction whose value will sometimes depend on the time but in every case be ultimately to be obtain in a numerical form of these coefficient extract -lrb- for convenience -rrb- from delaunay 's result there be 100 for parallax 182 for longitude 142 for latitude the argument be preserve in the usual form -- after review the change that have take place at the observatory during the past forty year the report to the board of visitor conclude thus : i much desire to see the system of time-signal extend by clock or daily signal to various part of we great city and we dockyard and above all by hourly signal on the start point which i believe would be the greatest of all benefit to nautical chronometry should any extension of we scientific work ever be contemplate i would remark that the observatory be not the place for new physical investigation it be well adapt for follow out any which originate with private investigator have be reduce to law susceptible of verification by daily observation the national observatory will i trust always remain on the site where it be first plant and which early acquire the name of ` flamsteed hill ' there be some inconvenience in the position arise principally from the limited extent of the hill but they be in my opinion very far overbalance by its advantage -- in a letter on the subject of the smith 's prize examination at cambridge which be always a matter of the greatest interest to he airy renew he objection to the preponderance in the papers of a class of pure mathematics which he consider be never likely under any circumstance to give the slightest assistance to physics and as before these remark call forth a rejoinder from prof cayley who be responsible for many of the question of the class refer to -- in this year airy complete he note on the earlier hebrew scripture which be shortly afterwards publish as a book by messr longmans green & co in he letter to the publisher introduce the subject he say for many year past i have at time put together a few sentence explanatory as i conceive of the geographical and historical circumstance connect with the principal event record in the hebrew scripture the view which i take be free but i trust not irreverent they terminate with a brief review of colenso 's great work the collection now amount to a small book from the reference already give in previous year to he papers and correspondence on the geography of exodus he correspondence with colenso & c & c it will be see that he take a great interest in the early history of the israelite -- on August 10th 1875 airy celebrate the bicentenary of the royal observatory by a dinner in the octagon room which be attend by the president of the royal society and the r astr society and by a large number of scientific gentleman interested in astronomy -- in February he be revise he treatise on probability of private history : up to jan 16th airy be at playford as usual -- for about a week in April he be in the isle of man with he daughter christabel -- in June there be a short trip to salisbury blandford and wimborne -- on August 12th he start with he daughter annot for a holiday in cumberland but on the next day he be recall by a telegram with the intelligence that a change for the worse have come over he wife 's health lady airy die on August 13th 1875 for the last five year of she life she have be very helpless from the effect of a paralytic stroke -- a very sad end to a bright and happy life -- and have be continually nurse throughout this time by she two unmarried daughter with the greatest self-denial and devotion she husband have be unremitting in he care and attention nothing be want that the most thoughtful kindness could supply and in all he trip and excursion he constant and kind letter shew how anxious he be that she should participate in all he interest and amusement from the nature of the case it could hardly be say that she death be unexpected and he receive the shock with the manly steadiness which belong to he lady airy be bury in playford churchyard -- from sept 22nd to oct 4 he make a short expedition to wale -lrb- capel curig & c -rrb- -- on dec 15th he attend the commemoration at trinity college cambridge -- on dec 22nd he go as usual to playford in this year airy receive the high honor of the freedom of the city of london in the follow communication : stone mayor -- a common council holden in the chamber of the guildhall of the city of london on Thursday the 29th day of April 1875 resolve unanimously that the freedom of this city in a gold box of the value of one hundred guinea be present to sir george biddell airy kcb dcl lld & c astronomer royal as a recognition of he indefatigable labor in astronomy and of he eminent service in the advancement of practical science whereby he have so materially benefit the cause of commerce and civilization monckton this resolution be forward with a letter from benjamin scott the chamberlain airy 's reply be as follow : royal observatory greenwich se _ 1875 may 1 _ dear sir i have the honor to acknowledge you letter of April 30 accompany with copy of the resolution of the common council of the city of london pass at they meeting of April 29 under signature of the town clerk that the freedom of the city of london in a valuable box be present to I in recognition of work state in the resolution and i be request by you to inform you whether it be my intention to accept the compliment propose by the corporation in reply i beg you to convey to the right honorable the lord mayor and the corporation that i accept with the greatest pride and pleasure the honor which they propose to offer to I the freedom of we great city confer by the spontaneous act of its municipal governor be in my estimation the highest honor which it be possible to receive and its presentation at this time be peculiarly grateful to I i have the honor to be sir you very obedient servant gb airy _ benjamin scott esq & c & c & c chamberlain of the corporation of the city of london _ as it be technically necessary that a freeman of the city of london should belong to one or other of the city company the worshipful company of spectacle maker through they clerk -lrb- with very great appropriateness -rrb- enquire whether it would be agreeable that that company should have the privilege of confer they honorary freedom on he and add : in solicit you acquiescence to the proposal i be direct to call attention to the fact that this guild be permit to claim all manufacturer of mathematical and astronomical instrument within the city of london which be now plead as a apology for the wish that one so distinguish as yourself in the use of such instrument should be enrol as a member of this craft in he reply accept the freedom of the company airy write thus : i shall much value the association with a body whose ostensible title bear so close a relation to the official engagement which have long occupy I i have have extensive experience both in arrange and in use optical and mathematical instrument and feel that my own pursuit be closely connect with the original employment of the company the freedom of the company be duly present and the occasion be celebrate by a banquet at the albion tavern on Tuesday July 6th the freedom of the city of london be confer at a court of common council hold at the guildhall on Thursday the 4th of November in present the gold box contain the freedom the chamberlain in a eloquent speech first refer to the fact that this be the first occasion on which the freedom have be confer on a person whose name be associate with the science other than those of war and statecraft he then refer to the solid character of he work in that while other have turn they attention to the more attractive field of exploration the discovery of new world or of novel celestial phenomenon he have incessantly devoted himself to the less interesting less obtrusive but more valuable walk of practical astronomy and he instance as the special grounds of the honor confer the compilation of nautical table of extraordinary accuracy the improvement of chronometer the correction of the compass of iron ship the restoration of the standard of length and weight and the transit of venus expedition in he reply airy state that he regard the honor just confer upon he as the greatest and proudest ever receive by he he refer to the fact that the same honor have be previously confer on the value friend of he youth thoma clarkson and say that the circumstance of he succeed such a man be to himself a great honor and pleasure he allude to he have receive a small exhibition from one of the london company when he be a poor undergraduate at cambridge and acknowledge the great assistance that it have be to he with regard to he occupation he say that he have follow it in a great measure because of its practical use and think it fortunate that from the first he be connect with a institution in which utility be combine with science the occasion of this presentation be celebrate by a banquet at the mansion house on Saturday July 3rd 1875 to sir george airy -lrb- astronomer royal -rrb- and the representative of learn society there be no doubt that airy be extremely gratify by the honor that he have receive it be to he the crowning honor of he life and come last of all it throw all he other honor into the shade to he independent and liberal spirit there be something peculiarly touch in the unsolicited approbation and act of so powerful and disinterested a body as the corporation of the city of london chapter ix at greenwich observatory from January 1st 1876 to he resignation of office on August 15th 1881 1876 at the door from the front court to the staircase of the octagon room -lrb- the original entrance to the observatory as erect by sir christopher wren -rrb- a small porch-shelter have be often desire i propose to fix there a fan-roof of quadrantal form cover the upper flat stone of the external step -- on a critical examination of the micrometer-screw of the transit circle it be find that the correction which range from -1  38 to +0  76 indicate considerable wear in the screw and it be find that as much as one-hundreth part of a inch have be worn away from some of the thread the old screw be consequently discard and new one be make by mr simm -- the adjustment of the spectroscope have occupy a great deal of attention there be astigmatism of the prism and false light reflect from the base of the prism cause loss both of light and of definition the latter defect be correct by alter the angle and then astigmatism be correct by a cylindrical lens near the slit the definition in both plane be then find to be perfect -- the number of small planet have now become so great and the interest of establish the element of all they orbit so small -- while at the same time the light of all those lately discover be very faint and the difficulty and doubt of observation greatly increase -- that i have begin to think seriously of limit future observation to a small number of these object -- all observation with the spectroscope have be completely reduce the measure of line in the spectrum of element be convert into corresponding wave-length and the observation of displacement of line in the spectrum of star be reduce so as to exhibit the conclude motion in mile per second after apply a correction for the earth 's motion sixteen measure of the f line in the spectrum of the moon as compare with hydrogen give a displacement correspond to a motion of less than two mile a second which seem to shew that the method of comparison now adopt be free from systematic error and this be support by the manner in which motion of approach and recession be distribute among the star examine on each night of observation the result recently obtain appear to be on the whole as consistent as can be expect in such delicate observation and they support in a remarkable manner the conclusion of dr huggin with regard to the motion of those star which he examine -- photograph of the sun have be take with the photoheliograph on 182 day on one of the photograph which be accidentally expose while the drop slit be be draw up there appear to be a faint image of a cloud-like prominence close to the sun 's limb though the exposure probably only amount to a fraction of a second a prominence of unusual brilliancy be see with the spectroscope about the same time and in the same position with reference to the sun 's limb all group of sun-spot and facula have be number and the date of they first and last appearance enter up to the present time area of spot have be measure and the measure have be reduce to millionth of the sun 's visible hemisphere -- the examination of the reading of the deep-sunk thermometer from 1846 to 1873 have exhibit some law which have be sufficiently establish before this time and some which be less know among the former be the successive retardation of season in successive descent amount to about four month at the depth of 25 foot and the successive diminution of the annual range of temperature among the latter be the character of the change from year to year which the great length of this series of observation bring well to light it be find that from year to year the mean temperature of the surface for the year vary by three or four degree of fahrenheit follow in its change the mean temperature of the atmosphere for the year and that the change of annual temperature be propagate downwards retard in phase and diminish in amount of change in the same manner -lrb- though probably not follow the same law -rrb- as the season change the inference from this be that change of temperature come entirely from the exterior and in no discoverable degree from the interior a inference which may be important in regard both to solar action and to geology -- refer to the transit of venus observation : in the astronomical part of the reduction there have be great labor and difficulty in the determination of local sidereal time some book of observation require extensive transcription some instrumental error be still uncertain the latter determination have perplex we so much that we be incline to believe that in spite of the great facility of reduction give by the transit instrument it would be better to rely on the altazimuth for time-determination in the photographic part i have confine my attention entirely to measure of the distance between the centre of the sun and planet a troublesome and complex operation -- refer to the progress of the numerical lunar theory : with a repetition of grant from the treasury i have usually maintain four junior computer on this work the progress though considerable have not be so great as i have hope by reason of the excessive personal pressure upon I during the whole year -- i write a letter of congratulation to le verrier on the completion of he great work of planetary table -- on may 13th the queen be at south kensington and i attend to explain the astronomical instrument and shew she majesty one of the transit of venus photograph of private history : he return from he playford visit on the 18th of January -- in April there be a two-day trip to colchester -- from June 13th to July 12th he be travel in the north of scotland and the orkney with he daughter stay for a short time with mr webster mp at aberdeen and with mr newall at newcastle -- in September there be a week 's run to birkenhead and keswick -- in November a week 's run to playford -- from the 13th to 15th of December he be at cambridge and on the 28th he go to playford for the usual winter stay there 1877 in April of this year i be much engage on the subject of mr gill 's expedition to ascension to observe for the determination of the parallax of mar at the approach opposition of that planet -- a large direct-vision spectroscope have be quite recently make by mr hilger under mr christie 's direction on a new plan in which either great dispersion or great purity of spectrum be obtain by the use of ` half-prism ' accord as the incident pencil fall first on the perpendicular or on the oblique face in this spectroscope either one or two half prism can be use at pleasure accord to the dispersion require and there be facility for increase the train to three or four half-prism though the dispersion with two only be nearly double of that give by the large ten-prism spectroscope the definition in this form of spectroscope appear to be very fine -- at the end of may 1876 spectroscopic determination of the sun 's rotation be make by observation of the relative displacement of the fraunhofer line at the east and west limb respectively the result be in close agreement with the value of the rotation find from observation of sun-spot a similar determination have also be make in the case of jupiter with equally satisfactory result -- a electrometer on sir william thomson 's plan for continuous photographic registration of atmospheric electricity have be receive from mr white of glasgow it be mount in December -- the computation of the photographic record of the barometer from 1854 to 1873 have so far advance that we can assert positively that there be no trace of lunar tide in the atmosphere but that there be a strongly marked semi-diurnal solar tide accompany with a smaller diurnal tide we be at present engage in compare the barometric measure with the direction of the wind -- regard the distribution of the print observation : there be no extensive wish for separate magnetic observation but general magnetic result be in great demand especially for mining operation and to meet this a map of magnetic declination be furnish in the newspaper call the ` colliery guardian ' -- as regard the operation for the transit of venus : the compute staff have by degree be reduce to two junior computer within the observatory and one or two computer external to the observatory who be employ on large group of systematic calculation the principal part of the calculation remain at the date of the last report be that apply to the determination of the geographical longitude of fundamental station at the moment of my write the last of these -lrb- the longitude of observatory bay kerguelen -rrb- be not absolutely finish : the method of determine the geographical longitude of the principal station in each group by vertical transit of the moon have be find very successful at honolulu and rodriguez for station in high south latitude horizontal transit be preferable -- as regard the numerical lunar theory : with the view of preserve against the ordinary chance of destruction or abandonment a work which be already one of considerable magnitude i have prepare and have print as appendix to the greenwich observation -lrb- with additional copy as for a separate work -rrb- the ordinary equation of lunar disturbance the novel theory of symbolical variation and the numerical development of the quantity on the first side of the equation -- at various time from February to may i be engage on the reduction of malta tide and on a paper concern the same -- in July i be award the albert medal for my compass correction and receive the same from the prince of wale -- in February campbell 's instrument for the registration of sunshine be introduce : it be mount in July of private history : i be at playford until jan 19th in close correspondence as usual with mr christie at the observatory and attend to my numerical lunar theory -- from mar 29th to apr 2nd i go on a short trip to hereford worcester & c -- from June 8th to 20th i be at playford -- from aug 13th to sept 8th airy be on a expedition in ireland chiefly in the north and west with he daughter when at dublin he visit grubb 's instrument factory on the return journey he stay for some time in the lake district of cumberland and take sounding in the neighborhood of the place of the ` floating island ' in derwentwater airy take the greatest interest in antiquarian matter whether military or ecclesiastical and he feeling on such matter be well illustrate by the follow letter : royal observatory greenwich se _ 1877 February 27 _ dear sir i venture to ask if you can assist I in the follow matter in the parish church of playford near ipswich suffolk be a splendid brass tombstone to sir thoma felbrigg by a act of folly and barbarism almost unequalled in the history of the world the incumbent and curate nearly destroy the brass inscription surround the image of the knight this tombstone be figure in gough 's sepulchral antiquity which i presume be to be find in the british museum and i take the liberty to ask if you would kindly look at the engraving and give I any suggestion as to the way in which some copy of it could be make in a fairly durable form i be connect with the parish of playford and be anxious to preserve for it this memorial of a family of high rank formerly resident there i be dear sir very faithfully yours gb airy _ t winter jone esq _ to this request mr winter jone immediately accede and the engraving be duly photograph and copy be circulate with a historical notice of sir george -lrb- not sir thoma -rrb- felbrigg and a history of the monument sir george felbrigg be esquire-at-arm to edward iii and lord of the manor of playford : he die in 1400 and be bury in the north wall of playford church 1878 the report to the board of visitor have this paragraph : i continue to remark the approach necessity for library extension without have absolutely decide on a site i may suggest that i should wish to erect a brick building about 50 foot by 20 consist of two very low story -lrb- or rather of one story with a gallery run round its wall -rrb- so low that book can be move by hand without necessity for a ladder -- in the month of December 1877 the azimuthal error of the transit circle have increase to 10 a skilful workman instruct by mr simm easily reduce the error to about 25 -lrb- which would leave its mean error nearly 0 -rrb- the western y be move to the north so far as to reduce the reading of the transit micrometer when point to the south from 35r500 to 35r000 the level error be not sensibly affect -- the sidereal standard clock preserve a rate approach to perfection so long as it be leave without disturbance of the galvanic-contact spring -lrb- touch by its pendulum -rrb- which transmit signal at every second of time to sympathetic clock and the chronograph a readjustment of these spring usually disturb the rate -- to facilitate the observation of star a new work catalogue have be prepare in which be include all star down to the third magnitude star down to the fifth magnitude which have not be observe in the last two catalogue and a list of 258 star of about the sixth magnitude of which the place be require for the united state coast survey the whole number of star in we new work list be about 2500 it may be here mention that a extensive series of observation be make during the autumn of about 70 star at the request of mr gill for comparison with mar ariadne and melpomene -- on apr 10th last a very heavy fall of rain take place between apr 10d 5h and apr 11d 2h 2824 inch be record and 75 per cent of this or 212 inch fall in the eight hour between 13-1\/2 h and 21-1\/2 h and on may 7 1 inch of rain fall in 50 minute of which 1\/2 inch fall in 15 minute -- the supplementary compensation continue to be apply with success to government chronometer which offer facility for its introduction and a marked improvement in the performance of chronometer return after repair by the maker appear to have result from the increase attention now give to the compensation of the 29 competitive chronometer 25 have the supplementary compensation -- with regard to the reduction of the observation of the transit of venus : after reference to the difficulty arise from the error and the interpretation of the language use by some of the observer the report continue thus : finally a report be make to the government on July 5th give as the mean result for mean solar parallax 876 the result from ingress and from egress however differ to the extent of 011 after further examination and consideration the result for parallax have be increase to 882 or 883 the result from photography have disappoint I much the failure have arise perhaps sometimes from irregularity of limb or from atmospheric distortion but more frequently from faintness and from want of clear definition many photograph which to the eye appear good lose all strength and sharpness when place under the measure microscope a final result 817 be obtain from mr burton 's measure and 808 from capt tupman 's -- with regard to the numerical lunar theory : a cursory collection of the term relate to the area -lrb- in the ecliptic -rrb- lead I to suppose that there might be some error in the computation of the annual equation and related term a most jealous re-examination have however detect nothing and have confirm my belief in the general accuracy of the numerical computation i dare not yet venture to assume a error in delaunay 's theory but i remember that the annual equation give great trouble to the late sir john lubbock and that he more than once change he conclusion as to its true value -- in February i be engage on the drawing and preparation for my intended lecture at cockermouth on the probable condition of the interior of the earth the lecture be deliver in April -- at different time in the autumn i be engage on diagram to illustrate the passage of ray through eye-piece and double-image micrometer -- the miscellaneous scientific correspondence which be always go on be in this year unusually vary and heavy of private history : he be at playford till jan 26th -- in April he go to cockermouth to deliver he lecture above-mentioned : the journey be by birmingham where he stay for two day -lrb- probably with he son osmund who reside there -rrb- to tarn bank -lrb- the residence of isaac fletcher mp -rrb- : the lecture be deliver on the 22nd : he make excursion to thirlmere and barrow and to edward i 's monument and return to greenwich on the 27th -- from June 17th to 28th he be at playford -- from aug 19th to sept 17th he be travel in scotland visit the tay bridge the loch katrine waterworks & c and spend the last fortnight of he trip at portinscale near keswick on dec 23rd he go to playford 1879 the manuscript of every kind which be accumulate in the ordinary transaction of the observatory be preserve with the same care and arrange on the same system as heretofore the total number of bind volume exceed 4000 besides these there be the great mass of transit of venus reduction and manuscript which when bind may be expect to form about 200 volume -- with regard to the numerous group of minor planet the berlin authority have most kindly give attention to my representation and we have now a most admirable and comprehensive ephemeri but the extreme faintness of the majority of these body place they practically beyond the reach of we meridian instrument and the difficulty of observation be in many case further increase by the large error of the predict place -- after a fine autumn the weather in the past winter and spring have be remarkably bad more than a entire lunation be lose with the transit circle no observation of the moon on the meridian have be possible between January 8 and march 1 a period of more than seven week neither sun nor star be visible for eleven day during which period the clock-time be carry on entirely by the precede rate of the clock the accumulate error at the end of this time do not exceed 0 ' 3 -- some difficulty be at first experience with the thomson electrometer which be trace to want of insulation this have be master by the use of glass supporter which carry some sulphuric acid the instrument be now in excellent order and the photographic register have be perfectly satisfactory since 1879 February when the new insulator be apply -- from the annual curve of diurnal inequality deduce from the magnetic reduction most important inference may be draw as to the connection between magnetic phenomenon and sun-spot these annual curve shew a well-marked change in close correspondence with the number of sun-spot about the epoch of maximum of sun-spot they be large and nearly circular have the same character as the curve for the summer month whilst about the time of sun-spot minimum they be small and lemniscate-shaped with a striking resemblance to the curve for the winter month the connection between change of terrestrial magnetism and sun-spot be shewn in a still more striking manner by a comparison which mr ellis have make between the monthly means of the diurnal range of declination and horizontal force and dr r wolf 's ` relative number ' for frequency of sun-spot -- the record of sunshine with campbell 's register sun-dial be preserve in a form easily accessible for reference and the result be communicate weekly to the agricultural gazette -- prof oppolzer 's result for the determination of the longitude of vienna and berlin make in 1877 have now be make public they shew a remarkable agreement of the chronometric determination formerly make with the telegraphic it may be of interest to recall the fact that a similar agreement be find between the chronometric and telegraphic determination of the longitude of valentium -- for observe the transit of venus of 1882 the general impression appear to be that it will be best to confine we observation to simple telescopic observation or micrometer observation at ingress and egress if possible at place whose longitude be know for the first phenomenon -lrb- accelerate ingress -rrb- the choice of station be not good but for the other phenomenon -lrb- retard ingress accelerate egress retard egress -rrb- there appear to be no difficulty -- with regard to the numerical lunar theory : respect the discordance of annual equation i suspend my judgment i have now discuss the theory completely and in go into detail of secular change i be at this time engage on that which be the foundation of all namely the change of excentricity of the solar orbit and its result in produce lunar acceleration a important error in the theoretical formula for variation of radius vector longitude and latitude be discover some calculation depend on they be cancel -- refer to the magnitude of the print volume of greenwich observation and the practicability of reduce the extent of it the report state thus : the tendency of external scientific movement be to give great attention to the phenomenon of the solar disc -lrb- in which this observatory ought undoubtedly to bear its part -rrb- and i personally be most unwilling to recede from the exist course of magnetical and meteorological observationsthe general tendency of these consideration be to increase the annual expense of the observatory and so it have be almost continuously for the last 42 year the annual ordinary expense be now between 2-1\/2 and 3 time as great as in my first year at the royal observatory -- mr gill be appoint to the cape observatory and i write out instruction for he in march : there be subsequently much correspondence respect the equipment and repair of the cape observatory -- in the monthly notice of the royal astronomical society for January a article have appear head note on the late admiral smyth 's cycle of celestial object vol ii by mr herbert sadler in this article mr sadler have criticize the work of admiral smyth in a manner which airy regard as impute bad faith to admiral smyth he at once take up the defense of he old friend very warmly and propose certain draft of resolution to the council of the society these resolution be move but be amend or negatived and airy immediately resign he office of vice-president there be considerable negociation on the subject and discussion with lord lindsay and on may 9th airy 's resolution be accept by the council -- in October airy inspect the faraday telegraph ship then lie in the river near messr siemen ' work and break he finger by a fall on board the vessel -- in this year airy write and circulate a letter to the member of the senate of the university of cambridge on the subject of the papers set in the smith 's prize examination in this letter as on former occasion he object much to the large number of question in purely idle algebra arbitrary combination of symbol applicable to no further purpose and in particular he single out for comment the follow question which be one of those set use the term circle as extend to the case where the radius be a pure imaginary it be require to construct the common chord of two give circle this draw forth as usual a rejoinder from prof cayley who write enclose a solution of he problem but not at all to airy 's satisfaction who reply as follow : i be not so deeply plunge in the mist of impossible as to appreciate fully you explanation in this instance or to think that it be a good criterion for university candidate of private history : on jan 21st he return from playford -- on march 22nd he attend the funeral of he sister at little welnetham near bury st edmund : miss elizabeth airy have live with he at the observatory from shortly after he appointment -- for about a week at the end of April he be visit matlock edensor and buxton -- from June 14th to July 18th he be stay at portinscale near keswick -- he be at playford for two or three day in October and go there again on dec 23rd for he usual winter holiday the follow letter relate to the life of thoma clarkson be write to dr merivale dean of ely after read the account in the time of October 10th of the unveiling of a statue of clarkson near ware : royal observatory greenwich london se _ 1879 October 11 _ dear sir pardon my intrusion on you in reference to a transaction which have greatly interested I -- the honor pay by you to the memory of thoma clarkson with very great pleasure i have hear of this step : and i have also be much satisfied with the remark on it in the time i well remember in clarkson 's history of the abolition which i read some 60 year ago the account of the circumstance now commemorate by you which determine the action of he whole subsequent life it be not improbable that among those who still remember clarkson my acquaintance with he begin at the earliest time of all i know he intimately from the beginning of 1815 to he death the family which he represent must have occupy a very good position in society i have hear that he sell two good estate to defray the expense which he incur in he personal labor for abolition : and he brother be governor of sierra leone -lrb- i know not at what time appoint -rrb- thoma clarkson be at st john 's college and as i gather from circumstance which i have hear he mention must have be a rather gay man he keep a horse and at one time keep two he take order in the church and on one occasion in the course of he abolition struggle he preach in a church but he afterwards resolutely lay aside all pretension to the title of minister of the church and never would accept any title except as layman he be however a very earnest reader of theology during my acquaintance with he and appear to be well acquaint with the early father the precise word in which be announce the subject for prize essay in the university be anne liceat invito in servitutem trahere after the first great victory on the slave trade question he establish himself in a house on the bank of ullswater i have not identify the place : from a view which he once shew I i suppose it to be near the bottom of the lake : but from a account of the storm of wind which he encounter when walk with a lady over a pass it seem to be in or near patterdale when the remains of a mountaineer who perish in helvellyn -lrb- as describe in scott 's well-known poem -rrb- be discover by a shepherd it be to mr clarkson that the intelligence be first bring he then live at bury st edmund mr clarkson be a lady of bury but i can not assign conjecturally any date to he removal or he marriage he only son take he ba degree i think about 1817 i think it be in 1814 that he begin he occupation of playford hall -- a moated mansion near ipswich formerly of great importance -- where he live as gentleman farmer manage a farm lease from the marquis of bristol and occupy a good position among the gentry of the county a relative of mine with whom i be most intimately acquaint live in the same parish -lrb- where in defiance of school rule i spend nearly half my time to my great advantage as i believe and where i still retain a cottage for occasional residence -rrb- and i enjoy much of mr clarkson 's notice it be by he strong advice that i be send to cambridge and that trinity college be select : he ride with I to rev mr roger of sproughton for introductory examination he introduce I to rev c musgrave -lrb- subsequently of halifax -rrb- accidentally do duty at grundisburgh who then introduce I to sedgwick peacock and t musgrave -lrb- subsequently of york -rrb- in 1825 when i spend the summer at keswick he introduce I to southey and wordsworth mr clarkson live about thirty year at playford hall and die there and lie inter with he wife son and grandson in playford churchyard i join several friend in erect a granite obelisk to he memory in the same churchyard he family be extinct : but a daughter of he brother be live first marry to t clarkson 's son and now mr dickinson of the rectory wolferton i be my dear sir very faithfully yours gb airy _ the very reverend the dean of ely _ 1880 the admiralty on final consideration of the estimate decide not to proceed with the erection of a new library near the magnetic observatory in the present year in the mean time the space have be clear for the erection of a building 50 by 20 foot -- i have remove the electrometer mast -lrb- a source of some expense and some danger -rrb- the perfect success of sir william thomson 's electrometer render all further apparatus for the same purpose unnecessary -- many year ago a double-image micrometer in which the image be form by the double refraction of a sphere of quartz be prepare by mr dollond for capt smyth rn adopt the same principle on a larger scale i have have construct by mr hilger a micrometer with double refraction of a sphere of iceland spar mark have be prepare for examination of the scale but i have not yet have opportunity of try it -- the spectroscopic determination of star-motion have be steadily pursue the star be take from a work list of 150 star which may eventually be extend to include all star down to the fourth magnitude and it be expect that in the course of time the motion of about 300 star may be spectroscopically determine -- a new pressure-plate with spring have be apply by mr browning to osler 's anemometer and it be propose to make such modification as will give a scale extend to 50 lb pressure on the square foot other part of the instrument have also be renew -- as regard the reduction of the magnetical result since 1863 : in the study of the form of the individual curve they relation to the hour the month the year they connection with solar or meteorological fact the conjectural physico-mechanical cause by which they be produce there be much to occupy the mind i regret that though in contemplation of these curve i have remark some singular -lrb- but imperfect -rrb- law i have not be able to pursue they -- the mean temperature of the year 1879 be 461  be 33  below the average of the precede 38 year the highest temperature be 806  on July 30 and the lowest 137  on dec 7 the mean temperature be below the average in every month of the year the month of greatest deviation be January and December respectively 68  and 76  below the average the month of April may July and November be each between 4  and 5  below the average the number of hour of bright sunshine record with campbell 's sunshine instrument during 1879 be only 983 -- in the summer of 1879 commander green usn come over to this country for the purpose of determine telegraphically the longitude of lisbon as part of a chain of longitude extend from south america to greenwich a successful interchange of signal be make with commander green between greenwich and porthcurno on four night 1879 June 25 to 29 the result communicate by commander green shew that the longitude of lisbon observatory as adopt in the nautical almanac require the large correction of +854 -- with regard to the come transit of venus in 1882 : from the facility with which the requirement for geographical position be satisfied and from the rapid and accurate communication of time now give by electric telegraph the observation of this transit will be comparatively easy and inexpensive i have attach greater importance than i do formerly to the elevation of the sun i remark that it be highly desirable that step be take now for determine by telegraph the longitude of some point of australium i have state as the general opinion that it will be useless to repeat photographic observation -- in April mr barlow call in reference to the enquiry on the tay bridge disaster -lrb- the bridge have be blow down on dec 28th 1879 -rrb- i prepare a memorandum on the subject for the tay bridge commission and give evidence in a committee room of the house of lord on apr 29th -lrb- much of the astronomer royal 's evidence on this occasion have reference to the opinion which he have express concern the wind-pressure which might be expect on the project forth bridge in 1873 -rrb- -- in may airy be consult by the postmaster-general in the matter of a dispute which have arise between the post office and the telephone company which latter be allege to have infringe the monopoly of the post office in commercial telegraph : airy make a declaration on the subject -- in July mr bakhuyzen come to england to determine the longitude of leyden on which he be engage till sept 9th and carry on he observation at the observatory -- in July airy be much engage in peruse the record of mr gill 's work at the cape of good hope of private history : on jan 24th he return from playford -- from June 14th to July 4th he be again at playford -- from September 21st to October 20th he be stay at portinscale near keswick -- on dec 23rd he go again to playford for he winter holiday respect the agitation at cambridge for grant university degree to woman the following extract from a letter address to a young lady who have forward a memorial on the subject for he consideration and dated nov 10th 1880 contain airy 's view on this matter i have not sign the memorial which you send for my consideration : and i will endeavor to tell you why i entirely approve of education of young woman to a higher pitch than they do commonly reach i think that they can successfully advance so far as to be able clearly to understand -- with gratification to themselves and with advantage to those whose education they will superintend -- much of the result of the highest class of science which have be obtain by man whose life be in great measure devote to it but i do not think that they nature or they employment will permit of they master the _ severe _ step of beginning -lrb- and indeed all through -rrb- and the _ complicated _ step at the end and i think it well that this they success should be well know -- as it be sure to be -- among they relative they friend they visitor and all in whom they be likely to take interest they connection with such a place as girton college be i think sufficient to lead to this but i desire above all that all this be do in entire subservience to what i regard as _ infinitely _ more valuable than any amount of knowledge namely the delicacy of woman 's character and here i think we view totally separate i do not imagine that the university degree would really imply as regard education anything more than be know to all person -lrb- socially concern in the happiness of the young woman -rrb- from the less public testimonial of the able man who have the means of know they merit and thus it appear to I that the admission to university degree would simply mean a more extended publication of they name i dread this 1881 the new line of underground telegraph wire have be complete by the officer of the general post office the new route be down croom 's hill in greenwich and the result of this change at least as regard the earth-current wire and probably as regard the other wire have not be satisfactory it be soon find that the indication of the earth-current wire be disturb by a continual series of petty fluctuation which almost completely mask the proper feature of earth current if this fault can not be remove i should propose to return to we original system of independent wire -lrb- formerly to croydon and dartford -rrb- -- the new azimuth-mark -lrb- for the altazimuth -rrb- upon the parapet of the naval college be find to be perfectly satisfactory as regard both steadiness and visibility the observation of a low star for zero of azimuth have be omit since the beginning of 1881 the mark in combination with a high star appear to give all that be necessary for this purpose -- all the instrument have suffer from the congealing of the oil during the severe weather of the past winter and very thorough cleaning of all the move part have be necessary -- the solar eclipse of 1880 dec 31 be well observe the first contact be observe by four observer and the last contact by two the computation for the observation have be exceptionally heavy from the circumstance that the sun be very low -lrb- 86  14 ' zd at the last observation -rrb- and that it have therefore be necessary to compute the refraction with great accuracy involve the calculation of the zenith distance for every observation and besides this eighty-six separate computation of the tabular ra and npd of cusp have be require -- amongst other interesting spectroscopic observation of the sun a remarkable spectrum of a sun-spot shewing 17 strong black line or band each as broad as b_1 in the solar spectrum be observe on 1880 nov 27 and 29 these band to which there be nothing corresponding in the solar spectrum -lrb- except some very faint line -rrb- have also be subsequently remark in the spectrum of several spot -- the police ship ` royalist ' -lrb- which be injure by a collision in 1879 and have be lay up in dock -rrb- have not be again moor in the river and the series of observation of the temperature of the thame be thus terminate -- part of the month of January 1881 be as regard cold especially severe the mean temperature of the period January 12 to 26 -lrb- 15 day -rrb- be only 242  or 147  below the average the temperature fall below 20  on 10 day and rise above the freezing point only on 3 day the highest temperature in this period be 353  the lowest 127  on January 17th -lrb- while stay at playford -rrb- my son hubert and i notice a almost imperceptible movement in the upper cloud from the south-east on that night begin the terrible easterly gale accompany with much snow which last to the night of the 18th the limit pressure of 50 lb on the square foot of osler 's anemometer be twice exceed during this storm -- with respect to the diurnal inequality of magnetic horizontal force : assume it to be certain that they originate from the sun 's power not immediately but mediately through he action on the earth it appear to I -lrb- as i suggest long ago -rrb- that they be the effect of the attraction of the red end or north end of the needle by the heated portion of we globe especially by the heated sea whose effect appear to predominate greatly over that of the land i do not say that everything be thus make perfectly clear but i think that the lead phenomenon may be thus explain and this be almost necessarily the way of begin a science -- in the first few year after the strict and systematic examination of competitive chronometer begin with 1856 the accuracy of chronometer be greatly increase for many year past it have be nearly stationary i interpret this as shewing that the effect of bad workmanship be almost eliminate and that future improvement must be seek in change of some point of construction -- refer to the transit of venus in 1874 the printing of all section of the observation with specimen of the print form employ and remark on the photographic operation be very nearly complete a introduction be begin in manuscript i be in correspondence with the commission which be entrust with the arrangement for observation of the transit of 1882 -- the numerical lunar theory have be much interrupt by the pressure of the transit of venus work and other business -- in he report to the board of visitor -lrb- he 46th and last -rrb- airy remark that it would be a fitting opportunity for the expression of he view on the general object of the observatory and on the duty which they impose on all who be actively concern in its conduct and this he proceed to do in very considerable detail -- on may 5th he write to lord northbrook -lrb- first lord of the admiralty -rrb- and to mr gladstone to resign he post of astronomer royal from time to time he be engage on the subject of a house for he future residence and finally take a lease of the white house at the top of croom 's hill just outside one of the gate of greenwich park on the

observatory the follow resolution propose by professor j c adam and second by professor g g stoke be then unanimously adopt and order to be record in the minute of the proceedings the board have hear from the astronomer royal that he propose to terminate he connection with the observatory on the 15th of August next desire to record in the most emphatic manner they sense of the eminent service which he have render to astronomy to navigation and the ally science throughout the long period of 45 year during which he have preside over the royal observatory they consider that during that time he have not only maintained but have greatly extend the ancient reputation of the institution and they believe that the astronomical and other work which have be carry on in it under he direction will form a enduring monument of he scientific insight and he power of organization among he many service to science the follow be a few which they desire especially to commemorate : _ -lrb- a -rrb- _ the complete re-organization of the equipment of the observatory _ -lrb- b -rrb- _ the design of instrument of exceptional stability and delicacy suitable for the increase accuracy of observation demand by the advance of astronomy _ -lrb- c -rrb- _ the extension of the means of make observation of the moon in such portion of she orbit as be not accessible to the transit circle _ -lrb- d -rrb- _ the investigation of the effect of the iron of ship upon compass and the correction of the error thence arise _ -lrb- e -rrb- _ the establishment at the observatory and elsewhere of a system of time signal since extensively develop by the government the board feel it they duty to add that sir george airy have at all time devoted himself in the most unsparing manner to the business of the observatory and have watch over its interest with a assiduity inspire by the strongest personal attachment to the institution he have avail himself zealously of every scientific discovery and invention which be in he judgment capable of adaptation to the work of the observatory and the long series of he annual report to the board of visitor furnish abundant evidence if such be need of the soundness of he judgment in the appreciation of suggest change and of he readiness to introduce improvement when the proper time arrive while maintain the most remarkable punctuality in the reduction and publication of the observation make under he own superintendance he have reduce collect and thus render available for use by astronomer the lunar and planetary observation of he predecessor nor can it be forget that notwithstanding he absorb occupation he advice and assistance have always be at the disposal of astronomer for any work of importance to refer in detail to he labor in department of science not directly connect with the royal observatory may seem to lie beyond the province of the board but it can not be improper to state that its member be not unacquainted with the high estimation in which he contribution to the theory of tide to the undulatory theory of light and to various abstract branch of mathematics be hold by man of science throughout the world in conclusion the board would express they earnest hope that in he retirement sir george airy may enjoy health and strength and that leisure for which he have often express a desire to enable he not only to complete the numerical lunar theory on which he have be engage for some year past but also to advance astronomical science in other direction \* \* \* \* \* admiralty _ 27th October 1881 _ sir i be

all land that it be unnecessary for we to do more than assure you how heartily we join in they appreciation of you labor we may however add that we position have give we opportunity of see that which other can not equally well know the untiring energy and great industry which have be therein display throughout a long and laborious career a energy which lead you in retirement and at fourscore year of age to contemplate further scientific work we would ask you to carry with you into private life the best wish of each one of we for you future happiness and that of you family express the hope that

letter from the academy of science at amsterdam and friendly letter of sympathy from dr gould prof newcombe dr listing and from many other scientific friend and society he reply to the russian and german address be as follow : royal observatory greenwich _ 1881 August 5 _ my dear sir i receive with feeling which i will not attempt to describe the address of yourself and the astronomer of pulkowa generally on the occasion of my retirement from the office of astronomer royal i can scarcely credit myself with possess all the varied claim to you scientific regard which you detail i must be permit to attribute many of they to the long and warm friendship which have subsist so long between the director of the pulkowa observatory and myself and which have influence the feeling of the whole body of astronomer attach to that institution on one point however i willingly accept you favourable expression -- i have not be spare of my personal labor -- and to this i must attribute partial success on some of the subject to which you allude in glance over the marginal list of scientific pursuit i remark with pleasure the reference to _ optics _ i still recur with delight to the undulatory theory once the branch of science on which i be best know to the world and which by calculation writings and lecture i support against the laplacian school but the close of you remark touch I much more -- the association of the name of w struve and my own i respect deeply the whole character of you father and i believe that he have confidence in I from we first meeting in 1830 -lrb- on a

and the vorstand of the astronomische gesellschaft _ chapter x at the white house greenwich from he resignation of office on August 15th 1881 to he death on January 2nd 1892 history of he life after he resignation of office on the 16th of August 1881 airy leave the observatory which have be he residence for nearly 46 year and remove to the white house whatever he feeling may have be at the sever of he old association he carefully keep they to himself and enter upon he new life with the cheerful composure and steadiness of temper which he possess in a remarkable degree he be now more than 80 year old and the care of office have begin to weigh heavily upon he : the long-continued drag of the transit of venus work have weary he and he be anxious to carry on and if possible complete he numerical lunar theory the great work which for some year have occupy much of he time and attention he mental power be still vigorous and he energy but little impaired : he strong constitution he regular habit of life the systematic relief which he obtain by short holiday expedition whenever he find himself wear with work and he keen interest in history poetry classic antiquity engineering and other subject not immediately connect with he profession have combine to produce this result and in leave office he have no idea of leave off work he resignation of office merely mean for he a change of work it be needless to say that he interest in the welfare and progress of the observatory be as keen as ever he advice be always at the service of he successor and he appointment as visitor a year or two after he resignation give he a official position with regard to the observatory which he much value the white house which be to be he home for the rest of he life be just outside one of the upper gate of the park and about a quarter of a mile from the observatory here he reside with he two unmarried daughter the house suit he well and he be very comfortable there : he prefer to live in the neighborhood with which he be so familiar and in which he be so well know rather than to remove to a distance he daily habit of life be but little altered : he work steadily as formerly take he daily walk on blackheath make frequent visit to playford and occasional expedition to the cumberland lake and elsewhere the work to which he chiefly devoted himself in he retirement be the completion of he numerical lunar theory this be a vast work involve the subtlest consideration of principle very long and elaborate mathematical investigation of a high order and a enormous amount of arithmetical computation the issue of it be unfortunate : he conclude that there be a error in some of the early work which vitiate the result obtain : and although the whole process be publish and be leave in such a state that it would be a comparatively simple task for a future astronomer to correct and complete it yet it be not permit to the original author of it to do this to avoid the necessity of frequent reference to this work in the history of airy 's remain year it will be convenient to summarize it here it be commence in 1872 : on feb 23rd in this year i first -lrb- privately -rrb- form the notion of prepare a numerical lunar theory by substitute delaunay 's number in the proper equation and see what would come of it from this time forward till he power to continue it absolutely fail he pursue the subject with he usual tenacity of purpose during he tenure of office every available opportunity be seize for make progress with he lunar theory and in every report to the visitor a careful statement be insert of the state in which it then stand and after he resignation of office it form the bulk of he occupation in 1873 the theory be form and by 1874 it be so far advance that he publish in the monthly notice of the royal astronomical society a statement of the fundamental point of the theory in 1875 the theory have advance to a stage where extensive arithmetical computation be require he obtain a small grant from the government in aid of the expense of the work and other grant be make in subsequent year by 1878 the calculation be so far advance that a opinion could be form as to the probable accuracy of the theory and the follow remark be make : a cursory collation of the term relate to the area -lrb- in the ecliptic -rrb- lead I to suppose that there might be some error in the computation of the annual equation and related term but no error could be discover and the work proceed the complex character of the theory and the extreme care require in the mathematical process be well illustrate by the follow statement which occur in the report of 1879 a important error in the theoretical formula for variation of radius vector longitude and latitude be discover some calculation depend on they be cancel in 1880 and 1881 the work be continue but be sadly interrupt by the pressure of the transit of venus work and other business after he resignation of the office of astronomer royal he have no further public assistance and do much of the computation himself but a sum of _ # 100 _ be contribute by mr de la rue in furtherance of the work and this sum be spend on computer in he retirement the work make good progress and on dec 31st 1882 he make the following note : i finish and put in general order the final table of equation of variation this be a definite point in the lunar theory i hope shortly to take up severely the numerical operation of the lunar theory from the very begin the work be continue steadily through 1883 and on mar 24th 1884 he make application through the board of visitor to the admiralty to print the work : after the usual enquiry as to the expense this be accede to and copy be send to the printer as soon as it be ready the first print proof be receive on feb 5th 1885 and the whole book be print by the end of 1886 from the frequent reference in he journal to error discover and correct during the progress of these calculation it would seem likely that he power be not what they have be and that there be a probability that some important error might escape correction he be far too honest to blind himself to this possibility and in the preface to he numerical lunar theory he say thus : i have explain above that the principle of operation be to arrange the fundamental mechanical equation in a form suit for the investigation of lunar theory to substitute in the term of these equation the numerical value furnish by delaunay 's great work and to examine whether the equation be thereby satisfy with painful alarm i find that they be not satisfied and that the discordance or failure of satisfy the equation be large the critical trial depend on the great mass of computation in section ii these have be make in duplicate with all the care for accuracy that anxiety could supply still i can not but fear that the error which be the source of discordance must be on my part i can not conjecture whether i may be able to examine sufficiently into this matter he resolutely take in hand the revision of he work and continue it till October 1888 but it be clear from the entry in he journal that he power be now unequal to the task and although from time to time he suspect that he have discover error yet it do not appear that he determine anything with certainty he never doubt that there be important error in the work and later on he leave the follow private note on the subject : numerical lunar theory _ 1890 sept 29 _ i have make considerable advance -lrb- under official difficulty -rrb- in calculation on my favorite numerical lunar theory when i discover that under the heavy pressure of unusual matter -lrb- two transit of venus and some eclipse -rrb- i have commit a grievous error in the first stage of give numerical value to my theory my spirit in the work be break and i have never heartily proceed with it since gb airy probably the error refer to here be the suspect error mention above in he report of 1878 as to which he subsequently become more certain whatever may be the imperfection of the numerical lunar theory it be a wonderful work to have be turn out by a man 85 year old in its idea and inception it embody the experience of a long life actively spend in practical science and it may be that it will yet fulfil the object of its author and that some younger astronomer may take it up correct its error -lrb- wherever they may be -rrb- and fit it for practical use and then the labor bestow upon it will not have be in vain subject always to the absorb occupation of the lunar theory he amuse himself with read he favorite subject of history and antiquity he movement during the remainder of the year 1881 be as follow : in September he pay a two day ' visit to lady herschel at hawkhurst from oct 4th to 17th he be at the cumberland lake and engage in expedition in the neighborhood from nov 5th to 8th he be at cambridge inspect prof stuart 's workshop and other scientific institution on dec 13th he go to playford -- amongst miscellaneous matter : in November he write to mr rothery on the loss of the ` teuton ' at some length with suggestion for the safer construction of such vessel -- in October he be ask for suggestion regard the establishment of a standard time applicable to the railway traffic in the united state : he reply as follow : _ 1881 oct 31 _ sir i have to acknowledge you letter of October 17 introduce to my notice the difficulty which appear to be arise in america regard a standard time for extensive use throughout n america applicable to railway traffic only the subject as include consideration of convenience in all the matter to which it apply be one of difficulty probably insuperable the certainty however that objection may be raise to every scheme render I less timid in offer my own remark which be much at you service i first comment upon you expression of standard time applicable to railway traffic only but do you mean this as affect the transaction between one railway and another railway or as affect each railway and the local interest -lrb- temporal and other -rrb- of the town which it touch the difference be so great that i should be dispose to adopt it as mark very strongly the difference to be make between the practice of railway among themselves and the practice of railway towards the public and will base a system on that difference as regard the practice of railway among themselves : if the various railway of america be join and inosculate as they be in england it appear to I indispensable that they have one common standard _ among themselves _ : say washington observatory time but this be only need for the office-transaction between the railway it may be keep perfectly private never communicate to the public at all and i should recommend this as the first step there will then be no difficulty in deduce from these private washington time the accurate local time at those station -lrb- whose longitude be suppose to be fairly well know as a sailor with a sextant can determine one in a few hour -rrb- which the railway authority may deem worthy of that honor generally the terminus of railway thus we shall have a series of basis of local time of authoritative character through the country of such basis _ we _ have two greenwich and dublin : and they be separate by a sea-voyage in the we of america there must be a greater number and probably not so well separate still it be indispensable to adopt such a system of local center no people in this world can be induce to use a reckoning which do not depend clearly upon the sun in all civilized country it depend -lrb- approximately -rrb- on the sun 's meridian passage even the sailor on mid-ocean refer to that phenomenon and the solar passage with reasonable allowance 20m or 30m one way or another must be recognize in all time-arrangement as give the fundamental time the only practical way of do this be to adopt for a whole region the fundamental time of a center of that region and to this fundamental time the local time of the railway as now enter into all the concern of life must be adapt a solicitor have a appointment to meet a client by railway a physician to a consultation how be this to be keep if the railway use one time and every other act of life another there be one chain of circumstance which be almost peculiar -- that of the line from new york to san francisco here i would have two clock at every station : those on the north side all shew san francisco time and those on the south all shew new york time every traveller 's watch would then be available to the end of he journey a system fundamentally such as i have sketch would give little trouble and may i think be adopt with advantage i be sir you faithful servant gb airy _ mr edward barrington _ 1882 he return from playford on jan 17 : he other movement during the year be as follow : from apr 27th to may 11th he be at playford and again from August 1st to 24th from oct 9th to nov 1st he be travel with he two unmarried daughter in the lake district of cumberland : the journey be by furness and coniston to portinscale near keswick on oct 13th he fall and sprain he ankle and he excursion for the rest of the time be mainly conduct by drive shortly after he return on nov 11th while walk alone on blackheath he be seize with a violent attack of illness and lay helpless for some time before he be find and bring home : he seem however to have recover to a great extent in the course of a day or two and continue he lunar theory and other work as before on June 22nd he make the follow sad note this morning die after a most painful illness my much-loved daughter-in-law anna airy daughter of professor listing of gttingen wife of my eldest son wilfrid in February he write out he reminiscence of the village of playford during he boyhood in June he be much disturb in mind on hearing of some important alteration make by the astronomer royal in the collimator of the transit circle and some correspondence ensue on the subject -- during the year he have much correspondence on the subject of the subsidence on blackheath the follow letter be write in reply to a gentleman who have ask whether it could be ascertain by calculation how long it be since the glacial period exist : _ 1882 July 4 _ sir i should have much pleasure in fully answer you question of July 3 if i be able to do so : but the subject really be very obscure -lrb- 1 -rrb- though it be recognize that the glacial period -lrb- or period -rrb- be late i do not think that any one have venture to fix upon a rude number of year since elapse -lrb- 2 -rrb- we have no reason to think that the mean distance of the earth from the sun have sensibly alter there have be change in the eccentricity of the orbit -lrb- make the earth 's distance from the sun less in one month and greater in the opposite month -rrb- but i do not perceive that this would explain glacier -lrb- 3 -rrb- i consider it to be certain that the whole surface of the earth at a very distant period be very hot that it have cool gradually and -lrb- theoretically and imperceptibly -rrb- be cool still the glacier must be later than these hot time and later than we last consolidated stratum : but this be nearly all that i can say i be sir you obedient servant gb airy _ jame alston esq _ 1883 from may 2nd to 29th he be at playford from July 10th to 20th he be travel in south wale with he daughter -- from oct 10th to nov 10th he be at playford -- between nov 20th of this year and jan 4th of the year 1884 he sit several time to mr john collier for he portrait : the picture be exhibit in the academy of 1884 it be a most successful and excellent likeness throughout the year he be very busy with the numerical lunar theory -- in march he be officially ask to accept the office of visitor of the royal observatory which he accept and in this capacity attend at the annual visitation on June 2nd and address a memorandum to the visitor on the progress of he lunar theory -- on march 12th he publish in several newspaper a statement in opposition to the propose braithwaite and buttermere railway which he consider would be injurious to the lake district in which he take so deep a interest -- in may he communicate to the observatory a statement of he objection to a theory advance by mr stone -lrb- then president of the royal astronomical society -rrb- to account for the recognize inequality in the mean motion of the moon this theory on a subject to which airy have give he incessant attention for so many year would naturally receive he careful attention and criticism and it attract much general notice at the time -- in December he write to the secretary of the royal astronomical society he opinion as to the award of the medal of the society in this letter he state the principle which guide he as follow : i have always maintain that the award of the medal ought to be guide mainly by the originality of communication : that one advance in a new direction ought in we decision to outweigh any mass of work in a routine already establish : and that in any case scientific utility as distinguish from mere elegance be indispensable -- in July lieut pinheiro of the brazilian navy call with a autograph letter of introduction from the emperor of brazil the lieutenant desire to make himself acquaint with the english system of lighthouse and meteorology and airy take much trouble in provide he with introduction through which he receive every facility for the thorough accomplishment of he object -- on oct 8th he forward to prof cayley proof of euclid 's proposition i 47 and iii 35 with the follow remark : i place on the other side the proposition which may be substitute -lrb- with knowledge of euclid 's vi book -rrb- for the two celebrated proposition of the geometrical book they leave on my mind no doubt whatever that they be invent as proof by ratio and that they be then violently expand into cumbrous geometrical proof -- on June 28th he decline to sign a memorial ask for the interment of mr spottiswoode in westminster abbey state as he reason i take it that interment possess such a public character be a public recognition of benefit political literary or philosophical whose effect will be great and durable now i doubt whether it can be state that mr spottiswoode have confer such benefit on society but he add at length he cordial recognition of mr spottiswoode 's scientific service -- throughout he life airy be a regular attendant at church and take much interest in the conduct of the church service in October of this year he write a long letter to the vicar of greenwich on various point in which occur the follow paragraph : but there be one matter in the present form of the church service on which my feeling be very strong namely the -lrb- so-called i believe -rrb- choral service in the confession the prayer and the creed i have long listen with veneration to we noble liturgy and i have always be strike with the deep personally religious feeling which pervade it especially those part of it which be for ` the people ' and a earnest priest earnestly press these part by he vocal example on the notice of the people can scarcely fail to excite a corresponding earnestness in they all this be totally lose in the choral system for a venerable persuasion there be substitute a rude irreverential confusion of voice for a earnest acceptance of the form offer by the priest there be substitute -- in my feeling at least -- a weary wait for the end of a unmeaning form he also object much to sing the response to the commandment 1884 from apr 29th to may 30th he be at playford conclude he journal there with the note so end a pleasant vacation -- on June 11th he go to cambridge and attend the trinity college commemoration service and dine in hall -- from aug

theology and sundry book of the old testament on June 7th he attend at the visitation of the royal observatory -- in a letter write in April to lt-col marindin ra on the subject of wind pressure there occur the follow remark : when the heavy gust come on the wind be blow in direction change rapidly but limit in extent my conclusion be that in arch of small extent -lrb- as in the tay bridge -rrb- every thing must be calculate for full pressure but in arch of large extent -lrb- as in the forth bridge -rrb- every thing may be calculate for small pressure and for a suspension bridge the pressure be far less dangerous than for a stiff arch -- in January he have some correspondence with professor tyndall on the theory of the white rainbow and state that he thoroughly agree with dr young 's explanation of this phaenomenon -- the follow be extract from a letter on may 1st to he old friend otto struve : i receive from you about 3 or 4 week past a sign of you friendly remembrance a copy of you paper on the annual parallax of aldebaran it please I much especially i be delighted with you noble retention of the one equation whose result differ so sensibly from that of the other equation it be quite possible even probable that the mean result be improve by it i have know such instance the first which attract much attention be capt kater 's attempt to establish a scale of longitude in england by reciprocal observation of azimuth between beachy head and dunnose the result be evidently erroneous but colonel colby on examination of the original papers find that some observation have be omit as suspicious and that when these be include the mean agree well with the scale of observation infer from other method -- in a letter to the rev rcm rouse acknowledge the receipt of a geometrical book there occur the follow paragraph : i do not value euclid 's element as a super-excellent book of instruction -- though some important point be better present in it than in any other book of geometrical instruction that i have see but i value it as a book of strong and distinct reasoning and of orderly succession of reasoning i do not think that there be any book in the world which present so distinctly the ` because therefore ' and this be invaluable for the mental education of youth -- in may he be in correspondence with professor balfor stewart regard a project movement in terrestrial magnetism to be submit to the british association airy cordially approve of this movement and support it to the best of he ability state that in he opinion what be mainly want be the collation of exist record -- in January and February he be much press by prof pritchard of oxford to give he opinion as to the incorrectness of statement make by dr kinn in he lecture on the scientific accuracy of the bible airy refuse absolutely to take part in the controversy but he could not escape from the correspondence which the matter involve : and this lead up to other point connect with the early history of the israelite a subject in which he take much interest 1885 from may 4th to June 3rd he be at playford -- from July 2nd to 22nd he be in the lake district the journey be by windermere to kentmere where he make enquiry concern the airy family as it have be conclude with much probability from investigation make by he nephew the rev basil r airy that the family be settle there at a very early date some person of the name of airy be still live there he then go on by coniston and grasmere to portinscale and spend the rest of he time in expedition amongst the hill and visit to friend -- on July 28th he go to woodbridge in suffolk and distribute the prize to the boy of the grammar school there -- from oct 9th to nov 12th he be again at playford -- throughout the year he be busily engage on the numerical lunar theory and find but little time for miscellaneous reading of print papers by airy in this year the most important be one on the result deduce from the measure of terrestrial magnetic force in the horizontal plane & c this be a long paper communicate to the royal society and publish in the phil tran and be the last scientific paper of any importance -lrb- except the volume of the numerical lunar theory -rrb- in the long list of papers by gb airy the preparation of this paper take much time -- of miscellaneous matter : in may a committee of the royal society have be appoint to advise the indium office as to the publication of col j herschel 's pendulum observation in indium and airy be ask to assist the committee with he advice he give very careful and anxious consideration to the subject and it occupy much time -- in the early part of the year he be ask by sir william thomson to assist he with a affidavit in a lawsuit concern a alleged infringement of one of he patent for the improvement of the compass airy decline to make a affidavit or to take side in the dispute but he write a letter from which the follow be extract : i can not have the least difficulty in express my opinion that you have make a great advance in the application of my method of correct the compass in iron ship by you introduction of the use of short needle for the compass-card in my original investigation when the whole subject be in darkness i could only use exist means for experiment namely the long-needle compass then exist but when i apply mechanical theory to explanation of the result i feel grievously the deficiency of a theory and the construction which it suggest -lrb- necessarily found on assumption that the proportion of the needle-length to the other element of measure be small -rrb- when the length of the needle be really so great i should possibly have use some construction like yours but the government have not then a single iron vessel and do not seem disposed to urge the enquiry you under happier auspices have successfully carry it out and i fully believe with much advantage to the science -- he write a paper for the athenaeum and have various correspondence on the subject of the badbury ring in dorsetshire which he -lrb- and other -rrb- consider as identical with the mon badonicus of gilda the site of a ancient british battle -- in February he be in correspondence with the astronomer royal on uniform time reckoning and on consideration relate to it -- on June 6th he attend the annual visitation of the observatory and bring before the board he investigation of the diurnal magnetic inequality and the revise of he lunar theory 1886 from June 8th to July 17th he be at playford -- and again at playford from oct 5th to nov 8th -- on march 27th he have a attack of gout in he right foot which continue through April and into may cause he much inconvenience -- he be busy with the numerical lunar theory up to sept 25th when he be read the last proof-sheet receive from the printer : during this period he power be evidently fail and there be frequent reference to error discover and correct and to uncertainty connect with point of the theory but he great work on the numerical lunar theory be print in this year : and there can be no doubt that he experience a great feeling of relief when this be accomplish -- he be in correspondence with prof adam as to the effect of he reduction of the coefficient of lunar acceleration on the calculation of the ancient historical eclipse -- he compile a paper on the establishment of the roman dominion in england which be print in 1887 -- he write a notice concern event in the life of mr john jackson of rosthwaite near keswick a well-known guide and much-respected authority on matter relate to the lake district -- he also write a short account of the connection of the history of mdlle de quroualle with that of the royal observatory at greenwich

greenwich -- from oct 11th to nov 12th he be at playford -- during this year he partly occupy himself with arrange he papers and drawing and with miscellaneous reading but he could not withdraw he thought from he lunar theory and he still continue to struggle with the difficulty of the subject and be constantly scheming improvement he private account also now give he much trouble throughout he life he have be accustom to keep he account by double entry in very perfect order but he now begin to make mistake and to grow confused and this distressed he greatly it never seem to occur to he to abandon he elaborate system of account and to content himself with simple entry of receipt and expense this would have be utterly oppose to he sense of order which be now more than ever the ruling principle of he mind and so he struggle with he account as he do with he lunar theory till he power absolutely fail in he journal for this year there be various entry of mental attack of short duration and other ailment ascribable to he advanced age the last print papers by gb airy belong to this year one be the paper before refer to on the establishment of the roman dominion in england : another be on the solution of a certain equation : and there be early reminiscence of the cambridge tripos & c -- in February he attend a little to a new edition of he ipswich lecture but soon hand it

drop it there be several reference in he journal to he feeling of pain and weakness both mental and bodily : at the end of march he have a attack of gout in the finger of he right hand during the latter part of the year he be trouble with he private account as before -- he do not appear to have be engage on any miscellaneous matter call for special notice in this year but he keep up he astronomical correspondence -- with lockyer on the meteorite system of planetary formation with pritchard on the work of the oxford university observatory with adam on he numerical lunar theory & c and with other -- on June 2nd he attend the visitation of the royal observatory -- he amuse himself occasionally with read he favorite subject of history and antiquity and with look over some of he early investigation of scientific question 1889 on June 5th he make a one-day 's excursion to colchester -- from July 2nd to 27th he be in the cumberland lake district chiefly at portinscale near keswick while stay at portinscale he be seize with a sudden giddiness and fall upon the floor : he afterwards write a curious account of the vision which oppress he brain immediately after the accident he return by solihull where he son osmund be reside -- from oct 4th to nov 8th he be at playford while there he draw up a short statement of he general state of health adverting particularly to the loss of strength in he leg and failure of he walk power -- he health seem to have fail a good deal in this year : on feb 4th he have a accidental fall and there be several entry in he journal

he amusement he be chiefly engage on theological note which he be compile : and also on early optical investigation & c on June 1st he attend the visitation of the royal observatory and move a resolution that a committee be appoint to consider whether any reduction can be effect in the amount of matter print in the volume of observation of the royal observatory during he tenure of office he have on various occasion bring this subject before the board of visitor and with he usual tenacity of purpose he now as visitor press it upon they notice -- in may he zealously join with other in a application to get for dr huggin a pension on the civil list -- in January he prepare a short paper illustrate with diagram to exhibit the interference of solar light as use by he in he lecture at cambridge in 1836 : but it do not appear to have be publish -- in April he receive a copy of a paper by mr rundell refer to the complete adoption of he system of compass correction in iron ship not only in the merchant service but also in the navy this be a matter of peculiar gratification to airy who have always maintain that the method of table of error which have be so persistently adhere to by the admiralty be a mistake and that sooner or later they would find it necessary to adopt he method of mechanical correction the passage refer to be as follow : the name of sir george airy the father of the mechanical compensation of the compass in iron vessel have just be mention it may not be inappropriate to remind you that the present year be the fiftieth since sir george airy present to the royal society he celebrated paper on this subject with the account of he experiment on the ` rainbow ' and ` ironside ' fifty year be a long period in one man 's history and sir george airy may well be proud in look back over this period to see how complete have be the success of he compass investigation he mode of compensation have be adopt by all the civilized world sir william thomson one of the latest and perhaps the most successful of modern compass adjuster when he exhibit he apparatus in 1878 before a distinguished meeting in london remark that within the last ten year the application of sir george airy 's method have become universal not only in the merchant service but in the navy of this and other country and add -- the compass and the binnacle before you be design to thoroughly carry out in practical navigation the astronomer royal 's principle 1890 from may 17th to 24th he be on a expedition to north wale stop at chester conway carnarvon barmouth and shrewsbury -- from June 18th to July 24th he be at playford and again from oct 11th to nov 15th -- in this year he power greatly fail and he complain frequently of mental attack weakness of limb lassitude and failure of sleep he occupy himself as usual with he book papers and account and read travels biblical history & c but nothing very persistently on June 7th he attend the visitation of the royal observatory -- from a letter address to he by mr j hartnup of liverpool observatory it appear that there have grow up in the mercantile world a impression that very accurate chronometer be not need for steam ship because they be rarely run many day out of sight of land : and airy 's opinion be request on this matter he reply as follow on mar 3rd : the question propose in you letter be purely a practical one -lrb- 1 -rrb- if a ship be _ likely _ ever to be two day out of sight of land i think that she ought to be furnish with two _ good _ chronometer properly test -lrb- 2 -rrb- for the proper testing of the rate of the chronometer a rating of the chronometer for three or four day in a meridional observatory be necessary a longer testing be desirable -- in march he be in correspondence as one of the trustee of the sheepshank fund with the master of trinity relative to grant from the fund for cambridge observatory 1891 from June 16th to July 15th he be at playford and again from oct 12th to dec 2nd -lrb- he last visit -rrb- throughout the year he weakness both of brain power and muscular power have be gradually increase and during this stay at playford on nov 11th he fall down in he bed-room -lrb- probably from failure of nerve action -rrb- and be much prostrate by the shock for several day he remain in a semi-unconscious condition and although he rally yet he continue very weak and it be not until dec 2nd that he could be remove to the white house up to the time of he fall he have be able to take frequent drive and even short walk in the neighborhood that he be so fond of but he could take but little exercise afterwards and on or about nov 18th he make the following note : the saddest expedition that i have ever make we have not leave home for several day the rapid failure of he power during this year be well exemplify by he handwriting in he journal entry which with occasional rally become broken and in place almost illegible he make frequent reference to he decline in strength and brain-power and to he fail memory but he continue he ordinary occupation make frequent drive around blackheath and amuse himself with he family history research arrangement of papers and miscellaneous reading : and he persist to the last with he private account he interest in matter around he be still keen on June 13th he be drive along the greenwich marsh in order to track the course of the great sewer and on August 5th he visit the crossness sewage work and take great interest in the detail of the treatment of the sewage -- in march he contribute with great satisfaction to the fund for the portrait of he old friend sir gg stoke with whom he have have so much scientific correspondence -- on July 25th a afternoon party be arrange to celebrate the 90th anniversary of he birthday -lrb- the actual anniversary be on July 27th -rrb- none of he early friend be there : he have survive they all but invitation be send to all he scientific and private friend who could be expect to come and a large party assemble the afternoon be very fine and he sit in the garden and receive he friend -lrb- many of whom have come from long distance -rrb- in good strength and spirit it be a most successful gathering and be not without its meaning for it be feel that under the circumstance of he fail power it be in all probability a final leave-taking -- on July 27th he go down to the greenwich parish church at 9 pm to be present at the illumination of the church clock face for the first time -- a matter of local interest which have necessitate a good deal of time and money on this occasion at the request of the company assemble in and around the vestry he speak for about a quarter of a hour on time -- the value of accurate time the dissemination of greenwich time throughout the country by time-signal from the observatory and the exhibition of it by time-ball & c & c -- the subject to which so large a part of he life have be devote it be a pleasant and able speech and give great satisfaction to the parishioner amongst whom he have live for so many year -- he receive two illuminate address -- one from the astronomer royal and staff of the royal observatory the other from the vorstand of the astronomische gesellschaft at berlin -- and various private letter of congratulation the address from the staff of the observatory be word thus : we the present member of the staff of the royal observatory greenwich beg to offer you we most sincere congratulation on the occasion of you 90th birthday we can not but feel how closely associate we be with you in that we whole energy be direct to the maintenance and development of that practical astronomical work of which you essentially lay the foundation it afford we great pleasure to think that after the conclusion of you life 's work you have be spare to live so long under the shadow of the noble observatory with which you name be identify for half a century and with which it must ever remain associate after he return from playford he seem to rally a little : but he soon fall ill and be find to be suffer from hernia this necessitate a surgical operation which be successfully perform on dec 17th this give he effectual relief and after recover from the immediate effect of the operation he lay for several day quietly and without active pain recite the english poetry with which he memory be store but the shock be too great for he enfeebled condition and he die peacefully in the presence of he six survive child on jan 2nd 1892 he be bury in playford churchyard on jan 7th the funeral procession be attend at greenwich by the whole staff of the royal observatory and by other friend and at he burial there be present two former fellow of the college to which he have be so deeply attach appendix list of print papers by gb airy list of book write by gb airy print papers by gb airy with the instinct of order which form one of he chief characteristic airy carefully preserve a copy of every print paper of he own composition these be regularly bind in large quarto volume and they be in themselves a striking proof of he wonderful diligence the bind volume be 14 in number and they occupy a space of 2 ft 6 in on a shelf they contain 518 papers a list of which be append and they form such a important part of he life 's work that he biography would be very incomplete without a reference to they he be very careful in select the channel for the publication of he papers most of the early papers be publish in the transaction of the cambridge philosophical society but several of the most important such as he paper on a inequality of long period in the motion of the earth and venus be publish in the philosophical transaction of the royal society and other such as the article on the figure of the earth gravitation tide and wave & c be publish in encyclopaedia after he removal to greenwich nearly all he papers on scientific subject -lrb- except astronomy -rrb- such as tide magnetism correction of the compass & c & c be communicate to the royal society and be publish in the philosophical transaction but everything astronomical be reserve for the royal astronomical society he connection with that society be very close : he have join it in its earliest day -lrb- the date of he election be may 9th 1828 -rrb- and regard it as the proper medium for the discussion of current astronomical question and for record astronomical progress he be unremitt in he attendance at the monthly meeting of the society and be several time president in the memoirs of the society 35 of he papers be print and in addition 129 papers in the monthly notice in fact a meeting of the society rarely pass without some communication from he and such be he wealth of matter that sometimes he would communicate as many as 3 papers on a single evening for the publication of several short mathematical papers and especially for correspondence on dispute point of mathematical investigation he choose as he vehicle the philosophical magazine to which he contribute 32 papers investigation of a more popular character he publish in the athenaeum which he also use as a vehicle for he reply to attack on he work or on the establishment which he conduct : in all he make 55 communication to that newspaper to various society such as the institution of civil engineer the british association the royal institution & c he present papers or make communication on subject specially suit to each and in like manner to various newspaper : there be 58 papers in this category in so long a official life there would naturally be a great number of official report parliamentary return & c and these with other miscellaneous papers print for particular object and for a limited circulation amount in all to 141 under this head come he annual report to the board of visitor which in themselves contain a extremely full and accurate history of the observatory during
