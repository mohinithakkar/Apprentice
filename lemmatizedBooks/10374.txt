kill-deer suddenly shrill out follow by intense silence no lightning flash fill the wall-like blackness slowly creep over the earth from the west a pale glow on the rim of the roll hill across the valley herald of the moon not yet above the horizon intensify the pall beneath the approach cloud a sullen roar throb angrily rise and fall in volume could be hear come out of the depths of the storm act like it be go to be a bad one old heck observe study the cloud they all be watch wicked skinny say one of they mutterin ' kind until it break and then all hell tear loose if th ' ramblin ' kid be

it you woman go inside and shut the door carolyn June and ophelia spring -- be blow almost -- inside the house and slam the door as another bolt fall flood the room with a blaze that make the light from the lamp on the reading table seem faint and dim old heck and skinny dart around the corner as the tempest pull and tug at the building of the quarter circle kt for a hour ophelium and carolyn June sit and listen to the storm and while it still rage go to bed carolyn June fall asleep watch the incessant glare of the lightning as flash after flash fill the room with light and illumine the world outside while the rain and wind lash the tree in the garden near she window above the tumult the word of old heck : if the ramblin ' kid be out in the sand-hills to-night -- keep repeat themselves over and over in she mind try as she would she could not shut out the picture of a slender young rider alone far out on the range in the storm-mad night unsheltered from the fury and wrath of the element chapter v a duel of endurance when the storm break over the quarter circle kt the ramblin ' kid be twenty mile away follow the gold dust maverick old heck 's surmise that he have go in search of the outlaw filly be but half correct it be not with the definite purpose of try for the renegade mare that he have mount captain jack and head he toward the narrow at the moment carolyn June dixon and ophelium cobb arrive at the ranch nor be it to escape meet the woman they come mean nothing to the ramblin ' kid he simply want to be alone the ride with parker and the boy to the north spring mean talk the ramblin ' kid do not want to talk he want to be with he thought he horse and silence should he happen on to the maverick he might give she a run since she first appearance on the kiowa the ramblin ' kid have see she many time more than once from a distance he have watch the mare get a line on she habit sooner or later he expect to test captain jack 's endurance and skill against the filly 's speed and cunning without success other rider of the kiowa have try to corral the outlaw or get within roping throw of she shapely head so far she have prove herself faster and more clever than any horse ridden against she the ramblin ' kid believe captain jack be master of the beautiful mare that in a battle of nerve and muscle and wind the roan stallion could run she down some day he would prove it at the narrow the trail fork one branch turn sharply to the right and follow a coule out on to the divide between the cimarron and the lower una de gata the other swing toward the river slip into it cross the stream and be lose in the sand-hill beyond the broncho of he own will at the prong of the road wheel up the coule and climb out on the level bench south of the cimarron a half-dozen mile away sentinel mountain rise abruptly out of the plain toward the lone butte captain jack turn he know the place on the north slope there be a tiny spring fence with wire to keep the stock from trample it into a bog near by be a duster of pion tree below the seep in the narrow gorge be a thin strip of willow it be a favorite rendezvous seek by the ramblin ' kid when in mood such as now possess he silently he ride to the group of pions and dismount the ramblin ' kid stretch himself under the tree while captain jack drink at the little water course then with he bridle off the broncho fed contentedly on the bunch grass along the hillside after a time captain jack quit feeding and come into the shade of the pions the ramblin ' kid flat on he back stare through the scant foliage of the tree into the sky -- overcast now with a dim haze forerunner of the storm gathering above the costejo peak thousand of foot in the air a buzzard merely a black speck without motion of wing wheel in great lazy ever-widening circle as the sun drop into the cloud bank in the west a band of mare and colt come from that direction and round a spur of sentinel mountain at they head be the most beautiful horse ever see on the kiowa range in color a coppery almost golden chestnut sorrel flaxen mane and tail verge on creamy white short-coupled in the back and with withers that mark the runner belly smooth and round leg trim and neat as a antelope 's and muscle like a panther 's head small carry proudly erect and eye full and wonderfully clear and brown th ' filly the ramblin ' kid breathe with a bunch of tony malush 's anchor bar mare and colt captain jack see the range horse and lift he head psst the ramblin ' kid hiss and the neigh be stop the ranger move toward the east and over the crest of a ridge a quarter of a mile away on the flat beyond the rise they stop the colt immediately tease the mare to suck the filly withdraw a short distance from the herd and stand alert and watchful for half a hour the ramblin ' kid study the gold dust maverick he look at the cloud climb higher and higher in the west then long and thoughtfully at captain jack let 's get she boy he murmur let 's go a ' get she he mind make up the ramblin ' kid slip the bridle again on captain jack remove the saddle and with the blanket wipe the sweat from the broncho 's back smooth the blanket reset the saddle carefully tighten front and rear cinch and mount the little stallion guide he slowly down the ravine in the direction of the horse on the flat a hundred yard away the mare and colt alarm by the sudden half-whinny half-snort from the filly discover the approach horse and rider instantly the wild horse crowd closely together and gallop toward the una de gata captain jack leap into a run rush they the maverick wheel quickly and dash away to the south alone she pet trick the ramblin ' kid mutter as he head captain jack after the nimble creature she absodamnedlutely will not bunch -- seem to know a crowd mean a corral a rope and at last a rider on she shapely back for two mile it be a race the ramblin ' kid hold captain jack to a steady run a couple of hundred yard in the rear of the speeding mare at last he pull the stallion down to a trot the gold dust maverick answer by run another fifty yard and then herself settle into the slower stride like i think the ramblin ' kid say to himself it be a case of wear she out -- a case of seasoned old muscle against speedy young heel it become a duel of endurance between captain jack wiry toughened and fully mature with heavier muscle and the nimble lighter-footed gold dust mare at dark they be on the edge of the arroyo grande and captain jack have close the distance between they until less than a hundred yard be between the heel of the filly and the head of the stallion behind she she turn east along the arroyo follow it a mile seek a cross then double straight north toward the cimarron captain jack hang to she trail like a hound in the blackness that precede the storm she could not lose he with almost uncanny sureness he pick she out -- follow follow never give the maverick a moment 's rest yet it seem that the distance she keep ahead be measure so alert and watchful be she always both be drip with sweat try as he would it seem impossible for captain jack to win those few yard that would put the filly in reach of the rope the ramblin ' kid hold ready to cast until the inky darkness make it impossible to risk a throw the mare splash into the cimarron a dazzling zigzag flash of lightning the first of the storm and the ramblin ' kid see the filly struggle in the yellow wind-whipped current a moment later and captain jack be swim close behind she on the north side of the river the mare yield to the drive of the tempest and turn east down the stream a rocky gorge run at right angle toward the north offer shelter from the lash wind and rain up the ravine the maverick head a rush of

upper ford be much the nearer way to the ranch rein old blue into it she ride swiftly along the ridge and down the slope toward the dangerous cross \* \* \* \* \* the ramblin ' kid spend the morning at the circular corral he be study the mood and work to win the confidence of the gold dust maverick he be watch she and think always a little ahead of the thought that be in the mind of the mare he love for a horse and understanding of the wonderfully intelligent animal be as natural as be the brown eye the soft low voice the gentle but strong touch by which it be express he woo the outlaw filly thoughtfully carefully as a lover court a sweetheart the beautiful creature remind he of carolyn June they be make for each other he repeat softly as he work with the mare from the corral he could see the road across the river where skinny and the girl have go often he turn he eye in that direction he be finger the garter in he pocket and look toward the river when carolyn June appear on the ridge as she return alone to the ranch he stand and watch she the ugly word she have speak at the gate come into he mind and a bitter smile curl he lip still he watch the girl expect skinny would ride into view she turn down the ridge toward the upper ford that be funny he think wonder where skinny 's at then it flash through he mind that something must be wrong for the girl be ride alone hell he exclaim aloud she be by herself a ' headin ' straight for th ' upper ford only a instant he pause jack he cry sharply run to the corral gate and swing it partly open come -- _ quick _ the roan stallion start at a trot toward the gate then train to obey instantly the word of the master he love better than life leap nimbly through the opening slamming and fasten the gate the ramblin ' kid run to the shed the broncho at he side he throw the blanket and saddle on the little roan cinch quickly but carefully the double gear slip the bit into the wait mouth of the horse and without stop to put on he chap spring on captain jack 's back and whirl he in a dead run around the corner of the shed and down the lane toward the north at the pasture corral below the barn he guide the broncho close to the fence and scarcely check he lean over and lift a rope coil and hang on a post near the gate from its place -- the one chuck that morning have leave because of the flaw god he groan -- a ' a bad rope he glance toward the ridge across the river carolyn June have disappear down the trail that lead to the upper ford go little man go -- for th ' love of god go the ramblin ' kid whisper as he lean forward over the neck of the horse captain jack answer the agonized appeal as he would never have respond to the cruel cut of spur and leap ahead in a desperate race to beat old blue and he precious burden to the greedy sand of the cimarron as he ride the ramblin ' kid slip he hand around the coil of the rope till he finger find the broken strand that tell of the weakness that cause chuck to leave it behind that morning bend over it while he horse run he work frantically to weave a rawhide saddle string into the fiber and so strengthen the dangerous spot \* \* \* \* \* think only to reach the ranch as quickly as possible carolyn June guide old blue down the trail and through the thin patch of willow and cottonwood tree that grow along the river the stream look innocent enough and the cross perfectly safe swift but apparently shallow water flow close to the northern bank beyond that be a clean pebble strew bar and then a smaller narrower prong of the river on the south side stretch a white unbroken expanse of sand a hundred foot or more wide and end against the low slope of the meadow land at the brink of the stream old blue stop short and refuse to go on what be the matter carolyn June laugh lightly -- afraid of get you ` little tootsie ' wet the horse rear backward when she try to urge he ahead and wheel half around in a effort to get away from the water look here old fellow she speak sharply tighten the rein as she touch he flank with she spur we have not time for foolishness generally in fact always accent the last word horse -- and man -- go in the direction i want they to go why you be as stubborn -- as -- as the ramblin ' kid she finish with another laugh as old blue with a snort of fear yet not daring to resist further the firm hand and firmer will of he rider step into the water gee when you do start you go in a hurry do not you carolyn June say as the broncho go rapidly forward as if eager to negotiate the cross seem to know that safety lay in the quickness and lightness of he tread as he lunge ahead the girl have the sensation that the saddle be sink from under she reach the firmer footing of the gravel bar in the center of the stream old blue try again to turn about go on carolyn June cry impatiently yet with a feeling somehow of impend danger she could not wholly define -- you have get to do it so you have as well quit you nonsense and go ahead at the same time rake the horse 's side sharply again with the spur cross the shallow branch of the river the broncho reach the smooth firm appear beach of sand with he head down he muzzle almost touch the ground as if scent feel he way he go forward step rapidly easily as possible at each step he foot slip lower into the yield quiver mass carolyn June feel he tremble and the sensation that the horse be be pull from under she grow more and more pronounced she notice how he sink into the sand and observe also the sweat begin to darken the hair on the neck of she mount pretty soft be not it she say speak to the broncho kindly as though to encourage he and perhaps at the same time to allay a bit the queer sense of uneasiness she feel for even yet she do not realize the danger into which she have unknowingly ridden half-way to the firm black soil of the southern bank of the stream old blue 's front foot seem suddenly to give way beneath he he begin to plunge desperately then it be the truth come to carolyn June she cheek grow white the quicksand she exclaim aloud at the same time try to help the horse with a lift of the rein it be too late to turn back she only salvation lay in reach the solid ground such a few yard ahead -- and yet so fearfully far away old blue struggle madly to go forward gain a little but at each effort sink deeper into the sand carolyn June try to encourage he with word : come on come on good little horse -- you can make it keep try -- that be it -- now -- you be do it brave old blue -- do not give up -- do not give up boy she plead pity for the horse cause she almost to forget she own terrible peril it be useless twenty-five foot from safety old blue 's front quarter go down until he breast be against the sand the hind leg be bury to the stifle he wallow and flounder helplessly he hoof touch nothing solid on which to stand he stretch he head forward straining-to lift himself away from that horrible clinging suction he effort only force he down -- down -- always down carolyn June 's own foot be in the sand she throw herself from the saddle -- as far to one side and ahead of the horse as she could with she weight remove perhaps old blue could get out anyway it be death to stay on the horse perhaps alone she could escape -- she be lighter -- the sand might hold she up -- by move rapidly surely she could go that short twenty-five foot to the firm ground ahead of she at the first step she sink half-way to she thigh she fall forward think to crawl on she hand and knee she arm go into the mass to the shoulder silently -- without a word -- but with horrible fear grip she heart she fight the sand she sink deeper -- slowly -- steadily -- surely the hellish stuff close about she body to the waist if she only have something -- anything -- solid to hold to she take off she hat grasp the edge of the brim reach she arm out and try to use the frail disk of feel for a buoy it hold a moment then gradually settle below the surface of the shift elusive substance again and again she lift the hat free from the sand and seek to place it so it would bear a part at least of she weight she effort be vain the insidious mass creep higher and higher on she body she remember read that one catch in the quicksand by he struggle only hasten he own destruction she try to be perfectly still in spite of all she be sink -- sinking -- the sand be engulf she during all she struggle carolyn June remain silent she have not think to cry out somehow she could not realize that she be to die the sun be bright the sky cloudless the tree along the river-bank barely sway in a little breeze how beautiful the world how queer that such a little distance away be the green grass of the meadow and the firm black earth in which it be root and she -- she be hold fast and helpless in the embrace of the deadly sand strange thought rush through she mind she wonder what they would think at the ranch when night come and she do not return would they know would they guess the thing that have happen would the sand draw she down -- down -- until it cover she so none would ever know where or how she die she look at old blue poor old fellow she whisper i be sorry -- i do not know -- it look so white and firm and safe the sand be half-way up the side of the horse and he sway he body in pathetic futile effort to free himself a strange calm come over carolyn June so this be the end she be to die alone horribly in the treacherous sand of the cimarron surely it could not be -- god would not let she die she be so young she have just begin to live -- she think of hartville she father the old friend how far away they seem how queer it be -- she could not image in she mind any of the familiar scene the face of she father or any of the friend she have know so well she try to think of she uncle josiah ophelia skinny rawlin -- poor fellow how susceptible be he big innocent boyish heart she call each one up in a mental effort to remember how they have look the sound of they voice -- they be only name -- dim shadowy name there be nothing in the whole world but old blue -- herself -- and the sand -- the sand -- a eternity of sand pull drag suck she down she close she eye tightly think to shut out the impression of utter loneliness the face of the ramblin ' kid flash into she mind she could see he she see he lie under the shed as he have look that morning he head rest on the saddle he eye gaze steadily into she own she see he again as he have look when she sting he with she harsh word at the gate she seem to see the agonized humility in he expression and hear the low tenseness of he voice as he repeat aloud the word she have use -- a ign ` rant savage stupid brute she laugh almost hysterically why can i see he -- just he -- and not the other have he come to -- to -- haunt I she finish with a gasp the sand have reach she breast how long before it clutch at she throat she mouth she eye ah would she hold up she arm as she go down -- down -- and reach out she hand as if to wave the world a last long farewell i will -- i will she cry the pressure around she body almost stop she breath i -- i -- will -- and -- wiggle my finger to the end she add with a choke half-hysterical laugh so tightly do she cling to life she mood change i -- guess -- i ought to pray she say but -- i -- god -- god know anyhow she voice trail away to a whisper as if she have grow suddenly utterly tired she stretch out she hand once more with the hat try to use it to buoy she up under the weight of she arm it sink in the sand she toss it to one side it will -- stay -- on top by itself she choke i -- i -- will leave it -- maybe they will find it -- and know -- she feel she sens be leave she even yet she have not call for help it have not occur to she that rescue be possible as if it be a echo to she thought there come the throbbing tattoo of hoof pound the earth she listen intently some one be ride down the lane toward the river from the ranch the horse be evidently run -- run madly desperately would he cross at the upper or lower ford she heart pulsed with heavy dull throb the sand be crush she chest a wave of weakness sweep over she she almost faint at that instant captain jack carry the ramblin ' kid leap through a opening in the willow and stop -- he front foot plow the firm ground at the edge of the quiver beach of sand pure luck the ramblin ' kid breathe fervently he eye quickly measure the distance to the nearly exhaust girl she be close enough i can reach she with th ' rope god if it 'll only hold already the coil be in he hand with a single backward fling of the noose and forward toss he drop the loop over the head of carolyn June pull it up -- close -- under you arm he command shortly a ' hang on with you hand to take th ' strain off you body the girt obey without a word he double half-hitch the rope to the horn of the saddle swing captain jack around look out he call to the girl as he start away from the brink of the sand steady boy be careful -- to the broncho the slack gradually tighten the strain draw on carolyn June 's arm till it seem they would be pull from the socket the rope cut cruelly into she body under she shoulder she want to cry -- to scream -- to laugh she do neither she throw back she head and clung with all she strength to the rough lariat stretch taut as a cable of steel the ramblin ' kid lean forward in the saddle he body half turn eye look back along the straight line of the severely test rope he swear softly steadily under he breath god -- if it will only hold -- if it only do not break slowly surely the little stallion lean he weight against the tensely draw ria and carolyn June feel herself lift inch by inch out of the sand that engulf she at last she fall forward -- she body free without stop the horse the ramblin ' kid continue away from the river-bank and drag the girl across the yield surface to the solid earth and safety the instant she be where he could reach she he whirl captain jack and ride quickly back carolyn June be try to get to she foot when he spring from the broncho and help she to the firm ground on which he stand she be pant and exhaust get -- get -- old blue out she gasp and drop limply down on the grass finger at the rope to remove it from around she body danged if she be not get more heart than i think she have the ramblin ' kid say to himself as he lift the loop from over she head i be goin ' to he say aloud if i can -- but -- i be afraid he be go i 'll try anyhow -- you lay there a ' rest -- at the same time remount he horse the sand cover the rump of old blue the saddle parker 's it be be nearly submerge only the horn and cantle showing above the slimy mass he head neck and the top of he withers be yet expose he still struggle wallow feebly vainly resist the downward pull of the sand crouching as if fascinate by the terrible scene carolyn June watch as the ramblin ' kid wait he opportunity at the instant the horse in the sand lift he head deftly fling the rope over he neck with a short jerk of the wrist he tighten the noose till it close snugly about the throat of the broncho again turn captain jack away from the bank he urge he slowly forward the rope stiffen the little stallion bunch himself and desperately strain against the dead weight of old blue multiply many time by the suction of the sand the ramblin ' kid lean far over the neck of captain jack to give the horse the advantage of he own weight and look back watch the supreme effort of the mire broncho as he fight to climb out of the sand a moment it look as if the little roan would drag he out slowly he seem to be raise and move forward there be a sharp snap half-way down its length the lariat part at the weak spot the strain be too great captain jack plunge forward to he knee he nose root the earth and the ramblin ' kid barely save himself from pitch over the horse 's head that be what i be dreadin ' -- he say as he turn and ride back to the edge of the sand carolyn June gaze wide-eyed speechless with horror at the horse in the sand when the rope break old blue with a groan almost human sink back and quickly settle down until only he head and part of he neck be expose to view the ramblin ' kid look at the broken rope -- the end fasten around the throat of old blue have whip back and be lie far beyond the cowboy 's reach the piece half-hitched to the saddle horn be too short for another throw old blue be doom carolyn June see he sink gradually surely into the sand it seem age he eye appeal with dumb pathos to the group on the bank they could hear he breath come in harsh terrible gasp the sand seem to be deliberately torture he as though it be some hellish thing alive and of fiendish cunning that grasp its victim and then pause in he destruction to gloat over he hopeless agony the ramblin ' kid sit captain jack and watch why do god ever want to make that stuff anyhow spring hoarsely from he lip he be tear between blind unreasoning anger at the quicksand and pity for the struggle horse suddenly he jerk the forty-four always on he saddle from its holster as the gun swing back and then forward there be a crash report and old blue 's head drop with a convulsive shudder limp on the sand carolyn June scream and bury she face in she hand at the sound of the shot captain jack stiffen and stand rigid the ramblin ' kid he face white and draw sit and look dry-eyed at the red stream ooze from the round hole just below the brow-band of the bridle on the head of the horse he have kill i -- i -- would have want somebody to do it to I he say softly and ride to the side of the girl huddle on the ground he dismount and stand without speak look down at she shake form after a time she look up through eye drench with tear into he face then as if draw by a irresistible impulse -- one she could not deny -- she turn she head and look at the spot where old blue have fight he last battle with the quicksand of the cimarron a crimson stain already darken on the white surface a few square foot of disturbed and broken sand even now settle into the smooth innocent-looking tranquillity that hide the death lurk in its depths a short length of rope one end draw beneath the sand the other lie in a sprawling coil she hat rest a little distance to one side be all that remain to tell the story of the grim tragedy of the morning she shudder and look once more into the pain-filled eye of the ramblin ' kid we would better be goin ' he say quietly you be wet a ' they clothes must be uncomfortable you can ride captain jack she stand up weak and tremble i -- i -- think captain jack be a outlaw she say with a faint smile he will not let I ride he will he he 'll let you the ramblin ' kid answer dully no woman ever have ride he -- or any other man only I -- but he 'll let you as she approach the stallion he raise he head and look at she with a queer mixture of curiosity and antagonism curve he neck in a challenging way jack the ramblin ' kid speak sharply but kindly to the horse be careful it be all right boy -- you be goin ' to carry double this one time the broncho stand passive while the ramblin ' kid help carolyn June to he back you set behind he say it 'll be easier to hold on a ' i can handle th ' horse better she slip back of the saddle and he swing up on to the little roan with one hand carolyn June grasp the cantle of the saddle the other she reach up and lay on the arm of the ramblin ' kid -- the touch send a thrill through she body and the cowboy feel a response that make he heart quiver as they turn and ride toward the quarter circle kt for a mile neither speak i -- i -- be sorry for what -- i say this morning carolyn June whisper at last haltingly feel intuitively that the cruel word -- a ignorant savage stupid brute -- be repeat themselves in she companion 's mind it be all right he answer without look around and in a voice without emotion it be th ' truth -- with a hopeless laugh i be a damn ' fool besides chapter viii quick with a vengeance old heck ride in advance of charley and bert as the trio return from repair the fence wreck by the flood that have sweep over the east bottom-land of the quarter circle kt all morning he have be silent and morose only when necessary have he speak while he direct the cowboy at they labor help they reset post or untangle twisted wire and build up again that which the rush of water have tear down the damage have not be great and by noon the fence be as good as new as soon as the break be mend the moody owner of the quarter circle kt mount he horse and start for the house they woman come or something have get old heck 's goat bert remark to charley as they climb on they horse and follow a moment later something 's get it charley answer he be not act natural all day -- do you reckon he be sore because parker take the widow to town darned if i know bert say doubtfully that might be it well he be feverish and disagreeable for some reason or other and that be the way people generally get when they be jealous charley observe sagely he have not ought to be bert argue it be parker 's day to keep company with ophelium and old heck and he agree to split if he be in love he will not split charley retort with conviction i never see two man take turn about love the same woman yet it can not be do the woman would not object would she bert query probably not charley reply at least not as long as double dose of affection be come she way from what i have hear most of 'em sort of enjoy have as many man make love to 'em as possible but -- he pause but what they kick if a man love several woman at once be the sophisticated reply but as far as that be concerned he continue speak as a man wise in the way of the world man and woman be not much different in that respect when it come to loving both side be plumb willing to divide up ` a-going ' but want it to be clean exclusive when it come to ` come ' it be funny be not it bert comment no it be not funny charley declare it be just natural -- maybe parker and old heck will have a fight about ophelium bert suggest hopefully which do you suppose would lick it be hard tell charley say thoughtfully old heck 's the heaviest but parker 's pretty active well it sure do seem like wherever woman be trouble be do not it bert observe meditatively blame if it do not charley agree there be something about they that be plum agitating old heck ride a short distance ahead of the cowboy be trouble with similar thought he be try to analyze he own feeling year without association with womankind have make he come to regard they with a measure of indifference and suspicion he have develop the idea that woman exist chiefly for the purpose of disorganize the morale of the masculine member of the race he be very sincere in this belief yet he be force now to confess that he find something interesting in have a couple of attractive female at the quarter circle kt the situation be not so disagreeable as he have expect already he be proud of he kinship to carolyn June she be a niece worth while ophelium also have prove herself a pleasant surprise he have picture she as a strong-minded assertive modernized creature who would probably discourse continuously and raspingly about the evil of smoking profanity poker drinking and other natural masculine impulse instead she have prove herself so far a perfect lady without doubt she be the most sensible widow he have ever meet the thought of parker 's long intimate ride with she to eagle butte make he uncomfortable it be a darned fool arrangement -- that agreement that he and he foreman be to divide time in the entertainment of ophelium he could have do it alone just as well as not anyway the dual plan be liable to cause confusion oh well parker would be out on the beef hunt next week by rights it ought not start for ten day yet but -- well it would not hurt to move it up a little he would do that then he remember the frank admiration the cowboy have show toward carolyn June this suggest complication in that direction thunderation he say aloud it be a good thing we fix it up for just skinny to make love to she -- if we have not there would have be a regular epidemic of bu ` sted heart on this blame ranch there would not have be a buckaroo on the place that could have keep from moon around sentimental -- unless it be th ' ramblin ' kid he add that blame cuss be too independent and indifferent to fall in love with any female at the barn charley and bert overtake old heck the three unsaddled and feed they horse and start toward the house for dinner sing pete have see they come and immediately pound the triangle th ' ramblin ' kid 's go somewhere again bert observe as he notice the gold dust maverick alone in the circular corral captain jack 's not with the filly -- yonder th ' ramblin ' kid come now charley say look toward the north he be be over to the river -- what the devil kind of a combination be that he exclaim as he get a better view of the horse come up the lane he and that girl both be ride captain jack blame if they be not bert say curiously it be a wonder captain jack 'll let they but how do that come anyhow where 's skinny i think it be he job to ride herd on carolyn June -- it be he job old heck interrupted i do not understand -- something must have go wrong he add excitedly as the stallion with he double burden draw near carolyn June 's all wet and she be lose she hat turn he horse toward the house when he reach the end of the lane and with but a glance at the trio standing at the barn the ramblin ' kid ride straight to the back-yard gate old heck and the cowboy hurry across the open space and reach the gate just as carolyn June rather stiffly dismount from the little roan she hair be disarrange she ride suit soil and wet from the sand and water but she eye be bright cheek flush and she show only a trace of nervousness what be the matter old heck ask uneasily what be happen where 's skinny in a few word while the ramblin ' kid sit silently on the back of captain jack carolyn June tell of the ride across the river the meeting with pedro and the message he bring that the cattle be out and some have be kill by lightning of send skinny with the mexican to help with the steer of she return alone toward the ranch the struggle in the quicksand and the death of the horse she have be ride poor old blue -- poor old fellow she finish with a little catch in she voice old heck 's cheek whiten as he listen good lord he half-groan you have a close call it be lucky th ' ramblin ' kid see you come toward the upper ford -- if he have not -- you would never get out but go on into the house and get some dry clothes on boy we 'll have to hurry up and eat dinner and then go help get they steer back i wish parker be here -- we 'll need all the help we can get you would better catch up another horse he continue speak to the ramblin ' kid captain jack be probably wear out from chase that gold dust maverick last night and if you be not too tired yourself go with we -- i be not too tired the ramblin ' kid reply quietly i 'll go -- a ' ride captain jack -- he be not do up he take the broncho to the corral remove the saddle and turn he in with the outlaw mare after give the horse fresh hay -- there be water in the corral supply by a small ditch that be feed from the larger irrigation canal and which run under one side of the fence -- he join the other at dinner a hour later old heck bert charley and the ramblin ' kid ride away from the ranch to help chuck skinny and pedro round up and return to the big pasture the cattle that have break out and be rush toward they old range on the purgatory carolyn June be leave alone with sing pete the chinese cook at the quarter circle kt she still feel somewhat shake from she experience of the morning

mind it do not seem possible so much could have happen in so short a time only yesterday have ophelium and she arrive at the ranch already she have the feeling that they both be fixture and have be indefinitely at the quarter circle kt the elemental atmosphere of the range country have completely envelop she seem to have absorb she and make she a part of it some way she rather delight in this sensation of permanency she rescue by the ramblin ' kid and the close view she have be able to get of he impulse make she thrill with a queer mixture of admiration and pity for he even while he brutal answer when she have apologize for she harsh word still echo in she mind gracious she think with a whimsical smile thing move fast in this western country she have see already that both she uncle josiah and parker be yield to the charm of ophelium the fancy make she chuckle she remember skinny 's too rapidly develop tenderness toward herself poor fellow she murmur slowly shake she head i wish he would not but i suppose he can not help it -- i wonder why man be always fall in love with I anyhow i be sure i do not try to make they i never see one yet i really want to care -- she stop

dangerous in way that you do not understand she finish softly she eye light with a strange light and she heart elated and beat quickly because of what the chinese cook have tell she the outlaw filly leap to the far side of the corral and stand tremble she head up and breath come in whistle snort of defiance and fear as carolyn June open the gate and step boldly inside apparently pay no attention to the frightened horse the girl walk to the center of the corral and face the mare lean she back against the snub post both stand perfectly still while the eye of each appraise the other after a time the filly seem to relax and she slowly lower she head yet watch alertly the motionless figure of carolyn June the girl talk to the horse she word gentle she voice soothing and low the gold dust maverick become quieter still presently she circle the corral trot swiftly and crowd closely against the fence carolyn June turn keep she eye always on the broncho and continue the quiet plead of she voice it be a hour before the filly shyly and cautiously come up to the girl -- before curiosity master she fear carolyn June hold out she hand and the outlaw nose it timidly ready instantly to spring

a effort to hide the tell-tale confusion in he eye old heck furtively study the face of he foreman or else she confess to be a bolshevik or local-optionist or something and the news break he heart charley volunteer join in the baiting of the range-boss she do not neither confess parker deny hastily aggravate into a reply she be not either one of they she be a ` organizer -- ' dead silence greet this sudden announcement every eye be turn in astonishment on parker while old heck and the boy await further explanation parker offer no additional information she be a what old heck finally manage to whisper lean toward parker while a look of fear and incredulity spread over he face parker notice the anguish in old heck 's eye and a sudden new look of cunning come into he own a ` organizer ' i say he repeat impressively she be a ` organizer ' for some kind of ` movement ' or other -- a dis-organizer you would better say chuck laugh uncertainly judge from the way she be get you and old heck stampede already great gun old heck half groan what -- what sort of a -- a -- ` movement ' do she say it be anyhow swiss probably come in a chuckle undertone from the direction of the ramblin ' kid 's

-- it be just what i expect she be one of these self-starting female suffragette that be what she be i knowed she be too gentle act to be harmless she just have to break loose sooner or later bert say in a awed voice my gawd old heck murmur hopelessly holy gosh a ` mighty the owner of the quarter circle kt be really shocked and worried he have surrender quickly to he first impression concern the widow the original meeting at eagle butte when she and carolyn June appear as vision of feminine loveliness as contrast with the homely cook and she daughter whom he and skinny have mistake for and fear be the quarter circle kt 's prospective guest have cause a psychic effect on he feeling toward ophelium the sense of relief that come when he find that the cook be not ophelia together with the widow 's unexpected graciousness have instantly disarm he suspicion and metaphorically speak hurl he heart into she lap he have find the widow charming interesting very feminine and already dream have shape themselves in he mind the sudden revelation that parker have make bring tremendous disappointment ophelium have not show the least indication of obnoxious strong-mindedness or that disagreeable intellectuality which old heck firmly believe be a necessary attribute of all woman who participate in politics or movement ophelium be a organizer it be unbelievable the thought give he a sickening feeling at the pit of he stomach and actually make he head ache old heck 's first impulse when parker make the startling announcement be to assert he authority as boss of the outfit and annul the every-other-day arrangement whereby he and he foreman be to share and share alike in the widow 's society he would let parker do it all -- have she all of the time he would not take any chance on second thought he decide to wait at least another day besides it be against he principle contrary to the ethic of the range to back up on a bargain and he never ask a employee to do a thing he have not the courage to do himself he would stick it out come what may and see the thing through to a finish however there be still a means of escape if ophelium develop any really serious suffragette tendency during the next day or two he would go on the beef hunt himself and let parker remain at the ranch when finally he go to sleep ophelium be still on he mind the first thought that come to he when he awaken the next morning be the sickening news parker have bring old heck and the cowboy be silent and have about they a air of depression when they file into the kitchen for breakfast each cast furtive curious glance at ophelium the information that she be a organizer -- presumably for a movement involve woman 's political rights -- cause they to view she with a kind of reverential awe and fear the widow and carolyn June apparently be wholly unconscious of the thought in the mind of the man both woman be as innocent-looking and attractive as ever -- match with they early morning freshness the bowl of rose carolyn June before the call to breakfast have gather and place on the table the ramblin ' kid sit at the right of carolyn June it be the first time they have meet at the

and the warm blood to rush over she throat and face she have feel that same sensation of soul-nakedness she experience when she look into he eye that first time when she be at the circular corral and he be lie under the shed neither speak of the incident of the previous day the other cowboy and old heck study ophelium with a sort of fascination casting shy upward glance at she from over they plate parker and the ramblin ' kid only be at ease and undisturbed you would not think she be one by look at she would you chuck say in a undertone to charley some of they be so blame slick they can not hide it i reckon that be right chuck whisper back it be a awful jolt to old heck be not it yes he be take it pretty hard charley mumble she forehead do bulge out a good deal in front when you come to look at it do not it chuck observe under he breath quite a lot charley answer in the same tone that be one indication parker gaze at the widow with a expression undeniably adoring old heck see it and straighten up with a look of sudden resolution on he face if parker be not afraid of ophelium by golly he would not be the widow have return the foreman 's look with understanding while more than a trace of tenderness and sympathy be register in she eye to-morrow be Sunday old heck announce suddenly with startling distinctness and we 'll get thing in shape to begin the beef round-up on Monday there be immediate interest i 'll be darned the ramblin ' kid murmur half audibly old heck be goin ' to ` uriah ' parker huh skinny query across the table nothin ' the ramblin ' kid answer with a laugh i be just remind of somethin' i read in a book one time -- carolyn June catch the subtle reference to the bible story of king david 's unfortunate romance with another man 's woman and chuckle

the gold dust maverick bert question that be the one i mean the ramblin ' kid reply in a low voice for two mile -- or five -- there be not nothin ' in western texa or mexico either that can catch she why do not you take she in when the rodeo be on and run she in the sweepstakes then chuck ask eagerly i be not care what kiowa horse get the money just so that y-bar outfit be take down a notch or two ever since they get that thunderbolt horse and beat old heck 's quicksilver with he they have be crow over the quarter circle kt and i be get plumb sick of it -- old heck lose three thousand dollar on

coaxingly of the ramblin ' kid yes go on and put she in skinny urge -- you ought to the ramblin ' kid remain silent seemingly indifferent to the teasing of the other carolyn June lean over and say in a voice audible only to he while she eye grow mellow with a look that test he composure to the uttermost but which wring no sign from he : please race the maverick -- i -- want you to -- ramblin ' kid it be the first time she have use he name in speak directly to he and the tone in which it be speak make he tremble in spite of himself for a moment he return she gaze she word and manner be so

the can he start to make a cynical reply then he remember she sympathy for old blue she apology later for the harsh word -- anyhow he know or feel in he heart they be true -- and suddenly he seem to see the pink satin garter he still carry in he pocket the look that come into he eye make carolyn June lower she own he smile a whimsical but hopeless smile as reply apparently to the plead of charley and skinny he say softly the single word : maybe old heck have forget the annual rodeo hold in eagle butte for some day each summer around the fourth of July he sudden determination and eagerness to have the beef round-up begin earlier than usual in order to get parker away from the widow have drive all else but that one idea from he mind the protest remind he of he oversight he have not intend to deprive the cowboy of the opportunity to enjoy the one big event happen yearly in the kiowa country and which temporarily turn eagle butte for a few day each summer into a seething metropolis of care-free humanity i think it be a darned shame to spring the beef hunt so it will interfere with the rodeo bert grumble -- and we have to be out on the hill wrangle steer while the celebration be go on i be not-goin to be out on th ' hill then the ramblin ' kid say quietly but with unchangeable finality you can all go to the rodeo old heck interpose not feel just right in he conscience about send

impressively it be my turn -- i have make one and it be you and i have be ` frame ' be the answer speak solemnly yet scarcely louder than a whisper while the brown eye of carolyn June sparkle with a mixture of suppress anger merriment and indignation frame the widow repeat inquiringly just what do ` frame ' mean my dear frame means carolyn June reply wisely ` trick ' ` job ' ` jinx ' ` fix ' or

carefully guard listen : before ophelium cobb and carolyn June dixon ever arrive at this quarter circle kt they ` lover ' be already pick out for they -- officially choose delegated appoint

kt i can not believe it ophelium mutter as if stunned why that would be ` deal ' with we just as though we be cattle that be it carolyn June exclaim vindictively she anger for the moment get the better of she sense of the ridiculous they ` deal ' in we more than likely they play poker to decide how to divide we up -- to see who should love you and which should love I as if the heart of a woman can be make to run in a groove cut to order by the hand of any masculine -- insect she finish thoughtless of the incongruous metaphor then skinny and you uncle josiah the widow murmur and parker -- be -- be -- pretend no carolyn June answer they start out ` pretend ' but they have step into they own trap they be painfully serious now -- they be ` intend ' what shall we do about it ophelia ask helplessly we ought to assassinate they carolyn June snap then laugh as the absurdity of the situation dawn upon she and she sense of humor overcome the moment of anger and indignation i have it -- i have get it we will vamp ' they in dead earnest we 'll fix the ` fixer ' we 'll frame the ` framer ' but how doubtfully from now on carolyn June reply decisively i be go to flirt individually and collectively -- desperately and wickedly -- with the whole male population of this ranch we 'll show they what premeditate love-making really be when it come to uncle josiah and well possibly parker you will have to take care of that giddy pair yourself and incidentally you might work some on charley saunder mention the oldest of the cowboy i 'll just flicker a eyelid occasionally at parker unless you object not in the least ophelium answer blush a trifle well then we will make it a free-for-all carolyn June say and -- how about the ramblin ' kid the widow interrupt do you think he be one of the conspirator -- be in on the -- the -- ` frame-up ' be he also to be a ` victim ' carolyn June color the least bit pause a moment before she reply then say rather stiffly : he -- yes he be probably have more fun watch we be ` officially ' make love to than any other one of the entire bunch the ramblin ' kid will have to take he medicine along with the rest every man-thing on the quarter circle kt -- eliminate sing pete from that classification -- be my meat when do the slaughter begin ophelium laugh right now carolyn June answer war be declare -- she stop suddenly as a step sound on the porch and a moment later skinny enter the room he be painfully dress up the instant old heck and parker in the clagstone six start for eagle butte and the cowboy disappear down the lane in the direction of the big pasture skinny struggle into the white shirt he plan to try its effect on carolyn June while the other be away if it do not produce result he would slip back to the bunk-house before they return and change again to he normal dress when skinny step into the room he be fully conscious of he unusual appearance the morning be warm and he have not put on a coat the shirt billow over he shoulder arm and chest in a snowy cloud it seem impossible to skinny that anything in all the world could be so vividly persistently white as the cloth that literally envelop the upper half of he body it actually gleam the sleeve of the shirt be too long a pair of sky-blue rosette-fastened satin ribbon sleeve-holder above he elbow keep the cuff from slip over he hand parker have be unable to get the purple necktie and have bring instead one that be a solid shamrock green skinny swear when he see the tie but decide to wear it anyhow parker have explain by say he have forget the errand until he be start from town and then step into old leon 's -- a cheap general store in eagle butte -- and purchase the outfit from the jew that account also for the surplus length of sleeve -- the shirt be a size and a half larger than skinny have order and for which parker declare positively he have ask eternal hatred for all hebrew be bear in skinny 's heart the moment he see the layout but well it be there he be anxious to see if a white shirt would have any effect and he would wear it anyway skinny know instantly that he make a impression on carolyn June she look at he once and be speechless by gosh he say to himself chuck be right it sure do beat hell how clothes affect a woman carolyn June unquestionably be overcome the surprise have be too much for she he have knock she cold

moment that he would never again be without a white shirt ophelium also be visibly affect the widow give one look at skinny glance quickly at carolyn June then with she hand clasp tightly against she breast she lean weakly against the table and chew at she underlip she start to speak and stop well i -- i -- get back skinny say break the spell while he grin somewhat sheepishly and yet with a air of complete satisfaction i -- i -- see you -- do carolyn June choke hysterically i be go longer than i aim to be skinny continued rapidly gain confidence as he see the confusion of the woman after i get the chore do i conclude to fix up a little this be the first time i ever wear this shirt he go on feeling that a bit of explanation be entirely proper and would probably help in restore the composure of carolyn June and the widow parker just bring it out yesterday and it be a good deal of trouble to make the collar work right it seem like it be pretty stiff or something generally speak the whole outfit 's bigger than it really ought to be but maybe it 'll shrink up some when it be wash he finish in a casual matter-of-fact way it -- it -- be wonderful carolyn June stammer it be -- i do not think i ever see one that be -- be -- whiter -- it look that way to I skinny interrupted as if glad some one else have notice a peculiarity of the garment that already have trouble he somewhat i think it be uncommonly white perhaps it just seem that way because we be not use to it ophelium suggest sympathetically that be it carolyn June exclaim feverishly it be because we be not use to it -- it will be perfectly all right when we have look at it a little more skinny decide he would risk the gauntlet of comment from parker old heck and the cowboy and wear the shirt the rest of the day carolyn June be really sorry for skinny but -- she need air -- she feel she must have it please she cry suddenly and with a effort excuse I i -- i -- have something i wish to do you speak to skinny and ophelia stay here and visit each other a while without wait for a answer she step quickly into the kitchen ask sing pete for a handful of sugar and hurry out to the circular corral oh skinny skinny you be so funny she laugh aloud as she go through the back-yard gate it break my heart to break you heart -- but you be one of the ` fixer ' and you have get to be ` fix ' the gold dust maverick at first be shy when carolyn June open the gate and enter the corral after a few moment she recognize the girl and be soon eat the sugar from the hand of carolyn June before the supply be exhaust the friendship and confidence of the two begin yesterday be firmly reestablish the maverick allow carolyn June to swing she weight from the glossy withers to clasp she arm tightly about the trim clean-built neck and when after a hour the girl start toward the house the outlaw mare protest so eagerly against be leave alone that she turn back to the corral and lean against the fence stroke the soft muzzle thrust between the bar carolyn June be coo endearing term to the filly and play with the quiver underlip when she hear a horse gallop swiftly up the lane and past the barn instinctively she step back and turn just as the ramblin ' kid ride captain jack wheel around the end of the shed near the corral he sudden appearance surprise she she have think he be with the cowboy over at the upland pasture help skin the steer kill by the lightning when they leave the ranch the ramblin ' kid have ride away with charley and the other but not with any intention of go to the big pasture where the road turn toward the lower ford he hold captain jack to the left be not you go with we charley saunder ask and help skin they steer no the ramblin ' kid reply quietly i be not i have get something else to do anyhow i be not a butcher -- i work with live cattle not dead one he conclude as captain jack continue in the direction of the upper cross he be the independentest darn ' cuss i ever see charley remark to he companion as the ramblin ' kid disappear it be a wonder old heck do not fire he he can not bert laugh th ' ramblin ' kid do not stay at the quarter circle kt by the grace of old heck but by the choice of th ' ramblin ' kid anyhow he be too good with horse -- he voice trail away to a low mutter as they turn in among the willow and cottonwood tree along the bank of the cimarron at the upper cross on almost the same spot where he have lift carolyn June from the quicksand to the solid ground of the meadow land the ramblin ' kid stop captain jack he look out over the placid unbroken surface of the sand-bar and see the end of the broken rope coil loosely where old blue have be draw under a few yard away the white feel hat carolyn June have toss to one side to be a mute and pathetic messenger of she fate when she think death be certain still rest on the smooth surface of the sand it be to get the hat the ramblin ' kid have come again to the scene of yesterday 's tragedy he have see it lie there when carolyn June and he ride away on captain jack and think then of try to get it but the part of the broken rope attach to he saddle be too short to reach it and it be impossible to secure it in any other way chuck have return the ramblin ' kid 's rope to he yesterday when they be after the runaway steer and it be now on he saddle he lightly toss the noose so that it fall circle the object he seek gently flick the rope toward he he tighten the loop about the crown of the hat and draw it to the edge of the quicksand he pick up the hat look curiously at it remount captain jack pause a moment and gaze at the treacherous surface beneath which the body of old blue be hide and with a savagely mutter something about th ' damned stuff whirl the little stallion and ride rapidly in the direction from which he come as captain jack gallop along the lane the ramblin ' kid look at the hat curiously turn it first one way and then the other with a laugh he reach into he pocket and draw out the pink satin garter a expression of tenderness follow by a look of deep humility that quickly change into savage anger come into he eye as he look first at the hat soil and dirty and then at the dainty bit of elastic he hold in he hand a swell pair of souvenir he say bitterly for a ` ign ` rant savage stupid brute ' of a cow-puncher to be packin ' around before reach the barn the ramblin ' kid drop the garter again into he pocket round the end of the shed he ride captain jack directly up to carolyn June dismount he leave the little roan standing not trouble to drop the rein over the broncho 's head step toward the girl and extend the hat say simply and without emotion here 's you hat there be no embarrassment now or humility in he eye as he look steadily at carolyn June he expression be as cold as if the one to whom he speak be a utter stranger i -- carolyn June hesitate oh i thank you it be kind of you to think about it and ride back -- back -- there she involuntarily shudder when she think of the upper cross and get it the simple unexpected thoughtfulness of the deed touch she it be the natural instinctive act of a gentleman she have forget the hat he have not as she look at he she feel that someway she might have know such a thing be exactly what he would do you be welcome he say quietly start to turn away a spirit of mischief suddenly flare up in she heart she think of the pink elastic she have lose and which she believe he be carry now in he pocket be the hat all -- do not you -- she intend to say find something else but quickly

hay-powder or other dust from its nostril come from the direction of the circular corral the ramblin ' kid stop in he walk and turn go thoughtfully through the darkness toward where captain jack and the gold dust maverick be quietly feed he lean against the bar of the corral and look at the shadowy form of the two horse stand a little distance away captain jack quit eating and come to the fence god little horse -- the ramblin ' kid speak tensely and without repression -- why can not human be as decent a ' honest as you the black dome of night be stud with innumerable star that gleam like point of silver sprinkle over a canopy of somber velvet some infinite hand have fling in a great arch from rim to rim of a sleep world the call of a night bird shrill softly from the cottonwood tree along the cimarron a hint of a breeze swing idly from the west and rustle the leaf in the top of the poplar in front of the house faintly as a distant echo come the wail strain of a waltz drift out from the light window and the open door of the room where carolyn June and ophelia in a spirit of sport and for revenge juggle the heart of man afraid of nothing in all the world but the look in a woman 's eye the music tortured the soul of the ramblin ' kid it breathe the unfathomable strife of life -- of love longing hope despair -- almost yet subtly elusively would not tell the eternal why of all thing not heed time he stand and listen the crunch sound make by the gold dust maverick munch at the pile of hay on the ground in the corral blended with and seem a queer accompaniment to the melody that come from the scene of revelry up at the house the orange disk of a late-rising moon show above the rim of the sand-hill at the lower end of the valley the ramblin ' kid watch it -- until it grow into a round plate of burnish glisten silver the gold dust maverick be suddenly flood with a glare of light as the moonbeam pour over the top of the shed and stream through the bar of the circular corral the filly lift she head a impulse to ride -- ride -- ride to get away from it all -- far out on the wide unpeopled plain where there be nothing above but god and the unmeasured depths of he heaven and nothing beneath but the earth and the rhythmic beat of he horse 's foot come over the ramblin ' kid man and the work of man -- they passion they strife they foolishness -- and woman -- woman who play with love -- he want to forget to leave mile and mile behind he start to open the gate think to saddle captain jack and obey the impulse of the moment carolyn June 's word speak of the gold dust maverick : it would be fun to see she run and utter lightly and in a spirit of coquetry that morning when she tease he to enter the outlaw filly in the race against the thunderbolt horse from the vermejo come to he mind the selfishness of the plea madden he she care nothing for the price in effort -- the strain muscle the panting breath -- the agony the beautiful mare must pay to defeat the black wonder from the other part of the range she want only to see the maverick run -- to coax he to yield and run the filly merely to please the cheap vanity of she sex no doubt also she count on entertainment when to-morrow he would ride the outlaw for the first time it would be a kind of show -- the battle for mastery between himself and the high-bred untame mare the whole bunch -- old heck parker ophelium carolyn June the cowboy -- yes even that damned chink -- unquestionably would be crowd about the corral to watch the fear and pain of the maverick as she learn she first hard lesson of servitude to man they would laugh at she frenzied effort to throw he he would fool they he would ride the filly to-night he go to the shed slip he leg into the worn leather chap take saddle bridle blanket and rope and return to the corral step inside he close the gate behind he captain jack come to he and nose at he shoulder no little man the ramblin ' kid say gently this be not you turn you can go with we though if you want to he laugh the gold dust maverick stand half-afraid at the other side of the corral she have not yet wholly conquer she dread of he she do not however offer to fight as she have do that morning when skinny enter the enclosure the ramblin ' kid speak to the filly and as she begin to move shyly away with one toss throw the loop over she head the instant the mare feel the rope she stop and stand tremble a moment then come straight up to he she be rope-wise the experience at the north spring the night he catch she and when she have three separate time be cruelly throw by this same rope have teach the gold dust maverick the power that lay in those pliant strand she flinch from the touch of the blanket the ramblin ' kid work easily carefully but in absolute confidence with she as he cautiously saddle the mare he talk in a low drawling monotone utter endearing phrase and occasionally slip a lump of sugar -- a supply of which he have get that night from the kitchen -- into she mouth she eat it ravenously darn little one he laugh you sure have get a sweet tooth -- you gobble that sugar like a indian squaw eatin ' choc ` late candy at last the mare be saddle still hold to the rope the ramblin ' kid without try to get the filly to follow move over and open the gate give it a push and swing it wide during the performance the gold dust maverick stand perfectly still save for a constant chew at the iron bit between she tooth the ramblin ' kid go quietly up to she coil the slack of the rope as he advance without bother to tighten the rein but watch closely the look in the maverick 's big brown eye and the nervous twitch of she ear he lay one hand on the withers of the outlaw with the other he grasp the horn of the saddle and slip he foot in the stirrup swing quickly and lightly on to she back for the space of a deep breath the maverick crouch grow tense in every muscle slowly arch she back gather herself together for a great effort a quiet smile curl the lip of the ramblin ' kid as he look down on the curving neck of the beautiful creature with a tremendous leap the gold dust maverick spring high into the air lunging forward while all she hoof be off the ground she forefoot come down across the back of captain jack -- she have all but clear the little roan the shock almost throw the stallion to the ground as he surge from under she the filly slide and sprawl on she shoulder and side instantly she be on she foot the ramblin ' kid still in the saddle he spur have not touch the mare -- instead he have be careful not to let they steel point so much as ruffle the golden-chestnut hair of she belly or flank only when the outlaw fall have he throw forward he right leg and hook the sharp rowel into the strong fiber of the forward cinch with the left hand he loosely hold the rein give the maverick she head -- the other hand he brush with a caress upward movement along she glossy neck twice the gold dust maverick circle the corral plunge buck side-winding desperately -- she nose between she knee squeal pitifully -- as she try vainly to rid herself of the weight of the ramblin ' kid go to it baby girl go to it he chuckle you have get to learn sooner or later you 'll find out it can not be do he ride limply loosely low in the saddle and while he make no effort to urge the filly into greater frenzy he do not try in any way to prevent she buck she hardest in the futile attempt to hurl he off she back the second time the outlaw mare come to the gate she whirl and dash through the open out of the corral across the open space past the corner of the front-yard fence and along the road that lead up to the bench and toward eagle butte captain jack trot around the corral once then follow at

of the bench and in the silence that follow the group on the porch hear only the distant thudding of hoof beat a ever fainter tattoo through the calm moonlit night carolyn June go back into the house with conflict emotion surge through she heart she believe she know why the ramblin ' kid have elect to ride the outlaw filly to-night but she thought she keep to herself for a hour longer the dance continue but not with the spirit of earlier in the evening the interruption take something of the eagerness to punish old heck parker and the cowboy out of the heart of carolyn June a bit of doubt that the role she and ophelium be play be worthy of true womanhood creep into she mind when the widow and carolyn June be alone ophelia laugh whew she exclaim that be a strenuous party i have dance

chuck bert charley and pedro be nervously happy in the heart of each be a thrill cause by the memory of some secret -- or what he think be a secret -- manifestation of carolyn June 's interest perhaps it be no more than the brushing of a stray whiff of odorous brown hair against a weather-tanned cheek the pulse of a warm breath on the side of a muscular neck a melting look from a pair of luminous eye some low-spoken word or the pressure of a hand but whatever it be each of the cowboy be reasonably certain he have be single out for special favor charley be doubly bless in addition to carolyn June 's seductive advance he have the memory also of ophelium 's attention he mind be awhirl with the effort to figure out which one by rights he ought to consider as a permanent possibility old heck

impulse be to call out and warn she to keep away from the horse -- that both be dangerous for man to fool with much less be it safe for a woman to undertake familiarity with they he next thought be that he sudden appearance would only startle the girl and -- well cause a lot of useless talk he remain quiet a low trill come from the throat of carolyn June the two horse stop feed and look around toward the gate the bird-like call be repeat the ramblin ' kid be astonish to see captain jack and the outlaw mare move eagerly in the direction from whence the sound have come he hear carolyn June talk to the broncho in soft endearing tone after a moment she open the gate and step inside the corral well i 'll be -- he breathe inaudibly for half a hour carolyn June pet the little stallion and the gold dust maverick both animal seem hungry for she caress oh you darling -- you wonder the ramblin ' kid hear carolyn June say as she give the maverick 's head a tight squeeze just before run

woman-thing and hate I with all he queer lonesome heart well i 'll be damned the ramblin ' kid exclaim when she be go he raise himself on one elbow and lay thus for a long time silently think at last he get up go to the corral gate and he himself step inside with the horse he give captain jack 's ear a loving twitch then turn to the gold dust maverick she permit he without protest to fondle she head and neck he hand linger long on the silky mane in which a little while before carolyn June have twine she finger oh queen of th ' range he say with a low laugh unconsciously use the poetical phrase as he give the warm cheek of the filly a tender parting pinch before turn away to go to the bunk-house we 'll whip that devil-horse of th ' vermejo -- we 'll show that thunderbolt runner what

between the y-bar and the quarter circle kt be well know to all and sabota himself have clean up a neat sum when the black horse from the vermejo have outstepp the runner from the quarter circle kt old heck redden at dorsey 's word but reply quietly : the cimarron be middling -- just middlin ' no we be not be pay much attention to teaching horse how to run lately old quicksilver 's pretty fair of course he be not the best horse in the world but he 'll do for cow and general knock around horse be a good deal like man you know dorsey -- there be always one that be a little bit better the vermejo cow-man color at the thrust any of you quarter circle kt feller go in on anything at the rodeo this year one of the y-bar rider ask skinny before dorsey could reply charley say he might go in on the ` bull-dogging ' and bert be figure some on the buck event -- but i do not reckon they 'll either one enter skinny carelessly both of they get first money in they entry last year and they be

be not aim to and i do not know what th ' ramblin kid be figure on he be not much for show off he only ride in the buck contest last year because after that cyclone horse kill dick stanley everybody say there be not any one that could ride he and the blame little fool just want to demonstrate that there be you never can tell what he 'll do though he may be intend to go in on something or other guess you people be not get anything out there for the two-mile sweepstakes this year have you dorsey break in with a sneer old thunderbolt 's too much for they sand-hill jumper from the cimarron oh i do not know as he be old heck say in a voice emotionless as a indian 's the quarter circle kt will probably be represent in the big event it seem to I i hear chuck mention enter that silver tip colt of he and let 's see i believe th ' ramblin ' kid say something about run a new filly he be be ride some do not he skinny since i come to think of it i believe he do skinny answer as if it be a matter without especial interest if i remember right he do speak something of it a day or two ago well bring 'em on dorsey exclaim boastfully the y-bar will take all the money you kiowa feller feel like contribute old thunderbolt 's as fit as a new rawhide rope and be just ache to rake in another three or four thousand of quarter circle kt _ dinero _ if you people have get the nerve to back you judgment there be a dead hush as the crowd in the pool-room wait for old heck 's reply to dorsey 's drunken challenge we 'll kind of remember that invitation dorsey old heck say in tone as hard and smooth and cold as ice while he gray eye narrow and bore the boastful cow-man like point of steel we 'll sort of bear in mind that suggestion of yours the quarter circle kt will send a horse into the big race that will beat that thunderbolt critter of yours just three time as bad as he set old quicksilver back -- and we 'll give you action on any amount of money cattle or anything else you want to name you can put you friend here in on it too if you want to -- with a scornful glance around the pool-room at the loafer in the place come on skinny he add as he start toward the door more than likely ophelium and carolyn June be through with they trading and ready to go home all stand silent until skinny and old heck step out of the door then mike sabota break into a coarse taunt laugh as they turn up the street old heck and skinny hear dorsey and the crowd inside join in the merriment damn that fool dorsey old heck exclaim viciously as he hear the shout of derisive laughter i be go to wipe he out on that race -- if he be get the gut to come across and back up that thunderbolt horse as hard as he blow about he i think i 'll hook sabota for a few hundred on the sweepstakes myself skinny reply with a good deal of feeling i do not like the way that dirty cuss act any better than i like dorsey 's brag carolyn June and ophelia be wait when old heck and skinny arrive at the golden rule when the clagstone six whirl past the amusement parlor a few moment later dorsey and sabota be stand in the door carolyn June glance at they heaven she say as she eye rest a instant on the burly low-browed greek proprietor of the place what a big brute of a look fellow that be the two man stare insolently at the occupant of the car and as it pass sabota make some remark evidently vulgar that cause dorsey to burst into another round of coarse laughter old heck be moody during the drive home for nearly two year dorsey have be crow because of the defeat of quicksilver by the black racer from the vermejo it be become more than idle jest it look as if for some reason he be try to torment old heck until something serious be start old heck be a good loser but he be grow tired of the persistent nagging he have not whimper at the loss of the twenty-five hundred dollar dorsey win from he on the race even the humiliation of see he best horse put in second place by the y-bar animal have be endure philosophically and without malice because he believe the thing have be run square and the faster horse have win but dorsey on every occasion since have drunk or sober boast of thunderbolt 's victory and take a devilish delight in rub it in on the owner of the quarter circle kt to-day the vermejo cattleman have be worse than usual due no doubt to the rotten boot-leg whisky the brute-like proprietor of eagle butte 's rather disreputable amusement parlor be suppose secretly to dispense to those who have the price and the honor to keep sacred the source of supply old heck be sore and he be ready to go the limit in back the gold dust maverick both he and skinny have purposely refrain from mention the horse the ramblin ' kid would enter the fame of the outlaw filly extend throughout all of southwestern texa and if the vermejo crowd have learn that the ramblin ' kid have finally catch she and be intend to put she against thunderbolt it be doubtful if the black horse would be enter at all in the sweepstakes even if he be dorsey and he crowd would be shy of the bet this be one reason old heck have so play the conversation that dorsey definitely throw down the challenge and which be so coldly accept the vermejo cow-man would have to come in heavy on the bet or be place in the role of a bluffer by the time they reach the ranch old heck 's good humor be restore he thoroughly enjoy the supper skinny and carolyn June prepared and joke the girl about she coffee-jelly she be learn how to make french toast now skinny say proudly it will not be long till she be a darned good cook why not carolyn June laugh see who i have to teach I and skinny flush while he heart hammer joyously well i reckon anybody could live on fried bread and coffee-jelly in a pinch old heck joke back but for my part i would be a good deal happier to mix a biscuit or two like ophelium make once in a while in with it -- give the widow a worshipful look it be ophelia 's turn to register pleasurable confusion after supper old heck and the widow wash the dish when they be finish ophelia go into the front room old heck take a glass of water step out of the kitchen door and diligently scrub he tooth while he be still at it skinny come out with a dipper in he hand and sheepishly draw a tooth-brush from he hip pocket faithfully imitate the action of the other i figure a man 's take a lot of chance if he do not keep he tooth clean and everything skinny splutter as the water splash down he chin yes that be right old heck agree there be germ and so on in they as he flip the water from he own brush dry he lip on he shirtsleeve and turn back into the kitchen the next morning Saturday old heck come to the breakfast table again in a pensive mood i be think about that man dorsey skinny remark observe old heck 's mental depression and attribute it to the meeting the day before in the pool-room at eagle butte do you reckon the filly can really beat that thunderbolt horse of course she can old heck answer th ' ramblin ' kid know all i be afraid be that when dorsey find out it be the gold dust maverick thunderbolt have get to go up against he will not bet much on it the boy ought to be in to-day skinny say abruptly switch the subject they figure on get the battle ridge cattle gather and in the big pasture by to-night do not they yes old heck reply that be what be in my mind parker will be -- he stop suddenly but in again he have start to say but catch himself and finish lamely -- probably pretty anxious to hurry through as soon as possible and get the beef animal in the upland pasture how be you go to work thing when he get back skinny ask with a significant look at old heck blame if i know -- old heck say uncertainly stop before he finish the sentence he understand what skinny mean and just that have be worry he he have reach the point where he could not endure the thought of go back to the old arrangement of day and day about with parker in the enjoyment of the widow 's society yet if parker on he return insist on divide ophelium 's time with he in conformity with they original agreement old heck know he would have to yield he think for a moment he would get the widow away from skinny and carolyn June after breakfast and make a full confession of the whole thing ask she to marry he and have it do with but he have not yet be able to get at the bottom of ophelium 's suffragette activity what if she marry he and then suddenly break loose as a speech-maker or something for woman 's rights it would not pay to take the risk it sure do keep a man guess he murmur under he breath the sweat start to bead he forehead from the mental effort to solve the problem before he carolyn June and ophelia exchange sly wink as they guess the thing that be in old heck 's mind skinny himself be a bit worried as the time draw near for the return of the cowboy he hope carolyn June would not spring another dance or similar opportunity for indiscriminate love-making nor have carolyn June forget that to-day be Saturday and parker and the cowboy be expect back from the first half of the beef round-up the week have be pleasant enough but she have miss the ramblin ' kid and the gold dust maverick more than she care to confess she wonder if the outlaw filly would remember she Saturday be a day of considerable tension for all at the
