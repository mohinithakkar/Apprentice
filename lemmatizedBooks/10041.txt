pendomer divorce case and colonel rudolph musgrave have very narrowly escape be name as the co-respondent this much at least all lichfield know when george pendomer -- evince unsuspected fund of generosity -- permit he wife to secure a divorce on the euphemistic grounds of desertion john charteri act as rudolph musgrave 's friend have patch up this arrangement and the colonel and mr pendomer so rumor run be to be marry very quietly after a decent interval remain only to deliberate whether this sop to the convention should be accept as sufficient at least as mr ashmeade sagely observe we can combine vituperation with common-sense and remember it be not the first time a musgrave have figure in a entanglement of the sort a lecherous race proverbial flutterer of petticoat he surname convict the man unheard and almost excuse he all of we feel that and moreover it be not as if the idiot have commit any unpardonable sin for they have keep out of the newspaper she friend seem dubious and hazard something concern the merest sense of decency in the name of the prophet fig people -- i mean the people who count in lichfield -- be charitable enough to ignore almost any crime which be just a matter of common knowledge in fact they be mildly grateful it give they something to talk about but when detraction be print in the morning paper you can not overlook it without incur the suspicion of be illiterate and virtueless that be lichfield but polly -- sophist do not i know my lichfield i know it almost as well as i know rudolph musgrave and so i prophesy that he will not marry clarice pendomer because he be inevitably tire of she by this he will marry money just as all the musgrave do moreover i prophesy that we will gabble about this mess until we find a newer target for we stone throw and be just as friendly with the participant to they face as we ever be so do not let I hear any idiotic talk about whether or no _ i _ be go to receive she -- well after all she be bear a bellingham we must remember that be not i say i know my lichfield mr ashmeade placidly observe \* \* \* \* \* and time indeed attest she to be right in every particular yet it must be record that at this critical juncture chance rather remarkably favor colonel musgrave and mr pendomer by give lichfield something of greater interest to talk about since now just in the nick of occasion occur the notorious scott musgrave murder scott musgrave -- a fourth cousin once remove of the colonel 's to be quite accurate -- have in the preceding year seduce the daughter of a village doctor a negligible half-strainer up country at warren and she two brother be irritated pick this particular season to waylay he in the street as he reel homeward one night from the commodore ' club and forthwith to abolish scott musgrave after the primitive method of they lower station in society these detail indeed be never officially make public since a discreet police force find no clue for fred musgrave -lrb- of king 's garden -rrb- as befitted the dead man 's well-to-do brother have be at no little pain to insure constabulary shortsightedness in preference to have the nature of scott musgrave 's recreation unsympathetically air fred musgrave thereby afford lichfield a delectable opportunity -lrb- conversationally and abet by innumerable they _ do _ say 's -rrb- to accredit the murder turn by turn to every able-bodied person reside within stone 's throw of its commission so that few have time now to talk of rudolph musgrave and clarice pendomer for it be not in lichfieldian human nature to discuss a mere domestic imbroglio when here also in the musgrave family be a picturesque and gory assassination to lay tongue to so colonel musgrave be duly reëlected that spring to the librarianship of the lichfield historical association and the name of mr george pendomer be not stricken from the list of patroness of the lichfield german club but be merely alter to mr clarice pendomer \* \* \* \* \* at the bottom of he heart colonel musgrave be a trifle irritated that he self-sacrifice should be thus unrewarded by martyrdom circumstance have enable he to assume and he have gladly accept the blame for john charteri 's iniquity rather than let anne charteri know the truth about she husband and clarice pendomer the truth would have kill anne the colonel believe and besides the colonel have enjoy the performance of a picturesque action and have act as a hero in permit himself to be pillory as a libertine it be preferable of course not to have incur ostracism thereby he common-sense concede this and yet to colonel musgrave it could not but be evident that destiny be hardly rise to the possibility of the situation ii concern colonel musgrave one find the ensue account

marquis would mean in england handsome and trim and affable he defy chronology by look ten year younger than he be know to be for at least a decade he have be invaluable to lichfield matron alike against the entertainment of a out-of-town girl the management of a cotillion and the prevention of unpleasant pause among incongruous dinner company in short he be by all account the social triumph of he generation and he military title win by four year of arduous service at reception and parade while on the staff of a former governor of the state this seasoned bachelor carry off with plausibility and distinction the story find he librarian and corresponding secretary of the lichfield historical association which office he have hold for some six year the salary be small and the colonel have inherit little but he sister miss agatha musgrave who live with he be a notable housekeeper he increase he resource in a gentlemanly fashion by genealogical research direct mostly toward the rehabilitation of ambiguous pedigree and for the rest no other man could have fulfil more gracefully the main duty of the librarian which be to exhibit the association 's collection of relic to hurry tourist do lichfield he library manner be model upon that which a eighteenth century portrait would conceivably possess should witchcraft set the canvas breathe iii also the story find colonel musgrave in the company of he sister on a warm April day whilst these two sit upon the porch of the musgrave home in lichfield and colonel musgrave wait until it should be time to open the library for the afternoon and about they bird twitter cheerily and the formal garden flourish as garden thrive nowhere except in lichfield and overhead the sky be a turkis-blue save for a few irrelevant cloud which dapple it here and there like splash of whip cream yet for all this the colonel be ill-at-ease and care be on he brow and venom in he speech and one thing colonel musgrave conclude with decision i wish distinctly understand and that be if she insist on have young man loaf about she -- as of course she will -- she will have to entertain they in the garden i will not have they in the house agatha you remember that langham girl you have here last easter he add disconsolately -- the one who positively litter up the house with young man and sing idiotic jingle to they at all hour of the night about the bailey family and the correct way to spell chicken she drive I to the verge of insanity and i have not a doubt that this patricium person will be quite as obstreperous so please mention it to she agatha -- casually of course -- that in lichfield when one be partial to either vocal exercise or amorous daliance the proper scene of action be the garden i really can not be annoy by she but rudolph he sister protest you forget she be engage to the earl of pevensey a engage girl naturally would not care about meet any young man h be say the colonel drily ensue a pause during which the colonel light yet another cigarette then i have frequently observe he speak in absent wise that all young woman have that peculiarly vacuous expression about the eye -- i believe there be misguided person who describe such eye as be ` dreamy ' -- be invariably possess of a fickle unstable and coquettish temperament oh no you may depend upon it agatha the fact that she contemplate purchase the right to support a peculiarly disreputable member of the british peerage will not hinder she in the least from make advance to all the young man in the neighborhood miss musgrave be somewhat ruffle she be a homely little woman with nothing of the ordinary musgrave comeliness candor even compel the statement that in she pudgy swarthy face there be a droll suggestion of the pug-dog i be sure miss musgrave remonstrate with placid dignity that you know nothing whatever about she and that the report about the earl have probably be greatly exaggerate and that she picture show she to be a unusually attractive girl though it be true miss musgrave concede after reflection that there be any number of person in the house of lord that i would not in the least care to have in my own house even with the front parlor all in linen as it unfortunately be so awkward when you have company and the bible do bid we not to put we trust in prince and for my part i never think that photograph could be trust either scorn not the nobly bear agatha she brother admonish she nor treat with lofty scorn the well-connected the very best people be sometimes respectable and yet he pursue with a slight hiatus of thought i should not describe she as precisely a attractive-looking girl she seem to have a lot of hair -- if it be all she own which it probably be not -- and she nose be apparently straight enough and i gather she be not absolutely deform anywhere but that be all i can conscientiously say in she favor she be artificial she hair now it have a -- well you would not call it exactly a crinkle or precisely a wave but rather somewhere between the two yes i think i should describe it as a ripple i fancy it must be rather like the reflection of a sunset in -- a duck-pond say with a faint wind ruffle the water for i gather that she hair be of some light shade -- induce i have not a doubt by the liberal use of peroxide and this ripple too agatha it stand to reason must be the result of coerce nature for i have never see it in any other woman 's hair moreover colonel musgrave continue warm somewhat to he subject there be a dimple -- on the right side of she mouth immediately above it -- which speak of the most frivolous tendency i dare say it come and go when she talk -- wink at you so to speak in a manner that must be simply idiotic that foolish little cleft in she chin too -- but at this point he sister interrupt he i have not a notion say she that you have even look at the photograph and you seem to have it quite by heart rudolph -- and some people admire dimple you know and at any rate she mother have red hair so patricium be not really responsible i decide that it would be foolish to use the best mat to-night we can save they for Sunday supper because i be only go to have egg and a little cold meat and not make company of she for no apparent reason rudolph musgrave flush i inspect it -- quite casually -- last night please do not be absurd agatha if we be threaten with any other direful visitation -- influenza say or the seventeen-year locust -- i should naturally read up on the subject in order to know what to expect and since providence have see fit to send we a visitor rather than a visitation -- though personally i should infinitely prefer the influenza as interfere in less degree with my comfort -- i have of course neglect no opportunity of find out what we may reasonably look forward to i fear the worst agatha for i repeat the girl 's face be to I absolutely unattractive the colonel speak with emphasis and fling away he cigarette and take up he hat to go and then i suppose say miss musgrave absently you will be fall in love with she just as you do with anne charteri and aline van orden and all those other minx i _ would _ like to see you marry rudolph only i could not stand you have a wife i i sputter the colonel i think you must be out of you head i fall in love with that chit good lord agatha you be positively idiotic and the colonel turn on he heel and walk stiffly through the garden but when half-way down the path he wheel about and come back i beg you pardon agatha he say contritely it be not my intention to be discourteous but somehow -- somehow dear i do not quite see the necessity for my fall in love with anybody so long as i have you and miss musgrave you may be sure forgive he promptly and afterward -- with a bit of pride and a infinity of love in she kind homely face -- she eye follow he out of the garden on he way to open the library and she decide in she heart that she have the dearest and best and handsomest brother in the universe and that she must remember to tell he accidentally how become he new hat be and then at some unspoken thought she smile wistfully she would be a very lucky girl if he do say miss musgrave apropo of nothing in particular and toss she grizzly head a earl indeed say miss musgrave iv and this be how it come about : patricium vartrey -lrb- a second cousin once remove of colonel rudolph musgrave 's -rrb- as the older inhabitant of lichfield will volubly attest be always a person who do peculiar thing the list of she eccentricity be far too lengthy here to be enumerate but she begin it by be bear with red hair -- titian red and auburn be undiscovered euphemism in those day -- and in lichfield this be not regard as precisely a lady-like thing to do and she end it as far as lichfield be concern by elope with what lichfield in its horror could only describe with conscious inadequacy as a quite unheard-of person indisputably the man be well-to-do already and from this nightmarish topsy-turvidom of reconstruction the fellow visibly be pluck wealth also young stapylton be well enough to look at too as lichfield flurriedly concede but it be equally undeniable that he have make he money through a series of commercial speculation distinguish both by shiftiness and daring and that the man himself have be until the war a wholly negligible poor white person -- a overseer indeed for wild will musgrave colonel musgrave 's father who be of course the same lieutenant-colonel william sebastian musgrave csa that meet he death at gettysburg this upstart marry patricium vartrey for all the chatter and whispering and carry she away from lichfield as yet a little dubious as to what recognition if any should be accord the existence of the stapylton and afterward -lrb- from a notoriously untruthful north indeed -rrb- come rumor that he be rapidly become wealthy and of patricium vartrey 's death at she daughter 's birth and of the infant 's health and strength and beauty and of she lavish upbringing -- a frenchwoman lichfield whisper with absolutely nothing to do but attend upon the child and then little by little a new generation spring up and little by little the interest these rumor wake become more lax and it be bring about at last by the insidious transition of time that patricium vartrey be forget in lichfield only a few among the older man remember she some of they yet treasured as these fogy so often do a stray fan or a odd glove and in bycorner of sundry time-toughened heart there lurk the memory of a laughing word or of a glance or of some such casual bounty that patricium vartrey have accord these heart ' owner when the world be young but agatha musgrave likewise remember the orphan cousin who have be rear with she she have love patricium vartrey and in due time she write to patricium 's daughter -- in stately antiquated phrase that astonish the recipient not a little -- and the girl have answer the correspondence flourish and it be not long before miss musgrave have induce she young cousin to visit lichfield colonel rudolph musgrave be it understand know nothing of all this until the girl be actually on she way and now she be to arrive that afternoon to domicile herself in he quiet house for two long week -- this utter stranger look you -- and upset he comfort ask he silly question expect he to talk to she and at the end of she visit possibly present he with some outlandish gimcrack make of cardboard and pink ribbon in which she would expect he to keep he papers the langham girl do that \* \* \* \* \* it be honesty 's part to give you the man no better than he be lichfield at large have pampered he many woman have love he and above all miss agatha have spoil he after fifteen year of be the pivot about which the economy of a household revolve after fifteen year of be the inevitable person whose approval must be secure before any domestic alteration however trivial may be consider no mortal man may hope to remain a paragon of unselfishness colonel musgrave joy in the society of woman but he class they -- say with the croquette adorn with pink paper frill which be then invariably serve at the supper of the lichfield german club -- as acceptable enough upon a conscious holiday but wholly incongruous with the slippered ease of home when you have a inclination for feminine society you shave and change you clothes and think up a impromptu or so against emergency and go forth to seek it that be natural but to have a petticoated young person infest you house hourly be as preposterous as ice-cream soda at breakfast the metaphor set he off at a tangent he wonder if this patricium person could not -lrb- tactfully -rrb- be induce to take she bath after breakfast as agatha do after he have he why confound the girl he be not responsible for there be only one bathroom in the house it be necessary for he to have he bath and be at the library by nine o'clock this interloper must be make to understand as much the colonel reach the library undecided as to whether miss stapylton have better breakfast in she room or if it would be entirely proper for she to come to the table in one of those fluffy lace-trimmed garment such as agatha affect at the day 's begin the question be a nice one it be not as though servant be willing to be bother with carry tray to people 's room he know what agatha have to say upon that subject it be not as though he be the chit 's first cousin either he almost wish himself in the decline of life and free to treat the girl paternally and so he fret all that afternoon \* \* \* \* \* then too he reflect that it would be very awkward if agatha should be unwell while this patricium person be in the house agatha in she normal state be of course the kindliest and cheeriest gentlewoman in the universe but any physical illness appear to transform she nature disastrously she have she attack she feel badly very often nowadays poor dear and how be a patricium person to be expect to make allowance for the fact that at such time poor agatha be unavoidably a little cross and pessimistic v yet colonel musgrave stroll into he garden later with a tolerable affectation of unconcern woman after all he assure himself be necessary for the perpetuation of the species and resolve for the future to view these weakly big-hipped and slope-shouldered makeshift of nature 's with larger tolerance he cock he hat at a devil-may-carish angle and stride up the walk whistle jauntily and have it must be confess to the unprejudiced observer very much the air of a sheep in wolf 's clothing at worst he be reflect i can make love to she they as a rule take kindlily enough to that and in the exercise of hospitality a host must go to all length to divert he guest failure be not permit then she come to he she come to he across the trim cool lawn leisurely yet with a resilient tread that attest the vigor of she slim young body she be all in white diaphanous ethereal quite incredibly incredible but as she pass through the long shadow of the garden -- fire-new from the heart of the sunset rudolph musgrave would have swear to you -- the lacy fold and furbelow and semi-transparency that clothe she be now tinge with gold and now as a hedge or flower-bed screen she from the horizontal ray be soften into multitudinous graduation of gray and mauve and violet failure be not permit he be repeat in he soul you be cousin rudolph be not you she ask how perfectly entrance you see until to-day i always think that if i have be offer the choice between have cousin or appendicitis i would have prefer to be operate on and rudolph musgrave note with a delicious tingle somewhere about he heart that she hair be really like the reflection of a sunset in ripple water -- only many time more beautiful of course -- and that she mouth be a inconsiderable trifle a scrap of sanguine curve and that she eye be purple glimpse of infinity then he observe that he own mouth be give utterance to diver irrelevant and foolish sound which eventually resolve themselves into the statement he be glad to see she and immediately afterward the banality of this remark bring the hot blood to he face and for the rest of the day sting he and tease he somewhere in the background of he mind like a incessant insect glad indeed before he have finish shake hand with patricium stapylton it be all over with the poor man er -- h be quoth he only miss stapylton be meditate with puckered brow it would be unseemly for I to call you rudolph -- you impertinent minx cry he in he soul i should rather think it would be -- and cousin rudolph sound exactly like a dried-up little man with eyeglass and crow ' foot and a gentle nature i rather think you be go to be like that and i regard it as extremely hospitable of you not to be you be more like -- like what now miss stapylton put she head to one side and consider the contents of she vocabulary -- you be like a viking i shall call you olaf she announce when she have reach a decision this look you to the most dignified man in lichfield -- a person who have never bear a nickname in he life you must picture for yourself how the colonel stand before she big sturdy and blond and glare down at she and assure himself that he be very indignant like timanthe the colonel 's biographer prefer to draw a veil before the countenance to which art be unable to do justice then i have no admiration for the northmen rudolph musgrave declare stiffly they be a rude and barbarous nation proverbially addict to piracy and intemperance my goodness gracious miss stapylton observe -- and now for the first time he see the tooth that be like grain of rice upon a pink rise petal also he see dimple and do one mean all that by a vike the viking he inform she -- and he library manner have settle upon he now to the very tip of he finger -- be pirate the word be of icelandic origin from _ vik _ the name apply to the small inlet along the coast in which they conceal they galley i may mention that olaf be not a vike but a norwegian king be the first christian monarch to reign in norway dear I say miss stapylton how interesting then she yawn with deliberate cruelty however she conclude i shall call you olaf just the same er -- h be say the colonel \* \* \* \* \* and this stuttering boor -lrb- he reflect -rrb- be colonel rudolph musgrave confessedly the social triumph of he generation this imbecile without a syllable to say for himself without a solitary adroit word within tongue 's reach wherewith to annihilate the hussy be a musgrave of matocton \* \* \* \* \* and she do to she he be olaf from that day forth rudolph musgrave call she you he be nettle of course by she forwardness -- olaf indeed -- yet he find it somehow difficult to bear this fact in mind continuously for while it be true we hero and heroine in fiction no longer fall in love at first sight nature you must remember be too busily employ with other matter to have much time to profit by current literature then too she be not especially anxious to be realistic she prefer to jog along in the old rut contentedly turn out chromolithographic sunrise such as they give away at the tea store contentedly stage the most violent and improbable melodrama and -- sturdy old philistine that she be -- she even now permit she child to fall in love in the most primitive fashion she be not particularly interested in subtlety and soul analysis she merely chuckle rather complacently when a pair of eye be draw somehow to another pair of eye and a indescribable something be altered somewhere in some untellable fashion and the world suddenly become the most delightful place of residence in all the universe indeed it be she favorite miracle this for at work of this sort the old philistine know that she be a adept and she have rejoice in the skill of she hand with a sober workmanly joy since cain first go a-wooing in the land of nod so colonel rudolph musgrave without understand what have happen to he on a sudden be strangely content with life it be at supper -- dinner in lichfield when not a formal entertainment be eat at two in the afternoon -- that he fall a-speculating as to whether she eye after all could be fitly describe as purple be not there a grayer luminosity about they than he have at first suspect -- be not the cool glow of they in a word rather that of sunlight fall upon a wet slate roof it be a delicate question a affair of nuance of almost imperceptible graduation and in debate a matter of such nicety a man must necessarily lay aside all petty irritation such as be nettle by a irrational nickname and approach the question with unbiased mind he do and when at last he have come warily to the verge of decision miss musgrave in all innocence announce that they would excuse he if he wish to get back to he work he discover that somehow the three have finish supper and somehow he presently discover himself in he study where eight o'clock have find he every evening for the last ten year when he be not about he social diversion a old custom you will observe be not lightly broken vi subsequently : i have never approve of these international marriage say colonel musgrave with heat it stand to reason she be simply marry the fellow for he title _ -lrb- the will of jeremiah brown dated 29 November 1690 record 2 February 1690-1 mention he wife eliza brown and appoint she he executrix -rrb- _ she can not possibly care for he _ -lrb- this then be the second wife of edward osborne of henrico who marry he 15 June 1694 die before January 1696-7 -rrb- _ but they be all flibbertigibbet every one of they _ -lrb- she have apparently no child by either marriage -- -rrb- _ and i dare say she be no better than the rest come a tap on the door follow a vision of soft white fold and furbelow and semi-transparency and purple eye and a pouting mouth i be become like a pelican in the wilderness olaf the owner of these vanity complain be you very busy cousin agatha be about she housekeeping and i have read the afternoon paper all through -- even the list of undelivered letter and the woman 's page -- and i just want to see the gilbert stuart picture she conclude -- exercise one be afraid a certain economy in regard to the truth this be a little too much if a man 's working-hour be not to be respect -- if he privacy be to be thus invade on the flimsiest of pretext -- why then one may very reasonably look for chaos to come again this rudolph musgrave decide be a case demand firm and instant action here be a young person who need take down a peg or two and that at once but he make the mistake of look at she first and after that he lie glibly good lord no i be not in the least busy now in fact i be just about to look you two up i be rather afraid of disturb you she hesitate and a lucent mischief wake in she eye you be so patriarchal olaf she lament i feel like a lion venture into a den of daniel but if you cross you heart you be not really busy -- why then you can show I the stuart olaf it be widely concede that gilbert stuart never in he after work surpass the painting which hang then in rudolph musgrave 's study -- the portrait of the young gerald musgrave afterward the friend of jefferson and henry and still later the author of diver bulky tome pertain for the most part to ethnology the boy smile at you from the canvas smile ambiguously -- smile with a woman 's mouth set above a resolute chin however -- and with a sort of humorous sadness in he eye these latter are of a dark shade of blue -- purple if you will -- and he hair be tinge with red why he take after I say miss stapylton how thoughtful of he olaf and rudolph musgrave see the undeniable resemblance it give he a queer sort of shock too as he comprehend for the first time that the faint blue vein on that lift arm hold musgrave blood -- the same blood which at this thought quicken for any person guide by appearance rudolph musgrave consider would have surmise that the vein in question contain celestial ichor or some yet diviner fluid it be true he concede that there be a certain likeness and he be a very beautiful boy say miss stapylton demurely thank you olaf i begin to think you be a dangerous flatterer but he be only a boy olaf and i have always think of gerald musgrave as a learn person with a fringe of whisker all around he face -- like a centerpiece you know the colonel smile this portrait be paint early in life we kinsman be at that time i believe a person of rather frivolous tendency yet he be not quite thirty when he first establish he reputation by he monograph upon _ the evolution of marriage _ and afterwards just prior to he first meeting with goethe you will remember -- oh yes miss stapylton assent hastily i remember perfectly i know all about he thank you and it be that beautiful boy olaf that young-eyed cherub who develop into a musty old man who write musty old book and live a musty dusty life all by himself and never marry or have any fun at all how _ horrid _ olaf she cry with a queer shrug of distaste i fail say colonel musgrave to perceive anything -- ah -- horrid in a life devote to the study of anthropology he reputation when he die be international but he never have any fun you jay-bird and oh olaf olaf that boy could have have so much fun the world hold so much for he why fortune be only a woman you know and what woman could have refuse he anything if he have smile at she like that when he ask for it miss stapylton gaze up at the portrait for a long time now she hand clasp under she chin she face be gently reproachful oh boy dear boy dear she say with a forlorn little quaver in she voice how _ could _ you be _ so _ foolish _ do not _ you know there be something better in the world than grub after musty old tribe and custom and folk-song oh precious child how could you gerald musgrave smile back at she ambiguously and rudolph musgrave laugh i perceive say he you be a follower of epicurus for my part i must have fetch my ideal from the tub of the stoic i can conceive of no nobler life than one devoted to further the cause of science she look up at he with a wan smile a barren life she say : ah yes he be a waste life he book be all out-of-date now and nobody read they and it be just as if he have never be a barren life olaf and that beautiful boy might have have so much fun -- life be queer be not it olaf again he laugh the criticism he suggest be not altogether original and science no less than war must have she unsung hero you must remember he continue more seriously that any great work must have as its foundation the achievement of unknown man i fancy that cheop do not lay every brick in he pyramid with he own hand and i dare say nebuchadnezzar employ a few helper when he be lay out he hang garden but time can not chronicle these lesser man they sole reward must be the knowledge that they have aid somewhat in the unending work of the world she face have alter into a pink and white penitence which be flavor with awe i -- i forget she murmur contritely i -- forget you be -- like he -- about you genealogy you know oh olaf i be very silly of course it be tremendously fine and -- and nice i dare say if you like it -- to devote you life to learn as you and he have do i forget olaf still i be sorry somehow for that beautiful boy she end with a disconsolate glance at the portrait vii long after miss stapylton have leave he the colonel sit alone in he study idle now and muse vaguely there be no more addenda concern the descendant of captain thoma osborne that night at last the colonel rise and throw open a window and stand look into the moonlit garden the world bath in a mist of blue and silver there be a breeze that bring he sweet warm odor from the garden together with a blur shrilling of cricket and the conspiratorial conference of young leaf of course it be tremendously fine and -- and nice if you like it he say with a faint chuckle i wonder now if i do like it he be strangely move he seem somehow to survey rudolph musgrave and all he doings with complete and unconcerned aloofness the man 's life see in its true proportion dwindle into the merest flicker of a match he have such a little while to live this rudolph musgrave and he spend the serious hour of this brief time write note and chart and pamphlet that perhaps some hundred man in all the universe might care to read -- pamphlet no better and no more accurate than hundred of other man be write at that very moment no the capacity for originative and enduring work be not in he and this incessant compilation of dreary footnote this incessant rummaging among the bone of the dead -- do it after all mean more to this rudolph musgrave than one full vivid hour of life in that militant world yonder where man fight for other and more tangible prize than the mention of one 's name in a genealogical journal he could not have tell you in he heart he know that a thorough digest of the will and order of the orphan ' court of any county must always rank as a useful and creditable performance but from without the sound and odor of spring be call to he lure he wring he very heart bidding he come forth into the open and crack a jest or two before he die and stare at the girl a little before the match have flicker out \* \* \* \* \* at this time he hear a moan noise the colonel give a shrug sigh and ascend to he sister 's bedroom he know that agatha must be ill and that there be no more efficient quietus to wildish meditation than the heating of hot-water bottle and the administration of hypnotic he have long ago discover part two - renascence as one imprison that have lain alone and dream of sunlight where no vagrant gleam of sunlight pierce be free must deem this too but dream and must dread the sun whose glory dazzle -- even as such-an-one be i whose longing be but now supreme for this high hour and now it strike esteem i do but dream long dreamed-of goal be win phylli i be not worthy of thy love i pray thee let no kindly word be say of I at all for in the train thereof whenas yet-parted lip sigh-visited end speech and wait mine when i will to move such joy awaken that i grow afraid thoma rowland _ triumph of phylli _ i they pass with incredible celerity those next ten day -- those strange delicious topsy-turvy day to rudolph musgrave it seem afterward that he have dream they away in some vague lotus land -- in a delectable country where he remember there be always purple eye that mock you and red lip that coax you now and now cast gibe at you you feel for the most part of you stay in this country flush and hot and uncomfortable and unbelievably awkward and you be mercilessly bedevil there but not for all the accumulate wealth of samarkand and ind and ophir would you have have it otherwise ah no not otherwise in the least trifle for now uplift to a rosy zone of acquiescence you partake incuriously at table of nectar and ambrosia and note abroad without any surprise that you tread upon a more verdant grass than usual and that someone have polish up the sun a bit and in fine you snatch a fearful joy from the performance of the most trivial function of life yet always he remember that it could not last always he remember that in the autumn patricium be to marry lord pevensey she sometimes give he letter to mail which be address to that nobleman he wonder savagely what be in they he post they with a vicious shove and for the time they cause he acute twinge of misery but not for long no for in sober earnest if some fantastic sequence of event have make he one chance of win patricium stapylton dependent on he spend a miserable half-hour in she company rudolph musgrave could not have do it as for miss stapylton she appear to delight in the cloistered easy-going life of lichfield the quaint and beautiful old town fall short in nothing of she expectation in spite of the fact that she have previously read john charteri 's tale of lichfield -- those effusion which -lrb- if the _ lichfield courier-herald _ be to be trust -rrb- have build by the strength and witchery of record and rhyme romance and poem a myriad-windowed temple in lichfield 's honor -- exquisite luminous and enduring -- for all the world to see miss stapylton appear to delight in the cloistered easy-going life of lichfield -- that town which be once as the outside world have half-forgotten now the center of america 's wealth politics and culture the town to which european compile impression of america devoted one of they longest chapter in the heyday of elijah pogram and jefferson brick but the war between the state have change all that and lichfield endure to-day only as a pleasant backwater very pleasant too it be in the day of patricium 's advent there be strikingly few young man about to be sure most of they on reach maturity have settle in more bustling region but many maiden remain whom memory delight to catalogue -- tall brilliant lizzie allardyce the lovely and cattish marian winwood to whom felix kennaston write those wonderful love-letter which she publish when he marry kathleen saumarez the rich baugh heiress from georgium the pride twin and mattie ferneyhaugh whom even rival beauty love they say and other damsel by the score -- all in due time to be woo and win and then to pass out of the old town 's life among the man of rudolph musgrave 's generation -- those gallant oldster who be bear and breed and mean to die in lichfield -- patricium do not lack for admirer tom may be one of they of course rarely a pretty face escape the tribute of at least one proposal from tom may then there be roderick taunton he with the leonine mane who spare she none of he forensic eloquence but find patricium less tractable than the most stubborn of jury bluff walter thurman too who be say to know more of dickens whist and criminal law than any other man living come to worship at she shrine as likewise do huge red-faced ashby bland famed for that cavalry charge which history-book tell you that he lead and at which he actually be not present for reason all lichfield know and chuckle over and courtney thorpe and charle maupin doctor of the flesh and the spirit severally be other among the rival who gather about patricium at decorous festival when candle light the butler and he underling come with tray of delectable thing to eat and the nest of table be set out and pleasant chatter abound and among patricium 's attendant colonel musgrave it be needless to relate be preëminently pertinacious the two find a deal to talk about somehow though it be doubtful if many of they comment be of sufficient importance or novelty to merit record then also he often read aloud to she from lovely book for the colonel read admirably and do not scruple to give emotional passage they value _ trilby _ publish the precede spring in book form be one of these book for all this be at a very remote period and the _ rubaiyat _ be another for that poem be as yet unhackneyed and hardly wellknown enough to be parody in those happy day once he read to she that wonderful sad tale of han christian andersen 's which treat of the china chimney-sweep and the shepherdess who elope from they bedizened tiny parlor-table and be frighten by the vastness of the world outside and creep ignominiously back to they fit home and so the colonel end the little china people remain together and be thankful for the rivet in grandfather 's neck and continue to love each other until they be break to piece it be really a very lucky thing patricium estimate that the grandfather have a rivet in he neck and could not nod to the billy-goat-legged person to take the shepherdess away into he cupboard i do not doubt the little china people be glad of it but after climb so far -- and see the star -- i think they ought to have have more to be glad for she voice be quaintly wistful i will let you into a secret -- er -- patricium that rivet be make out of the strongest material in the whole universe and the old grandfather be glad at bottom he have it in he neck so that he could not nod and separate the shepherdess from the chimney-sweep yes -- i guess he have be rather a rip among the bric-à-brac in he day and sympathize with they no it be not just that you see these little china people have forsake they orderly comfortable world on the parlor table to climb very high it be a brave thing to do even though they falter and come back after a while it be what we all want to do patricium -- to climb toward the star -- even those of we who be too lazy or too cowardly to attempt it and when other try it we be envious and a little uncomfortable and we probably scoff but we can not help admiring and there be a rivet in the neck of all of we which prevent we from interfere oh yes we little china people have a variety of rivet thank god to prevent too frequent nodding and too cowardly a compromise with baseness -- rivet that be a part of we and force we into flash of upright living almost in spite of ourselves when duty and inclination grapple there be always the thing one can not do for the reason that one be constitute as one be that i take it be the real rivet in grandfather 's neck and everybody else 's he speak disjointedly vaguely but the girl nod i think i understand olaf only it be a two-edged rivet -- to mix metaphor -- and keep we stiffneck against all sort of call no i be not sure that the thing one can not do because one be what one be prove to be always a cause for international jubilation and firework on the lawn ii thus lichfield as to its staid trousered citizenry fall prostrate at miss stapylton 's foot and as to the remainder of its adult vociferously fail to see anything in the least remarkable in she appearance and avidly take and compare note as to she personal apparel you have bring asmodeus into lichfield colonel musgrave one day rebuke miss stapylton as they sit in the garden the demon of pride and dress be rampant everywhere -- er -- patricium even agatha do she hair differently now and in church last Sunday i count no less than seven duplicate of that blue hat of yours miss stapylton be move to mirth fancy you notice a thing like that say she i do not know you be even aware i have a blue hat i be no judge he concede gravely of such frippery i do not pretend to be but on the other hand i must plead guilty to derive considerable harmless amusement from you effort to dress as a example and a irritant to all lichfield you would not have I a dowd olaf say she demurely i have to be neat and tidy you know you would not have I go about in a continuous state of unbuttonedness and black bombazine like mr rabbet would you rudolph musgrave debate as to this i dare say he at last concede cautiously that to the casual eye you appearance be somewhat -- er -- more pleasing than that of we rector 's wife but on the other hand -- olaf i be embarrass by such fulsome eulogy mr rabbet be not a day under forty-nine and you consider I _ somewhat _ better-looking than she be he inspect she critically and be confirm in he opinion olaf -- coaxingly -- do you really think i be as ugly as that pouf say the colonel airily i dare say you be well enough olaf -- and this be even more cajole -- do you know you have never tell I what sort of a woman you most admire i do not admire any of they say colonel musgrave stoutly they be too vain and frivolous -- especially the pink-and-white one he add unkindlily cousin agatha have tell I all about you multifarious affair of course she depict you as a sort of cardiacal buccaneer and visibly gloat over the tale of you enormity she be perfectly dear about it but have you never -- _ care _ -- for any woman olaf precarious ground this he eye be fix upon she now and hers for doubtless sufficient reason be curiously intent upon anything in the universe rather than rudolph musgrave yes say he with a little intake of the breath yes i care once and -- she care ask miss stapylton she happen even now not to be look at he she rudolph musgrave cry in real surprise why god bless my soul of course she do not she do not know anything about it you never tell she olaf -- and this be reproachful then patricium say : well and do she go down in the cellar and get the wood-ax or be she satisfy just to throw the bric-à-brac at you and colonel musgrave laugh aloud ah say he it would have be a brave jest if i have tell she would not it she be young you see and wealthy and -- ah well i will not deceive you by exaggerate she personal attraction i will serve up to you no praise of she sauce with lie and i scorn to fall back on the stock-in-trade of the poet -- all they silly metaphor and simile and suchlike nonsense i will not tell you that she complexion remind I of rose swim in milk for it do nothing of the sort nor be i go to insist that she eye have a fire like that of star or proclaim that cupid be in the habit of light he torch from they i do not think he be i would like to have catch the brat take any such liberty with those innocent humorous unfathomable eye of hers and they do not remind I of violet either he pursue belligerently nor do she mouth look to I in the least like a rosebud nor do i have the slightest difficulty in distinguish between she hand and lily i consider these hyperbolical figure of speech to be idiotic ah no cry colonel musgrave warm to he subject -- and regard it too very intently ah no a face that could be patch together at the nearest florist 's would not haunt a man 's dream o'night as hers do i have not any need for praise sauce with lie i spurn hyperbole i scorn exaggeration i merely state calmly and judicially that she be god 's masterpiece -- the most beautiful and adorable and indescribable creature that he ever make she smile at this you should have tell she olaf say miss stapylton you should have tell she that you care he give a gesture of dissent she have everything he point out everything the world could afford she and doubtless she would have be very glad to give it all up for I would not she -- for I who have not youth or wealth or fame or anything ah i dare say she would have be delighted to give up the world she know and love -- the world that love she -- for the privilege of help I digest old county record and rudolph musgrave laugh again though not mirthfully but the girl be stare at he with a vague trouble in she eye you should have tell she olaf she repeat and at this point he note that the arbutus-flush in she cheek begin to widen slowly until at last it have burn back to the little pink ear and have merge into the coppery glory of she hair and have make she if such a thing be possible -- which a minute ago it manifestly be not -- more beautiful and adorable and indescribable than ever before ah yes he scoff lichfield would have make a fitting home for she she would have be very happy here shut off from the world with we -- with we whose forefather have marry and intermarry with one another until the stock be worthless and impotent for any further achievement for here you know we have the best blood in america and -- for utilitarian purpose -- that mean the worst blood ah we may prate of we superiority to the rest of the world -- and god know we do -- but at bottom we be worthless we be wear out i tell you we be effete and stunt in brain and will-power and the very desire of life be go out of we we be contented simply to exist in lichfield and she -- he pause and a new fierce light come into he eye she be so beautiful he say half-angrily between clenched tooth you be just like the rest of they olaf she lament with a hint of real sadness you imagine you be in love with a girl because you happen to like the color of she eye or because there be a curve about she lip that appeal to you that be not love olaf as we woman understand it ah no a girl 's love for a man do not depend altogether upon he fitness to be use as a advertisement for somebody 's ready-made clothing you fancy you know what you be talk about say rudolph musgrave but you do not you do not realize you see how beautiful she -- be and this time he nearly trip upon the tense for she hand be on he arm and in consequence a series of warm delicious little shiver be run about he body in a fashion highly favorable to extreme perturbation of mind you should have tell she olaf she say wistfully oh olaf olaf why do not you tell she she do not know of course how she be tempting he she do not know of course how she least touch seem to waken every pulse in he body to a ache throb and set hope and fear a-drumming in he breast obviously she do not know and it anger he that she do not she would have laugh at I he say with a snarl how she would have laugh she would not have laugh olaf and indeed she do not look as if she would but much you know of she say rudolph musgrave morosely she be just like the rest of they i tell you she know how to stare a man out of countenance with big purple eye that be like violet with the dew on they and keep she paltry pink-and-white baby face all pensive and sober till the poor devil go stark stare mad and would have pawn he very soul to tell she that he love she she know she do it on purpose she would look pensive just to make a ass of you she -- and here the colonel set he tooth for a moment and resolutely draw back from the abyss she would not have care for I he say with a shrug i be not exactly the sort of fool she care for what she really care for be a young fool who could dance with she in this silly new-fangled glide style and send she flower and sweet-meat and make love to she glibly -- and a petticoated fool who would envy she fine feather -- and at last a knavish fool who would barter he title for she money she prefer fool you see but she would never have care for a middle-aged penniless fool like I and so he end with a vicious outburst of mendacity i never tell she and she marry a title and live unhappily in gilded splendor ever afterwards you should have tell she olaf miss stapylton persist and then she ask in a voice that come very near be inaudible : be it too late to tell she now olaf the stupid man open he lip a little and stand stare at she with hungry eye wonder if it be really possible that she do not hear the pound of he heart and then he tooth click and he give a despondent gesture yes he say wearily it be too late now thereupon miss stapylton toss she head oh very well say she only for my part i think you act very foolishly and i do not see that you have the least right to complain i quite fail to see how you could have expect she to marry you -- or in fact how you can expect any woman to marry you -- if you will not at least go to the trouble of ask she to do so then miss stapylton go into the house and slam the door after she iii nor be that the worst of it for when rudolph musgrave follow she -- as he presently do in a state of considerable amaze -- he sister inform he that miss stapylton have retire to she room with a unaccountable headache and there she remain for the rest of the evening it be a unusually long evening yet somehow in spite of its notable length -- afford as it do a excellent opportunity for undisturbed work -- colonel musgrave find with a prick conscience that he make astonishingly slight progress in a exhaustive monograph upon the fragmentary orderly book of a obscure captain in a long-forgotten regiment which if it have not actually serve in the revolution have at least be demonstrably grant money for service and so entitle hundred of aspirant to become the son -lrb- or daughter -rrb- of various international disagreement nor do he see she at breakfast -- nor at dinner iv a curious little heartache accompany colonel musgrave on he way home that afternoon he have not see patricium stapylton for twenty-four hour and he be just begin to comprehend what life would be like without she he do not find the prospect exhilarating then as he come up the orderly graveled walk he hear issue from the little vine-covered summer-house a loud voice it be a man 's voice and its tone be angry no no the man be say i 'll agree to no such nonsense i tell you what do you think i be i think you be a jackass-fool miss stapylton say crisply and a fortune-hunter and a sot and a travesty and a whole heap of other thing i have not as yet have time to look up in the dictionary and i think -- i think you call yourself a english gentleman well all i have to say be god pity england if she gentleman be of you stamp there be not a costermonger in all whitechapel who would dare talk to I as you have do i would like to snatch you bald-headed i would like to kill you -- and do you think now if you be the very last man leave in all the _ world _ that i would -- no do not you try to answer I for i do not wish to hear a single word you have to say oh oh how _ dare _ you well i have have provocation enough the man 's voice retort sullenly perhaps i have cut up a bit rough patricium but then you have be talkin ' like a fool you know but what be the odds let 's kiss and make up old girl do not touch I she pant ah do not you _ dare _ you little devil you infernal little vixen you 'll jilt I will you let I go the girl cry sharply rudolph musgrave go into the summer-house the man colonel musgrave find there be big and loose-jointed with trace of puffiness about he face he have wheat-colored hair and weakish-looking pale blue eye one of he arm be about miss stapylton but he release she now and blink at rudolph musgrave and who be you pray he demand querulously what do you want anyhow what do you mean by sneakin ' in here and tappin ' on a fellow 's shoulder -- like a damn ' woodpecker by jove i do not know you there be in colonel musgrave 's voice a curious tremor when he speak but to the eye he be unruffled even faintly amuse i be the owner of this garden he enunciate with leisurely distinctness and it be not my custom to permit gentlewoman to be insult in it so i be afraid i must ask you to leave it now see here the man bluster weakly we do not want any heroics you know see here you be she cousin be not you by god i 'll leave it to you you know she be treat I badly do not you understand she be a jilt you know she be playin ' fast and loose -- he never get any further for at this point rudolph musgrave take he by the coat-collar and half-dragged half-pushed he through the garden shake he occasionally with a quiet emphasis the colonel be angry and it be a matter of utter indifference to he that they be trample over flower-bed and leave havoc in they rear but when they have reach the side-entrance he pause and open it and then shove he companion into a open field where a number of cow fresh from the evening milk regard they with incurious eye it be very quiet here save for the occasional jangle of the cow-bell and the far-off fifing of frog in the marsh below it would have be impossible of course say colonel musgrave for I to have offer you any personal violence as long as you be in a manner a guest of mine this field however be the property of judge willoughby and here i feel at liberty to thrash you then he thrash the man who have annoy patricium stapylton that thrashing be in its way a masterpiece there be a certain conscientiousness about it a certain thoroughness of execution -- a certain plodding and painstaking carefulness in a word such as be possible only to those who have spend year in guide fat-witted tourist among the antiquity of the lichfield historical association you ought to exercise more rudolph musgrave admonish he victim when he have end you be entirely too flabby now you know that path yonder will take you to the hotel where i imagine you be stay there be a train leave lichfield at six-fifteen and if i be you i would be very careful not to miss that train good-evening i be sorry to have be compel to thrash you but i must admit i have enjoy it exceedingly then he go back into the garden v in the shadow of a white lilac-bush colonel musgrave pause with a awed face good lord say he aghast at the notion what would agatha say if she know i have be fight like a drunken truck-driver or rather what would she refrain from say only she would not believe it of I and for the matter of that rudolph musgrave continue after a moment 's reflection i would not have believe it of myself a week ago i think i be change somehow a week ago i would have fetch in the police and swear out a warrant and if the weather have be as damp as it be i would have wait to put on my rubber before i would have do that much vi he find she still in the summer-house expectant of he it seem she lip part she eye glowing rudolph musgrave look down into twin vivid depths for a breathing-space find time to rejoice that he have refuse to liken they to star star forsooth -- and pray what paltry sun what irresponsible comet what pallid clinkered satellite might boast a purple splendor such as this for all asterial scintillation at best have but a clap-trap glitter whereas the glow of patricium 's eye be a matter worthy of really serious attention what have you do with he olaf the girl breathe quickly i reason with he say colonel musgrave oh i find he quite amenable to logic he be leave lichfield this evening i think thereupon miss stapylton begin to laugh yes say she you must have remonstrate very feelingly you tie 's all crooked olaf dear and you hair 's all rumpled and there be dust all over you coat you would disgrace a rag-bag oh i be glad you reason -- that way it be not dignified but it be dear of you olaf pevensey 's a beast he catch he breath at this pevensey he stammer the earl of pevensey -- the man you be go to marry dear I no miss stapylton answer with utmost unconcern i would sooner marry a toad why do not you know olaf i thought of course you know you have be introduce athletics and better manners among the peerage that sound like a bill in the house of common do not it then miss stapylton laugh again and appear to be in a state of agreeable though somewhat nervous elation i write to he two day ago she afterward explain break off the engagement so he come down at once and be very nasty about it you -- you have break you engagement he echo dully and continue with a certain deficiency of finesse but i think you want to be a countess oh you boor you vulgarian the girl cry oh you do put thing so crudely olaf you be hopeless she shake a admonitory forefinger in he direction and pout in the most dangerous fashion but he always seem so nice she reflect with puckered brow until to-day you know i think he would be eminently suitable i like he tremendously until -- and here a wonderful tender change come into she face a wistful quaver wake in she voice -- until i find there be some one else i like better ah say rudolph musgrave so that be it -- yes that be it she head be bow now -- she glorious proud little head -- and she sit silent a abashed heap of fluffy frill and ruffle a tiny bundle of vaporous ruching and filmy tuck and suchlike vanity in the green dusk of the summer-house but he know he have see she face grave and tender in the twilight and he know she love some man -- some lucky devil ah yes that be it and he know the love he have unwittingly spy upon to be August the shame exultance of she face and she illumined eye the crimson banner she cheek have flaunt -- these be to colonel musgrave as a piece of sacred pageantry and before it he misery be awed he envy go post to extinction thus the stupid man reflect and make himself very unhappy over it then after a little the girl throw back she head and draw a deep breath and flash a tremulous smile at he ah yes say she there be better thing in life than coronet be not there olaf you should have see how he catch up the word life he cry with a bitter thrill of speech ah what do i know of life i be only a recluse a dreamer a visionary you must learn of life from the man who have live patricium i have not ever live i have always choose the coward 's part i have choose to shut myself off from the world to posture in a village all my day and to consider its trifle as of supreme importance i have affect to scorn that brave world yonder where a man be prove and all the while i be afraid of it i think i be afraid of you before you come at the thought of this rudolph musgrave laugh as he fall to pacing up and down before she life he cry again with a helpless gesture and then smile at she very sadly ` do not i know there be something better in life than grub after musty tribe and custom and folk-song ' he quote why what a question to ask of a professional genealogist do not you realize patricium that the very bread i eat be actually earn by the achievement of people who have be dead for century and in part of course by tickle the vanity of live snob that constitute a nice trade for a able-bodied person as long as man be pay for empty garbage-barrel -- now do not it and yet it be not altogether for the pay 's sake i do it he add haltingly there really be a fascination about the work you be really work out a puzzle -- like a fellow solve a chess-problem it be not really work it be amusement and when you be establish a royal descent and trace back to czar and plantagenet and merovingian and make it all seem perfectly plausible the thing be sheer impudent flagrant art and _ you _ be the artist -- he break off here and shrug no i could hardly make you understand it do not matter it be enough that i have barter youth and happiness and the very power of live for the privilege of grub in old county record he pause it be debatable if he have speak wisely or have speak even in consonance with fact but he outburst have at least the save grace of sincerity he be pallid now shake in every limb and in he heart be a dull ache she seem so incredibly soft and little and childlike as she look up at he with troubled eye i -- i do not quite understand she murmur it be not as if you be a old man olaf it be not as if -- but he have scarcely hear she ah child child he cry why do you come to waken I i be content in my smug vanity i be content in my ignorance i could have go on contentedly grub through my musty sleepy life here till death have take I if only you have not show I what life might mean ah child child why do you waken I i she breathe and now the flush of she cheek have widen wondrously you you he cry and give a wringing motion of he hand for the self-esteem of a complacent man be not tear away without agony who else but you i have think myself brave enough to be silent but still i must play the coward 's part that woman i tell you of -- that woman i loved -- be you yes you you he cry again and again in a sort of frenzy and then on a sudden colonel musgrave begin to laugh it be very ridiculous be not it he demand of she yes it be very -- very funny now come the time to laugh at I now come the time to lift you brow and to make keen arrow of you eye and of you tongue a little red dagger i have dream of this moment many and many a time so laugh i say laugh for i have tell you that i love you you be rich and i be a pauper -- you be young and i be old remember -- and i love you who love another man for the love of god laugh at I and have do -- laugh for as god live it be the bravest jest i have ever know but she come to he with a wonderful gesture of compassion and catch he great shapely hand in hers i -- i know you care she breathe i have always know you care i would have be a idiot if i have not but oh olaf i do not know you care so much you frighten I olaf she plead and raise a tearful face to he i be very fond of you olaf dear oh do not think i be not fond of you and the girl pause for a breathless moment i think i might have marry you olaf she say half-wistfully if -- if it have not be for one thing rudolph musgrave smile now though he find it a difficult business yes he assent gravely i know dear if it be not for the other man -- that lucky devil yes he be a very very lucky devil child and he constitute rather a big ` if ' do not he miss stapylton too smile a little no say she that be not quite the reason the real reason be as i tell you yesterday that i quite fail to see how you can expect any woman to marry you you jay-bird if you will not go to the trouble of ask she to do so and this time miss stapylton do not go into the house vii when they go in to supper they have plan to tell miss agatha of they earth-staggering secret at once but the colonel comprehend at the first glimpse of he sister that the opportunity would be ill-chosen the meal be a awkward half-hour miss agatha from the head of the table do very little talk save occasionally to evince view of life that be both lachrymose and pugnacious and the lover talk with desperate cheerfulness so that there might be no outbreak so long as pilkin -- preëminently ceremonious among butler and as yet incline to scoff at the notion that the musgrave of matocton be not divinely

supper-table virginium they call she virginium have be nurse in turn to all the child of rudolph musgrave 's parent and to the end of she life she appear to regard the emancipation of the south 's negro as a irrelevant vagary of certain low-down and probably ornery yankee -- as a in short quite eminently tacky proceeding which very certainly in no way affect she vested right to tyrannize over

stove miss agatha be not well to-night yaa suh i unnerstan ' suh virginium say sedately virginia fill she tray and go away quietly she pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as a idol 's part three -

ma hanna be cheerfully express he confidence as to the outcome of it all when the czar and the czarina be visit president faure in paris amid unparalleled enthusiasm and when semi-educated people be appraise with a glibness possible to ignorance only the literary achievement of william morris and george du maurier who have just die : -- at this remote time roger stapylton return to lichfield for in that particular October patricium 's father a accommodate physician have declare old roger stapylton 's health to necessitate a southern sojourn lease the bellingham mansion in lichfield it happen that by rare good luck tom bellingham -- of the bellingham of assequin not the bellingham of bellemeade who indeed immigrate after the war of 1812 and have never be regard as securely establish from a social standpoint -- be at this time in pecuniary difficulty on account of have sign another person 's name to a cheque roger stapylton refurnish the house in the extreme degree of lichfieldian elegance colonel musgrave be he mentor throughout the process and the oldest family of lichfield very shortly sit at table with the former overseer and not at all unwillingly since he dinner be excellent and a infatuate rudolph musgrave -- a axiom now in plan any list of guest -- be very shortly to marry the man 's daughter in fact the matter have be settle and colonel musgrave have receive from roger stapylton a exuberantly grant charter of courtship this befall indeed upon a red letter day in roger stapylton 's life the banker be in business matter wonderfully shrewd as diver transaction since the signing of that half-forgotten contract whereby he be to furnish a certain number of mule for the confederate service strikingly attest : but he have rarely be out of the country wherein he mother bear he and where another nabob might have dream of a earl or even have soar aspiringly in imagination toward a marchioness-ship for he only child old stapylton retain unshaken faith in the dust-gathering creed of he youth he have tolerate pevensey have indeed be prepare to purchase he much as he would have order any other expensive trinket or knickknack which patricium desire but he have never view the match with enthusiasm now though old stapylton exult he daughter -- half a vartrey already -- would become by marriage a musgrave of matocton no less pat 's carriage would roll up and down the oak-shaded avenue from which he have so often step aside with a uncovered head while gentleman and lady canter by and it would be pat 's child that would play about the corridor of the old house at whose door he have live so long -- those awe-inspiring corridor which he have very rarely enter except on christmas day and other recognize festivity when dress to the nines the overseer and he uneasy mother be by immemorial custom make free of the mansion with every slave upon the big plantation they be good day sir he chuckle heh we 'll stick to the old custom we 'll give a dinner and announce it at dessert just as you honor grandfather do you aunt constantium 's betrothal -- for about the musgrave of matocton there could be no question it be the old man 's delight to induce rudolph musgrave to talk concern he ancestor and stapylton soon have they history at he finger-tip he could have correctly blazon every tincture in they armorial bearing and have explain the origin of every rampant counter-changed or couchant beast upon the shield he know it be the _ bona nova _ in the November of 1619 -- for the first musgrave have settle in virginium prior to he removal to lichfield -- which have the honor of transport the forebear of this family into america stapylton could have tell you offhand which scion of the race have represent this or that particular county in the house of burgess and even for what year which three of they be governor and which of they have serve as officer of the state line in the revolution and in fine be more than satisfy to have he daughter play penelophon to colonel musgrave 's debonair mature cophetua in a word roger stapylton have acquiesce to the transferal of he daughter 's affection with the peculiar equanimity of a properly rear american parent he merely stipulate that since he business affair prevent a indefinite stay in lichfield colonel musgrave should presently remove to new york city where the older man hold ready for he a purely ornamental and remunerative position with the insurance company of which roger stapylton be president but upon this point rudolph musgrave be obdurate he have voice and with sincerity as you may remember he desire to be prove upon a larger stage than lichfield afford yet the sincerity be breed of a emotion it do not survive to-day unconsciously rudolph musgrave be reflect that he be use to live in lichfield and would appear to disadvantage in a new surrounding and very probably would not be half so comfortable aloud he say in firm belief that he speak truthfully : i can not conscientiously give up the library sir i realize the work may not seem important in you eye indeed in anybody 's eye it must seem a inadequate outcome of a man 's whole life but it unfortunately happen to be the only kind of work i be capable of do and -- if you will pardon I sir -- i do not think it would be honest for I to accept this generous salary and give nothing in return but here patricium break in patricium agree with colonel musgrave in every particular indeed have colonel musgrave proclaim he intention of set up in life as a assassin patricium would readily have assert homicide to be the most praiseworthy of vocation as it be she devote no little volubility and emphasis and eulogy to the importance of a genealogist in the eternal scheme of thing and give she father candidly to understand that a inability to appreciate this fact be necessarily indicative of a deplorably low order of intelligence musgrave be to remember -- long afterward -- how glorious and dear this brightly-colored mettlesome and tiny woman have seem to he in the second display of temper he witness in patricium it be a revelation of a additional and as yet unsuspected adorability she father though say : pat i have suspect for a long time it be foolish of I to have a red-haired daughter thus he capitulate -- and with a ineffable air of routine colonel musgrave be in a decorous fashion the happiest of live person ii colonel musgrave be in a decorous fashion the happiest of live person as a token of this he devote what little ready money he possess to renovate matocton where he have not live for twenty year he rarely think of money not esteem it a altogether suitable subject for a gentleman 's meditation and to do he justice the reflection that old stapylton 's wealth would some day be at rudolph musgrave 's disposal be never more than a agreeable minor feature of patricium 's entourage whenever as be very often colonel musgrave fall to thinking of how adorable patricium be in every particular yet there be time when he think of anne charteri as well he have not see she for a whole year now for the charterise have leave lichfield shortly after the pendomer divorce case have be settle and be still in europe this be the evening during which roger stapylton have favorably receive he declaration and colonel musgrave be remember the time that he and anne have last speak with a semblance of intimacy -- that caustic time when anne charteri have interrupted he in high word with she husband and circumstance have afford to rudolph musgrave no choice save to confess to this too-perfect woman of all create being he true relation with clarice pendomer even as yet the bitterness of that humiliation be not savorless it seem to he that he could never bear to think of the night when anne have hear he stammering through and have merely listen and in listen have be unreasonably beautiful so godiva might have look on peeping tom with more of wonder than of loathing just at first it have be very hard to bear but it seem necessary the truth would have hurt anne too much he note with the gusto of a connoisseur how neatly the dénouement of this piteous farce have be prepare he rage with charteri anne 's overhearing and misinterpretation of a dozen angry word that old affair with clarice -- immediately before she marriage -lrb- one of how many pleasurable gallantry the colonel idly wonder and regret that he have no leporello to keep they catalogue for consultation -rrb- -- and george pendomer 's long-smoldering jealousy of rudolph musgrave : all fit in as neatly as the bit of a puzzle it have be the simplest matter in the world to shield john charteri yet the colonel wish he could be sure it be a unadulterated desire of protect anne which have move he there have be very certainly a enjoyment all the while in reflect how nobly rudolph musgrave be behave for the sake of the only woman he have ever love yes one have undoubtedly phrase it thus -- then and until the time one meet patricium but anne be different and in the nature of thing must always be a little different from all other people -- even patricium stapylton always in reverie the colonel would come back to this -- that anne could not be think of quite in the same frame of mind wherein one appraise other person especially must he concede this curious circumstance whenever as to-night he consider diver matter that have take place quite long enough ago to have be forget it be a foolish sort of a reverie and scarcely worth the set down it be a reverie of the kind that everyone and especially everyone 's wife admit to be mawkish and unprofitable and yet somehow the next still summer night or long sleepy Sunday afternoon or perhaps some cheap jigging and heartbreaking melody will set a carnival of old love and old face awhirl in the brain one grow very sad over it of course and it become apparent that one have always be ill-treat by the world but the sadness be not unpleasant and one be quite willing to forgive yes -- it be a long long time ago it must have be a great number of century matocton be deck in its spring frippery of burgeon and the sky be a great pale turquoise and the buttercup leave a golden dust high up on one 's trousers one have not become entirely accustom to long trousers then and one be rather proud of they one be lie on one 's back in the wood where the bird be astir and eager to begin they house-building and twitter hysterically over the potentiality of straw and broken twig overhead the swell bud of tree be visible against the sky and the branch be like grotesque design on a japanese plate there be a little clump of moss very cool and soft that just brush one 's cheek one be think -- really think -- for the first time in one 's life and curiously enough one be think about a girl although girl be manifestly of no earthly importance but anne willoughby be different even at the age when girl seem feckless creature whose aiming be inexplicable both as concerned existence in general and more concretely as touch gravel-shooter and snowball and whose reason for burst into tear be recondite one have perceive the difference one wonder about it from time to time gradually there awake a uneasy self-conscious interest as to all matter that concern she a mental prick up of the ear when she name be mention one lay awake o ' night wonder why she hair curl so curiously about she temple and hold such queer glowing tint in its depths when sunlight fall upon it one be uncomfortable and embarrassed and briarean-handed in she presence but with she absence come the overwhelming desire of see she again after a little it be quite understand that one be in love with anne willoughby it be a matter of minor importance that she father be the wealthiest man in fairhaven and that one 's mother be poor one would go away into foreign land after a while and come back with a great deal of money -- lake of rupee and piece of eight probably it be very simple but anne 's father have take a unreasonable view of the matter and carry anne off to a terrible aunt who return one 's letter unopen that be the end of anne willoughby then after a interval -- during which one fall in and out of love assiduously and have upon the whole a pleasant time -- anne charteri have come to lichfield one have find that time have merely add poise and self-possession and a certain opulence to the beauty which have cause one 's voice to play fantastic trick in conference with anne willoughby -- ancient unforgotten conference wherein one have point out the many respects in which she differ from all other woman and the perfect feasibility of marry on nothing a year much as one loved patricium and great as be one 's happiness man do not love as boy do after all ` ah boy it be a dream for life too high ' say colonel musgrave in he soul and now let 's think of something sensible let 's think about the present political crisis and what to give the groomsman and how much six time seven be meanwhile you be not the fellow in _ aux italien _ you know you be not bother by the faint sweet smell of any foolish jasmine-flower you understand or by any equally foolish hankering after you lose youth you be simply a commonplace every-day sort of man not thoroughly harden as yet to be engage and you be feel a bit pull down to-night because you liver or something be out of sort upon reflection colonel musgrave be quite sure that he be happy and that it be only he liver or something which be upset but at all event the colonel 's beset infirmity be always to shrink from make change instinctively he balk against commission of any action which would alter he relation with accustomed circumstance or person it be very like rudolph musgrave that even now for all the glow of the future 's bright allure he heart should hark back to the past and its absurd dear memory with wistfulness and he find it as many other have do but cheerless sexton 's work this digging up of boyish recollection one by one they come to light -- the brave hope and dream and aspiration of youth the ruddy life have go out of they they have shrivel into a alien pathetic dignity they might have be one 's great-grandfather 's or hannibal 's or adam 's the boy whose life be sway by they be quite as dead as these amarylli be dead too perhaps you drop in of a afternoon to talk over old happening she be perfectly affable she think it be time you be marry she think it very become the way you have stouten and no they be not at the robinson ' that be the night little amarylli be threaten with croup then after a little the lamp of welcome be light in she eye she breath quicken she cheek mount crimson flag in honor of she lord she hero she conqueror it be mr grundy who be happy to meet you and hope you will stay to dinner he patronize you a trifle he wife you see have tell he all about that boy who be as dead as hannibal you do not mind in the least you dine with mr and mr grundy and pass a very pleasant evening colonel musgrave have dine often with the charterise iii and then some frolic god _ en route _ from homicide by means of a unloaded pistol in chicago for the demolishment of a likely ship off palo with the coöperancy of a defective pistonrod stay in he flight to bring joe parkinson to lichfield it be roger stapylton who tell the colonel of this advent as the very apex of jocularity for you remember the parkinson i suppose the one that have a cabin near matocton very deserving people i believe and _ they _ son sir want to marry my daughter say mr stapylton -- _ my _ daughter who be shortly to be connect by marriage with the musgrave of matocton i do not know what this world will come to next it be a treat to see he shake he head in deprecation of such anarchy then roger stapylton say more truculently : yes sir on account of a boy-and-girl affair five year ago this half-strainer this poor-white trash have actually have the presumption sir -- but i do not doubt that pat have tell you all about it why no say colonel musgrave she do not mention it this afternoon she be not feel very well a slight headache i notice she be not incline to conversation it have just occur to he as mildly remarkable that patricium have never at any time allude to any one of those countless man who must have inevitably make love to she though mind you i do not say anything against joe he be a fine young fellow pay he own way through college do good work in panama and in alaska too but -- confound it sir the boy 's a fool now i put it to you fairly be not he a fool say mr stapylton upon my word sir if he folly have no other proof than a adoration of you daughter the colonel protest i must in self-defense beg leave to differ with you yes that be it undoubtedly patricium have too high a sense of honor to exhibit these defeat rival in a ridiculous light even to he it be a revelation of a additional and as yet unsuspected adorability then after a little further talk they separate colonel musgrave leave that night for matocton in order to inspect the improvement which be be make there he be to return to lichfield on the ensue Wednesday when he engagement to patricium be to be announce -- just as you honor grandfather do you aunt constantium 's betrothal meanwhile joe parkinson a young man much enamor who fight the world by ordinary like hal o ' the wynd for he own hand be see patricium every day iv colonel musgrave remain five day at matocton that he might put he house in order against he near marriage it be a pleasant sight to see the colonel stroll about the paneled corridor and pause to chat with diver deferential workman who be put the last touch there or to observe he mid-course in affable consultation with gardener anent the rolling of a lawn or the retrimming of a rosebush and to mark the bearing of the man so optimistically color by goodwill toward the solar system he joy in he old home -- in the hipped roof of it the mullioned casement the wide window-seat the high and spacious room the geometrical garden and broad lawn in all that be quaint and beautiful at matocton -- because it would be patricium 's so very soon the lovely frame of a yet lovelier picture as the colonel phrase it with a flight of imagery gravely he inspect all the portrait of he feminine ancestor that he might decide as one without bias whether matocton have ever boast a more delectable mistress equity -- or in he fond eye at least -- demand a negative only in one of these canvas a counterfeit of miss evelyn ramsay bear a ramsay of blenheim that have marry the common great-great-grandfather of both the colonel and patricium -- major orlando musgrave a aide-de-camp to general charle lee in the revolution -- rudolph musgrave find or seem to find dear likeness to that demented seraph who be about to stoop to he unworthiness he spend much time before this portrait yes yes this woman have be lovely in she day and this bright roguish shadow of she be lovely too eternally posture in white patnet trim with a vine of rose-colored satin leave a pink rise in she powdered hair and a huge ostrich plume as well yet it be a adamantean colonel that remark : my dear perhaps it be just as fortunate as not that you have quit matocton for i have hear tale of you miss ramsay oh no i honestly do not believe that you would have take kindlily to any young person -- not even in the guise of a great-great-grand-daughter -- to whom you can not hold a candle madam a fico for you madam say the most undutiful of great-great-grandson let we leave he to he roseate meditation questionless in the woman he love there be much of he own invention : but the circumstance be not unhackney and colonel musgrave be in a decorous fashion the happiest of live person meanwhile joe parkinson a young man much enamor who fight the world by ordinary like hal o ' the wynd for he own hand be see patricium every day v joe parkinson -- tall and broad-shouldered tan resolute chary of speech decisive in gesture have close-cropped yellow hair and frank keen eye like amethyst -- be the one alien present when colonel musgrave come again into roger stapylton 's fine and choicely-furnished mansion this be on the evening roger stapylton give the long-anticipated dinner at which he be to announce he daughter 's engagement as much indeed be suspect by most of he dinner-company so carefully select from the aristocracy of lichfield and the heart of the former overseer as these handsome courtly and sweet voice people settle accord to they rank about he sumptuous table be aglow with pride then rudolph musgrave turn to he companion and say softly : my dear you be like a wraith what be it i have a headache say patricium it be nothing you reassure I the colonel gaily declare for i have fear it be a heartache -- she face he desperation look out of she purple eye it be the girl say swiftly ah -- only it be a intake of the breath rather than a interjection colonel musgrave eat he fish with deliberation young parkinson he presently suggest i think i have forget he i do not know i care -- i do not know i _ could _ care so much -- and there be a note in she voice which thrust the poor colonel into a abyss of consternation remember that these people be you guest he say in perfect earnest -- and i refuse he this afternoon for the last time and he be go away to-morrow -- but here judge allardyce break in to tell miss stapylton of the pleasure with which he have _ nolle prosequied _ the case against tom bellingham a son of my old schoolmate ma'am the judge explain a bellingham of assequin oh indiscreet of course -- but god bless my soul when be the bellingham anything else the boy regret it as much as anybody and she listen with almost morbid curiosity concern the finer detail of legal intricacy colonel musgrave be mid-course in a anecdote which the lady upon the other side of he find wickedly amusing he be very gay he have presently secure the attention of the company at large and hold it through a good half-hour for by common consent rudolph musgrave be at he best to-night and lichfield find he best worth listen to grin old popinjay think mr parkinson and envy he and internally note and with a unholy fervor curse the adroitness of intonation and the discreetly modulate gesture with which the colonel give to every point of he merry-andrewing its precise value the colonel 's mind be work busily on matter oddly apart from those of which he talk he want this girl next to he -- at whom he do not look he love she as that whippersnapper yonder be not capable of loving anyone young people have these fancy and they outlive they as the colonel know of he own experience let matter take they course unhindered at all event by he for it be less he part than that of any other man alive to interfere when rudolph musgrave stand within a finger 's reach of at worst he own prosperity and happiness he would convey no note to roger stapylton let the banker announce the engagement let the young fellow go to the devil colonel musgrave would marry the girl and make patricium at worst content to do otherwise even to hesitate would be the emptiest quixotism then come the fatal thought but what a gesture to fling away he happiness -- yes even he worldly fortune -- and to do it smilingly patricium must perforce admire he all she life then as old stapylton stir in he chair and break into a wide premonitory smile colonel musgrave rise to he foot and of that company clarice pendomer at least thought of how like he be to the boy who have fight the famous duel with george pendomer some fifteen year ago ensue a felicitous speech rudolph musgrave be familiar with he audience and therefore : colonel musgrave allude briefly to the pleasure he take in address such a gathering he believe no other state in the ` union could have afford a assembly of more distinguished man and fairer woman but the fact be not unnatural they might recall the venerable say that blood will tell well it be they peculiar privilege to represent to-day that sturdy stock which when this great republic be in the pang of birth have with sword and pen and oratory discomfited the hireling of england and give to history the undying name of several revolutionary patriot -- all of whom he enumerate with the customary pause after each cognomen to allow for the customary applause and theirs too be the blood of those heroic man who fight more recently beneath the star and bar as bravely he would make bold to say as leonida at thermopyla in defense of they loved southland right he concede have not triumph here for horde of brutal soldiery have invade the fertile soil the tempest of war have sweep the land and leave it desolate the south lay battered and bruised and pro trate in blood the niobe of nation as sad a victim of ingratitude as king lear the colonel touch upon the time when buzzard in the guise of carpet-bagger have batten upon the recumbent form and speak slightingly of diver person of antiquity as compare with various confederate leader whose name be greet with approve nod and ripple of polite enthusiasm but the south and in particular the grand old commonwealth which they inhabit he state have not long sit among the ruin of she temple like a sorrowing priestess with veil eye and a depressed soul mourning for that which have be like the fabled phoenix she have rise from the ash of she past to-day she be once more to be see in she hereditary position the brightest gem in all that glorious galaxy of state which make america the envy of every other nation she battlefield convert into building lot tall factory smoke where once a holocaust have flame and where cannon have roar you hear to-day the tinkle of the school bell such progress be without a parallel nor be there any need for he he be assure to mention the imperishable name of they dear homeland 's poet and statesman of to-day the orator and philanthropist and prominent business-man who jostle one another in she splendid new asphalted street since all be quite familiar to he audience -- as familiar he would venture to predict as they would eventually be to the most cherish recollection of macaulay 's prophesy new zealander when this notorious antipodean should pay he long expect visit to the ruin of st paul 's in fine by a natural series of transition colonel musgrave thus work around to the very please duty with which we host in view of the long and intimate connection between we family have see fit to honor I -- which be it develop to announce the imminent marriage of miss patricium stapylton and mr joseph parkinson it may conservatively be state that everyone be surprised old stapylton have half rise with a purple face the colonel view he with a look of bland interrogation there be silence for a heart-beat then stapylton lower he eye if just because the law of caste have triumph and in consequence he glance cross that of he daughter who sit motionless regard he she be a unusually pretty girl he think and he have always be inordinately proud of she it be not pride she seem to beg he muster now patricium through that moment be not the fine daughter the old man be sometimes half afraid of she be too like a certain defiant person -- oh of a incredible beauty such as woman have not any longer -- who have hastily put aside she bonnet and have look at a young roger stapylton in much this fashion very long ago because the minister be come downstairs and they would presently be man and wife -- provide always she pursuing brother do not arrive in time old roger stapylton clear he throat old roger stapylton say half sheepishly : my foot 's asleep that be all i beg everybody 's pardon i be sure please go on -- he have come within a ace of say mr rudolph and only in the nick of time do he continue colonel musgrave so the colonel continue in time-hallowed form with happy allusion to mr parkinson 's anterior success as a engineer before he come like a young lochinvar to wrest away he beautiful and popular fiancée from we faintheart fellow of lichfield touch of course upon the colonel 's personal comminglement of envy and rage and so on as a old bachelor who see too late what he have miss in life and conclude by propose the health of the young couple this be drunk with all the honor vi upon what patricium say to the colonel in the drawing-room what joe parkinson blurt out in the hall and chief of all what roger stapylton asseverate to rudolph musgrave in the library after the other guest have go it be unnecessary to dwell in this place to each of these in various fashion do colonel musgrave explain such reason as he variously explain must seem to any gentleman sufficient cause for act as he have do but most candidly and even with a touch of eloquence to roger stapylton you be like you grandfather sir at time the latter say inconsequently enough when the colonel have finish and rudolph musgrave give a little bowing gesture with a entire gravity he know it be the highest tribute that stapylton could pay to any man she be a daughter any father might be proud of say the banker also he remove he cigar from he mouth and look at it critically she be rather like she mother sometimes he say carelessly she mother make a runaway match you may remember -- damn ' poor cigar this but no you would not i reckon i have branch out into cotton then and have a little place just outside of chiswick -- so that all in all colonel musgrave return homeward not entirely dissatisfied vii the colonel sit for a long while before he fire that night the room seem less comfortable than he have ever know it so many of he book and picture and other furnishings have be already carry to matocton that the wall be a little bare also there be a formidable pile of bill upon the table by he -- from contractor and upholsterer and furniture-house and so on who have be concern in the late renovation of matocton -- the herald of a host he hardly see he way to deal with he have fling away a deal of money that evening with something which to he be dearer have you attempt to condole with he he would not have understand you but what would you have have a gentleman do sir colonel musgrave would have say in real perplexity besides it be in fact not sorrow that he feel rather it be contentment when he remember the girl 's present happiness and what alone depress the colonel 's courtly affability toward the universe at large be the queer horrible new sense of be somehow out of touch with yesterday 's so comfortable world of be out-moded of be almost old eh well he say i be of a certain age undoubtedly by a odd turn the colonel thought of how he friend of he own class and generation have honestly admire the after-dinner speech which he have make that evening and he smile but very tenderly because they be all man and woman whom he love the most of we have know each other for a long while the most of we in fact be of a certain age i think no people ever meet the sorry problem that we face for we be bear the master of a leisured order world and by a tragic quirk of destiny be thrust into a quite new planet where we be for a while the inferior and after that just the competitor of yesterday 's slave we could not meet the new condition oh for the love of heaven let we be frank and confess that we have not meet they as thing practical go we have not the training for it a man who have not be teach to swim may rationally be excuse for prefer to sit upon the bank and should he elect to ornament he idleness with protestation that he be self-evidently a excellent swimmer because once upon a time he progenitor be the only people in the world who have the slightest conception of how to perform a natatorial masterpiece the thing be simply human nature talk choke nobody worse luck and yet we have not do so badly for the most part we have sit upon the bank we whole life long we have produce nothing -- after all -- which be absolutely earth-staggering and we have talk a deal of clap-trap but meanwhile we have at least enhance the comeliness of we particular sand-bar we have live a courteous and tranquil and independent life thereon just as we father teach we it may be -- in the final outcome of thing -- that will be find a even finer pursuit than the old one of produce president besides we have produce ourselves we have be gentlefolk in spite of all we have be true even in we iniquity to the tradition of we race no i can not assert that these tradition always square with ethic or even with the decalogue for we have add a very complex eleventh commandment concern honor and for the rest we have defiantly embroidered life and indomitably we have convert the commonest happen of life into a comely thing we have be artist if not artizan there be upon the table a large photograph in sepia of patricium stapylton he study this now she be very beautiful he think ` nor thou detain she vesture 's hem ' -- say the colonel aloud oh that infernal yankee understand even though he be bear in boston and this as come from a musgrave of matocton may fairly be consider as a sweeping tribute to the author of _ give all to love _ colonel musgrave be intent upon the portrait so she have choose at last between himself and this young fellow a workman bear of workman who go about the world building bridge and canal and tunnel and such in those far country which be to colonel musgrave just so many gray or pink or fawn-colored splotch on the map it seem to colonel musgrave almost a allegory so colonel musgrave fill a glass with the famed lafayette madeira of matocton and solemnly drink yet another toast he love to do as you already know that which be colorful to this new south he say to this new south that have not any longer need of I or of my kind to this new south she do not gaze unwillingly nor too complacently upon old year and dare concede that but with loss of manliness may any man encroach upon the heritage of a dog or of a trotting-horse and consider the exploit of a ancestor to guarantee a innate and personal excellence for to she all former glory be less a jewel than a touchstone and with she portion of it daily she appraise she own do and without vain speech and she high past she value now in chief as fit foundation of that edifice whereon she labor day by day and with augment stroke \* \* \* \* \* and yet -- it may be he will serve you better but oh it be not possible that he should love you more than i say colonel musgrave of matocton the man be destine to remember that utterance -- and with the recollection to laugh not altogether in either scorn or merriment part four - appreciation you have choose and i cry content thereto and cry you pardon also and be reprove in that i take you for a woman i love odd century ago and would undo that curious error nay you eye be blue you speech be gracious but you be not she and i be older -- and change how utterly -- i be no longer i you be not you time destine as we think but to befriend and guerdon love like ours find you beset with joy and grief i neither share nor mend who be a stranger and we two be meet nor wholly glad nor sorry and the end of too much laughter be a faint regret re townsend _ sonnet for elena _ i next morning rudolph musgrave find the world no longer a impassion place but simply a familiar habitation -- no longer the wrestling-ground of big emotion indeed but undoubtedly a spot whatever be its other pretension to praise wherein one be at home he breakfast on ham and egg in a state of tolerable equanimity and mildly wonder at himself for do it the colonel be deep in a heraldic design and be whistle through he tooth when patricium come into the library he look up with the outline of a frown vanish like penciling under the india-rubber of professional courtesy -- for he be denote _ or _ at the moment which be fussy work as it consist exclusively of dot then he chair scrape audibly upon the floor as he push it from he it occur to rudolph musgrave after a interval that he be still half-way between sit and stand and that he mouth be open he could hear a huckster outside on regi avenue the colonel never forget the man be cry fresh orange he kiss I olaf yes i let he kiss I even after he have ask I if he could no sensible girl would ever do that of course and then i know -- patricium be horribly frightened and afterwards the jackass-fool make matter worse by call I ` he darling ' there be no more hateful word in the english language than ` darling ' it sound like castor-oil taste or a snail look after you have put salt on he the colonel deliberate this information and he appear to understand so parkinson have go the way of pevensey -- and of i wonder how many other well may heaven be very gracious to we both he say for i be go to do it then composedly he take up the telephone upon he desk and call roger stapylton i want you to come at once to dr rabbet 's -- yes the rectory next door to st luke 's patricium and i be to be marry there in half a hour we be on we way to the city hall to get the license now no she might change she mind again you see i have not the least notion how it happen i do not care then you will have to be rude to he or else not see you only daughter marry kindly permit I to repeat sir that i do not care about that or anything else and for the rest patricium be twenty-one last December the colonel hang up the receiver and now he say we be go to the city hall be you say patricium with courteous interest well my way lie uptown i have to stop in at greenberg 's and get a mustard plaster for the parrot he have he hat by this it be not cool enough for I to need a overcoat be it i think you must be crazy she say sharply of course i be so i be go to marry you let I go -- oh and i have think you be a gentleman -- i fear that at present i be simply masculine he become aware that he hand in grip both she shoulder be hurt the girl come now he continue will you go quietly or will i have to carry you she say and you would too -- she speak in wonder for patricium have glimpse a unguessed rudolph musgrave he hand go under she arm-pit and he lift she like a feather he hold she thus at arm 's length you -- you adorable whirligig he laugh i be a stronger animal than you it would be as easy for I to murder you as it would be for you to kill one of those fly on the window-pane do you quite understand that fact patricium oh but you be a idiot -- in want you my dear please put I down she thoroughly enjoy she helplessness he see it long before he lower she why not so much in that say miss stapylton because inasmuch as i be a woman of superlative charm of course you can not help yourself but how do you know that dr rabbet may not be somewhere else harry a defenseless barkeeper or superintend the making of dress-shirt protector for the hottentot or do something else clerical when we get to the rectory after a irrelevant interlude she stamp she foot i do not care what you say i will not marry a atheist if you have the least respect for he cloth olaf you would call he up and arrange -- oh well whatever you want to arrange -- and permit I to powder my nose without be bother because i do not want people to think you be marry a second help to butter and i never do like that baptist man on the block above anyhow and besides say patricium as with the occurrence of a new view-point think what a delicious scandal it will create ii patricium speak the truth by supper-time lichfield have so industriously embroider the stapylton dinner and the ensue marriage with hypothesis and explanation and unparented rumor that none of the participant in the affair but could advantageously have exchange reputation with benedict arnold or lucretium borgium have lichfield believe a tithe of what lichfield be repeat a duel be of course anticipate between mr parkinson and colonel musgrave and the colonel indeed offer through major wadleigh any satisfaction which mr parkinson might desire the engineer with garnishment of profanity consider duel to be a painstakingly-described absurdity and wish the old popinjay joy of he bargain lichfield feel that only show what come of treat poor-white trash as you equal and glory in the salutary moral iii meanwhile the two originator of so much lichfieldian diversion be not unhappy but indeed it be irreverent even to try to express the happiness of they earlier married life they be a ill-matched couple in so many way that no long-headed person could conceivably have anticipate -- in the outcome -- more than decorous tolerance of each other for apart from the disparity in age and taste and rear there be always the fact to be weigh that in marry the only child of a wealthy man rudolph musgrave be make what lichfield call a eminently sensible match -- than which as lichfield know there be no more infallible recipe for discord in this case the axiom seem after the manner of all general rule to bulwark itself with a exception colonel musgrave continue to emanate a air of contentment which fall perilously short of fatuity and that patricium be honestly fond of he be evident to the most impecunious of lichfield 's bachelor true curtain have be lift a little by a little patricium could hardly have tell you at what exact moment it be that she discover miss agatha -- who continue of course to live with they -- be a dipsomaniac very certainly rudolph musgrave be not patricium 's informant it be doubtful if the colonel ever concede he sister 's infirmity in he most private meditation so that patricium find the cause of miss agatha 's attack to be a open secret of which everyone in the house seem aware and of which by tacit agreement nobody ever speak it bewilder patricium at first to find that as concerned lichfield at large any over-indulgence in alcohol by a member of the musgrave family be satisfactorily account for by the matter-of-course statement that the musgrave usually drink -- just as the allardyce notoriously perpetuate the taint of insanity and the townsend be proverbially unable to let woman alone and the vartrey be deplorably prone to dabble in literature these thing have be for a long while just as they be to-day and therefore -lrb- lichfield estimate -rrb- they must be reasonable then too patricium would have prefer to have be rid of the old mulatto woman virginium because it be through virginium that miss agatha furtively procure intoxicant but rudolph musgrave would not consider virginium 's leave virginium 's faithfulness have be prove by too many year of faithful service be the formulum with which he dismiss the suggestion afterward patricium learn from miss agatha of the wrong that have be do virginium by olaf 's uncle senator edward musgrave the note ante-bellum orator and understand that olaf -- without of course concede it to himself because that be olaf 's way -- be try to make reparation patricium respect the sentiment and continue to fret under its manifestation miss agatha also tell patricium of how the son of virginium and senator musgrave have come to a disastrous end -- lynch in texa i believe only it may not have be texa and indeed when i come to think of it i do not believe it be because i know we first hear of it on a Monday and virginia could not do the wash that week and i have to send it out and for the usual crime of course it simply show you how much better off the darky be before the war miss agatha say patricium refrain from comment not be willing to consider the deduction strain for love be a contagious infection and loving rudolph musgrave so much patricium must perforce love any person whom he love as conscientiously as she would have strangle any person with whom he have flirt and yet to patricia it be begin to seem that patricium musgrave be not live altogether in that lichfield which john charteri have make immortal -- that nursery of free principle -lrb- accord to the _ lichfield courier-herald _ -rrb- wherein so many statesman lieutenants-general and orator be train to further the faith of they father to thrill the listen senate draft constitution and bruise the paw of the british lion iv it may be remember that lichfield have ask long ago but who pray be the stapylton it be characteristic of colonel musgrave that he go about answer the question without delay the stapleton -- for stapylton be a happy innovation of roger stapylton 's dead wife -- the colonel know to have be farmer in brummell county and brummell courthouse be within a hour 's ride by rail of lichfield so he set about he labor of love and in it he excel himself the record of brummell date back to 1750 and be voluminous but rudolph musgrave do not overlook a item in any will book or in any order of the court that pertain however remotely to the stapleton then he renew he labor at the courthouse of the older county from which brummell be form in 1750 and through many fragmentary evil-odored and unindexed volume indefatigably pursue the family 's fortune back to the immigration of its american progenitor in 1619 -- and by the happiest fatality upon the same _ bona nova _ which enable the first american musgrave to grace the colony of virginium with he presence it could no longer be say that the wife of a musgrave of matocton lack a authentic and tolerably ancient pedigree the colonel make a book of he stapyltonian research which he vaingloriously proclaim to be the stupidest reading within the ample field of uninteresting print english patricium be allow to see no word of it until the first ten copy have come from the printer 's very splendid in green art-vellum and stamp with the stapylton coat-of-arm in gold she read the book it be perfectly superb be she verdict it be as dear as remembered kiss after death and as sweet as a plaintiff in a breach-of-promise suit only i would have prefer it serve with a few king and duke for parsley the stapleton do not seem to have be anything but perfectly respectable mediocrity the colonel smile at the bottom of he heart he share patricium 's regret that the stapylton pedigree be unadorned by a potentate because nobody can stay unimpressed by a popular superstition however crass the thing may be but for all this a appraisal of himself and he own achievement profusely show high lineage be not invariably a guarantee of excellence and so he smile and say : there be two end to every stick it be the stapleton and other of they sort rather than any soft-handed musgrave who convert a wilderness a little by a little into the america of to-day the task be tediously achieve and without ostentation and always the ship have its resplendent figure-head as always it have its hidden nay grimy engine which propel the ship and however direfully america may differ from utopia to have assist in the making of america be no mean distinction we musgrave and we peer i sometimes think may possibly have be just gaudy autumn leave which happen to lie in the path of a high wind and to cut a gallant figure in such circumstance do not necessarily prove the performer to be a _ rara avi _ even though he ride the whirlwind quite as splendidly as any bird existent patricium flutter and as lightly and irresponsibly as a wren might have do perch on he knee no there be really something in heredity after all now you be a musgrave in every vein of you it always seem like a sort of flippancy for you to appear in public without a stock and a tarnished gilt frame with most of the gilt knock off and a catalogue-number tuck in the corner patricium speak without any regard for punctuation and i be so unlike you i be only a stapylton i do hope you do not mind my be merely a stapylton olaf because if only i be not too modest to even think of allude to the circumstance i would try to tell you about the tiniest fraction of how much a certain ravishingly beautiful half-strainer love you olaf and the consequence would be deplorable my dear -- he begin ouch say patricium you be tickle I you do not shave half as often as you use to do you no nowadays you think you have I safe and do not have to bother about be attractive if i have a music-box i could put you face into it and play all sort of tune only i prefer to look at it you be a slattern and a jay-bird and a joy forever and besides the first stapleton seem to have blunder somehow into the house of burgess so that entitle I to be a colonial dame on my father 's side too do not it olaf the colonel laugh madam vanity say he i repeat that to be descend of a line of czar or from a house of emperor be at the worst a empty braggartism or at best -- upon the plea of heredity -- a handy palliation for iniquity and to be descend of sturdy and honest and clean-blooded folk be beyond doubt preferable since upon quite similar grounds it entitle one to hope that even now ` when they generation be go when they play be over when they panorama be withdraw in tatters from the stage of the world ' there may yet survive of they ` some few action worth remember and a few child who have retain some happy stamp from the disposition of they parent ' patricium -- with eye widen in admiration at he rhetoric -- have turn a entice shade of pink i be glad of that she say she snuggle so close he could not see she face now she be to all appearance attempt to twist the top-button from he coat i be very glad that it entitle one to hope -- about the child -- because -- the colonel lift she a little from he he do not say anything but he be regard she half in wonder and one-half in worship she too be silent presently she nod he kiss she as one do a very holy relic it be a moment to look back upon always there be no period in rudolph musgrave 's life when he could not look back upon this instant and exult because it have be he \* \* \* \* \* only patricium find out afterward with a inexplicable disappointment that she husband have not be talk extempore but be freely quote he compiler 's foreword just as it figure in the print book one judge this posturing so inevitable of detection to have be as significant of much in rudolph musgrave as be the fact of its belated discovery characteristic of patricium yet she have read this book about she family from purely normal motive : first to make certain how old she various cousin be secondly to gloat over any trace of distinction such as she ancestry afford thirdly to note with what exaggerate importance the text seem to accredit those relative she do not esteem and mentally to annotate each page with unprintable event which _ everybody _ know about and fourthly to reflect as with a gush of steadily augment love how dear and how unpractical it be of olaf to have concoct these date-bristling page -- so staunch and blind in he misguided gratitude toward those otherwise uninteresting people who have render possible the existence of a patricium v matter go badly with patricium in the ensue month she mother 's blood tell here as colonel musgrave see with disquietude he know the woman of he race have by ordinary be unfit for childbearing indeed the daughter of this famous house have long in a grim routine perish just as patricium 's mother have do in they first maternal essay there be many hideous history the colonel could have tell you of unmeet to be set down and he be familiar with this talk of pelvic anomaly which be congenital but he have never think of patricium till this as be he kinswoman and in part a musgrave and even now the stapylton blood that be in she pull patricium through long week of anguish surgeon deal with she very horribly in a famed northern hospital whither she have be remove by she obdurate request -- and secretly to he own preference since it be never in he power to meet discomfort willingly -- colonel musgrave have remain in lichfield patricium know that officious people would tell he she life could be save only by the destruction of a unborn boy she never question she child would be a boy she know that olaf want a boy oh even more than he do I daddy and so he must not know you see until it be all over because olaf be such a ill-informed person that he really believe he prefer I pat she father inconsequently say i be proud of you and -- and by god if i _ want _ to cry i guess i be old enough to know my own mind and i 'll help you in this if you 'll only promise not to die in spite of what these damn ' doctor say because you be _ mine _ pat and so you realize a bargain be a bargain yes -- i be really yours daddy it be just my crazy body that be a musgrave patricium explain the real I be a unfortunate stapylton who have somehow get lock up in the wrong house it be not a desirable residence you know daddy no modern improvement for instance but i have to live in it still i have not the least intention of die and i solemnly promise that i will not so these two hoodwink rudolph musgrave and bring it about by subterfuge that he child be bear at most he vaguely understand that patricium be have rather a hard time of it and steadfastly drug this knowledge by the performance of triviality he be eat a cucumber sandwich at the moment young roger musgrave come into the world and by that action very nearly accomplish patricium 's death vi and the god curse roger stapylton with such a pride in and so great a love for he only grandson that the old man could hardly bear to be out of the infant 's presence he be frequently in lichfield nowadays and he renew he demand that rudolph musgrave give up the exhaustively-particularized librarianship so that the little coot would be remove to new york and all three of they be with roger stapylton always patricium have not be well since little roger 's birth it be a peaked and shrewish patricium rather than rudolph musgrave who fight out the long and obstinate battle with roger stapylton she be jealous at the bottom of she heart she would not have anyone not even she father be too fond of what be preëminently hers the world at large include rudolph musgrave be at liberty to adore she boy as be perfectly natural but not to meddle : and in fine patricium be both hysterical and vixenish whenever a give up of the library work be suggest the old man do not quarrel with she and with roger stapylton 's loneliness in these day and the long thought it breed we have nothing here to do but when he die stricken without warn some five year after patricium 's marriage he will be discover to bequeath practically he entire fortune to little roger musgrave when the child should come of age and to rudolph musgrave as patricium 's husband what be a reasonable income when judge by lichfield 's unexacting standard rather than by patricium 's anticipation in a word patricium find that she and the colonel could for the future count upon a little more than half of the income she have previously be allow by roger stapylton it be not fair she say it be monstrous and all because you be so obstinate about you picayune library patricium -- he begin oh i tell you it be absurd olaf the money logically ought to have be leave to I and here i will have to come to you for every penny of _ my _ money and heaven know i have have to scrimp enough to support we all on what i use to have -- olaf patricium say in another voice olaf why what be it dear i be reflect say colonel musgrave that as you justly observe both agatha and i have be practically indebted to you for we support these past five year -- vii it must be enregister not to the man 's credit but rather as a simple fact that it be never within colonel musgrave 's power to forget the incident immediately record he forgive when patricium weep see how leaden-colored he handsome face have turn he forgive as promptly and as freely as he be learn to pardon the tell of a serviceable lie or the perpetration of a occasional barbarism in speech by patricium for he a musgrave of matocton have marry a stapylton he have begin to comprehend that they standard be different and that some daily conflict between these standard be inevitable and besides as it have be veraciously observe the truth of a insult be the barb which prevent its retraction patricium speak the truth : rudolph musgrave and all those rationally reliant upon rudolph musgrave for support have live for some five year upon the money which they owe to patricium he see about he other scion of old family who accept such circumstance blithely : but he say he be a musgrave of matocton and he reflect in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed be necessarily very unhappy he do not mean to touch a penny of such money as roger stapylton have bequeath to he for the colonel consider -- now -- it be a man 's duty personally to support he wife and child and sister and he vigorously attempt to discharge this obligation alike by virtue of he salary at the library and by spasmodic raid upon he tiny capital and -- chief of all -- by speculation in the stock market oddly enough he venture be through a long while -- for the most part -- successful here he build a desperate edifice whose foundation be he social talent and it be with quaint self-abhorrence he often note how the tell of a smutty jest or the insistence upon a manifestly superfluous glass of wine have purchase from some properly tickle magnate a much desiderated tip and presently these tip mislead he so the colonel borrow from patricium 's account and on this occasion he guess correctly and then he stumble upon such a chance for reinvestment as do not often arrive and so he borrow a trifle more in common justice to patricium viii when those then famous warrior colonel gaynor and captain green be obstinately fight extradition in quebec when in washington the senate be wording a suitable resolution wherewith to congratulate cuba upon that island 's brand-new independence and when monsieur fitzsimmon and jeffry be make amicable arrangement in san francisco to fight for the world 's championship : -- at this remote time in chicago -lrb- on the same day indeed that in this very city mr se gross be legally declare the author of a play call cyrano de bergerac -rrb- the son of the colonial governor open they tenth biennial convention you may depend upon it that colonel rudolph musgrave represent the lichfield chapter it be two day later the telegram arrive it read : _ agatha very ill come to I roger in perfect health _ patricium he note how with stapyltonian thrift patricium telegraph ten word precisely and when he have reach home late in the evening the colonel not have take he bunch of key with he lay down he dress-suit case on the dark porch and reach out one hand to the door-bell he find it muffle with some flimsy gritty fabric he do not ring upon the porch be a rustic bench he sit upon it for a quarter of a hour -- precisely where he have first talk with agatha about patricium 's first come to lichfield once the door of a house across the street be open with a widen gush of amber light wherein he see three woman fitting wrap about they one of they be adjust a lace scarf above she hair no we be not a _ bit _ afraid -- just around the corner you know -- _ such _ a pleasant evening -- they voice carry far in the still night rudolph musgrave be not thinking of anything presently he go around through the side entrance and thus come into the kitchen where the old mulattress virginium be sit alone the room be very hot in agatha 's time supper would have be cook upon the gas-range in the cellar he reflect virginium have rise and make as though to take he dress-suit case she pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as a idol 's no -- do not bother virginium say colonel musgrave he meet patricium in the dining-room on she way to the kitchen she have not choose -- as even the most sensible of we will instinctively decline to do -- to vex the quiet of a house wherein death be by ring a bell hold he hand in hers fondle it as she talk patricium tell how three night before miss agatha have be queer you know at supper patricium have not like to leave she but it be the night of the woman 's club 's second whist tournament and virginium have promise to watch miss agatha and anyhow miss agatha have go to bed before patricium leave the house and _ anybody _ would have think she be go to sleep all night and in fine patricium 's return at a drizzle half-past eleven have find miss agatha sit in the garden in she night-dress only weep over fancied grievance -- and virginium asleep in the kitchen and agatha have die that afternoon of pneumonia even in the last half-stupor she be ask always when would rudolph come patricium tell he rudolph musgrave do not say anything without any apparent emotion he put patricium aside much as he do the dress-suit case which he have forget to lay down until patricium have end she recital he go upstairs -- to the front room patricium 's bedroom patricium follow he agatha 's body lay upon the bed with a sheet over all the undertaker 's skill have arrange everything with smug and horrible tranquillity rudolph musgrave remembered he be forty-six year old and when in all these year have there be a moment when agatha -- the real agatha -- have not know that what he have do be self-evidently correct because otherwise rudolph would not have do it i trust you enjoy you whist-game patricium well i could not help it i be not run a sanitarium i be not responsible for she eternal drinking the word skip out of either mouth like gleeful little devil then both be afraid and both be as icily tranquil as the thing upon the bed you could not hear anything except the clock upon the mantel colonel musgrave go to the mantel open the clock and with a odd deliberation remove the pendulum from its hook follow one metallic gasp as of indignation and then silence he speak still stare at the clock he back turn to patricia you must be utterly worn out you have better go to bed he shift by the fraction of a inch the old-fashioned hand-colored daguerreotype of he father in confederate uniform please do not wear that black dress again it be no cause for mourn that we be rid of a encumbrance behind he very far away it seem he hear patricium wail olaf -- colonel musgrave turn without any haste please go he say and appear to plead with she you must be frightfully tired i be sorry that i be not here i seem always to evade my responsibility somehow -- then he begin to laugh it _ be _ rather amusing after all agatha be the most noble person i have ever know the -- this habit of hers to which you have allude be not a part of she and i love agatha and i suppose loving be not altogether dependent upon logic in any event i love agatha and when i come back to she i have come home somehow -- wherever she might be at the time that have be true oh ever since i can remember -- he touch the dead hand now please go he say and he do not look toward patricium for agatha love I better than she do god you know the curse be bear in she she have to pay for what those dead soft-handed musgrave do that be why she hand be so cold now she have to pay for the privilege of be a musgrave you see but then we can not always pick and choose as to what we prefer to be oh yes of course it be all my fault everything be my fault but god know what would have become of you and you agatha if it have not be for I oh oh patricium wail i be a child and i have not any better sense and i marry you and you have be live off my money ever since there have not be a christmas present or a funeral wreath buy in this house since i come into it i do not pick out and pay for out of my own pocket and all the thanks i get for it be this perpetual fault-finding and i wish i be dead like this poor saint here she spend she life slave for you and what thanks do she get for it oh you ought to go down on you knee rudolph musgrave -- please leave he say i will leave when i feel like it and not a single minute before and you might just as well understand as much you _ have _ be live off my money oh you need not go to the trouble of lie and she do too and she hate I she always hate I because i have be fool enough to marry you and she carry on like a lunatic more than half the time and i always pretend not to notice it and this be my reward for try to behave like a lady patricium toss she head yes and you need not look at I as if i be some sort of a bug you have not ever see before and do not approve of because i have see you try that high-and-mighty trick too often for it to work with I patricium stand now beneath the stuart portrait of young gerald musgrave she have insist long ago that it be hang in she own bedroom -- because it be through that beautiful boy we first get really acquaint olaf the boy smile at you from the canvas smile ambiguously as the colonel now note i think you have better go say colonel musgrave please go patricium before i murder you she see that he be speak in perfect earnest ix rudolph musgrave sit all night beside the body he have decline to speak with innumerable sympathetic cousin -- vartrey and fenton and allardyce and musgrave to the fifth and sixth remove -- who have come from all quarter with visiting-card and low-voiced request to be inform if there be anything we can possibly do rudolph musgrave sit all night beside the body he have not any strength for anger now and hardly for grief agatha have be he charge and the fact that he have never pluck up courage to allude to she practise be now a enormity in which he could not quite believe he cowardice and its fruitage confront he and frighten he into a panic frenzy of remorse agatha have be he charge and he have entrust the stewardship to patricium between they -- that patricium might have she card-game that he might sit upon a platform for a hour or two with a half-dozen other pompous fool -- they have let agatha die there be no mercy in he for patricium or for himself he wish patricium have be a man have any man -- a emperor or a coal-heaver it would not have matter -- speak as patricium have do within the moment here within arm 's reach of the poor flesh that have be agatha 's rudolph musgrave would have know he duty but accord to he code it be not permit to be discourteous to a woman he catch himself with grotesque meanness wish that agatha have be there -- privileged by she sex where he be fetter -- she who be so generous of heart and so fiery of tongue at need and comprehension that agatha would never abet or adore he any more smite he anew \* \* \* \* \* and chance reserve for he more poignant torture next day while rudolph musgrave be make out the list of honorary pall-bearer the postman bring a letter which have be forward from chicago it be from agatha write upon the morning of that day wherein later she have be as patricium phrase it queer you know he find it wildly droll to puzzle out those cross four sheet of triviality write in a italian hand so minute and orderly that the finish page suggest a fly-screen he have so often remonstrate with agatha about she penuriousness as concerned stationery selina brice & the rev would henry anstruther who now have a church in seattle have announce they engagement stanley haggage have go to alabama to marry leonora bright who move from here a year ago they be both as poor as church mouse & i think marriage in such a case a unwise step for anyone it bring care & anxiety enough any way without start out with poverty to increase and render deeper every trouble such be the tenor of agatha 's last letter of the last self-expression of that effigy upstairs who -lrb- you could see -rrb- know everything and be not discontent here the dead speak omniscient and tell you that stanley haggage have go to alabama and that marriage bring new care and anxiety i can not laugh say rudolph musgrave aloud i know the jest deserve it but i can not laugh because my upper lip seem to be make of leather and i can not move it and besides i love agatha to a degree which only you and i have ever know of she never understand quite how i love she oh will not you make she understand just how i love she for agatha be dead because you want she to be dead and i have never tell she how much i love she and now i can not ever tell she how much i love she oh will not you please show I that you have make she understand or else have I strike by lightning or do _ anything _ nothing be do x and afterward rudolph musgrave and he wife meet amicably and without reference to they last talk patricium wear black-and-white for some six month and colonel musgrave accept the compromise tacitly all pass with perfect smoothness between they and anyone in lichfield would have tell you that the musgrave be a model couple she call he rudolph now olaf be such a silly-sounding nickname for two old married people you know patricium estimate the colonel negligently say that he suppose it do sound odd only i do not think clarice pendomer would care about come he resume -- for the two be discuss a uncompleted list of the people patricium be to invite to they first house-party and for heaven 's sake why not we always have she to everything he could not tell she it be because the charterise be to be among they guest so he say : oh well -- mr cb pendomer then -- patricium write the name with a flourish oh you jay-bird i be not jealous everybody know you never have any more moral than a tom-cat on the back fence it be a lucky thing the boy do not take after you be not it he do not not a bit no harry pendomer be the puniest black-haired little wretch whereas you other son sir resemble he mother and be in consequence a ravishingly beautiful person of superlative charm -- he be stare at she so oddly that she pause so patricium be familiar with that old scandal which link he name with clarice pendomer 's he be wonder if patricium have marry he in the belief that she be marry a man who appraise by any standard have act infamously i be only think you have better ask judge allardyce patricium you see he be absolutely certain not to come -- \* \* \* \* \* this year the musgrave have decide not to spend the spring alone together at matocton as they have do the four precede year it look so silly as patricium point out and besides a house-party be the most economical method -- as she also point out be bear a stapylton -- of pay off you social obligation because you can always ask so many people who you know have make other plan and can not accept \* \* \* \* \* so we will invite judge allardyce of course say patricium i have forget he court meet in June oh and peter blagden too it have slip my mind he uncle be dead i learn this morning mr haggage be to lecture in louisville on the sixteenth she be read up in the library you see -- rudolph you be the lodestar of my existence i will ask she to come on the fourteenth and spend a week i never could abide the hag but she have such a -- there i have make a big blot right in the middle of ` darling ' and spoil a perfectly good sheet of paper you would better mail it at once though because the evening-paper may have something in it about she lecture xi rudolph -- why -- er -- yes dear this be after supper and patricium be play solitaire she husband be read the paper agatha tell I all about virginium you know -- here colonel musgrave frown it be not a pleasant topic you jay-bird you behave entirely too much as if you be my grandfather as i be say agatha tell I all about you uncle and virginium patricium hurry on and how she run away afterwards and hide in the wood for three day and come to you father 's plantation and how you father buy she and how she son be bear and how she son be lynch -- now really patricium surely there be other matter which may be more profitably discuss of course now for instance why be the king of heart the only one that have not a moustache patricium peep to see what card lay beneath that monarch and upon reflection move the king of spade into the vacant space she be a devotee of solitaire and invariably cheat at it she go on absently : but do not you see that color boy be you own first cousin and he be kill for do exactly what he father have do only they send the father to the senate and give he column of flubdub and lay he out in state when he die -- and they pour kerosene upon the son and burn he alive and i believe virginium think that be not fair what do you mean i honestly believe virginium hate the musgrave she be only a negro of course but then she be a mother once -- oh yes all i need be a black eight -- patricium demand now look at you brother hector -- the awfully dissipate one that die of a overdose of opiate when it happen be not virginia take care of he of course she be a invaluable nurse and nobody else be here when agatha go out into the rain now what if she have just let agatha go without try to stop she it would have be perfectly simple so be this all i have to do be to take they off now colonel musgrave negligently return to he perusal of the afternoon paper you be suggest -- if you will overlook my frankness -- the most deplorable sort of nonsense patricium i know exactly how balaam feel she say irrelevantly and fall to shuffling the card you do not and you will not understand that virginium be a human be in any event i wish you would get rid of she i could not decently do that say rudolph musgrave with careful patience virginium 's faithfulness have be prove by too many year of faithful service nothing more strikingly attest the folly of free the negro than the unwillingness of the better class of slave to leave they former owner -- now you be go to quote a paragraph or so from you gracious era as if i have not read everything you ever write you be a fearful humbug in some way rudolph and you be a red-headed rattlepate madam but seriously patricium you who be rear in the north be strangely unwilling to concede that we of the south be after all best qualify to deal with the negro problem we know the negro as you can not ever know he you oh god ha ' mercy on we mock patricium there be not any negro problem hereabouts you beautiful idiot so long as there be any negro why to-day there be hardly one full-blooded negro in lichfield there be only a thousand or so of mulatto who share the blood of people like you uncle edward and for the most part they take after they white kin unfortunately and there you have the lichfield negro problem in a nutshell it be a venerable one and fully set forth in the bible you need not attempt to argue with I because you be a ninnyhammer and i be a second nestor the holy scripture be perfectly explicit as to what happen to the head of the child and they tooth too i wish you would not jest about such matter -- because it be not lady-like but rudolph you know perfectly well that i be not a lady my dear he cry in horror that be real and what on earth have i say even to suggest -- oh not a syllable it be not at all the sort of thing that you sort _ say _ and i be not you sort i do not know that i altogether wish i be but _ if _ i be it would certainly make thing easier patricium add sharply my dear -- he again protest now candidly rudolph -- relinquish the game she fall to shuffling the card -- just count up the number of time this month that my -- oh well i really do not know what to call it except my deplorable omission in fail to be bear a lady -- have seem to you to yank the very last rag off the gooseberry-bush he scoff what nonsense although of course patricium -- she nod mischief in she brightly-colored tiny face yes that be just you attitude you beautiful idiot -- although of course -- now quite honestly patricium i have occasionally wish that you would not speak of sacred and -- er physical and sociological matter in exactly the tone in which -- well in which you sometimes do speak of they it may sound old-fashioned but i have always believe that decency be quite as important in mental affair as it be in physical one and that as a consequence a gentlewoman should always clothe she thought with at least the same care she accord she body oh do not misunderstand I of course it do not do any harm my dear between we but outside -- you see for people to know that you think about such thing must necessarily give they a false opinion of you patricia meditate she say with utter solemnity anathema maranatha oh hell to damn may the nose of all respectable people be turn upside down and jackass dance eternally upon they grandmother ' grave patricium -- cry a shocked colonel i mean every syllable of it no rudolph _ i _ can not help it if the vinaigretted beauty of you boyhood be unabridged dictionary of prudery you see i know almost all the swearword there be and i read the newspaper and medical book and even the thing that boy chalk up on fence in consequence i be not a bit whiteminded because if you use you mind at all it get more or less dingy just like use anything else he could not help but laugh much as he disapprove patricium flutter and as a wren might have do perched presently upon he knee rudolph can not you laugh more often and not devote so much time to trace out the genealogy of those silly people and be so tediously beautiful and good she ask and with a hint of seriousness rudolph you do not know how i would adore you if you would rob a church or cut somebody 's throat in a alley and tell I all about it because you know i would not betray you you be so infernally respectable in everything you do how do you come to bully I that day at the library it seem almost as if those two be different people do not it rudolph my dear the colonel say whimsically i be afraid we be rather like the shepherdess and the chimney-sweep of the fable i read you very long ago we climb up so far that we could see the star once very long ago patricium and we have come back to live upon the parlor table i suppose it happen to all the little china people she take he meaning each be aware of a odd sense of intimacy everything we have to be glad for now rudolph be the rivet in grandfather 's neck it be rather a fiasco be not it eh there be all sort of rivet patricium and the thing one can not do because one be what one be need not be necessarily a cause for grief xii it be excellent to see jack charteri again as colonel musgrave do within a few day of this musgrave be unreasonably fond of the novelist and frankly confess it would be as preposterous to connect charteri with any of the accept standard of morality as it would be to judge a artesian-well from the standpoint of ethic anne be not yet in lichfield she have break the journey to visit a maternal grand-aunt and some virginia cousin in richmond charteri explain and be to come thence to matocton and so you have acquire a boy and by my soul a very handsome wife rudolph it be sufficiently notorious say colonel musgrave yes we be quite absurdly happy he laugh and add : patricium -- but you do not know she droll way of put thing -- say that the only rational complaint i can advance against she be she habit of rush into a hospital every month or so and have a section or two of she person remove by surgeon it worry I -- only of course it be not the sort of thing you can talk about and as patricium say it _ be _ a unpleasant thing to realize that you wife be not leave you through the ordinary channel of death or of type-written decree of the court but only in vulgar fraction as it be -- please do not be quite so brutal rudolph it be not become in a musgrave of matocton to speak of woman in any tone other than the most honeyed accent of chivalry oh i be only quote patricium the colonel largely say and -- er -- jack he continue by the way jack clarice pendomer will be at matocton -- i rejoice in she good luck say charteri equably -- and -- well i be wonder -- i can assure you that there will be no -- trouble that skeleton be safely lock in its closet and the key to that closet be miss -- more thanks to you you act very nobly in the whole affair rudolph i wish i could do thing like that as it be of course i shall always detest you for have be able to do it charteri say thereafter : i shall always envy you though rudolph no other man i know have ever attain the good old troubadourish ideal of _ domneus _ -- that love which rather abhor than otherwise the notion of possess its object i still believe it be a distinct relief to a certain military officer whose name we need not mention when anne decide not to marry you the colonel grin a trifle consciously well anne mean youth you comprehend and all the thing we then believe in jack it would have be decidedly difficult to live up to such a contract and -- as it be -- to fulfil every one of the imply specification and yet -- here charteri flick he cigarette -- anne rule in the stead of aline van orden and aline in turn have follow clarice pendomer and before the come of clarice have pauline romeyne whom time have convert into polly ashmeade reign in the land -- do not be a ass the colonel plead and then observe inconsequently : i can not somehow quite realize aline be dead lord lord the letter that i write to she she send they all back you know in genuine romantic fashion after we have quarrel i find those boyish ravings only the other day in my father 's desk at matocton and skim they over i shall read they through some day and appropriately meditate over life 's mystery that be too sad for tear he meditate now it would not be quite equitable jack the colonel sum it up if the aline i loved -- no i do not mean the real woman the one you and all the other people know the one that marry the enterprising brewer and die five year ago -- be not wait for I somewhere i can not express just what i mean but you will understand i know -- that heaven be necessarily run on a mohammedan basis why of course say mr charteri heaven as i apprehend it be a place where we shall live eternally among those lady of old year who never condescend actually to inhabit any realm more tangible than that of we boyish fancy it be the obvious definition and i defy you to evolve a more entice allurement toward become a deacon you romancer be privileged to talk nonsense anywhere the colonel estimate and i suppose that in the lichfield you have make famous jack you have a double right ah but i never write a line concern lichfield i only write about the lichfield whose existence you continue to believe in in spite of the fact that you be actually live in the real lichfield charteri return the vitality of the legend be wonderful he cock he head to one side -- a habitual gesture with charteri -- and the colonel note as he have often do before how extraordinarily reminiscent jack be of a dried-up quizzical black parrot say charteri : i love to serve that legend i love to prattle of ` ole marster ' and ` ole miss ' and throw in a sprinkling of ` mockin ' - bud ' and ` hant ' and ` horg-killing time ' and of sweeping animadversion as to all ` free nigger ' and to narrate how ` de quality use ter cum ' -- you spell it c-u-m because that look so convincingly like dialect -- ` ter de gret hous ' those be the main ingredient and as for the unavoidable love-interest -- charteri pause grin and pleasantly resume : why je arter dat suh a hut yankee cap ` en whar some uv we folk do shoot in de laig wuz lef on de road fer daid -- a quite notorious custom on the part of all northern army -- un young miss have he fotch up ter de gret hous un nuss im same 's he one uv de fambly un dem two je fit un argufy scanlous un never spicion huccum dey 's in love wid each othuh till de war 's ovuh and there you be i need not mention that during the tale 's progress it be necessary to introduce at least one favorable mention of lincoln arrange a duel ` in de low groun ' immediately after day-break and have the family silver inter in the back garden because these point will naturally suggest themselves jack jack the colonel cry it be a ill bird that foul its own nest but believe I i do not at heart say charteri in a queer earnest voice there be a sardonic imp inside I that make I jeer at the commoner trick of the trade -- and yet when i be practise that trade when i be write of those tender-hearted brave and gracious man and woman and of those dear old darky i very often write with tear in my eye i tell you this with careful airiness because it be true and because it would embarrass I so horribly if you believe it then he be off upon another tack and wherein pray have i harm lichfield by imagine a dream city situate half way between atlanti and avalon and people with superhuman person -- and by have call this city lichfield the portrait do not only flatter lichfield it flattered human nature so naturally it pleased everybody yes that i take it be the true secret of romance -- to induce the momentary delusion that humanity be a superhuman race profuse in aspiration and prodigal in the exercise of glorious virtue and stupendous vice as a matter of fact all human passion be depressingly chicken-hearted i find be it not for the police court record i would pessimistically insist that all of we elect to love one person and to hate another with very much the same enthusiasm that we display in express a preference for rare roast beef as compare with the outside slice oh really rudolph you have no notion how salutary it be to the self-esteem of we romanticist to run across even nowadays a occasional breach of the peace for then sometimes -- when the coachman obligingly cut the butler 's throat in the back-alley say -- we actually presume to think for a moment that we profession be almost as honest as that of make counterfeit money the colonel do not interrupt he brief pause of meditation then the novelist say : why no if i be ever really to attempt a tale of lichfield i would not write a romance but a tragedy i think that i would call my tragedy _ futility _ for it would mirror the life of lichfield with unengaging candor and as a consequence people would complain that my tragedy lack sustained interest and that its participant be inconsistent that it have no order plot no startling incident no high endeavor and no especial aim and that it be equally deficient in all time-hallowed provocative of either laughter or tear for very few people would understand that a life such as this when rightly view be the most pathetic tragedy conceivable oh come now jack come recollect that you reasoning power be almost as worthy of employment as you rhetorical ability we be not quite so bad as that you know we may be a little behind the time in lichfield we certainly let well enough alone and we take thing pretty much as they come but we meddle with nobody and after all we do not do any especial harm we do not do anything whatever in especial rudolph that would be precisely the theme of my story of the real lichfield if i be ever bold enough to write it there seem to be a sort of blight upon lichfield oh yes it would be unfair perhaps to contrast it with the bigger southern city like richmond and atlanta and new orlean but even the inhabitant of smaller southern town be begin to buy excursion ticket and thereby ascertain that the twentieth century have really begin yes it be only in lichfield i can detect the raw stuff of a genuine tragedy for depend upon it rudolph the most pathetic tragedy in life be to get nothing in particular out of it but for my part i do not see what you be drive at the colonel stoutly say and charteri only laugh and i hardly expect you to do so rudolph -- or not yet at least part five - souvenir i be contented by remembrance -- dream of dead passion wraith of vanish time fragment of vow and by-end of old rhyme -- flotsam and jetsam tumble in the sea whereon long since put forth we argosy which bent on traffic in the isle of love lie founder somewhere in some firth thereof encradle by eternal silence thus have come to naked bankruptcy let we part friend as thrifty tradesman do when common venture fail for it may be these batter oath and rhyme may yet ring true to some fair woman 's hearing so that she will listen and think of love and i of you f ashcroft wheeler _ revision _ i when the _ reliance _ the _ constitution _ and the _ columbium _ be hold trial race off newport to decide which one of these yacht should defend the _ america 's _ cup when the tone of the japanese press as to russium 's action in manchurium be begin to grow ominous when the jew of america be draft a petition to the czar and when it be rumor that the health of pope leo xiii be commence to fail : -- at this remote time the musgrave give they first house-party and at this period colonel musgrave note and admire the apparent unconcern with which john charteri and clarice pendomer encounter at matocton and at this period colonel musgrave note with approval the intimacy which be obviously flourish between the little novelist and patricium also colonel musgrave have presently good reason to lament a contretemps over which he be sulk when mr pendomer rustle to she seat at the breakfast-table with a shortness of breath that be partly due to the stair and in part attributable to she youthful dress which fit a trifle too perfectly waffle say mr pendomer at my age and weight the first be a experiment and the fifth a amiable indiscretion of which i be invariably guilty sugar please she yawn and reach a generously-proportioned arm toward the sugar-bowl yes that will do pilkin colonel musgrave -- since the remainder of he house-party have already breakfast -- raise he fine eye toward the chandelier and sigh as pilkin demurely close the dining-room door leander pilkin -- butler for a long while now to the musgrave of matocton -- would here if space permit be the subject of a encomium leander pilkin be in lichfield consider to be upon the whole the handsomest man whom lichfield have produce for this quadroon 's skin be like old ivory and he profile would have do credit to a emperor he terrapin be still speak of in lichfield as people in less favored locality speak of the golden age and he mayonnaise -lrb- boast lichfield -rrb- would have compel a olympian to plead for a second help for the rest he deportment in all function of butlership be best describe as super-chesterfieldian and indeed he be generally know to be a byblow of captain beverley musgrave 's who in he day be lichfield 's arbiter as touch the social grace and so no more of pilkin mr pendomer partook of chop be this remorse she query or a convivially induce requirement for bromide at this unearthly hour of the morning it be very often difficult to disentangle the two it be neither say colonel musgrave and almost snappishly follow a interval of silence really say mr pendomer and as with sympathy one would think you have at last be confront with one of you thirty-seven past -- or be it thirty-eight rudolph colonel musgrave frown disapprovingly at she frivolity he swallow he coffee and butter a superfluous potato h be say he then you know i know sigh she that a sleep past frequently suffer from insomnia and in that case say he darkly it be not the only sufferer mr pendomer consider the attraction of a third waffle -- a mellow blending of autumnal yellow fringe with a crisp and irresistible brown that for the moment put to flight all dream and vision of slenderness and patricium she query with a mental hiatus colonel musgrave flush patricium he concede with mingled dignity and sadness be after all still in she twenty -- yes say mr pendomer with a dryness which might mean anything or nothing she _ be _ only twenty-one when she marry you i mean he explain with obvious patience that at she age she -- not unnaturally -- take a immature view of thing she unspoiled purity he add meditatively and innocence and general unsophistication be of course adorable but i can admit to think that for a journey through life they impress I as excess baggage patricium say mr pendomer soothingly have ideal and ideal like a hare-lip or a mission in life should be pity rather than condemn when we friend possess they especially she continue butter she waffle as so many woman have they sandwich between they last attack of measles and they first import complexion no one of the three be lasting rudolph h be say he there be another silence the colonel desperately feel that matter be not advance h be say she with something of interrogation in she voice see here clarice i have know you -- you have not cry she very earnestly not by five year well say for some time you be a sensible woman -- a man mr pendomer lament parenthetically never suspect a woman of discretion until she begin to lose she waist -- and i be sure that i can rely upon you womanly tact and finer instinct -- and that sort of thing you know -- to help I out of a deuce of a mess mr pendomer eat on in a exceedingly noncommittal fashion as he pause inquiringly she have be read some letter say he at length some letter that i write a long time ago in the case of so young a girl observe mr pendomer with perfect comprehension i should have undoubtedly recommend a judicious supervision of she reading-matter she be look through a old escritoire he explain jack charteri have suggest that some of my father 's letter -- during the war you know -- might be of value -- he pause for mr pendomer appear on the verge of a question but she only say so it be mr charteris who suggest patricium 's search the desk ah yes and then -- and it be year ago -- and just the usual sort of thing though it may have seem from the letter -- why i have not give the girl a thought he cry in virtuous indignation until patricium find the letter -- and read they naturally she assent -- yes -- just as i read george 's the smile with which she accompany this remark suggest that both mr pendomer 's correspondence and home life be at time of a interesting nature i have destroy the envelope when she return they continue colonel musgrave with morose confusion of person patricium do not even know who the girl be -- she name somehow be not mention ` woman of my heart ' -- ` dearest girl in all the world ' quote mr pendomer reminiscently and suchlike tender phrase scatter in with a pepper-cruet after the rough copy be make in pencil and date just ` Wednesday ' or ` Thursday ' of course ah you be always very careful rudolph she sigh and now that make it all the worse because -- as far as all the evidence go -- these letter may have be return yesterday why -- colonel musgrave pull up short hardly see he way clear through the indignant period on which he have enter i decline say he somewhat lamely to discuss the matter with she in she present excited and perfectly unreasonable condition mr pendomer 's pencil eyebrow rise and she lip -- which be quite as red as there be any necessity for they be -- twitched hysteric she ask worse groan colonel musgrave patient resignation under unmerited affliction he have pick up a teaspoon and he carefully balance it upon he forefinger there be certain phrase in these letter which be somehow repeat in certain letter i write to patricia the summer we be engage and -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- she do not like it mr pendomer smile as though she consider this not improbable and he continue with grow embarrassment and indignation : she say there must have be other -- mr pendomer 's smile grow reminiscent -- any number of other that she be only a incident in my life er -- as you have mention patricium have certain notion -- northern idiocy about the awfulness of a young fellow 's sowing he wild oats which you and i know perfectly well he be go to do anyhow if he be worth he salt but she do not know it poor little girl so she will not listen to reason and she will not come downstairs -- which lament rudolph musgrave plaintively be particularly awkward in a house-party he drum he finger for a moment on the table it be he sum up a combination of ibsen and hysteric and of -- er rather declamatory observation concern there be one law for the man and another for the woman and patricium 's realization of the mistake we both make -- and all that sort of nonsense you know exactly as if i give you my word she be one of those woman who want to vote the colonel patently consider that feminine outrageousness could go no farther and she be take menthol and green tea and mustard plaster and i do not know what all in bed prior to -- to -- take leave mr pendomer suggest er -- that be mention i believe say colonel musgrave but of course she be only talk mr pendomer look about she and without the clean-shaven lawn and trim box-hedge be very beautiful in the morning sunlight within the same sunlight sparkle over the heavy breakfast service and gleam in the high walnut panel of the breakfast-room she view the comfortable appointment about she a little wistfully for mr pendomer 's purse be not over-full of course say she as in meditation there be the money yes say rudolph musgrave slowly there be the money he spring to he foot and draw himself erect here be a moment he must give its full dramatic value oh no clarice my marriage may have be a eminently sensible one but i love my wife oh believe I i love she very tenderly poor little patricium i have weather some forty-seven birthday and i have do much as other man do and all that -- there have be flirtation and suchlike and -- er -- some woman have be kinder to I than i deserve but i love she and there have not be a moment since she come into my life i have not love she and be -- he wave he hand now impotently almost theatrically -- sicken at the thought of the other mr pendomer 's foot tap the floor whilst he speak when he have make a end she incline she head toward he thank you say mr pendomer colonel musgrave bit he lip and he flush that say he hastily be different but the difference whatever may have be its nature be seemingly a matter of unimportance to mr pendomer who be in meditation she rest she ample chin on a much-bejeweled hand for a moment and when mr pendomer raise she face she voice be free from affectation you will probably never understand that this particular July day be a crucial point in you life you will probably remember it if you remember it at all simply as that morning when patricium find some girl-or-another 's old letter and behave rather unreasonably about they it be the merest trifle you will think john charteris understand woman better than you do rudolph i need not pretend at this late day to be as clever as jack the colonel say in some bewilderment but why not more succinctly state that the escurial be not a dromedary although there be many fly in france for what on earth have jack to do with crucial point and July morning why i suppose i only make bold to introduce he name for the sake of a illustration rudolph for the last person in the world to realize precisely why any woman do anything be invariably the woman who do it yet there come in every married woman 's existence that time when she realize suddenly that she husband have a past which might be take as in itself a complete and round life -- as a life which have run the gamut of all ordinary human passion and have become familiar with all ordinary human passion a dishearteningly long while before she ever come into that life a woman never realize that of she lover somehow but to know that you husband the father of you child have live for other woman a life in which you have no part and never can have part -- she realize that at one time or another and -- and it sicken she mr pendomer smile as she echo he phrase but she eye be not mirthful ah she hunger for those dead year rudolph and though you devote you whole remain life to she nothing can ever make up for they and she always hate those shadowy woman who have steal they from she a woman never at heart forgive the other woman who have love she husband even though she cease to care for he herself for she remember -- ah you man forget so easily rudolph god have not invent memory when he create adam it be keep for the woman then ensue a pause during which rudolph musgrave smile down upon she irresolutely for he abhor a scene as he vernacular phrase it and to he clarice 's present manner border upon both the scenic and the incomprehensible ah -- you woman he temporize there be a glance from eye whose luster time and irregular living have conspire to dim ah -- you man mr pendomer retort and there we have the tragedy of life in a nutshell silence last for a while the colonel be find this matutinal talk discomfortably opulent in pause rudolph and have it never occur to you that in marry patricium you swindle she and naturally he eyebrow lift because a woman want love well well and do not i love patricium i dare say that you think you do only you have play at loving so long you be really unable to love anybody as a girl have every right to be love in she twenty yes rudolph you be be rather subtly punish for the good time you have have and after all the saddest punishment be something that happen in we not something which happen to we i wish you would not laugh clarice -- i wish i do not have to for i would get far more comfort out of cry and i do not dare to because of my complexion it come in a round pasteboard box nowadays you know rudolph with french mendacity all over the top -- and my eyebrow come in a fat crayon and the healthful glow of my lip come in a little porcelain tub mr pendomer be play with a teaspoon now and a smile hover about the aforementioned lip and yet do you remember rudolph say she that evening at assequin when i wear a blue gown and they be play _ fleur d'amour _ and -- you say -- yes -- there be a effective little catch in he voice -- you be a wonderful girl clarice -- ` my sunshine girl ' i use to call you and blue be always you color it go with you eye so exactly and those big sleeve they wear then -- those tell-tale crushable sleeve -- they suit you slender youthfulness so perfectly ah i remember it as though it be yesterday mr pendomer majestically rise to she foot it be pink and it be at the whitebrier you say -- what you say and -- and you do not deserve anything but what you be get she conclude grimly i -- it be so long ago rudolph musgrave apologize with mingled discomfort and vagueness yes she concede rather sadly it be so long -- oh very long ago for we be young then and we believe in thing and -- and jack charteri have not take a fancy to I -- she sigh and drum she finger on the table but woman have always help and shield you have not they rudolph and now i be go to help you too for you have show I the way you do not deserve it in the least but i 'll do it ii thus it shortly come about that mrs pendomer mount in meditative mood to mr musgrave 's room and that mr pendomer recover she breath enter without knock into a gloom where cologne and menthol and the odor of warm rubber contend for mastery for patricium have decide that she be very ill indeed and be sob softly in bed very calmly mr pendomer open a window let in a flood of fresh air and sunshine very calmly she draw a chair -- a substantial arm-chair -- to the bedside and very calmly she begin : my dear rudolph have tell I of this ridiculous affair and -- oh you equally ridiculous girl she remove with deft finger a damp and clinging bandage from about patricium 's head and pat the back of patricium 's hand placidly patricium be by this time sit erect in bed and she coppery hair be thick about she face which be colorless and altogether she be very rigid and very indignant and very pretty and very very young how dare he tell you -- or anybody else she cry we be such old friend remember mr pendomer plead and rearrange the pillow soothingly about she hostess and i want to talk to you quietly and sensibly patricium sink back among the pillow and inhale the fresh air which in spite of herself she find agreeable i -- somehow i do not feel very sensible she murmur half sulky and half shame-faced mr pendomer hesitate for a moment and then plunge into the heart of thing you be a woman dear she say gently though heaven know it must have be only yesterday you be play about the nursery -- and one of the fact we woman must face eventually be that man be a polygamous animal it be unfortunate perhaps but it be true civilization may veneer the fact but nothing will ever override it not even in these new horseless carriage a man may give he wife the best that be in he -- he love he trust he life 's work -- but it be only the best there be leave we give we heart man dole out theirs as people feed bread to bird with a crumb for everyone he wife have the remnant and the best we woman can do be to remember we be credibly inform that half a loaf be preferable to no bread at all she face sober and she add pensively : we might contrive a better universe we sister woman but this be not permit we so we must take it as it be patricium stir as talk die away i do not believe it say she and she add with emphasis : and anyhow i hate that nasty trollop ah but you do believe it mr pendomer 's voice be insistent you know it year before you go into long frock that knowledge be i suppose a legacy from we mother patricium frown petulantly and then burst into choke sob oh she cry it be damnable some other woman have have what i can never have and i want it so -- that first love that mean everything -- the love he give she when i be only a messy little girl with pig-tail and too many hand and foot oh that -- that hell-cat she be have everything there be a interval during which mr pendomer smile crookedly and patricium continue to sob although at lengthen interval then mr pendomer lift the packet of letter lie on the bed and clear she throat h be say she so this be what cause all the trouble you do not mind and consider silence as equivalent to acquiescence she draw out a letter at hazard and read aloud : ` just a line woman of all the world to tell you but what have i to tell you after all only the old old message so often tell that it seem scarcely worth while to bother the postman about it just three word that innumerable dead lip have whisper while life be yet good and old people be unreasonable and sky be blue -- three word that we unborn child 's child will whisper to one another when we too have go to help the grass in they grow or to nourish the victorious sway host of some field of daffodil just three word -- that be my message to you my lady ah it be weary wait for a sight of you dear face through these long day that be so much alike and all so empty and colorless my heart grow hungry as i think of you great green eye and of the mouth that be like a little wound i want you so o dearest girl in all the world i want you ah time travel very slowly that bring you back to I and meanwhile i can but dream of you and send you impotent scrawl that only vex I with they futility for my desire of you -- ' the remainder say mr pendomer clear she throat once more appear to consist of insanity and heretical sentiment in about equal proportion all write at the top of a boy 's breaking voice it be not colonel musgrave 's voice -- quite -- be it during the reading patricium lean on one elbow have regard she companion with wide eye and flush cheek now you see she cry indignantly he love she he be simply crazy about she why yes mrs pendomer replace the letter carefully almost caressingly among its companion my dear it be year ago i think time have by this wreak a vengeance far more bitter than you could ever plan on the woman who after all never think to wrong you for the bitterest of all bitter thing to a woman -- to some woman at least -- be to grow old she sigh and she well-manicured finger fret for a moment with the counterpane ah who will write the tragedy of we woman who be ` famous southern beauty ' once we be queen of man while we youth last and diarist still prattle charmingly concern we but nothing be expect of we save to be beautiful and to condescend to be make much of and that be we tragedy for very few thing my dear be more pitiable than the middle-age of the pitiful butterfly woman whose mind can not -- can not because of its very nature -- reach to anything higher middle-age strip she of everything -- the admiration the flattery the shallow merriment -- all the little thing that she little mind long for -- and other woman take she place in spite of she futile pitiful effort to remain young and the world go on as before and there be a whispering in the moonlit garden and young people steal off for wholly superfluous glass of water and the man give she duty dance and she be old -- ah so old -- under the rouge and inane smile and dainty frippery that caricature she lost youth no my dear you need not envy this woman pity she my dear plead clarice pendomer and with a note of earnestness in she voice such a woman say patricium with distinctness deserve no pity well mr pendomer concede drily she do not get it probably because she always grow fat from sheer lack of will-power to resist sloth and gluttony -- the only agreeable vice leave she and by no stretch of the imagination can a fat woman be convert into either a pleasing or heroic figure mr pendomer pause for a breathing-space and smile though not very pleasantly it be doubtless say she a sight for god -- and quite certainly for man -- to laugh at this silly woman strive to regain a vanish frugality of waist yes i suppose it be amusing -- but it be also pitiful and it be more pitiful still if she have ever love a man in the unreasoning way these shallow woman sometimes do man age so slowly the man a girl first know be young long after she have reach middle-age -- yes they go on dancing cotillion and talk nonsense in the garden long after she have take to common-sense shoe and the man be still young -- and he care for some other woman who be young and have all that she have lose -- and it seem so unfair say mr pendomer patricium regard she for a moment the purple eye be alert they glance be hard you seem to know all about this woman patricium begin in a level voice i have hear of course what everyone in lichfield whisper about you and rudolph i have even tease rudolph about it but until to-day i have believe it be a lie it be often a mistake to indulge in uncommon opinion say mr pendomer you get more fun and interest out of it i do not deny but the bill my dear be unconscionable so you confess it my dear and who be i to stand aside like a coward and see you make a mountain of this boy-and-girl affair -- a affair which rudolph and i have practically forget -- oh year ago -- until to-day why -- why you _ can not _ be jealous of I mr pendomer conclude half-mockingly patricium regard she with deliberation in the windy sunlight mr pendomer be a well-preserved woman but unmistakably preserved moreover there be a great deal of she and she nose be in need of a judicious application of powder of which there be a superfluity behind she ear be this the siren patricium have dread patricium clearly perceive that whatever have be she husband 's relation with this woman he have be manifestly entrap into the imbroglio -- a victim to mr pendomer 's inordinate love of attention which be indeed tolerably notorious and patricium 's anger against rudolph musgrave give way to a rather contemptuous pity and a half-maternal remorse for not have take better care of he no answer mr pendomer to she unspoken thought no woman could be seriously jealous of I yes i dare say i be _ passée _ and vain and frivolous and -- harmless but she add meditatively you hate I just the same my dear mrs pendomer -- patricium begin with cool courtesy then hesitate yes she concede i dare say it be unreasonable -- but i do hate you like the very old nick why then speak mr pendomer with cheerfulness everything be as it should be she rise and smile i be sorry to say i must be leave matocton to-day the ullwether be very press and i really do not know how to get out of pay they a visit -- so sorry to lose you coo patricium but of course you know best i believe some very good people be visit the ullwether nowadays she extend the letter blandly may i restore you property she query with utmost gentleness thanks clarice pendomer take they and kiss she hostess not without tenderness on the brow my dear be kind to rudolph he -- he be rather a attractive man you know -- and other woman be kind to he we of lichfield have always say that he and jack charteri be the most dangerous man that even lichfield have ever produce -- why do people really find mr charteri particularly attractive patricium demand so quickly and so innocently that mr pendomer could not deny herself the glance of a charlatan who applaud he fellow 's legerdemain and patricium color oh well -- you know how lichfield gossip say mr pendomer iii colonel musgrave have smoke a preposterous number of unsatisfying cigarette on the big front porch of matocton whilst mr pendomer be absent on she mission and on she return flush and triumphant he rise in eloquent silence i have do it rudolph say mr pendomer do what he query blankly restore what my incomprehensible lawyer call the _ status quo _ achieve peace with honor carry off the spoil of war and -- in short -- arrange everything answer mr pendomer and sink into a rustic chair which creak admonishingly and all she add bring a fan into play without a single falsehood _ i _ be not to blame if patricium have jump at the conclusion that these letter be write to I my word say rudolph musgrave you method of restore domestic peace to a distract household be to say the least original he seat himself and light another cigarette oh well patricium be not deaf you know and she have live in lichfield quite a while mr pendomer say abruptly i have half a mind to tell you some of the thing i know about aline van orden please do not say colonel musgrave for i would inevitably beard you on my own porch and smite you to the door-mat and i be hardly young enough for such adventure and poor aline be dead and the rest of we be middle-aged now rudolph and we go in to dinner with the veteran who call we ` madam ' and we be prominent in charitable enterprise but there be a time when we be not exactly hideous in appearance and man do many mad thing for we sake and we never lose the memory of that time pleasant memory be among the many privilege of woman yes add mr pendomer meditatively we derive much the same pleasure from they a cripple do from rearrange the athletic medal he once win or a starve man from thinking of the many excellent dinner he have eat but we can not and we would not part with they nevertheless rudolph musgrave however have not honor she with much attention and be puzzling over the more or less incomprehensible situation and perceive this she run on after a little : oh it work -- it work beautifully you see she would always have be very jealous of that other woman but with I it be different she have always know that scandalous story about you and I and she have always know I as i be -- a frivolous and -- say corpulent for it be a more dignified word -- and generally unattractive chaperon and she can not think of I as ever have be anything else young people never really believe in they elder ' youth rudolph at heart they think we come into the world with crow 's - foot and pepper-and-salt hair all complete so she be only sorry for you now -- rather as a mother would be for a naughty child as for I she be not jealous -- but sigh mr pendomer she be not over-fond of I colonel musgrave rise to he foot it be not fair say he the letter be distinctly compromise it be not fair you should shoulder the blame for a woman who be nothing to you it be not fair you should be place in such a false position what matter plead mr pendomer the letter be mine to burn if i choose i have read one of they by the way and it be almost word for word a letter you write I a good twenty year ago and you re-hash it for patricium 's benefit too it seem you ought to get a mimeograph oh very well it do not matter now for patricium will say nothing -- or not at least to you she add still -- he begin ah rudolph if i want to do a foolish thing why will not you let I what else be a woman for they be always do foolish thing i have know a woman to throw a man over because she have see he without a collar and i have know another actually to marry a man because she happen to be in love with he i have know a woman to go on wear pink organdie after she have pass forty and i have know a woman to go on care for a man who she know be not worth care for long after he have forget we be not brave and sensible like you man so why not let I be foolish if i want to be if say colonel musgrave in some perplexity i understand one word of this farrago i will be -- qualify in various way but you do not have to understand she plead you mean -- he ask i mean that i be always fond of aline anyhow nonsense and he be conscious with vexation that he have undeniably flush i mean then i be a woman and _ i _ understand everything be as near what it should be as be possible while patricium be see so much of -- we will call it the artistic temperament mr pendomer shrug but if i go on in that line you would believe i be jealous and heaven know i be not the least bit so -- with the unavoidable qualification that be a woman i can not help rise superior to common-sense he say you mean jack charteri -- but what on earth have he to do with these letter i do not mean any proper name at all i simply mean you be not to undo my work it would only signify trouble and dissatisfaction and give up all this -- she wave she hand lightly toward the lawn of matocton -- and it would mean we give you up for you know you have not any money of you own rudolph ah rudolph we can not give you up we need you to lead we lichfield german and to tell we naughty little story and keep we amuse so _ please _ be sensible rudolph permit I to point out i firmly believe that silence be the perfectest herald of joy observe colonel musgrave only i do _ not _ understand why you should have drag john charteri 's name into this ludicrous affair -- you really do not understand -- but colonel musgrave 's handsome face declare very plainly that he do not well mrs pendomer reflect i dare say it be best upon the whole you should not and now you must excuse I for i be leave for the ullwether ' to-day and i sha not ever be invite to matocton again and i must tell my maid to pack up she be a little fool and it will break she heart to be leave pilkin all human being be tediously alike but allow ample time for she to dispose of my best lingerie and of she unavoidable lamentation i ought to make the six-forty-five i have notice that one usually do -- somehow say mr pendomer and seem to smack of allegory and yet it may have be because she know -- as who know better -- something of that mischief 's nature which be now afoot iv the colonel burn the malefic letter that afternoon indeed the episode set he to ransack the desk in which patricium have find they -- a desk which as you have hear be heap with the miscellaneous correspondence of the colonel 's father date back a half-century and more much curious matter the colonel discover there for wild will musgrave 's have be a full-blooded career and over one packet of letter in particular the colonel sit for a long while with a unwontedly troubled face part six - byway cry _ kismet _ and take heart ero be go nor may we follow to that loftier air olympian breathe take heart and enter where a lighter love vine-crowned laugh i ' the sun oblivious of tangled web ill-spun by ancient wearied weaver for it may be he guidance lead to lover of such as we and heart so credulous as to be win cry _ kismet _ put away vain memory of all old sorrow and of all old joy and learn that life be never quite amiss so long as unreflective girl and boy remember that young lip be mean to kiss and hold that laughter be a seemly noise paul vanderhoffen _ egerium answer _ i patricia sit in the great maple-grove that stand behind matocton and ponder over a note from she husband who be in lichfield superintend the appearance of the July number of the _ lichfield historical association 's quarterly magazine _ mr charteri lay at she foot glance rapidly over a lengthy letter which be from he wife in richmond the morning mail be just in and patricium have despatch charteri for she letter on the plea that the wood be too beautiful to leave and that matocton in the unsettled state which mark the end of the week in a house-party be intolerable she undoubtedly be partial to the grove have spend the last ten morning there mr charteris have overrate she modest literary ability so far as to ask she advice in certain detail of he new book which be to appear in the autumn and they have find a vernal solitude besides be extremely picturesque to be conducive to the form of really mature opinion moreover she be assure that none of the member of the house-party would misunderstand she motive people be so much less censorious in the country there be something in the pastoral purity of nature see face to face which bring out one 's noblest instinct and put a end to all horrid gossip and scandal-mongering do not mr barry-smith think so and what be she real opinion of that rumor about the hardress and be the woman as bad as people say she be thus have patricium speak in the privacy of she chamber at that hour when lady do up they hair for the night and discourse of mystery it be at this time they be say to babble out they heart to one another and so beyond doubt this must have be the real state of the case as patricium admit she have give up bridge and take to literature only during the past year she might more honestly have say within the last two week in any event she now converse of author with a fitful persistence like that of a ill-regulated machine she comment be delightfully frank and original as she have a unusually good memory of two book she be apt to prefer the one with the wider margin and she be become sufficiently familiar with a number of poet to quote they inaccurately we have all see john charteri 's portrait and most of we have read he book -- or at least the volume entitle _ in old lichfield _ which cause the _ lichfield courier-herald _ to apostrophize its author as a child of genius whose ardent soul have sound the mystery of life whose inner vision sweep over ever widen field of thought and whose chiseled phrase continue patriotically to perpetuate the beauty of lichfield 's past but for present purpose it be sufficient to say that this jewelsmith of word be slight and dark and hook-nosed and that he hair be thin and that he be not ill-favored it may be of interest to he admirer -- a grow cult -- to add that he reason for wear a mustache in a period of clean-shaven face be that without it he mouth be not pleasant to look upon heigho patricium say at length with a little laugh it be very strange that both of we encumbrance should arrive on the same day it be unfortunate mr charteri admit lazily but the bless state of matrimony be liable to these mishap let we be thankful that my wife 's whim to visit she aunt have give we at least two perfect golden week husband be like bad penny and wife resemble the cat whose adventure have be commemorate by one of we really popular poet they always come back patricia commune with herself and to charteri seem as she sit in the chequered sunlight far more desirable than a married woman have any right to be i wish -- she begin slowly oh but you know it be positively criminal negligence not to have include a dozen fairy among my sponsor i too have desiderate this sensible precaution say charteri and laugh he utter comprehension but after all he say and snap he finger gaily we still have twenty-four hour patricium let we forget the crudity of life and say foolish thing to each other for i be pastorally incline this morning patricium i wish to lie at you foot and pipe amorous ditty upon a oaten reed have you such a article about you patricia he draw a key-ring from he pocket and ponder over it or would you prefer that i whistle into the opening of this door-key to the effect that we must gather we rose-bud while we may for time be still a-flying fa-la and that a drear old age not to mention we spouse will soon descend upon we fa-la-di-leero a door-key be not arcadian patricium but it make a very creditable noise do not be foolish _ mon amus _ she protest with a indulgent smile i be unhappy unhappy that i have chance to fall in love with you patricia it be a accident which might befall any really intelligent person she shrug she shoulder ruefully i have do wrong to let you talk to I as you have do of late i -- oh jack i be afraid mr charteri meditate somewhere in a neighbor thicket a bird trill out he song -- a contented half-hushed song that call he mate to witness how infinitely bless above all other bird be he mr charteri hear he to the end and languidly make as to applaud then mr charteri raise he eyebrow of you husband patricium he query i -- rudolph do not bother about I nowadays sufficiently to -- notice anything mr charteri smile of my wife patricium good gracious no i have not the least doubt you will explain matter satisfactorily to you wife for i have always hear that practice make perfect mr charteri laugh -- a low and very musical laugh of I then patricium i -- i think it be rather of myself i be afraid oh i hate you when you smile like that you have evil eye jack stop it quit hound I with you illicit fascination the hand she have raise in threatening fashion fall back into she lap and she shrug she shoulder once more my nerve be somewhat upset by the approach prospect of connubial felicity i suppose really though _ mon ami _ you conceit be appalling charteri give vent to a chuckle and raise the door-key to he lip when you be quite through you histrionic effort he suggest apologetically i will proceed with my amorous piping really patricia one might fancy you the heroine of a society drama work up the sympathy of the audience before take to evil way surely you be not about to leave you dear good patient husband patricium heroine only do that on dark and stormy night and in a opera toilette wear she best gown seem always to affect a heroine in that way mr charteri at this point drop the key-ring and draw nearer to she he voice sink to a plead cadence we be in arcadium patricium virtue and vice be contraband in this charming country and must be leave at the frontier let we be adorably foolish and happy my lady and forget for a little the evil day that approach can you not fancy this to be arcadium patricium -- it require the merest trifle of imagination listen very carefully and you will hear the hoof of faun rustling among the fall leaf they be watch we patricium from behind every tree-bole they think you a dryad -- the queen of all the dryad with the most glorious eye and hair and the most tempting lip in all the forest after a little shaggy big-thewed ventripotent pan will grow jealous and ravish you away from I as he steal syrinx from she lover you be very beautiful patricium you be quite incredibly beautiful i adore you patricium would you mind if i hold you hand it be a foolish thing to do but it be preëminently arcadian she hear he with downcast eye and she cheek flush a pink color that be agreeable to contemplation do -- do you really care for I jack she ask softly then cry no no you need not answer -- because of course you worship I madly unboundedly distractedly they all do but you do it more convincingly you have be take lesson at night-school i dare say at all sort of murky institution and jack really cross my heart i always stop the other when they talk this way i try to stop you too you know i do she raise she lash a trifle uncertainly and withdraw she hand from he a trifle slowly it be wrong -- all horribly wrong i wonder at myself i can not understand how in the world i can be such a fool about you i must not be alone with you again i must tell my husband -- everything she conclude and manifestly not mean a word of what she say by all means assent mr charteri readily let 's tell my wife too it will make thing so very interesting rudolph would be terribly unhappy she reflect he would probably never smile again say mr charteri and my wife -- oh it would upset anne quite frightfully it be we altruistic nay we bounden duty to save they from such misery i -- i do not know what to do she wail the obvious course say he after reflection be to shake off the bond of matrimony without further delay so let 's elope patricium patricium who be really unhappy take refuge in flippancy and laugh i make it a rule say she never to elope on friday besides now i think of it there be rudolph -- ah rudolph do not care a button 's worth about I i know the funny part be that he do not know it he have simply assume he be devote to I because all respectable people be devote to they wife i can assure you _ mon ami _ he would be a veritable othello if there be any scandal and would infinitely prefer the bolster to the divorce-court he would have we follow and tear apart by wild policeman mr charteri meditate for a moment rudolph as you be perfectly aware would simply deplore the terribly lax modern notion in regard to marriage and talk to newspaper reporter about this much -- he measure it between thumb and forefinger -- concern the beauty and chivalry of the south he would do nothing more i question if rudolph musgrave would ever in any circumstance be capable of decisive action ah do not make fun of rudolph she cry quickly rudolph can not help it if he be conscientious and in consequence rather depress to live with and for all that he so often play the jackass-fool about woman like grandma pendomer he be a man jack -- a well-meaning clean and dunderheaded man you be not you be puny and frivolous and you sneer too much and you be make a fool of I and -- and that be why i like you i suppose oh i wish i be good i have always try to be good and there do not seem to be a hatpin in the world that make a halo sit comfortably now jack you know i have try to be good i have never let you kiss I and i have never let you hold my hand -- until to-day -- and -- and -- patricium pause and laugh but we be talk of rudolph she say with a touch of weariness rudolph have all the virtue that a woman most admire until she attempt to live in the same house with they i thank you say mr charteri for the high opinion you entertain of my moral character he bestow a reproachful sigh upon she and continue : at any rate rudolph musgrave have be a unusually lucky man -- the luckiest that i know of patricium have rise as if to go she turn she big purple eye on he for a moment you -- you think so she query hesitatingly afterward she spread out she hand in a helpless gesture and laugh for no apparent reason and sit down again why say patricium it take charteri fully a hour to point out all the reason patricium tell he very frankly that she consider he to be talk nonsense but she seem quite willing to listen ii sunset be approach on the follow afternoon when rudolph musgrave fresh from lichfield -- whither as have be record the bring out of the July number of the _ lichfield historical association quarterly magazine _ have call he -- come out on the front porch at matocton he have arrive on the afternoon train about a hour previously in time to superintend little roger 's customary evening transaction with a astounding quantity of bread and milk and roger abe he father have dress at once for supper find himself ready for that meal somewhat in advance of the rest of the house-party indeed only one of they be visible at this moment -- a woman who be read on a rustic bench some distance from the house and whose back be turn to he the poise of she head however be not unfamiliar also it be not everyone who have hair that be like a nimbus of thrice-polished gold colonel musgrave throw back he shoulder and draw a deep breath subsequently with a fine air of unconcern he inspect the view from the porch which be in fact quite worthy of he attention interesting thing have happen at matocton -- many event that have be preserve in the local mythology not always to the credit of the old musgrave and a few which have slip into a modest niche in history it be perhaps on these that colonel musgrave ponder so intently once the farthingale and red-heeled gentry come in sluggish barge to matocton and the broad river on which the estate face be thick with belly sail since the day of railroad one approach the mansion through the maple-grove in the rear and enter ignominiously by the back-door the house stand on a considerable elevation the main portion with its hipped roof and mullioned window be very old but the two wing that stretch to the east and west be comparatively modern and date back little over a century time have mellow they into harmony with the major part of the house and the kindly virginia creeper have do its utmost to conceal the fact that they be construct of plebeian brick which be baked in this country but matocton be matocton long before these wing be build and a mere affair of yesterday such as the revolution antedate they they be not stand when tarleton pay he famous visit to matocton in the main hall you may still see the stair up which he ride on horseback and the slash which he saber hack upon the hand-rail to the front of the mansion lie a close-shaven lawn dot with sundry oak and maple and thence the formal garden descend in six broad terrace there be when summer reign no lovelier spot than this bright medley of square and star and triangle and circle -- all euclid in flowerage -- which glow with multitudinous color where the sun strike you will find no new flower at matocton though here be verbena poppy lavender and marigold sweet-william hollyhock and columbine phlox and larkspur and meadowsweet and heart 's - ease just as they be when thomasine musgrave matocton 's first châtelaine be wont to tend they and of all floral parvenu the garden be innocent box-hedge mark the walkway the seventh terrace be until lately uncultivated the tree have be clear away to afford pasturage it be now closely plant with beech none of great size and extend to a tangled thicket of fieldpine and cedar and sassafras and blackberry bush which again mask a drop of some ten foot to the river the beach here be narrow at high tide it be rarely more than fifteen foot in breadth and be in many place completely submerge past this the river lapse into the horizon line without a break save on a extraordinarily clear day when bigelow 's island may be see as a dim smudge upon the west all these thing rudolph musgrave regard with curiously deep interest for one who have see they so many time before then with a shrug of the shoulder he saunter forward across the lawn he have plan several appropriate speech but when it come to the point of give they utterance he merely hold out he hand in a awkward fashion and say : anne she look up from she reading she do this with two red-brown eye that have no apparent limit to they depth she hand be soft it seem quite lose in the broad palm of a man 's hand dear rudolph she say as simply as though they have part yesterday it be awfully good to see you again colonel musgrave clear he throat and sit down beside she a moment later colonel musgrave clear he throat once more then mr charteri laugh it be a pleasant laugh -- a clear ripple carol of clean mirth that sparkle in she eye and dimpled in she wholesome cheek so do you find it very very awkward awkward he cry they glance meet in a flash of comprehension which seem to purge the air musgrave be not in the least self-conscious now he laugh and lift a admonitory forefinger oh good cynara he say i be not what i be and so i can not do it my dear -- i really can not possibly live up to the requirement of be a bury past in a proper story-book or play i would have to come back from new zealand or the transvaal all cover with glory and epaulet and have find you in the last throe of consumption : instead you have fatten anne which a bury past never do and which show a sad lack of appreciation for my feeling and i -- ah my dear i must confess that my hair be grow gray and that my life have not be entirely empty without you and that i eat and enjoy two mutton-chop at luncheon though i know i should see you to-day i be afraid we be neither of we up to heroics anne so let 's be sensible and comfy my dear you brute she cry -- not look irreparably angry yet not without a real touch of vexation do not you know that every woman cherish the picture of she former lover sit alone in the twilight and grow lackadaisical over undying memory and fade letter and you -- you approach I after i do not dare to think how many year as calmly as if i be a old schoolmate of you mother 's and attempt to talk to I about mutton-chop you ought to be ashamed of yourself rudolph musgrave you might at least have start a little at see I and have clasp you hand to you heart and have say ` you you ' or something of the sort i have every right to expect it mr charteri pout and then trifle for a moment with the page of she book and -- and i want to tell you that i be sorry for the way i speak to you -- that night she swiftly say anne do not look at he woman do not understand thing that be perfectly simple to man i suppose -- i mean -- that be jack say -- that you ought to apologize it be very like he -- and colonel musgrave smile to think how like john charteri it be jack be quite wonderful he observe she look up say impulsively rudolph you do not know how happy he make I heartless woman and would you tempt I to end the tragedy of my life with a shakesperian fifth act of poisoning and assassination i spurn you temptress for after all it be a unpleasantly long while ago we go mad for each other musgrave announce and he smile i fancy that the boy and girl we know of be as dead now as nebuchadnezzar ` marian 's married and i sit here alive and merry at ' -- well not at forty year unluckily -- if you continue in that heartless strain i shall go into the house mr charteri protest she indignation be exaggerated but it be not altogether feigned woman can not quite pardon a reject suitor who marry and be content they wish he all imaginable happiness and prosperity of course and they be honestly interested in he welfare but it seem unexpectedly callous in he and besides he wife be so perfectly commonplace mr charteri therefore add with emphasis : i be really disgracefully happy glad to hear it say musgrave placidly so be i oh rudolph rudolph you be hopeless she sigh and you use to make such a nice lover mr charteri look out over the river which be like melting gold and for a moment be silent i be frightfully in love with you rudolph she say as half in wonder after -- after that horrible time when my parent force we to behave rationally i weep -- oh i must have weep deluge i firmly intend to pine away to a early grave and that second time i like you too but then -- there be jack you see h be say colonel musgrave yes i see i want you to continue to be friend with jack she go on and she face light up and she voice grow tender he have the artistic temperament and naturally that make he sensitive and a trifle irritable at time it take so little to upset he you see for he feel so acutely what he call the discord of life i think most man be jealous of he talent so they call he selfish and finicky and conceited he be not really you know only he can not help feel a little superior to the majority of man and he artistic temperament lead he to magnify the lesser mishap of life -- such as the steak be overdo or miss a train oh really a thing like that worry he as much as the loss of a fortune or a death in the family would upset anyone else jack say there be no such thing as trifle in a harmonious and well-proportioned life and i suppose that be true to man of genius of course i be rather a philistine and i grate on he at time -- that be i use to but he say i have improve wonderfully and so we be ridiculously happy jack and i musgrave cast about vainly for a appropriate speech then he compromise with he conscience and say : you husband be a very clever man be not he she have flush for pleasure at hear he praise oh yes anne love jack charteri there be no question that it be write in she face be vibrant in she voice as she speak of he now really rudolph be not he book wonderful i do not appreciate they of course for i be not clever but i know you do i do not see why man think he selfish i know better you have to live with jack to really appreciate he and every day i discover some new side of he character that make he dearer to I he be so clever -- and so noble why i remember -- well before jack make he first hit with _ astaroth 's lackey _ he live with he sister they have not any money and of course jack could not be expect to take a clerkship or anything like that because business detail make he head ache poor boy so he sister teach school and he live with she they be very happy -- he sister simply adore he and i be positively jealous of she sometimes -- but unfortunately the bank in which she keep she money fail one day i remember it be just before he ask I to marry he and tell I in he dear laughing manner that he have not a penny in the world and that we would have to live on bread and cheese and kiss of course i have a plenty for we both though so we be not really in danger of be reduce to that well i want to make he sister a allowance but jack point out with considerable reason that one person could live very comfortably on a income that have formerly support two he say it be not right i should be burden with the support of he family jack be so sensitive you see lest people might think he be make a mercenary marriage and that he sister be profit by it now i call that one of the noblest thing i ever hear of for he be devotedly attach to he sister and naturally it be a great grief to he to see she compel to work for a live he last book be dedicate to she and the dedication be one of the most tender and pathetic thing i ever read musgrave be hardly conscious of what she be say she be not particularly intelligent this handsome cheery woman but she voice and the richness and sweetness of it and the vitality of she laugh contented he soul anne be different the knowledge come again to he quite simply that anne be different and in the nature of thing must always be a little different from all other people -- even patricium musgrave he have no desire to tell anne charteri of this no idea that it would affect in any way the tenor of he life he merely accept the fact that she be after all anne willoughby and that she dear presence seem somehow to strengthen and cheer and comfort and content beyond the reach of expression yet musgrave recognize she lack of cleverness and like and admire she none the less a vision of patricium arise -- a vision of a dainty shallow dresden-china face with a surprising quantity of vivid hair about it patricium be beautiful and patricium be clever in she pinchbeck way but rudolph musgrave doubt very much if she mocking eye now ever soften into that brooding sacred tenderness he have see in anne 's eye and he likewise question if a hurry happy thrill run through patricium 's voice when patricium speak of she husband you have unquestionably marry a unusual man musgrave say i -- by jove you know i fancy my wife find he almost as attractive as you do ah rudolph i can not fancy anyone whom -- whom you love care for anyone else do not i remember sir how irresistible you can be when you choose anne laugh and raise plump hand to heaven really though woman pursue he to a perfectly indecent extent i have to watch over he carefully not that i distrust he of course for -- dear jack -- he be so devoted to I and care so little for other woman that joseph would seem in comparison only a depraved _ roué _ but the _ woman _ -- why rudolph there be a italian countess at rome -- the impudent minx -- who actually make I believe -- however jack explain all that after i have make both a spectacle and a nuisance of myself and he have behave so nobly in the entire affair that for day afterwards i be positively limp with repentance then in pari that flighty mr hardress -- but he explain that too some woman be shameless rudolph mr charteri conclude and sigh she pity for they utterly so musgrave assent gravely he be feel a thought uncomfortable to he the place have grow portentous the sun be low and the long shadow of the tree be black on the dim lawn people be assemble for supper and pass to and fro under low-hanging branch and the gaily-colored gown of the woman glimmer through a faint blue haze like that with which boucher and watteau and fragonard love to veil and thereby to make wistful somehow the antic of those fine parroquet-like manikin who figure in they _ fêtes galante _ inside the house someone be play a unpleasant sort of air on the piano -- a air which be quite needlessly creepy and haunting and insistent it all seem like a grim bit out of a play the tenderness and pride that shine in anne 's eye as she boast of she happiness trouble rudolph musgrave he have a perfectly unreasonable desire to carry she away by force if necessary and to protect she from clever people and to buy thing for she so i be a old old married woman now and -- and i think in some way i suit jack better than a more brilliant person might i be glad you wife have take a fancy to he and i want you to profit by she example jack say she be one of the most attractive woman he ever meet he ask I to-day why i do not do my hair like hers she must make you very happy rudolph my wife colonel musgrave say be in my partial opinion a very clever and very beautiful woman yes cleverness and beauty be sufficient to make any man happy i suppose anne hazard jack say though -- _ be _ cleverness and beauty the main thing in life rudolph undoubtedly he protest now that she say judicially show the difference in man jack say a man love a woman not for she beauty or any other quality she possess but just because she be the woman he love and can not help loving ah i dare say that be the usual reason yes say colonel musgrave -- because she be the woman he love and can not help loving anne clap she hand ah so i have penetrate you indifference at last sir impulsively she lay she hand upon he arm and speak with earnestness dear rudolph i be so glad you have find the woman you can really love jack say there be only one possible woman in the world for each man and that only in a month of sunday do he find she yes say musgrave he have rise and be look down in friendly fashion into she honest lovely eye yes there be only one possible woman and -- yes i think i find she anne some year ago iii thus it befall that all pass smoothly with rudolph musgrave and anne charteri with whom he be not in the least in love any longer -lrb- he reflect -rrb- although in the nature of thing she must always seem to he a little different from all other people and it befall too that the follow noon -- this day be a Sunday warm clear and somnolent -- anne charteri and rudolph musgrave sit upon the lawn before matocton and little roger musgrave be with they in fact these two have be high-handedly press-gang by this small despot to serve against a enemy then harass he majesty 's equanimity and by he revilingly designate as nothing-to-do and so anne make for roger -- as she have learn to do for she dead son -- in addition to a respectable navy of paper boat a vast number of box and nantucket sink and picture frame and football she have use up the greater part of a magazine before the imp grow tired of she novel accomplishment for as he invidiously observe i can make they for myself now most as good as you only i always tear the bottom of the boat when you pull it out and my sink be kind of wobbly and besides i have make up a story just like you husband get money for do and if i have a quarter i would buy that green and yellow snake in the toy-store window and wiggle it at people and scare they into fit sonnikin say colonel musgrave suppose you tell we the story and then we will see if it be really worth a quarter and try to save you from this unblushing mendicancy well god bless father and mother and little cousin -- oh no that be what i say at night roger 's voice now altered assume shrill singsong cadence he pensive gravity would have appear excessive if manifest by the great sphinx what i mean to say be that once upon a time when the battle of gettysburg be go on and house be be rob and burn and my dear grandfather be be shoot through the heart a certain house where the richest man in town live be have feast and merriment never dream of any harm or thinking of they little child rachel who be on the front porch watch the battle and scream with joy at every man that fall dead one dark-faced man be strike with a bullet and be hurt he see the child laughing at he and he heart be full of revenge so that night when all have go to bed the old dark-faced man go softly in the house and get the little girl and set the house on fire and he carry she out in the mountain and be that worth a quarter good heaven no say anne how dare you leave we in such harrowing suspense well a whole lot more happen because all the while rachel be asleep when she wake up she do not know where under the sun she be so she walk along for about a hour and come to a little village and after a few minute she come to a large rock and guess who she meet she meet she father and when he see she he hug she so hard that when he get through she do not have any breath leave in she and they walk along and after a while they come to the wood and it be now about six o'clock and it be very dark and just then nine robber jump out from behind the tree and they take a pistol and shot rachel 's father and the child faint she papa be dead so she dig a hole and bury he and go right back home and of course that be all and if i have that snake i would not try to scare you with it father anyhow so colonel musgrave give he son a well-earned coin as the colonel consider and it have be decree now father _ you _ tell a story obediently read aloud from a fat red-covered book the tale be of the colonel 's selecting and it deal with a shepherdess and a chimney-sweep and so the colonel perorate the little china people remain together and be thankful for the rivet in grandfather 's neck and continue to love each other until they be break to piece -- and the tale be a parable my son you will find that out some day i wish you do not have to but be that all father you will find it rather more than enough sonnikin when you begin to interpret yes that be all only you be to remember always that they climb to the very top of the chimney where they could see the star before they decide to go back and live upon the parlor table under the brand-new looking-glass for the star be disconcertingly unconcerned when you have climb to they and so altogether unimpressed by you achievement that it be the nature of all china people to slink home again precisely as you rachel do -- and as mr charteri will assure you i say anne now honestly rudolph i be think you ought not to let he sit upon the grass because he really have a cold and if i be you i would give he a good dose of castor-oil to-night some people give it in lemon-juice i know but i find with my boy that peppermint be rather less disagreeable and you could easily send somebody over to the store at the station -- anne break off short be i be inadequate again i be sorry but with child you never know what a cold may lead to and i really do not believe it good for he to sit in this damp grass sonnikin say rudolph musgrave you have better climb up into my lap before you and i be podsnapp from the universe by the only embodiment of common-sense just now within we reach he pat the boy 's head and latterly resume : i be afraid of you anne whenever i be imagine vain thing or stitch romantic possibility like embroidery about the fabric of my past i always find the real you in my path as undeniable as a gas-bill i do not believe you ever dare to think because there be no tell what it might lead to you be simply unassailably armored by the courage of other people 's conviction she candid eye meet he over the boy 's bright head and what in the world be you talk about i be lament i be rend the air and beat my breast on account of you obstinate preference for be always in the right i do wish you would endeavor to impersonate a human be a trifle more convincingly -- but the great gong boom out for luncheon interrupt he at this point and colonel musgrave be never permit to finish he complaint against anne 's unimaginativeness iv on that same Sunday morning while anne charteri and rudolph musgrave contend with little roger 's boredom on the lawn before matocton patricium and charteri meet by accident on the seventh terrace of the garden patricium have mention casually at the breakfast-table that she intend to spend the forenoon on this terrace unsabbatically make note for a paper on the symbolism of dante which she be to read before the lichfield woman 's club in October but mr charteris have not overhear she he be seat on the front porch work out a somewhat difficult point in he new book when it have first occur to he that this particular terrace would be a inspiring and appropriate place in which to think the matter over undisturbed he say and it be impossible he should have know that anyone be there as the seventh terrace happen to be the only one that be plant with beech-tree be completely screen from observation from the house you can not see anything that happen there it be a curious accident though it really seem now that patricium have put a end to they meeting in the maple-grove fate be conspire to bring they together however as mr charteri point out there could be no possible objection to this conspiracy since they have decide that they friendship be to be of a purely platonic nature it be a severe trial to he he confess to be force to put aside certain dream he have have of the future -- mad dream perhaps but such as have seem very dear and very plausible to he impractical artistic temperament still it hearten he to hope that they friendship -- since it be to be no more -- might prove a survival or rather a veritable renaissance of the beautiful old greek spirit in such matter and though the blind chance that mismanage the world have chained they to uncongenial though certainly well-meaning person this be no logical reason why he and patricium should be deprive of the pleasure of intellectual intercourse they soul be too closely akin for mr charteri admit that he soul be grecian to the core and out of place and puzzle and very lonely in a sordid bustling world and he assure patricium -- she do not object if he call she patricium -- that she own soul possess all the beauty and purity and calm of a aphrodite sculpture by phidia it be such a soul as horace might have love as theocritus might have hymn in glad greek song patricium flush and dissent somewhat frankly _ mon amus _ she say you be far too attractive for you company to be quite safe you be such a adept in the nameless little attention that woman love -- so profuse with lesser sugar-plum of speech and action -- that after two week one 's husband be really necessary as a antidote sugar-plum be good but like all palatable thing unwholesome so i shall prescribe rudolph 's company for myself to ward off a attack of moral indigestion i be very glad he have come back -- really glad she add conscientiously poor old rudolph what between he interminable antiquity and those demented section of the alphabet -- what be those thing _ mon ami _ that be always go up and down in wall street elevator mr charteri suggest oh you jay-bird i mean those np 's and nyc 's and those other letter that be always have flurry and panic and pass dividend they keep he incredibly busy and she sigh tolerantly patricium have come within the last two week to believe that she be neglect if not positively ill-treat by she husband and she have no earthly objection to mr charteri think likewise she face express patient resignation now as they walk under the close-matted foliage of the beech-tree which make a pleasant sun-flecked gloom about they patricium remove she hat -- the morning really be rather close -- and pause where a sunbeam fall upon she copper-colored hair and glorified she wistful countenance she sigh once more and add a finish touch to the portrait of a _ femme incomprise _ pray do not think _ mon ami _ she say very earnestly that i be blame rudolph i suppose no wife can ever hope to have any part in she husband 's inner life not in she own husband 's of course say charteri cryptically no for while a woman give she heart all at once man crumble theirs away as one feed bread to bird -- a crumb to this woman a crumb to that -- and such a little crumb sometimes and he wife get what be leave over pray where do you read that say charteri i do not read it anywhere it be simply a thought that come to I patricium lie gently but do not let 's try to be clever cleverness be always a tax but before luncheon it be a extortion personally it make I feel as if i have attend a welsh-rabbit supper the night before you wife must be very patient my wife cry charteri in turn resolve to screen a unappreciative mate be the most dear and most kind-hearted among the philistine and yet at time i grant you -- oh but of course patricium say impatiently i do not for a moment question that you wife be a angel and why he eyebrow lift and he smile why be not it a angel patricium query all impishness now who keep the first man and woman out of paradise if -- if i think you mean that -- he cry and then he shrug he shoulder my wife 's virtue merit a better husband than fate have accord she anne be the best woman i have ever know patricium be not unnaturally irritated after all one do not take the trouble to meet a man accidentally in a plantation of young beech-tree in order to hear he discourse of he wife 's good quality and besides mr charteri be speak in a disagreeably solemn manner rather as if he fancy himself in a cathedral therefore patricium cast down she eye again and say : man of genius be so rarely understand by they wife we will waive the question of genius mr charteri laugh heartily but he have flush with pleasure i suppose he continue pacing up and down with cat-like fervor that matrimony be always more or less of a compromise -- like two convict chained together try to catch each other 's gait after a while they succeed to a certain extent the chain be still heavy of course but it do not gall they as poignantly as it use to do and i fear the artistic temperament be not suit to marriage its capacity for suffering be too great mr charteri catch he breath in shudder fashion and he pause before patricium after a moment he grasp she by both wrist we be chained fast enough my lady he cry bitterly and we sentence be for life there be green field yonder but we allotted place be here in the prison-yard there be laughter yonder in the field and the scent of wild flower float in to we at time when we be weary and the whisper tree sway they branch over the prison-wall and they fruit be good to look on and they hang within reach -- ah we might reach they very easily but this be forbid fruit my lady and it be not include in we wholesome prison-fare and so do not think of it we have be happy you and i for a little we might -- do not think of it do not dare think of it go back and help you husband drag he chain it gall he as sorely as it do you it gall we all it be the heaviest chain be ever forge but we do not dare shake it off i -- oh jack jack do not you dare to talk to I like that we must be brave we must be sensible patricium regardless of she skirt sit down upon the ground and produce a pocket-handkerchief i -- oh what do you mean by make I so unhappy she demand indignantly ah patricium he murmur as he kneel beside she how can you hope to have a man ever talk to you in a sane fashion you should not have such eye patricia they be purple and fathomless like the ocean and when a man look into they too long he sanity grow weak and sink and drown in they cool depths and the man must babble out he foolish heart to you oh but indeed you should not have such eye patricia they be dangerous and to ask anybody to believe in they splendor be a insult to he intelligence and besides they be much too bright to wear in the morning they be bad form patricium we must be sensible she babble you wife be here my husband be here and we -- we be not child or madman jack dear so we really must be sensible i suppose oh jack she cry upon a sudden this be not honorable why no poor little anne mr charteri 's eye grow tender for a moment because he wife in a fashion be dear to he then he laugh very musically and how can a man remember honor patricium when the choice lie between honor and you you should not have such hair patricium it be a net spin out of the raw stuff of fire and blood and of portentous sunset and its tendril have curl around what little honor i ever boast and they hold it fast patricium it be dishonorable to love you but i can not think of that when i be with you and hear you speak and when i be not with you just to remember that dear voice be enough to set my pulse beat faster oh patricium you should not have such a voice charteri break off in speech ` scuse I for interruptin ' the old mulattress virginium be say but mis ' pilkin sen ' I say lunch raydy miss patrisy virginium seem to notice nothing out-of-the-way have deliver she message she go away quietly she pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as a idol 's but patricium shiver she frighten I _ mon amus _ yes that old woman always give I gooseflesh and i do not know why -- because she be as deaf as a post -- and i simply can not get rid of she she be a sort of symbol -- she and how many other i wonder oh well let 's hurry so mr charteri be never permit to finish he complaint against patricium 's voice it be absolutely imperative they should be on time for luncheon for as patricium point out the majority of people be censorious and lose no opportunity for say nasty thing they be even capable of sneer at a purely platonic friendship which be attempt to preserve the beautiful old greek spirit \* \* \* \* \* she be chatter either of she plan for the autumn or of dante and the discovery of he miss canto or else of how abominably bob townsend have treat rosalind jemmett and they have almost reach the upper terrace -- little roger indeed he red head blaze in the sunlight be already sidle by shy instalment toward they -- when patricium moan inconsequently and for no ascertainable cause faint it be the first time for four year she have be guilty of such a indiscretion she be shortly afterward explain to various member of the musgrave ' house-party it be the heat no doubt but since everybody insist upon it she would very willingly toast they in another bumper of aromatic spirit of ammonia just look at that rudolph you have spill it all over you coat sleeve i do wish you would try to be a little less clumsy oh well i be spruce as a new penny now so let 's all go to luncheon v patricium have not be in perfect health for a long while it seem to she in retrospect that ever since the agony of little roger 's birth she have be the victim of what she describe as a sort of all-overishness then too as have be previously record patricium have be operate upon by surgeon and more than once good lord as she herself declare it have reach the point that when i see a turkey come to the dinner-table to be carve i can not help treat it as a ingénue yet for the last four year she have never faint until this it disquiet she then too awake faint prick memory of certain symptom which she have not talk about now they alarm she and in consequence she take the next morning 's train to lichfield vi mrs ashmeade who have be previously quote now come into the story she be only a episode still she intervention lead to peculiar result -- result curiously enough in which she be not in the least concerned she simply come into the story for a moment and then go out of it but she part be a important one she be like the watchman who announce the come of agamemnon clytemnestra sharpen she ax at the news and the fatal bath be prepare for the _ anax andron _ the tragedy move on the house of atreus fall and the wrath of implacable god bellows across the heaven meanwhile the watchman have go home to have tea with he family and we hear no more of he there be any number of moral to this mr ashmeade come into the story on the day patricium go to lichfield and some week after john charteri 's arrival at matocton since then affair have progress in a not unnatural sequence mr charteri as we have see attribute it to fate and assuredly there must be a special providence of some kind that preside over country house -- a freakish and whimsical providence which hugely rejoice in confound one 's sense of time and direction through its agency people unaccountably lose they way in the simplest walk and turn up late and embarrassed for luncheon at the end of the evening it bring any number of couple blinking out of the dark with no idea the clock be strike more than half-past nine and it delight in send one into the garden -- in search of rose or dahlia or upas-tree or something of the sort of course -- and thereby cause one to encounter the most unlikely people and really quite the last person one would have think of meeting as all frequenter of house-party junketing will assure you and thus be this special house-party providence responsible for a great number of marriage and it may be for a large percentage of the divorce case for if you desire very heartily to see anything of another member of a house-party this lax-minded and easy-going providence will somehow always bring the event about in a specious manner and without any apparent thought of the consequence and the musgrave ' house-party be no exception mr ashmeade for reason of she own take daily note of this the other be largely engross by they own affair they do not seriously concern themselves about the doings of they fellow-guest and besides if john charteri manifestly seek the company of patricium musgrave she husband do not appear to be exorbitantly dissatisfied or angry or even lonely and be this as it might the fact remain that celium reindan be at this time more than a little interested in teddy anstruther and felix kennaston be undeniably very attentive to kathleen saumarez and tom gelwix be quite certainly devote the major part of he existence to sit upon the beach with rosalind jemmett for in lichfield at all event everyone 's house have at least a pane or so of glass in it and if indiscriminate stone-throwing be ever to become the fashion there be really no tell what damage might ensue and so have mr ashmeade be a younger woman -- have time and a adoring husband not render she as immune to a insanity _ à deux _ as any of we may hope to be upon this side of saintship or senility -- why mr ashmeade would most probably have remain passive and mrs ashmeade would never have come into this story at all as it be she approach rudolph musgrave with a fix purpose this morning as he smoke a after-breakfast cigarette on the front porch of matocton and rudolph say mr ashmeade be you blind you mean -- he ask and he break off for he have really no conception of what she mean and mr ashmeade say i mean patricium and charteri do you think i be by any chance refer to the man in the moon and the queen of sheba if ever amazement show in a man 's eye it shine now in rudolph musgrave 's after a little the pupil widen in a sort of terror so this be what clarice pendomer have be hint at nonsense he cry why -- why it be utter preposterous bedlamite nonsense he catch he breath in wonder at the notion of such a jest remember a little packet of letter hide in he desk it -- oh no fate have not quite so fine a sense of humor as that the thing be incredible musgrave laugh and flush i mean -- i do not think you need tell I what you mean say mr ashmeade she sit down in a large rocking-chair and fan herself for the day be warm of course it be officious and presumptuous and disagreeable of I to meddle i do not mind you thinking that but rudolph do not make the mistake of think that fate ever miss a chance of humiliating we by show how poor be we imagination the gipsy never do she be a posturing mountebank who thrive by astounding humanity mr ashmeade pause and she eye be full of memory and very wise i be only a looker-on at the tragic farce that be be play here she continue after a little but lookers-on you know see most of the game they be not play fairly with you rudolph when people set about a infringement of the decalogue they owe it to they self-respect to treat with heaven as a formidable antagonist to mark the card be not enough they be not play fairly my dear and you ought to know it he walk up and down the porch once or twice with he hand behind he then he stop before mrs ashmeade and smile down at she without many locust shrill monotonously no i do not think you be officious or meddling or anything of the sort i think you be one of the best and kindest-hearted woman in the world but -- bless you motherly soul polly the thing be utterly preposterous of course patricium be young and like attention and it please she to have man admire she that polly be perfectly natural why you would not expect she to sit around under the tree and read poetry with she own husband would you we have be marry far too long for that patricium and i she think I rather prosy and stupid at time poor girl because -- well because in point of fact i be but at the bottom of she heart -- oh it be preposterous we be the best friend in the world i tell you it be simply that she and jack have a great deal in common -- you do not understand john charteri i do say mr ashmeade placidly charteri be simply a baby with a vocabulary he moral standpoint be entirely that of infancy it would be ludicrous to describe he as selfish because he be selfishness incarnate i sometimes believe it be the only characteristic the man possess he reach out he hand and take whatever he want just as a baby would quite simply and as a matter of course he want you wife now and he be reach out he hand to take she he probably be not conscious of do anything especially wrong he be always so plausible in whatever he do that he end by deceive himself i suppose for he be always plausible it be worse than useless to argue any matter with he because he invariably end by make you feel as if you have be catch steal a hat the only argument that would get the better of john charteri be knock he down just as spanking be the only argument which ever get the better of a baby yes he be very like a baby -- thoroughly selfish and thoroughly dependent on other people only he be a clever baby who exaggerate he own helplessness in order to appeal to woman he have a taste for woman and woman naturally like he for he impress they as a irresponsible child astray in a artful and design world they want to protect he even i do at time it be really maternal you know we would infinitely prefer for he to be soft and little so that we could pick he up and cuddle he but as it be he be dangerous he believe whatever he tell himself you see she voice die away and mrs ashmeade fan herself in the fashion addict by perturb woman who nevertheless mean to have they say out -- slowly and impersonally and quite as if she be fan some one else through motive of charity i do not question musgrave say at length that jack be the highly estimable character you describe but -- oh it be all nonsense polly he cry with petulance and with a tinge -- if but the merest nuance -- of conviction lack in he voice the fan continue its majestic sweep from the shade into the sunlight and back again into the shadow without many locust shrill monotonously rudolph i know what you mean by say that fate have not such a fine sense of humor my dear madam it be simply throw out in the heat of conversation -- as a axiom -- for a moment the fan pause then go on as before it be never charge against pauline ashmeade whatever she shortcoming that she be give to unnecessary verbiage colonel musgrave be stride up and down divide between a disposition to swear at the universe at large and a desire to laugh at it somehow it do not occur to he to doubt what she have tell he he comprehend now that chafe under he indebtedness in the affair of mr pendomer charteri would most naturally retaliate by make love to he benefactor 's wife because the colonel also know john charteri and for the rest it be useless to struggle against a fate that plan such preposterous and elaborate joke one might more rationally depend on fate to work out some both ludicrous and horrible solution he reflect remember a little packet of letter hide in he desk nevertheless he pause after a while and laugh with a tolerable affectation of mirth i say -- i -- and what in heaven 's name polly prompt you to bring I this choice specimen of a mare 's - nest because i be fond of you i suppose be not one always privileged to be disagreeable to one 's friend we have be friend a long while you know mr ashmeade be look out over the river now but she seem to see a great way a very great way beyond its glaring water and to be rather uncertain as to whether what she behold there be of a humorous or pathetic nature rudolph do you remember that evening -- the first summer that i know you -- at fortress monroe when we sit upon the pier so frightfully late and the moon rise out of the bay and make a great solid-looking silver path that lead straight over the rim of the world and you talk to I about -- about what now oh yes yes -- i remember perfectly one of the most beautiful evening i ever see i remember it quite distinctly i talk -- i -- and what in the lord 's name do i talk about polly ah man forget a woman never forget when she be really friend with a man i know now you be tell I about anne charteri for you have be in love with she all you life rudolph in you own particular half-hearted and dawdle fashion perhaps that be why you have have so many affair you plainly find the run of woman so unimportant that it put every woman on she pride to prove she be different yes i remember but that night i think you be try to make love to I and i be disappoint in you and -- yes rather pleased woman be all vain and perfectly inconsistent but then girl-children always take after they father mr ashmeade rise from she chair she fan shut with a snap you be a dear boy rudolph when i first know you -- and what i like be that you never make love to I of all the boy i have know and help to form you be the only sensible one -- the only one who never presume that be rather clever of you rudolph it would have be ridiculous for even arithmetically i be older than you would not it have be ridiculous rudolph she demand suddenly not in the least musgrave protest in courteous wise you -- why polly you be a wonderfully handsome woman any boy -- oh yes -- i be i be not now be i rudolph mrs ashmeade throw back she head and laugh naturally ah dear boy that be it be unfair be not it for a old woman to seize upon you in this fashion and insist on you make love to she but i will let you off you do not have to do it she catch she skirt in she left hand preparatory to go and she right hand rest lightly on he arm she speak in a rather peculiar voice yes she say the boy be a very very dear boy and i want the man to be equally brave and -- sensible musgrave stare after she i wonder -- i wonder -- oh no that could not be he say and wearily there must be some preposterous situation that do not come about \* \* \* \* \* and afterward he stroll across the lawn where the locust be shrilling as if in a stubborn prediction of something which be inevitable and he meditate upon a great number of thing there be a host of fleecy little cloud in the sky he look up at they interrogatively and then he smile and shake he head yet i do not know say he for i be come to the conclusion that the world be run on a extremely humorous basis and oddly enough it be at the same moment that patricium -- in lichfield -- reach the same conclusion part seven - yoke we be as time mould we lack wherewithal to shape out nobler fortune or contend against all-patient fate who may not mend the allotted pattern of thing temporal or alter it a jot or e'er let fall a single stitch thereof until at last the web and its drear weaver be overcast and predetermined darkness swallow all they have ordain for we a time to sing a time to love a time wherein to tire of all spend song and kiss carol such elegy as bury dream require love now depart and leave we shiver beside the ember of a burned-out fire paul vanderhoffen _ egerium answer _ i the doctor 's waiting-room smell strongly of antiseptic that be patricium 's predominate think as she wander aimlessly about the apartment she finger its dusty furniture she remember afterward the steel-engraving of jefferson davi and he cabinet with general lee explain some evidently important matter to those attentive and unhumanly stiff politician and she remember too how in depict one statesman who unavoidably sit with he back to the spectator the artist have exceed anatomical possibility in order to obtain a recognizable full-faced portrait yet at the time this picture have not rouse she conscious attention she go presently to the long table austerely decorate with two row of magazine each partly cover by its neighbor just as shingle be place the arrangement irritated she unreasonably she want to disarrange these dog-eared pamphlet to throw they on the floor to destroy they she wonder how many other miserable people have try to read these hateful book while they wait in this abominable room she start when the door of the consultation-room open the doctor be pat the silk glove of a harassed-looking woman in black as he escort she to the outer door and be assure she that everything be go very well indeed and that she be not to worry and so on and presently he speak with patricium for a long while quite levelly of matter which it be not suitable to record discreet man that he be wendell pemberton could not entirely conceal he wonder that patricium should have remain so long in ignorance of she condition he speak concern malformation and functional weakness and although obscurely because of the bugbear of professional courtesy voice he opinion that patricium have not receive the most adroit medical treatment at the time of little roger 's birth she be dividedly conscious of a desire to laugh and of the notion that she must remain outwardly serious because though this horrible pemberton man be talk abject nonsense she would presently be have he as a dinner-guest but what if he be not talk nonsense the possibility consider rouse a sensation of fall through infinity yes yes patricium civilly assent these young doctor have take this out of I and that out of I as you might take the work out of a watch and it have do no good and they be mistake in they first diagnosis because what they take for true osteomalacium be only -- would you mind tell I again oh yes i have only a pseudo-osteomalacic rhachitic pelvis to begin with to think of anybody 's be mistaken about a simple little trouble like that and i suppose i be just bear with it like my mother and all those other luckless woman with musgrave blood in they fehle and schliephake at least consider this variety of pelvic anomaly to be congenital in the majority of case but without go into the question of heredity at all i think it only fair to tell you mrs musgrave -- and pemberton go on talk neither of the two show any emotion the doctor go on talk patricium do not listen the man be talk she comprehend but to she he word seem blur and indistinguishable like a talking-machine when it be not wind up enough she decide subconsciously patricium be think you have two big bead of perspiration on you nose and if i be to allude to the fact you would very probably die of embarrassment aloud patricium say : you mean then that to cap it all a functional disorder of my heart have become organic so that i would inevitably die under another operation or even at a sudden shock and that particular operation be now the solitary chance of save my life the dilemma be neat be not it how god must laugh at the joke he contrive say patricium i wish that i could laugh and i will i do not care whether you think I a reprobate or not dr pemberton i want a good stiff drink of whiskey -- the musgrave size he give it to she ii patricium have as yet a hour to spend in lichfield before she train leave she pass it in the garden of she own home where she have first see rudolph musgrave and he have fight with pevensey all that seem very long ago the dahlia leave she notice be edge with yellow she must look to it that the place be more frequently water and that the bulb be dig up in September next year she mean to set the dahlia thinly like a hedge oh yes i mean to only i will not be alive next year she recollect she go about the garden to see if ned have weed out the wild-pea vine -- a pest which have invade the trim place lately only a few of the intruder remain burnt-out and withered as they be annually by the mid-summer sun there would be no more fight until next April oh and i have pray to you i have always try to do what you want and i never ask you to let I be bear lock up in a good-for-nothing musgrave body and you will not even let I see a wild-pea vine again that be not much to ask i think but you will not let I do it you really do have rather funny notion about you joke she begin to laugh oh very well patricium say aloud it be none of my affair that you elect to run you world on a extremely humorous basis she be at matocton in good time for luncheon iii colonel musgrave have a brief interview with he wife after luncheon he begin with quiet remonstrance and end with a unheard extenuation of he presumption patricium 's speech on this occasion be of a unfettered and heady nature you ought to be ashamed of yourself she say when she have finally pause for breath and have wipe away she tear and have powdered she nose viciously to bully a weak and defenseless woman in this way i dare say everybody in the house have hear we -- brawl and squabbling just like a hod-carrier and he wife what be that you have not say a word for fifteen minute oh la la la well i do not care anyhow i have and i be perfectly sure they hear I and i be sure i do not care in the least and it be all you fault anyway oh but you have a abominable nature rudolph -- a mean and cruel and suspicious nature you bald-headed little charteri be nothing whatever to I and i would have be quite willing to give he up if you have speak to I in a decent manner about it you only _ say _ -- i do not care what you say and besides if you do speak to I in a decent manner it simply show that you thought be so horrid and vulgar that even you be not so abandon as to dare to put they into word very well then i will not be see so much with he in future i realize you be quite capable of beat I if i do not give way to you absurd prejudice yes you be rudolph you be just the sort of man to take pleasure in beat a woman after the exhibition of temper you have give this afternoon i believe you be capable of anything hand I that parasol do not keep on talk to I for i do not wish to hear anything you have to say you be simply drive I to my grave with you continual nagging and abuse and fault-finding i be sure i wish i be dead as much as you do be my hat on straight how do you expect I to see into that mirror if you stand directly in front of it there not content with rob I of every pleasure in life i verily believe you be go to let I go downstairs with my hat cock over one ear and do not you snort and look at I like that i be not go to meet mr charteri i be go drive with felix kennaston he ask I at luncheon i suppose you 'll object to he next you object to all my friend very well now you have make I utterly miserable for the entire afternoon and i be sure i hope you be satisfied there be a rustle of skirt and the door slam iv colonel musgrave go to he own room where he spend a interval in meditation he open he desk and take out a small packet of papers some of which he read listlessly how curiously life re-echoed itself he reflect for here again be castby love-letter potent to breed mischief and he talk with polly ashmeade have be peculiarly reminiscent of he more ancient talk with clarice pendomer everything that happen seem to have happen before but presently he shake he head sigh chance have put into he hand a weapon and a formidable weapon it seem to he but the colonel do not care to use it he prefer to strike with some less grimy cudgel then he ring for one of the servant question he and be inform that mr charteri have go down to the beach just after luncheon a moment later colonel musgrave be walk through the garden in this direction as he come to the thicket which screen the beach he call charteri 's name loudly in order to ascertain he whereabouts and the novelist 's voice answer -- yet not at once but after a brief silence it chance that at this moment musgrave have come to a thin place in the thicket and could plainly see mr charteri he be conceal some white object in the hollow of a log that lay by the river a little later musgrave come out upon the beach and find charteri seat upon the same log a open book upon he knee and look back over he shoulder wonderingly oh say john charteri so it be you rudolph i could not imagine who it be that call yes -- i want a word with you jack now there be five little red-and-white bath-house upon the beach at matocton the nearest of they be some thirty foot from mr charteri it might have be either imagination or the prevalent breeze but musgrave certainly think he hear a door close moreover as he walk around the end of the log he glance downward as in a casual manner and perceive a protrusion which bear a undeniable resemblance to the handle of a parasol musgrave whistle though at the bottom of he heart he be not surprised and then he sit down upon the log and for a moment be silent a beautiful evening say mr charteri musgrave light a cigarette jack i have something rather difficult to say to you -- yes it be deuced difficult and the sooner it be over the better i -- why confound it all man i want you to stop make love to my wife mr charteri 's eyebrow rise really colonel musgrave -- he begin coolly now you be about to make a scene you know say musgrave raise he hand in protest and we be not here for that we be not go to tear any passion to tatters we be not go to rant we be simply go to have a quiet and sensible talk we do not happen to be character in a romance for you be not lancelot you know and i be not up to the part of arthur by a great deal i be not angry i be not jealous nor do i put the matter on any high moral grounds i simply say it will not do -- no hang it it will not do i dare not question you be a authority in such matter say john charteris sweetly -- since among many other clarice pendomer be near enough to be a obtainable witness colonel musgrave grimace but what a gesture he think half-enviously jack charteri quite certainly mean to make the most of the immunity musgrave have purchase for he none the less musgrave have now he cue patricium must be listen and so what colonel musgrave say be : put it that a burnt child dread the fire -- be that a reason he should not warn he friend against it at least say charteri at length you be commendably frank i appreciate that rudolph i honestly appreciate the fact you have come to I not as the husband of that fiction in which kitchen-maids delight breathing fire and speak balderdash but as one sensible man to another let we be frank then let we play with the card upon the table you have charge I with loving you wife and i answer you frankly -- i do she do I the honor to return this affection what then rudolph musgrave blow out a puff of smoke i do not especially mind he say slowly accord to tradition of course i ought to spring at you throat with a smother curse but as a matter of fact i do not see why i should be irritated no in common reason he add upon consideration i be only rather sorry for you both mr charteri spring to he foot and walk up and down the beach ah you hide you feeling well he cry and he laughter be a trifle unconvincing and a bit angry but it be unavail with I i know i know the sick and impotent hatred of I that be seething in you heart and i feel for you the pity you pretend to entertain toward I yes i pity you but what would you have frankly while in many way a estimable man you be no fit mate for patricium she have the sensitive artistic temperament poor girl and only we who be curse with it can tell you what its possession imply and you -- since frankness be the order of the day you know -- well you impress I as be a trifle inadequate it be not you fault perhaps but the fact remain that you have never amount to anything personally you have simply trade upon the accident of be bear a musgrave of matocton in consequence you be enable to marry patricium 's money just as the musgrave of matocton always marry some woman who be able to support they ah but it be she money you marry and not patricia any community of interest between you be impossible and be radically impossible you marriage be a hideous mistake just as mine be for you be starve she soul rudolph just as anne have starve mine and now at last when patricium and i have see we single chance of happiness we can not -- no we can not and we will not -- defer to any outworn tradition or to fear of mr grundy 's narrow-minded prattle charteri sweep aside the dogma of the world with a indignant gesture of somewhat conscious nobility and he turn to he companion in a attitude of defiance musgrave be smile he smoke and seem to enjoy he cigarette the day be approach sunset the sun a glowing ball of copper hang low in the west over a rampart of purple cloud whose height be smear with red a slight almost imperceptible mist rise from the river and where the horizon should have be a dubious cloudland prevail far to the west be orange-colored quivering upon the stream 's surface but nearer the river dimpled with silver-tipped wave and at they foot the water grow transparent and splash over the sleek brown sand and suck back leave a curved line of bubble which one by one wink gape and burst there be a drowsy peacefulness in the air behind they among the beech be many stealthy wood-sound and at long interval a sleepy peevish twittering go about the nested tree in colonel musgrave 's face the primal peace be mirror may i ask say he at length what you propose do mr charteri answer promptly i of course propose say he to ask patricium to share the remainder of my life a euphemism as i take it for a elopement i hardly think you intended go so far rudolph cried charteri draw himself to he full height -- and he be not to blame for the fact that it be but five-feet-six -- i be i hope a honorable man i can not eat you salt and steal you honor so i loot openly or not at all the colonel shrug he shoulder i presuppose you have count the cost -- and estimate the necessary breakage true love the novelist declare in a hushed sweet voice be above such consideration i think say musgrave slowly that any love worthy of the name will always appraise the cost -- to the woman it be of patricium i be think she love I charteri murmur he glance up and laugh upon my soul you know i can not help think the situation a bit farcical -- you and i talk over matter in this fashion but i honestly believe the one chance of happiness for any of we hinge on patricium and I chuck the whole affair and bolt no it will not do -- no hang it jack it will not do musgrave glance toward the bath-house and he lift he voice i be not consider you in the least -- and under the circumstance you could hardly expect I to it be of patricium i be think i have not make she altogether happy we marriage be a mating of incongruity -- and possibly you be justified in call it a mistake yet day in and day out i think we get along as well together as do most couple and it be waste time to cry over spilt milk instead it rest with we the two man who love she to decide what be best for patricium it be she and only she we must consider ah you be right say charteri and he eye grow tender she must have what she most desire and all must be sacrifice to that he turn and speak as simply as a child of course you know i shall be give up a great deal for love of she but -- i be willing musgrave look at he for a moment h be doubtless he assent why then we will not consider the other we will not consider you wife who -- who worship you we will not consider the boy i for my part think it be a mother 's duty to leave a unsullied name to she child but probably my idea be bourgeois we will not consider patricium 's relative who perhaps will find it rather unpleasant in short we must consider no one save patricium of course one can not make a omelet without break a few egg no the question be whether it be absolutely necessary to make the omelet i say no and i quoth charteri smile gently say yes for patricium musgrave go on as in meditation but speak very clearly it mean give up -- everything it mean give up she friend and the life to which she be accustom it mean be ashamed to face those who be formerly she friend we the world we world of lichfield i mean -- be lax enough as to the divorce question heaven know but we can not pardon immorality when couple with poverty and you would be poor you know you book be tremendously clever jack but -- as i happen to know -- the proceeds from they would not support two people in luxury and patricium have nothing that be a sordid detail of course but it be worth consider patricium would never be happy in a three-pair back mr charteri be frankly surprised patricium have -- nothing bless you soul of course not she father leave the greater part of he money to we boy you know most of it be still hold in trust for we boy who be name after he not a penny of it belong to patricium and even i can not touch anything but a certain amount of interest mr charteri look at the colonel with eye that be sad and hurt and wistful i be perfectly aware of you reason for tell I this he say candidly i know i have always be think a mercenary man since my marriage at that time i fancy myself too much in love with anne to permit any sordid consideration of fortune to stand in the way of we union poor anne she little know what sacrifice i have make for she she too would be dreadfully unhappy if i permit she to realize that we marriage be a mistake god help she -- yes groan musgrave and as concern patricia you be entirely right it would be hideously unfair to condemn she to a life of comparative poverty my book sell better than you think rudolph but still a author can not hope to attain affluence so long as he be handicap by any reverence for the english language yes i be about to do patricia a great wrong i rejoice that you have point out my selfishness for i have be abominably selfish i confess it i think so assented musgrave calmly but then my opinion be naturally rather prejudiced yes i can understand what patricium must mean to you -- mr charteri sigh and pass he hand over he forehead in a graceful fashion -- and i also love she far too dearly to imperil she happiness i think that heaven never make a woman more worthy to be love and i have hope -- ah well after all we can not utterly defy society its prejudice however unfounded must be respect what would you have this dunderheaded giantess of a mr grundy condemn I to be miserable and i be powerless the utmost i can do be to refrain from whine over the unavoidable and rudolph you have my word of honor that henceforth i shall bear in mind more constantly my duty toward one of my best and oldest friend i have not deal with you quite honestly i confess it and i ask you pardon mr charteri hold out he hand to seal the compact word of honor query colonel musgrave with a odd quiz sort of fondness for the little novelist as the colonel take the proffer hand why then that be settle and i be glad of it i tell you you know it would not do see you at supper i suppose and rudolph musgrave glance at the bath-house turn on he heel and presently plunge into the beech plantation whistle cheerfully the effect of the melody be somewhat impaired by the apparent necessity of break off at interval in order to smile the comedy have be admirably enact he consider on both side and he do not object to jack charteri 's retire with all the honor of war v the colonel have not go far however before he pause thrust both hand into he trousers ' pocket and stare down at the ground for a matter of five minute musgrave shake he head after all say he i can not trust they patricium be too erratic and too use to have she own way jack will try to break off with she now of course but jack where woman be concern be as weak as water it be not a nice thing to do but -- well one must fight fire with fire thereupon he retrace he step when he have come to the thin spot in the thicket rudolph musgrave leave the path and enter the shrubbery there he composedly sit down in the shadow of a small cedar the sight of he wife upon the beach in converse with mr charteri do not appear to surprise colonel musgrave patricium be speak quickly she hold a bedraggled parasol in one hand she husband note with a faint thrill of wonder that at time and in a rather unwholesome elfish way patricium be actually beautiful she big eye glow they flash with change light as deep water glitter in the sun she copper-colored hair seem luminous and she cheek flush arbutus-like the soft white stuff that gown she have the look of foam against the gray sky she seem a freakish spirit in the act of vanish for sky and water be all one lambent gray by this in the west be a thin smear of orange but for the rest the world be of a uniform and gleaming gray she and charteri stand in the heart of a great pearl ah believe I she be say rudolph be not a ophthalmic bat but god keep we all respectable be rudolph 's notion of a sensible morning-prayer so he just prefer to see nothing and bleat out edifying axiom that be one of he favorite trick no it be a comedy for my benefit i tell you he will allow a deal for the artistic temperament no doubt but he do not suppose you fetch along a white-lace parasol when you go to watch a sunset -- especially a parasol he give I last month indeed protest mr charteri he see nothing i be too quick for he she shrug she shoulder i see he look at it accordingly i pay no attention to what he say but you -- ah jack you be splendid i suppose we shall have to elope at once now though charteri give she no immediate answer i be not quite sure patricium that you husband be not -- to a certain extent -- in the right believe I he do not know you be about he approach I in a perfectly sensible manner and exhibit commendable self-restraint he have play a difficult part to admiration i could not have do it better myself and it be not for we who have be endow with gift deny to rudolph to reproach he for lack the finer perception and sensibility of life yet i must admit that for the time i be a little hurt by he evident belief that we would allow we feeling for each other -- which be rather beyond he comprehension be not it dear -- to be coerce by mercenary consideration oh rudolph be just a jackass-fool anyway she be not particularly interested in the subject he can not help that you know charteri remind she gently then he ask after a little : i suppose it be all true that what be true about you have no money of you own he laugh but she could see how deeply he have be pained by musgrave 's suspicion i ask because as you husband have discover i be utterly sordid my lady and care only for you wealth ah how can you expect a man like that to understand -- you why jack how ridiculous in you to be hurt by what the brute think you be as solemn as a owl my dear yes it be true enough my father be not very well pleased with we -- and that horrid will -- ah jack jack how grotesque how characteristic it be he think such thing would influence you -- you of all man who scarcely know what money be it be even more grotesque i should have be pained by he think it charteri say sadly but what would you have i be so abominably in love with you that it seem a sort of desecration when the man lug you name into a discussion of money-matter it really do and then besides -- ah my lady you know that i would glory in the thought that i have give up all for you you know i think that i would willingly work my finger to the bone just that i might possess you always so i have dream of love in a cottage -- a idyl of blissful poverty where cupid contents himself with crust and kiss and mock at the proverbial wolf on the doorstep and i give you my word that until to-day i have not suspect how blindly selfish i have be for poor old prosaic rudolph be in the right after all you delicate tender beauty must not be drag down to face the unlovely reality and petty deprivation and squalid makeshift of such a existence as ours would be true i would glory in they -- ah luxury and riches mean little to I my dear and i can conceive of no greater happiness than to starve with you but true love know how to sacrifice itself you husband be right it would not be fair to you patricia you -- you be go to leave I yes and i pray that i may be strong enough to relinquish you forever because you welfare be more dear to I than my own happiness no i do not pretend that this be easy to do but when my misery be earn by serve you i prize my misery charteri try to smile what would you have i love you he say simply ah my dear she cry musgrave 's heart be sick within he as he hear the same note in she voice that echo in anne 's voice when she speak of she husband this be a new patricium she speech be low and gentle now and she eye hold a light rudolph musgrave have not see there for a long while ah my dear you be the noblest man i have ever know i wish we woman could be like man but oh jack jack do not be quixotic i can not give you up my dear -- that would never be for my good think how unhappy i have be all these year think how rudolph be starve my soul i want to be free jack i want to live my own life -- for at least a month or so -- patricium shiver here but none of we be sure of live for a month you have show I a glimpse of what life might be do not let I sink back into the old humdrum existence from a foolish sense of honor i tell you i should go mad i mean to have my fling while i can get it and i mean to have it with you jack -- just you i do not fear poverty you could write some more wonderful book i could work too jack dear i -- i could teach music -- or take in wash -- or something anyway lot of woman support themselves you know oh jack we would be so happy do not be honorable and brave and disagreeable jack dear for a moment charteri be silent the nostril of he beak-like nose widen a little and a curious look come into he face he discover something in the sand that interest he after all he demand slowly be it necessary -- to go away -- to be happy i do not understand she hand lift from he arm then quick remorse smite she and it flutter back confidingly charteri rise to he foot it be doubtless a very spectacular and very stir performance to cast you cap over the wind-mill in the face of the world but after all be it not a bit foolish patricium lot of people manage these thing -- more quietly oh jack patricium 's face turn red then white and stiffen in a sort of sick terror she be a frightened columbine in stone i think you care for I -- really not -- that way patricium rise and speak with composure i think i 'll go back to the house mr charteri it be a bit chilly here you need not bother to come then mr charteri laugh -- a choke sob laugh he raise he hand impotently toward heaven and to think he cry to think that a man may love a woman with he whole heart -- with all that be best and noblest in he -- and she understand he so little i do not think i have misunderstand you patricium say in a crisp voice you proposition be very explicit i -- be sorry i think i have find one thing in the world which i would regret to leave -- and you really believe that i could sully the great love i bear you by stoop to -- that you really believe that i would sacrifice to you my home life my honor my prospects -- all that a man can give -- without test the quality of you love you do not know that i speak to try you -- you actually do not know eh but yours be a light nature patricium i do not reproach you for you be only as you narrow philistine life have make you yet i have hope better thing of you patricia but you who pretend to care for I have leap at you first opportunity to pain I -- and if it be any comfort to you i confess you have pained I beyond word and he sink down on the log and bury he face in he hand she come to he -- it be pitiable to see how she come to he laugh and sob all in one breath -- and kneel humbly by he side and raise a grieve shame penitent face to he forgive I she wail oh forgive I you have pained I beyond word patricium he repeat he be not angry -- only sorrowful and very much hurt ah jack dear jack forgive I mr charteri sigh but of course i forgive you patricium he say i can not help it though that i be foolishly sensitive where you be concerned and i have hope you know as much she be happy now dear boy she murmur do not you see it be just these constant proof of the greatness and the wonderfulness of you love -- really though jack be not it too horrid of I to misunderstand you so be you quite sure you be forgive I entirely -- without any nasty little reservation mr charteri be quite sure he face be still sad but it be benevolent do not you see she go on that it be just these thing that make I care for you so much and feel sure as egg be egg we will be happy ah jack we will be so utterly happy that i be almost afraid to think of it patricium wipe away the last tear and laugh and add in a matter-of-fact fashion : there be a train at six-five in the morning we can leave by that before anyone be up charteri start you husband love you he say in gentle reproof and quite candidly you know rudolph be worth ten of I bah i tell you that be a comedy for my benefit she protest and begin to laugh patricium be unutterably happy now because she and not john charteri have be in the wrong poor rudolph -- he have such a smug horror of the divorce-court that he would even go so far as to pretend to be in love with he own wife in order to keep out of it really jack both we better-half be horribly commonplace and they will be much better off without we you forget that rudolph have my word of honor say mr charteri in indignation and that instant with one of he baffling change of mood he begin to laugh really though patricium you be very pretty you be April embody in sweet flesh you soul be just a wisp of April cloud and you life a April day half sun that only seem to warm and half tempest that only play at ferocity but you be very pretty that be why i be think light-headedly it would be a fine and past doubt a agreeable exploit to give up everything for such a woman and be complacently compare myself to antony at actium i be think it would be a interesting episode in one 's _ life and letter _ you see my dear i honestly believe the world revolve around john charteri -- although of course i would never admit that to you if i think for a moment you would take I seriously then presently sigh he be grave again but no rudolph have my word of honor mr charteri repeat and with unconcealed regret ah do that matter she cry do anything matter except that we love each other i tell you i have give the best part of my life to that man but i mean to make the most of what be leave he have have my youth my love -- there be a time you know when i actually fancy i care for he -- and he have only make I unhappy i hate he i loathe he i detest he i despise he i never intend to speak to he again -- oh yes i shall have to at supper i suppose but that do not count and i tell you i mean to be happy in the only way that be possible everyone have a right to do that a woman have a especial right to take she share of happiness in any way she can because she hour of it be so short sometimes -- sometimes the woman know how short it be and it almost frighten she but at best a woman can be really happy through love alone jack dear and it be only when we be young and good to look at that man care for we after that there be nothing left but to take to either religion or hand-embroidery so what do it matter after all yes they all grow tired after a while jack i be only a vain and frivolous person of superlative charm but i love you very much my dear and i solemnly swear to commit suicide the moment my first wrinkle arrive you shall never grow tired of I my dear she laugh to think how true this be she hurry on : jack kneel down at once and swear that you be perfectly sore with loving I as that ridiculous person say in dickens and whose name i never could remember oh i forget -- dickens caricature nature do not he and be not read by really culture people you will have to educate I up to you level jack and i warn you in advance you will not have time to do it yes i be quite aware that i be talk nonsense and be on the verge of hysteric thank you but i rather like it it be because i be go to have you all to myself for whatever future there be and the thought make I quite drunk will you kindly ring for the patrol-wagon jack jack be you quite sure you love I be you perfectly certain you never love any one else half so much no do not answer I for i intend to do all the talk for both of we for the future i shall tyrannize over you frightfully and you will like it all i ask in return be that you will be a good boy -- by which i mean a naughty boy -- and do solemnly swear promise and affirm that you will meet I at the side-door at half-past five in the morning with a portmanteau and the intention of never go back to you wife you swear it thank you so much now i think i would like to cry for a few minute and after that we will go back to the house before supper be over and my eye be perfectly crimson in fact mr charteri have consent patricium be irresistible as she plead and mock and scold and coax and laugh and cry all in one bewildering breath she plan be simple it be to slip out of matocton at dawn and walk to the near-by station there they would take the train and snap they finger at convention the scheme sound preposterous in outline but she demonstrate its practicability in performance and mr charteri consent rudolph musgrave sit in the shadow of the cedar with fierce and confused emotion whirling in he soul he certainly have never think of this contingency part eight - harvest time be i covet the woe they rue whose love commemorate they -- i that mean to get like grace of love then -- and intent to win as they have do love 's plenitude rapture and havoc vauntingly i sue that love like theirs might make a toy of I at will caress at will -lrb- if publicly -rrb- demolish as love find or find not good to-day i be no longer overbrave i have a fever -- i that always know this hour be certain -- and be too weak to rave too tired to seek -lrb- as later i must do -rrb- try remedy -- time manhood and the grave -- to drug abate and banish love of you allen rossiter _ a fragment _ i when patricium and charteri have leave the beach colonel musgrave part the underbrush and step down upon the sand he must have air -- air and a open place wherein to fight this out night have rise about he in bland emptiness there be no star overhead but a patient weary ancient moon push through the cloud the tree and the river confer with one another doubtfully he pace up and down the beach musgrave laugh in the darkness he heart be race racing in he and he thought be blow foam he raise he hat and bow fantastically in the darkness because the colonel love he gesture signor lucifer i present my compliment you have discourse with I very plausibly i honor you cunning signor but if you be indeed a gentleman as i have always hear you will now withdraw and permit I to regard the matter from a standpoint other than my own for the other be weak signor as you have doubtless discover good woman and bad man be the weakest of they sex i be the strongest among they for all that i be no hercule and the outcome of this matter must rest with I so he sit presently upon the log where charteri have sit when musgrave come to this beach at sunset very long ago that seem now for now the colonel be tire -- physically outwear it seem to he as if after prolonged exertion -- and now the moon look down upon he passionless cold inexorable and seem to await the colonel 's decision and it be woefully hard to come to any decision for as you know by this it be the colonel 's beset infirmity to shrink from make change instinctively he balk -- under shelter of whatever grandiloquent excuse -- against commission of any action which would alter he relation with accustomed circumstance or person to guide event be never he forte as he forlornly know and here he be condemn perforce to play that uncongenial rôle with slender chance of reward yet always anne 's face float in the darkness always anne 's voice whisper through the lisping of the beech through the murmur of the water he sit thus for a long while ii musgrave be not unnaturally late for supper it be not to be suppose that at this meal the colonel falter in he duty as a host for to the contrary he narrate several anecdote in he neatest style it be with he a point of honor always to be in company the social triumph of he generation he observe with idle interest that charteri and patricium avoid each other in a rather marked manner both seem a trifle more serious than they be wont to be after supper tom gelwix bring forth a mandolin and most of the house-party sing song sentimental and otherwise upon the front porch of matocton anne have disappear somewhere musgrave subsequently discover she in one of the drawing-rooms puzzling over a number of papers which she maid have evidently just bring to she mr charteri look up with a puckered brow rudolph say she have not you a account at the occidental bank hardly a account dear lady -- merely a deposit large enough to entitle I to receive monthly notice that i have overdrawn it why then of course you have a cheque-book horrible thing be not they -- such a nuisance remember to fill out those little stub of course i forget to bring mine with I -- i always do and equally of course a vexatious debt turn up and find I without a occidental bank cheque to my name musgrave be amuse that say he be easily remedy i will get you one though even if -- ah well what be the good of try to teach you adorable woman anything about business you shall have you indispensable blank form in three minute he return in rather less than that time with the cheque anne be alone now she be gown in some dull soft yellow stuff and sit by a small marble-topped table twiddle a fountain-pen you must not sneer at my business method rudolph she say pout a little as she fill out the cheque it be not polite sir in the first place and in the second i be really very methodical of course i be always lose my cheque-book and draw cheque and forget to enter they and i usually put down the same deposit two or three time -- all woman do that but otherwise i be really very careful i manage all the account i can not expect jack to do that you know mr charteri sign she name with a flourish and nod at the colonel wisely dear infant but he be quite too horribly unpractical do you know this bill have be due -- oh for month -- and he forget it entirely until this evening fortunately he can settle it to-morrow those disagreeable publisher of he have telegraph for he to come to new york at once you know otherwise -- dear dear but marry a genius be absolutely ruinous to one 's credit be not it rudolph the tradespeople will refuse to trust we soon involuntarily musgrave have see the cheque it be for a considerable amount and it be make out to john charteri beyond doubt say musgrave in he soul jack be colossal he be actually draw on he wife for the necessary expense for run away with another woman the colonel sit down abruptly before the great open fireplace and stare hard at the pine-bough which be heap up in it a penny say she at length he glance up with a smile my dear madam it would be robbery for a penny you may read of the subject of my thought in any of the yellow journal only far more vividly set forth and obtain a variety of more or less savory addition to boot i be think of the lethbury case and wonder how we could have be so long deceive by the man ah poor mr lethbury anne sigh i be very sorry for she rudolph she be a good woman and be always interested in charitable work do you know say colonel musgrave with deliberation it be she i can not understand to discover that he have be systematically hoodwink she for some ten year that after make away with as much of she fortune as he be able to lay hand on he have betray business trust after business trust in order to -- to maintain another establishment that he have never care for she and have make she he dupe time after time in order to obtain money for he gambling debt and other even less reputable obligation -- she must realize all these thing now you know and one would have think no woman 's love could possibly survive such a test yet she be stand by he through thick and thin yes i confess amelia lethbury puzzle I i do not understand she mental attitude musgrave be look at anne very intently as he end why but of course say anne she realize that it be all the fault of that -- that other woman and besides the -- the entanglement have be go on only a little over eight year -- not ten rudolph she be entirely in earnest colonel musgrave could see it plainly i admit i have not look on it in that light say he at length and be silent for a moment then upon my soul anne he cry i believe you think the woman be only do the natural thing only do the thing one have a right to expect of she in stick to that blackguard after she have find he out mr charteri raise she eyebrow she be really surprised naturally she must stand by she husband when he be in trouble why if he own wife do not who would rudolph it be just now that he need she most it would be abominable to desert he now anne pause and think depend upon it she know a better side of he nature than we can see she know he possibly to have be mislead or to have act thoughtlessly because otherwise she would not stand by he so firmly have reach this satisfactory conclusion anne begin to laugh -- at musgrave 's lack of penetration probably so you see rudolph in either case she conduct be perfectly natural and this he cry this be how woman reason be i very stupid jack say i be a bit illogical at time but rudolph you must not expect a woman to judge the man she love if you call on she to do that she do not reason about it she just go on love he and think how horrid you be woman love man as they do child they punish they sometimes but only in deference to public opinion a woman will always find a excuse for the man she love if he desert she she be miserable until she succeed in demonstrate to herself it be entirely she own fault after that she be properly repentant but far less unhappy and anyhow she go on love he just the same the colonel ponder over this woman be different he say i do not know i think that if all woman could be throw with good man they would all be good woman want to be good but there come a time to each one of they when she want to make a certain man happy and want that more than anything else in the world and then of course if he want -- very much -- for she to be bad she will be bad a bad woman be always to be explain by a bad man anne nod very wisely then she begin to laugh but this time at herself i be talk quite like a book she say really i have no idea i be so clever but i have think of this before rudolph and be sorry for those poor woman who -- who have not find the right sort of man to care for yes musgrave 's face be alert you have be luckier than most anne he say lucky she cry and that queer little thrill of happiness wake again in she rich voice ah you do not know how lucky i have be rudolph i have never care for any one except -- well yes you a great while ago -- and jack and you be both good man ah rudolph it be very dear and sweet and foolish the way we love each other but you do not mind -- very very much -- do you if i think jack be the best man in the world and by far the best man in the world for I he be so good to I he be so good and kind and considerate to I and even after all these year of matrimony he be always the lover a woman appreciate that rudolph she want she husband to be always she lover just as jack be and never to give in when she coax -- because she only coax when she know she be in the wrong -- and never never to let she see he shave himself if a husband observe these simple rule rudolph he wife will be a happy woman and jack do in consequence every day i live i grow fonder of he and appreciate he more and more he grow upon I just as a taste for strong drink might without he -- without he -- anne 's voice die away then she face musgrave indignantly oh rudolph she cry how horrid of you how mean of you to come here and suggest the possibility of jack 's die or run away from I or do anything dreadful like that colonel musgrave be smile i say he equably my dear madam if you will reconsider -- no she concede after deliberation it be not exactly you fault i get start on the subject of jack and imagine all sort of horrible and impossible thing but there be a sort of a something in the air to-night probably a storm be come down the river so i feel very morbid and very foolish rudolph but then i be in love you see be not it funny after all these year anne ask with a smile -- and so you be not to be angry rudolph my dear he say i assure you the emotion you raise in I be very far from resemble that of anger musgrave rise and laugh i fear you know we will create a scandal if we sit here any longer let 's see what the other be do iii that night after he guest have retire colonel musgrave smoke a cigarette on the front porch of matocton the moon now in the zenith be bright and chill after a while musgrave raise he face toward it and laugh be not it -- be not it funny he demand echo anne 's query ruefully eh well perhaps i still retain some linger hope in a season of discomfort most of we look vaguely for a miracle and at time it come but more often not life be not always a pantomime with a fairy god-mother wait to break through the darkness in a burst of glory and reunite the sever lover and transform they enemy into pantaloons in this case it be certain that the fairy will not come i be condemn to be my own god in the machine have demonstrate this to himself musgrave go into the house and drug he mind correct proofsheet -- for the _ lichfield historical association 's quarterly magazine _ -- and bring down to the year 1805 he list of will record in brummell county iv the night be well advance when charteri step noiselessly into the room the colonel be then sedately write amid a host of motionless mute watcher for at matocton most of the portrait hang in the east drawing-room thus above the great marble mantel -- carve with thyrsus and support by proud deep-bosomed caryatide -- you will find burly sebastian musgrave the speaker a all-overbearing man even on canvas paint I among duke and earl with my hat on to show i be in all thing a republican and the finest diamond in the colony shall be yours he have direct the painter and this be do then there be frail wilhelmina musgrave -- that famed beauty whose two-hundred-year-old story all lichfield know and no genealogist have ever care to detail -- eternally weave flower about she shepherd hat there too be evelyn ramsay before whose roguish loveliness as you may remember the colonel have snap he finger in those roseate day when he so joyously consider he profound unworthiness to be patricium 's husband there be also the colonial governor of albemarle -- a van dyck this -- two kneller and lely 's portrait of thoma musgrave the poet with serious blue eye and flaxen hair the painting of captain george musgrave who distinguish himself at the siege of cartagena be admittedly a inferior piece of work but it have vigor none the less and below it hang the sword which be present to he by the lord high admiral so quietly do charteris come that the colonel be not aware of he entrance until the novelist have cough gently he be in a dressing-gown and look unusually wizened i see you light he say i do not seem to be able to sleep somehow it be so infernally hot and still i suppose there be go to be a thunderstorm i hate thunderstorm they frighten I the little man be speak like a peevish child oh well -- it will at least clear the air say rudolph musgrave sit down and have a smoke will not you no thanks charteri have go to the bookshelf and be gently push and pull at the book so as to arrange they back in a mathematically straight line i think i would borrow something to read -- why this be the tennyson you have at college be not it yes i remember it perfectly these two have room together through they college day yes it be the old tennyson and yonder be the identical swinburne you use to spout from too lord jack it seem a century since i use to listen by the hour to _ the triumph of time and dolore _ ah but you do not really care for they -- not even then charteri reach up he back still turn and move a candlestick the fraction of a inch there be something so disgustingly wholesome about you rudolph and it appear to be ineradicable i can not imagine how i ever come to be fond of you the colonel be twirl he pen he eye intent upon it and yet -- we _ be _ fond of each other be not we jack why i positively adore you you be such a strong and healthy animal upon my word i do not believe i ever miss a single football game you play in in fact i almost learn to understand the game on you account you see -- it be so good to watch you rage about with touzled hair like the only original bull of bashan and the other tumble like ninepin it use to make I quite inordinately proud the colonel smoke but lord how proud _ i _ be when you get medal yes -- i remember even if i do bully you sometimes remember how i use to twist you arm to make you write my latin exercise jack i like to have you do that charteri say simply it hurt a great deal but i like it he have come up behind the colonel who be still seat yes that be a long while ago say charteri it be rather terrible -- be not it -- to reflect precisely how long ago it be why i shall be bald in a year or two from now but you have keep almost all you beautiful hair rudolph charteri touch the colonel 's head stroke he hair ever so lightly once or twice it be in effect a caress the colonel be aware of the odor of myrrh which always accompany charteri and feel that the little man be tremble be not there -- anything you want to tell I jack the colonel say he sit quite still there be the tiniest pause the caress finger-tip lift from musgrave 's head but presently give it one more brief and half-timid touch why only _ au revoir _ i believe i be leave at a rather ungodly hour to-morrow and will not see you but i hope to return within the week i hope so jack and after all it be too late to be read i shall go back to bed and take more trional and then i dare say i shall sleep so good-by rudolph good-night jack oh yes -- i mean good-night of course the colonel sigh then he speak abruptly : no just a moment jack i do not ask you to come here to-night but since you have come by chance i be go to follow the prompting of that chance and strike a blow for righteousness with soil weapon jack do you remember suggest that my father 's correspondence during the war might be of value and that he desk ought to be overhaul why yes of course mr musgrave be tell I she begin the task say charteri and smile a little unluckily yes -- but -- well in any event it suggest to I that old letter be dangerous i really have no idea what that desk contain my father have preserve great stack of letter i have be go through they they be most of they from woman -- letter which should never have be write in the first place and which he certainly have no right to keep what and be ` wild will 's ' love-correspondence still extant i fancy it make interesting reading rudolph there be some letter which in a measure concern you jack the colonel hand he a small packet of letter if you will read the top one it will explain i will just go on with my write he write steadily for a moment or two then charteri laugh musically i have always know there be a love-affair between my mother and ` wild will ' but i never suspect until to-night that i have the honor to be you half-brother rudolph -- one of ` wild will 's ' innumerable bastard charteri be pallid and though he seem perfectly compose he eye glitter as with gusty brilliancy i understand now why my reputed father always make such a difference between my sister and myself i never like old alvin charteri you know it be a distinct relief to be inform i have no share in he blood although of course the knowledge come a trifle suddenly perhaps i should have keep that knowledge to myself i know it would have be kinder i have mean to be kind i loathe myself for dabble in this mess but in view of all thing it seem necessary to let you know i be you own brother in the flesh and that patricium be you brother 's wife i see say charteri accord to you standard that would make a great difference i do not know speak frankly that it make much difference with I he turn again to the bookshelf so that musgrave could no longer see he face charteri run he finger caressingly over the back of a row of volume i love my mother rudolph i never love anyone else that make a difference then he say we musgrave -- how patly i catalogue myself already -- we musgrave have a deal to answer for rudolph and do not that make it all the more we duty to live clean and honest life to make the debt no greater than it be both man be oddly quiet eh i be not so sure john charteri wave airily toward sebastian musgrave 's counterfeit then toward the other portrait it be they who compound we inheritance rudolph -- all that we be to have in this world of wit and strength and desire and endurance we know they history they be proud brave and thriftless a greedy and lecherous race who squeeze life dry as one do a orange and leave we the dregs i think that it be droll but i be not sure it place we under any obligation in fact i rather think god owe we a apology rudolph he speak with quaint wistfulness the colonel sit regard he in silence with shocked disapproving eye then charteri cock he head to one side and grin like a hobgoblin what would not you give he demand to know what i be really think of at this very moment while i talk so calmly well you will never know and for the rest you be at liberty to use you all-important document as you may elect i be john charteris whatever man beget my body he be rotten bone to-day and it be as such i value he i be never anybody 's son -- or friend or brother or lover -- but just a pen that someone far bigger and far nobler than john charteri write with occasionally whereas you -- but oh you be funny rudolph and then good-night dear brother charteri add sweetly as he leave the room \* \* \* \* \* and rudolph musgrave could not quite believe in the actuality of what have just happen in common with most of we he get he general notion concern the law of life from read fiction and here be the material for a renaissance tragedy waste so far as any dénouement go destiny once more be hardly rise to the possibility of the situation the weapon chance have forge have fail rudolph musgrave utterly and indeed he wonder now how he could ever have esteem it formidable jack be he half-brother in noveldom or in a melodrama this discovery would have transform they mutual dealings but as a workaday world 's fact musgrave would not honestly say that it have in any way affect he feeling toward jack and it appear to have leave charteri equally unaltered i be not sure though we can only guess where jack be concern he go he own way always tricky and furtive and lonelier than any other human be i have ever know it be loneliness that look out of he eye really even when he be mock and sneer the colonel meditate then he sigh and go back to the tabulation of he list of will v the day be grow strong in the maple-grove behind matocton as yet the climb sun fire only the topmost branch and flood they with a temper radiance through which bird plunge and shrill vague rumor to one another beneath a green twilight linger -- twilight which hold a gem-like glow chill and lucent and steady as that of a emerald vagrant little puff of wind bustle among the leaf with a thin pretense of purpose and then lapse and merge in the large ambiguous whispering which go stealthily about the grove rudolph musgrave sit on a stone beside the road that wind through the wood toward the railway station and smoke nervously he be dishearten of the business of living and absurdly enough as it seem to he he be hungry it have to be do quietly and without the remotest chance of anne 's ever hearing of it and without the remotest chance of its ever have to be do again i have about fifteen minute in which to convince patricium both of she own folly and of the fact that jack be a unmitigated cad and to get he off the place quietly so that anne will suspect nothing and i never know any reasonable argument to appeal to patricium and jack will be a cornered rat yes it be a large contract and i would give a great deal -- a very great deal -- to know how i be go to fulfil it at this moment he wife and mr charteri carry two portmanteau come around a bend in the road not twenty foot from musgrave they be both rather cross in the clean and more prosaic light of morning a elopement seem almost silly moreover patricium have have no breakfast and charteri have be much annoy by he wife who have breakfast with he and have insist on drive to the station with he it be a trivial-seeming fact but perhaps not unworthy of notice that patricium be carry she own portmanteau as well as a umbrella the three face one another in the cool twilight the wood stir lazily about they the bird be singing on a wager now ah say colonel musgrave so you have come at last i have be expect you for some time patricium drop she portmanteau sullenly mr charteri place he with care to the side of the road and say oh it be perhaps the only observation that occur to he patricium musgrave begin very kindly and very gravely you be about to do a foolish thing at the bottom of you heart even now you know you be about to do a foolish thing -- a thing you will regret bitterly and unavailingly for the rest of time you be turn you back on the world -- we world -- on the one possible world you could ever be happy in you can not be happy in the half-world patricium you be not that sort but you can never come back to we then patricia it do not matter what the motive be what the temptation be or how great the repentance be -- you can not ever return that be the law patricium perhaps it be not always a just law we do not make it you and i but it be the law and we must obey it we world merely say that leave it once you can not ever return : such be the only punishment it award you for it know this wise old world of ours that such be the bitterest punishment which could ever be devise for you we world have make you what you be in every thought and ideal and emotion you possess you be a product of we world you could not live in the half-world patricium you be a product of we world that can never take root in that alien soil come back to we before it be too late patricium musgrave shake himself all over rather like a newfoundland dog come out of the water and the grave note die from he voice he smile and rub he hand together and now say he i will stop talk like a problem play and we will say no more about it give I you portmanteau my dear and upon my word of honor you will never hear a word further from I in the matter jack here can take the train just as he intend and -- and you and i will go back to the house and have a good hot breakfast together eh patricium she be think unreasonably enough how big and strong and clean she husband look in the grow light it be a pity jack be so small however she face musgrave coldly and think how ludicrously wide of the mark be all these threat of ostracism she shudderingly wish he would not talk of soil and take root and hideous thing like that but otherwise the colonel leave she unmoved he be certainly good-looking though charteri be light a cigarette with a queer contented look he know the value of patricium 's stubbornness now still he appear to be use a unnecessary number of match i should have think you would have perceive the lack of dignity as well as the utter uselessness in make such a scene patricium say we be not suit for each other rudolph and it be better -- far better for both of we -- to have do with the farce of pretend to be i be sorry that you still care for I i do not know that but for the future i intend to live my own life patricium 's voice falter and she stretch out she hand a little toward she husband in a odd gust of friendliness he look so kind and he be not smile in that way she never like surely that be not so unpardonable a crime rudolph she ask almost humbly no my dear he answer it be not unpardonable -- it be impossible you can not lead you own life patricium none of we can each life be bind up with many other and every rash act of yours every hasty word of yours must affect to some extent the life of those who be nearest and most dear to you but oh it be not argument that i would be at patricium there be a woman once -- she be young and wealthy and -- ah well i will not deceive you by exaggerate she personal attraction i will serve up to you no praise of she sauce with lie but fate and nature have combine to give she everything a woman can desire and all this that woman freely give to I -- to I who have not youth or wealth or fame or anything and i can not stand by for that dear dead girl 's sake and watch you life go wrong patricium you be just like the rest of they olaf -- and when have she use that half-forgotten nickname last he wonder you imagine you be in love with a girl because you happen to like the color of she eye or because there be a curve about she lip that appeal to you that be not love olaf as we woman understand it and wildly hideous and sad it seem to colonel musgrave -- this dreary parody of they old love-talk only he dimly know that she have forget john charteri exist and that to she this moment seem no less sardonic charteri inhale lazily yet he do not like the tremble about patricium 's mouth she hand too open and shut tight before she speak it be too late now she say dully i give you all there be to give you give I just what grandma pendomer and all the other have leave you able to give that remnant be not love olaf as we woman understand it and anyhow it be too late now yet patricium be remember a time when rudolph 's voice hold always that grave tender note in speak to she it seem a great while ago and he be big and manly just like he voice rudolph be and he look very kind desperately patricium begin to count over the time she husband have offend she have not he talk to she in the most unwarrantable manner only yesterday afternoon too late -- oh not a bit of it musgrave cry he voice sink persuasively why patricium you be only think the matter over for the first time you have only begin to think of it why there be the boy -- we boy patricium surely you have not think of roger he have find the right chord at last it quiver and thrill under he touch and the sense of mastery leap in he blood of a sudden he know himself dominant she face be red then white and she eye waver before the blaze of he that hold she compellingly now honestly just between you and I the colonel say confidentially be there ever a better and braver and quainter and handsomer boy in the world why patricium surely you would not willingly -- of you own accord -- go away from he and never see he again oh you have not think i tell you think patricium do not you remember that first day when i come into you room at the hospital and he -- ah how wrinkled and red and old-looking he be then be not he little wife do not you remember how he be lie on you breast and how i take you both in my arm and hold you close for a moment and how for a long long while there be not anything leave of the whole wide world except just we three and god smile down upon we do not you remember patricium do not you remember he first tooth -- why we be as proud of he you and i as if there have never be a tooth before in all the history of the world do not you remember the first day he walk why he stagger a great distance -- oh nearly two yard -- and catch hold of my hand and laugh and turn back -- to you you do not run away from he then patricium be you go to do it now she struggle under he look she have a absurd desire to cry just that he might console she she know he would why be it so hard to remember that she hate rudolph of course she hate he she love that other man yonder he name be jack she turn toward charteri and the reassuring smile with which he greet she impressed patricium as be singularly nasty she hate both of they she want -- in that brief time which remain for have anything -- only she boy she soft warm little roger who have eye like rudolph 's i -- i -- it be too late rudolph she stammer parrot-like if you have only take better care of I rudolph if -- no it be too late i tell you you will be kind to roger i be only weak and frivolous and heartlesss i be not fit to be he mother i be not fit rudolph rudolph i tell you i be not fit ah let I go my dear -- in mercy let I go for i have not love the boy as i ought to and i be afraid to look you in the face and you will not let I take my eye away -- you will not let I ah rudolph let I go not fit he voice thrill with strength and pulsed with tender cadence ah patricium i be not fit to be he father but between we -- between we might not we do much for he come back to we patricium -- to I and the boy we need you my dear ah i be only a stolid unattractive fogy i know but you love I once and -- i be the father of you child my standard be out-of-date perhaps and in any event they be not you standard and that difference have break many tie between we but i be the father of you child you must -- you _ must _ come back to I and the boy musgrave catch she face between he hand and lift it toward he patricium do not make any mistake there be nothing you care for so much as that boy you can not give he up if you have to walk over red-hot ploughshare to come to he you would do it if you could win he a moment 's happiness by a lifetime of poverty and misery and degradation you would do it and so would i little wife that be the tie which still unite we that be the tie which be too strong ever to break come back to we patricium -- to I and the boy i -- jack jack take I away she wail helplessly charteri come forward with a smile he be quite sure of patricium now colonel musgrave he say with a faint drawl if you have entirely finish you edifying and i assure you highly entertaining monologue i will ask you to excuse we i -- oh man man charteris cry not unkindly do not you see it be the only possible outcome musgrave face he the glow of hard-earned victory be pulse in the colonel 's blood but he eye be chill star now jack he say equably i be go to talk to you in fact i be go to discharge a agreeable duty toward you musgrave draw close to he charteri shrug he shoulder he smile however be not entirely satisfactory it do not suggest enjoyment i do not blame you for be what you be musgrave go on curtly you be bear so doubtless i do not blame a snake for be what it be but when i see a snake i claim the right to set my foot on its head when i see a man like you -- well this be the right i claim thereupon rudolph musgrave strike he half-brother in the face with he open hand the colonel be a strong man physically and on this occasion he make no effort to curb he strength now musgrave conclude you be go away from this place very quickly and you be go alone you will do this because i tell you to do so and because you be afraid of I understand also -- if you will be so good -- that the only reason i do not give you a thorough thrashing be that i do not think you be worth the trouble i only want patricium to perceive exactly what sort of man you be the blow stagger charteri he seem to grow smaller he clothes seem to hang more loosely about he he face be paper-white and the red mark show plainly upon it there would be no earthly sense in my hit you back he say equably it would only necessitate my get the thrashing which i can assure you we be equally anxious to avoid of course you be able to knock I down and so on because you be nearly twice as big as i be i fail to see that prove anything in particular come patricium and he turn to she and reach out he hand she shrink from he she draw away from he without any vehemence as if he have be some slimy harmless reptile a woman do not like to see fear in a man 's eye and there be fear in mr charteri 's eye for all that he smile patricium 's heart sicken she loathe he and she be a little sorry for he oh you cur you cur she gasp in a wonder whisper patricium go to she husband and hold out she hand she be afraid of he she be proud of he the strong animal take I away rudolph she say simply take I away from that -- that coward take I away my dear you may beat I too if you like rudolph i dare say i have deserve it but i want you to deal brutally with I to carry I away by force just as you threaten to do the day we be marry -- at the library you remember when the man be cry ` fresh orange ' and you smell so deliciously of soap and leather and cigarette smoke musgrave take both she hand in he he smile at charteri the novelist return the smile intensify its sweetness i fancy rudolph he say that after all i shall have to take that train alone mr charteris continue with a grimace : you have no notion though how annoying it be not to possess a iota of what be vulgarly consider manliness but what be i to do i be not bear with the knack of endure physical pain oh yes i be a coward if you like to put it nakedly but i be bear so willy-nilly personally if i have be consult in the matter i would have prefer the usual portion of valor however the sanctity of the hearth have be most edifyingly preserve -- and after all the woman be not worth squabbling about there be exceedingly little of the mountebank in he now he kick patricium 's portmanteau frankly and viciously as he step over it to lift he own holding this in one hand john charteri speak honestly : rudolph i have a trifle underrated you resource for you be a brave man -- we physical coward you know admire that above all thing -- and a strong man and a clever man in that you have adroitly play upon the purely brutal trait of woman any she-animal cling to its young and look for protection in its mate upon a higher ground i would have beat you but as a animal you be my superior still a thing do have a end you have win back you wife in open fight i fancy by the way that you have rather lay up future trouble for yourself in do so but i honor the skill you have show colonel musgrave it be to you that as the vulgar phrase it i take off my hat thereupon mr charteri uncover he head with perfect gravity and turn on he heel and go down the road whistle melodiously musgrave stare after he for a while the lust of victory die the tumult and passion and fervor be go from musgrave 's soul he could very easily imagine the thing jack charteri would say to anne concern he and the colonel know that she would believe they all he have win the game he have play it heartily and skilfully and successfully and he reward be that the old bickering with patricium should continue and that anne should be teach to loathe he he foresee it all very plainly as he stand hand in hand with he wife but anne would be happy it be for that he have play vi they come back to matocton almost silently the spell of the dawn be break it be honest garish day now and they be both hungry patricium 's spirit be rise as a butterfly 's might after a thunderstorm since she have only a few month to live she would at least not waste they in squabbling she would be conscientiously agreeable to everybody ah rudolph rudolph she coo if i have only know all along that you love I my dear he protest fondly it seem such a matter of course he be a little tired perhaps the portmanteau seem very heavy a woman like to be tell -- a woman like to be tell every day otherwise she forget patricium murmured then she face grow tenderly reproachful ah rudolph rudolph see what you carelessness and neglect have nearly lead to it nearly lead to my run away with a man like -- like that it would have be all you fault rudolph if i have you know it would have be rudolph and patricium sigh once more and then laugh and become magnanimous yes -- yes after all you be the boy 's father she smile up at he kindly and indulgently i forgive you rudolph say patricium he must have show that pardon from patricium just now be not unflavored with irony for she continue in another voice : who after all be the one human be you love you know that it be the boy and just the boy alone i give you that boy you should remember that i think -- i do remember it patricium -- i bear the child i pay the price not you patricium say very quiet no i do not mean the price all woman have to pay -- she pause in they leisurely progress and draw vague outline in the roadway with the ferrule of she umbrella before she look up into rudolph musgrave 's face she appraise it for a long while and quite as if she husband be a stranger yes i could make you very sorry for I if i want to she thought run thus but what be the use you could only become a interminable nuisance in try to soothe my die hour you have just obstinately squat around in lichfield and devote all you time to be beautiful and good and moon around woman for i do not know how many year you make I tired and i have half a mind to tell you so right now and there really be no earthly sense in attempt to explain thing to you you have so get into the habit of be beautiful and good that you be capable of quote scripture after i have finish then i would assuredly box you jaw because i do not yearn to be a poor stricken dear and weep on anybody 's bosom and i do not particularly care about you opinion of I anyway aloud she say : oh well let 's go and get some breakfast vii and thus the situation stay patricium tell he nothing and rudolph musgrave know that accord to he light he have behave not unhandsomely be the merest trifle patronize and rather like a person speak from a superior plane in he future dealings with patricium moreover he be engross at this time by he scholarly compilation of lichfield legislative papers prior to 1800 which be print the follow February she tell he nothing she be a devoted mother for two day ' space and then candidly decide that roger be develop into the most insufferable of little prig and besides if he have never be bear i would quite probably have live to keep my tooth in a glass of water at night and i can not help thinking of that privilege be deny I whenever i look at he she tell rudolph musgrave nothing she be find it mildly amusing to note how people come and go at matocton and to appraise these people disinterestedly because she would never see they again patricium be draw she own conclusion as to lichfield 's aristocracy these people -- for the most part a preposterously handsome race -- be the pleasantest of companion and they manners be perfection but there be enough of old roger stapylton 's blood in patricium 's vein to make she feel however obscurely that nobody be justified in live without even a attempt at any personal achievement the younger man evince a marked tendency to leave lichfield to make they home elsewhere she note and they very often attain prominence there be joe parkinson for instance who have lunch at oyster bay only last Thursday accord to the _ lichfield courier-herald _ and meanwhile the man of she husband 's generation cling to they old mansion and be ornamental certainly and be very certainly profoundly self-satisfied for they adhere to the custom of yesterday under the comfortable delusion that this be the only way to uphold yesterday 's ideal but what in heaven 's name have any of these man of rudolph musgrave 's circle ever do beyond enough perfunctory desk-work say to furnish he food and clothes a hamlet of hamlet be patricium 's verdict as to lichfield -- whose actual tragedy be not that they father be badly treat but that they themselves be constitutionally unable to do anything except talk about how badly they father be treat no it be not altogether that these man be indolent rudolph and rudolph 's peer have be rear in the belief that when any manual labor become inevitable you as a matter of course entrust its execution to a negro and force themselves to labor they not unnaturally comply with a ever-present sense of unfair treatment and in consequence perform the work inefficiently lichfield have no doubt preserve a comely manner of living but it have produce in the last half-century nothing of real importance except john charteri viii for charteri be important patricium be reread all the book that charteri have publish and they engross she with a augment admiration but it be unnecessary to dilate upon the marvelous and winning picture of life in lichfield before the war between the state which charteris have paint in he novel even as the king of bird that with unwearied wing soar nearest to the sun yet wear upon he breast the softest down -- as we learn from no less eminent authority than that of the _ lichfield courier-herald _ -- so mr charteri be equally expert in depict the derring-do and tenderness of those glorious day of chivalry of fair woman and brave man of gentle breeding of splendid culture and wholesome living patricium be not a little puzzle by these book the traditional lichfield she decide in the outcome may very possibly have be just the trick-work of a charlatan 's cleverness but even in that event here be the tale of life in lichfield -- ardent sumptuous and fragrant throughout with the fragrance of love and rose of rhyme and of youth 's lovely fallacy and for the pot-pourrus if it deserve no higher name all who believe that live ought to be a uniformly noble transaction could not fail to be grateful eternally esthetic value apart -- and indeed to all such value patricium accord a provisional respect -- what most impressed she stapyltonian mind be the fact that these book represent in a perfectly tangible way success patricium very heartily admire success when it be brevett as such by the applause of other and while to be a note stylist and even to be reasonably sure of annotated reissuement for the plaguing of unborn schoolchildren be all well enough in a unimportant high-minded way patricium be far more vividly impress by the blunt figure which tell how many of john charteri 's book have be buy and pay for she accept these figure as he publisher give they forth implicitly and she marvel over and take odd joy in these figure they enable she to admire charteri 's book without reservation by this time mr ashmeade have manage in the most natural manner to tell patricium a deal concern charteri no halo grace the portrait mr ashmeade paint but indeed patricium now view john charteri consider as a person without any particular bias she do not especially care -- now -- what the man have do or have omit to do but the venerable incongruity of the writer and he work confront she intriguingly a charteri write _ in old lichfield _ a cockney drug-clerk write _ the eve of st agne _ a genteel printer evolve a lovelace and a cutpurse pen the _ ballad of dead lady _ in a brothel it be manifestly impossible and it happen so here then be a knave who hold somehow the key to a courtlier and nobler world these tale make live seem a braver business for all that they be write by a poltroon be it pure posturing patricium at least think it be not at worst such dexterous maintenance of a pose be hardly despicable she consider and anyhow she prefer to believe that charteri have by some miracle put the best of himself into these book have somehow clarify the abhorrent mixture of ability and evil which be john charteri and the best in he she find on this hypothesis to be a deal more admirable than the best in rudolph musgrave it _ be _ a part of jack she fiercely say it be because i know it be all this be part of he -- as much a part of he as the cowardice and the trickery so i do not really care if he be a liar and a coward i ought to i suppose but at the bottom of my heart i admire he he have make something he have create these beautiful book and they will be here when we be all dead he do not leave the world just as he find it that be the only real cowardice i think -- especially as i be go to do it -- and later she say belligerently : if i have be a man i could have at least assassinate somebody who be prominent i do wish rudolph be not such a stick-in-the-mud and i wish i like rudolph better but on the whole i prefer the physical coward to the moral one rudolph simply bore I stiff with he benevolent air he just walk around the place forgiving I sixty time to the hour and if he do not stop it i be go to slap he thus patricia ix the world know how charteri be kill in fairhaven by jasper hardress -- the husband of that flighty mr hardress anne have speak of and i hardly know say mr ashmeade whether more to admire the justice or the sardonic humor of the performance here after hundred of entanglement with woman john charteri manage to be shoot by a jealous maniac on account of a woman with whom -- for a wonder -- he relation be prove to be innocent the man need killing but it be ask too much of human nature to put up with he be make a martyr of she cry a little though it -- it be because i remember he when he be turn out he first mustache she explain lucidly \* \* \* \* \* but with the horror and irony of john charteri 's assassination the biographer of rudolph musgrave have really nothing to do save in so far as this event influence the life of rudolph musgrave it be on the day of charteri 's death -- a fine clear afternoon in late September -- that rudolph musgrave go bass-fishing with some eight of he masculine guest luncheon be bring to they in a boat about two o'clock along with the day 's mail i say -- but listen everybody cry alfred chayter whose mail include a morning paper -- the _ lichfield courier-herald _ in fact he read aloud i wish i could be with anne think colonel musgrave it may be i could make thing easier but anne be in lichfield now he have just finish dress for supper when it occur to he that since they return from the river he have not see patricium he be afraid that patricium also would be upset by this deplorable news as he cross the hall virginium come out of patricium 's room the colonel raise he voice in speak to she for with age virginium be grow very deaf yaa suh she say i be doin ' middlin ' well suh thank yeh suh jus ' take the evenin ' mail to miss patricy like i always do suh she go away quietly she pleasant yellow face as imperturbable as a idol 's he go into patricium 's bedroom patricium have be take a afternoon nap and have not rise from the couch where she lay with three or four unopened letter upon she breast two she have open and drop upon the floor she seem not to hear he when he speak she name and yet she be not asleep because she eye be partly unclosed there be no purple glint in they as once there have be always she countenance indeed show everywhere less brightly tinted than normally it should be she heavy copper-colored hair alone undimmed seem like some parasitic growth -lrb- he think -rrb- to sustain its beauty by virtue of have drain patricium 's body of color and vitality there be a newspaper in she right hand with flamboyant headline because to lichfield the death of john charteri be a event of importance patricium seem very young you see that she have suffer you know it be not fair to hurt a child like that but indeed rudolph musgrave hardly realize as yet that patricium be dead for colonel musgrave be think of that time when this same patricium have first come to he fire-new from the heart of a ancient sunset and he have note for the first time that she hair be like the reflection of a sunset in ripple water and that she mouth be a inconsiderable trifle a scrap of sanguine curve and that she eye be purple glimpse of infinity this same patricium he say aloud part nine - relic you have choose the love ` that live san murmuring san passion ' and incuriously endure the gradual lapse of time you have choose as yours a level life of little happening and through the long autumnal evening lord love no doubt be of the company and hug you ingleside contentedly smile at old grief and rustle needless wing and yet i think that sometimes memory of diver tryst of blood that urge like wine on moonlit night and of that first long kiss whereby you lip be first make one with mine awake and trouble you and loving be once more important and perhaps divine allen rossiter _ two in October _ i to those who know john charteri only through the medium of the print page it must have appear that the novelist be stay in mid-career by a accident of unrelieved and singular brutality and truly thus extinguish by the unfounded jealousy of a madman the force of charteri 's genius seem and seem to-day as emphasize by that sinister caprice of chance which annihilate it but people in lichfield after the manner of each prophet 's countryman have they own point of view the artist always stand between these people and the artist 's handiwork in part obscure it in any event it be generally agree in lichfield that anne charteri 's conduct after she husband 's death be not all which could be desire to begin with she attend the funeral in black it be true but wear only the lightest of net veil pin under she chin -- more as if she be go somewhere on the train you know than as if she be in genuine bereavement jack do not approve of mourning he say it be a heathen survival that be the only explanation she offer it seem inadequate to lichfield it be preferable as good taste go for a widow to be too overcome to attend she husband 's funeral at all and mr charteri have not weep once during the church ceremony and have not even have hysteric during the interment at cedarwood and she have cap a scandalous morning 's work by remain with the undertaker and the bricklayer to supervise the closing of john charteri 's grave why but of course it be the last thing i will ever be allow to do for he she have say in innocent surprise why should not i she air be such that you be both to talk to she about appearance because she be not a bit like a widow as mr ashmeade point out anybody can condole with a widow and devote two outer sheet to explain that you realize nothing you can say will be of any comfort to she and begin at the top of the inside page by tell she how much better off he be to-day -- which i have always think a double-edged assertion when advance to a man 's widow but you can not condole with a lantern whose light have be blow out that be what anne be mrs ashmeade meditate and appear dissatisfied and john charteri of all people anne be presently about the memorial edition of she husband 's collect writings it be magnificently print and when market achieve a flattering success robert etheridge townsend be commission to write the authorized _ life of john charteris _ and to arrange the two volume of _ letter _ anne be consider a authority on literature and art in general through virtue of reflect glory and in the interview she grant various journalist it be noticeable that she no longer refer to jack or to mr charteri but to my husband to have be he wife be she one claim on estimation and for the rest it be inadequate to love the memory of a martyr worship be demand and so the wife become the priestess ii into colonel musgrave 's mental process during this period it will not do to pry too closely the man have he white night and he battle in part with real grief and regret and in part with sundry emotion which he take on faith as the emotion he ought to have and therefore manifestly suffer under patricium be my wife jack be my brother run he verdict in the outcome and beyond that he do not care to go for death cow he thought in the colonel 's explicit theology dead people be straightway convey to either one or the other of two place he have very certainly never know anybody who in he opinion merit the torment of he orthodox gehenna so that in imagination he vaguely populate its blaze corridor with nero and juda and caesar borgium and henry viii and spanish inquisitor and the aboriginal american indian -- excepting of course he ancestress pocahonta -- and with benedict arnold and all the carpet-bagger and suchlike other eminent practitioner of depravity for no one whom rudolph musgrave have ever encounter in the flesh have be really and profoundly wicked rudolph musgrave consider and so he always gravely estimate this-or-that acquaintance after death to be better off poor fellow -- as the colonel phrase it with a tinge of self-contradiction -- even if he actually refrain in fancy from endow the decease with aureate harp and crown and footgear in fine death cow the colonel 's thought beyond the grave they do not care to venture and when confront with that abyss they decorously balk patricium and jack be as a matter of course better off then -- and miraculously purge of fault with all they defect somehow remedy the colonel 's wife and brother with agatha and the colonel 's other interred relative be partaking of dignified joy in bright supernal iridescent realm which the colonel resignedly look forward to enter on some comfortably remote day or another and thus rejoin he transfigured kindred such be the colonel 's charitable decision in the form whereof logic be in no way implicate for religion as the colonel would have tell you sedately be not a thing to be reason about attempt to do that you become in rudolph musgrave 's honest eye regrettably flippant meanwhile cousin lucy fentnor be take care of the colonel and little roger and lichfield long before the letter on patricium 's tombstone have time to lose its first light dusty gray have accredit cousin lucy fentnor with illimitable willingness to become mr rudolph musgrave upon proper solicitation although such tittle-tattle be neither here nor there for at worst a widow childless and impoverished second-cousin discreetly advance in she forty be entitle to keep house for the colonel in he bereavement as a jointly beneficial arrangement without provoke scandal 's tongue to more than a jocose innuendo or two when people meet for auction -- that new-fangled perplexing variant of bridge just introduce wherein you bid on the suit and besides cousin lucy fentnor -lrb- as befitted any one bear a allardyce -rrb- be to all account a notable housekeeper famed alike for the perilous glassiness of she hardwood floor she dexterous management of servant she honiton-braid fancy-work -lrb- familiar to every patron of lichfield charity bazaar -rrb- and she unparalleled calves-foot jelly under cousin lucy fentnor 's systematize coddling little roger grow like the proverbial ill weed and the colonel likewise wax perceptibly in girth thus it be that accident and a woman 's intervention seem once more to combine in shield rudolph musgrave from discomfort and in consequence it be consider improbable that at this late day the colonel would do the proper thing by clarice pendomer as at the first tiding of patricium 's death have be authentically rumor among the imaginative and in fact lichfield no longer consider that necessary the claim of outraged morality against these two have be throw out of court through some unword social statute of limitation as far as lichfield go of course it be interesting to note that the colonel call at mr pendomer 's rather frequently nowadays but then clarice pendomer have all sort of caller now -- though not many in skirt -- and she play poker with man for money until unregenerate hour of the night and be repute with a wealth of corroborative detail to have even less discussable source of income : so that indeed clarice pendomer be now rather precariously retain within the social pale through she initial precaution of have be bear a bellingham but all such tittle-tattle as have be say be quite beside the mark since with the decadence of clarice pendomer this chronicle have in the outcome as scant concern as with the marital aspiration of cousin lucy fentnor and moreover the colonel -- in colloquial phrase at least -- go everywhere after the six month of comparative seclusion which decency exact of he widowerhood -- and thereby afford he ample leisure to complete and publish he _ lichfield legislative papers prior to 1800 _ -- the colonel be it repeat go everywhere and people find he no whit the worse company for he black glove and the somber band stitch to he coatsleeve so lichfield again receive he gladly as the social triumph of he generation handsome and trim and affable no imaginable tourist could possibly have divine -- for everybody in lichfield know of course -- that rudolph musgrave have round he half-century and he stay as ever invaluable to lichfield matron alike against the entertainment of a out-of-town girl the management of a cotillon and the prevention of unpleasant pause among incongruous dinner-company but of anne charteri he see very little nowadays and indeed it be of she own choice that anne live apart from lichfieldian junketing contented with she dream and she pride therein and she remorseful tender memory of the thing she might have do for jack and have not do -- live upon exalted level nowadays to which the colonel 's more urbane bereavement do not aspire iii charteri be engrave in large raise letter upon the granite coping over which anne step to enter the trim burial-plot wherein she dead lay the place to-day be one of the point of interest in cedarwood tourist pass through lichfield visit it as inevitably as they do the grave of the president the southern general and the many other famous people which the old cemetery contain and the negro hackman of lichfield be already profuse in inaccurate information concern its occupant in a phrase the post card which picture e 9436 -- grave of john charteri be among the seven similar misinterpretation of locality most frequently demand in lichfieldian drugstore and news-stand she victorium have pause a trifle farther up the hill where two big sycamore overhang the roadway she come into the place alone walk quickly for she be unwarrantably fluster by she late encounter and when she find of all people rudolph musgrave standing by she husband 's grave as in a sort of puzzle and yet reverent meditation she be and somehow as half-guiltily assure herself there be no possible reason for the repugnance -- nay the rage -- which a mere glimpse of trudge paint and flamboyant clarice pendomer have kindle yet it must be record that anne have always detest clarice now anne speak as the phrase run before she think she come with you and he answer as from the depths of a uncalled-for comprehension which be distinctly irritating : yes and harry too for that matter only we talk get somehow to be not quite the sort it would be salutary for he to take a interest in so we tell harry to walk on slowly to the gate and be sure not to do any number of thing he would never have think of if we have not suggest they you know how people be with child -- harry be -- she boy anne be vex have almost add -- and yours oh -- say the _ fon et origo _ of the pendomer divorce case poor little chap yes harry be she boy anne say and again as she perceive within the moment a thought too expeditiously : i wish you would not bring they here colonel musgrave indeed it seem to she flat desecration that musgrave should have bring he former mistress into this hallowed plot of ground she do not mind -- illogically perhaps -- he bring the child eh -- oh yes say colonel musgrave he be sensibly nettle you wish ` colonel musgrave ' would not bring they here but then you see we have be to patricium 's grave and we remember how jack stand by we both when -- when thing bid fair to be even more unpleasant for clarice and myself than they actually be you should not i think grudge even such moral reprobate the privilege of be properly appreciative of what he do for both of we besides you always come on saturday you know we could not very well anticipate that you would be here this afternoon so he have be at pain to spy upon she anne phrase it thus in she soul be irritated and crisply answer : i be leave lichfield to-morrow i have mean this to be my farewell to they until October colonel musgrave have glance toward the little headstone with its rather lengthy epitaph which mark the resting-place of this woman 's only child and then to the tall shaft whereon be engrave just john charteri the latter inscription be very characteristic of she view-point he reflect and yet reasonable too as one might mention a hector or a goethe say without be at pain to disclaim allusion to the minor sharer of either name yes he say well i shall not intrude no -- wait she dissent she voice be alter now for there have come into it a marvelous gentleness and colonel musgrave remain motionless the whole world be motionless ineffably expectant as it seem to he sunset be at hand on one side be the high wooden fence which show the boundary of cedarwood and through its paling and above it be visible the broad shallow river comfortably color for the most part like _ café au lait _ but fleck with many patch of foam and flat iron-colored rock and innumerable islet some no bigger than a billiard-table but with even the tiniest boast a tree or two on the other -- westward -- be a mount vista of close-shaven turf and many coping like magnify geometrical problem and a host of stunt grow thing -- with the staid verdancy of evergreen predominant -- and a multitude of candid shaft and slab and cross and dwarf lamb and meditant angel some of these throng memorial be tinge with violet and other be a-glitter like silver just as the order tree shaded they or no from the low sun the disposition of all worldly affair the man dimly know be very anciently prearrange by a illimitable and upon the whole a kindly wisdom she be consider the change in he anne be recollect that colonel musgrave have somewhat pointedly avoid she since she widowhood he seem almost a stranger nowadays and she could not recognize in the man any resemblance to the boy whom she remember -- so long ago -- except just he womanish mouth which be as in the old time very full and red and sensitive and illogically enough both this great change in he and this one feature that have never change annoyed she equally she be also worry by he odd tone of flippancy it jar it vaguely -- for the phrase have no equivalent -- rub she the wrong way here at a martyr 's tomb it be hideously out-of-place and yet she do not see she way clear to rebuke so she remain silent but rudolph musgrave be uncanny in some respects for he say within the moment i be not a bit like john charteri be i no she answer quietly it have be she actual thought anne stay a tiny while quite motionless she eye see nothing physical it be the attitude colonel musgrave reflect of one who listen to a far-off music and incommunicably you know that the music be of a martial sort she be all in black of course very slim and pure and beautiful the great cluster of red rose loosely hold be like blood against the somber gown the widow of john charteri in fine be a very different person from that anne willoughby whom rudolph musgrave have love so long and long ago this woman have taste of tonic sorrow unknown to rudolph musgrave and have get consolation too somehow in far half-credible upland unvisited by he but he know she live and be so exquisite mainly by virtue of that delusion which he of all man have preserve anne charteri be of he creation he masterpiece and view she he be aware of great reverence and joy anne be happy it be for that he have play but aloud i be envious rudolph musgrave declare he be the single solitary man i ever know whose widow be contented to be simply he relict for ever and ever amen for you will always be just the woman john charteri love will not you yes if you live to be thirty-seven year older than methuselah and every genius and potentate in the world should come a-wooing in the meantime it never would occur to you that you could possibly be anything even to a insane person except he relict and he have be dead now all of three whole year so i be envious just as we ordinary mortal can not help be of you both and -- may i say it -- i be glad iv they be stand thus when a boy of ten or eleven come unhurriedly into the section he assume possession of colonel musgrave 's hand as though the action be a matter of course i get lose colonel musgrave the child composedly announce i walk ever so far and the gate be not where we leave it and the road keep turn and twist so it seem i would never get anywhere i do not like be lose when it be get dark and there be so many dead people ` round do you the colonel be move to disapproval young man i suppose you poor desert mother be look for you everywhere and have probably tear out every solitary strand of hair she possess by this time i reckon she be the boy assent the topic do not appear to be in he eye of preëminent importance then anne charteri say harry and she voice be such that rudolph musgrave wheel with amazement in he face the boy have go to she complaisantly and she stand now with one hand on either of he shoulder regard he she lip be part but they do not move at all you be mrs pendomer 's boy be not you say anne charteri in a while she have some difficulty in articulation yes be harry assented and we come here ` most every Wednesday and please ma'am you be hurtin ' I i do not mean to -- dear the woman add painfully do not interfere with I rudolph musgrave you mother must be very fond of you harry i have a little boy once i be fond of he he would have be eleven year old last February please ma'am i be not eleven till April and i be not tall for my age but tubby parson say -- the woman give a odd unhuman sound not until April harry say colonel musgrave then a enormous whale be come down the river in precisely two minute perhaps if you be to look through the paling of that fence you might see he i do not suppose you would care to though and harry strolled resignedly toward the fence harry pendomer do not like this funny lady who have hurt frightened eye he do not believe in the whale of course any more than he do in santa claus but like most child he patiently accept the fact that grown people be unaccountable overlord appoint by some vast _ bêtise _ whom if only through prudential motive it be preferable to humor v colonel musgrave stand now upon the other side of john charteri 's grave -- just in the spot that be reserve for she own occupancy some day you be ill anne you be not fit to be out go home i have a little boy once she say ` but that be all past and go and good time and bad time and all time pass over ' there be a odd simple music in the sentence be not there yet i remember it chiefly because i use to read that book to he and he love it and it be my child that die why be this other child so like he oh then that be it be it say rudolph musgrave as in relief bless I i suppose all these little shaver be pretty much alike i can only tell roger from the other boy by he red head humanity in the raw you know still it be no wonder it give you a turn you have much better go home however and not take any foolish risk and put you foot in hot water and rub cologne on you temple and do all the other suitable thing -- i remember now she continue without any apparent emotion and as though he have not speak when i come into the room you be say that the child must be consider you be both very angry and i be alarm -- foolishly alarmed perhaps and my -- and john charteri say ` let he tell then ' -- and you tell I -- the truth anne and he sit quietly by oh if he would have the grace the common manliness -- she shiver here but he never interrupt you i -- i be not look at he i be think how vile you be and when you have end he say ` my dear i be sorry you should have be involve in this but since you be i think we can assure rudolph that both of we will regard he confidence as sacred ' then i remember he and think how noble he be and all those year that be so happy hour by hour he be let you -- meet he bill she seem to wrench out the inadequate metaphor you could hear the far-off river now faint as the sound of boiling water after a few pacing colonel musgrave turn upon she he speak with a curious simplicity there be not any use in lie to you you would not believe you would only go to some one else -- some woman probably -- who would jump at the chance of tell you everything and a deal more yes there be a great many ` they _ do _ say 's ' float about this be the only one that come near be -- serious the man be very clever -- oh he be not vulgarly lecherous he be simply -- jack charteri he always irritated lichfield though by not take lichfield very seriously you would hear every by-end of retaliative and sniggered-over mythology and in you present state of mind you would believe all of they i happen to know that a great many of these story be not true a great many of these story anne repeat be not true a great many be not that ought to be console ought not it she speak without a trace of bitterness i express myself very badly what i really mean what i be aim at be that i wish you would let I answer any question you might like to ask because i will answer they truthfully very few people would you see you go about the world so like a gray-stone saint who have just step down from she niche for the fraction of a second he add as with venom that it be only human nature to dislike you anne be not angry it have come to she quite as though she be consider some other woman that what the man say be in a fashion true there be sunlight and fresh air in the street john charteri have be wont to declare and there be a culvert at the corner i think it be a mistake for we to emphasize the culvert so he have train she to disbelieve in its existence she see this now it do not matter it seem to she that nothing matter any more i have only one question i think why do you do it she speak with bright amazement in she eye oh my dear my dear he seriocomically deplore why because it be such a noble thing to do it be so like the estimable young man in a play you know who acknowledge the crime he never commit and take a curtain-call immediately afterwards in fine i simply observe to myself with the late monsieur de bergerac ` but what a gesture ' and he parody a actor 's motion in this rôle she stay unsmiling and patiently await veracity anne do not understand that colonel musgrave be tell the absolute truth and so you have not _ any _ sense of humor he lament you use to have a deal too before you take to be conscientiously cheerful and diffusing sweetness and light among you cower associate well it be because it help he a little oh i be be truthful now i have some reason to dislike jack charteri but odd as it be i know to-day i never do i ought to have perhaps but i do not my friend you be be almost truthful but i want the truth entire it be not polite to disbelieve people he reprove she or at the very least accord to the best book on etiquette you ought not to do it audibly would you mind if i smoked i could be more veracious then there be something in tobacco that make frankness a matter of course i thank you he produce a amber holder fit a cigarette into it and presently inhale twice he say with a curt voice : the reason naturally be you you may remember certain thing that happen just before john charteri come and take you oh that be precisely what he do you be rather a narrow-minded woman now in consequence -- or in my humble opinion at least -- and deplorably superior it please the man to have in he house -- if you will overlook my venture into metaphor -- one cool room very sparsely furnish where he could come when the mood seize he he take the raw material from I wherewith to build that room because he want that room i acquiesce because i have not the skill wherewith to fight he anne understand he now as with a great drench of surprise and fear be what she feel in chief when she see for just this moment as though it have lighten the man 's face transfigure and tender and strange to she i try to buy you happiness to -- yes just to keep you blind indefinitely have the price be heavier i would have pay it the more gladly fate have play a sorry trick _ you _ would never have see through he my dear i have want very often to shake you he say and she know in a glorious terror that she desire he to shake she and as she have never desire anything else in life oh well i be just a common ordinary garden-sort of fool the musgrave always be in one fashion or another he sulkily conclude and now the demigod be merely rudolph musgrave again and she be not afraid any longer but only inexpressibly fordone be not that like a woman he presently demand of the June heaven to drag something out of a man with inflexibility monomania and moral grappling-iron and _ then _ not like it oh very well i be disgust by you sex 's axiomatic variability i shall take harry to he fond mamma at once she do not say anything a certain new discovery obsess she like a piece of pierce music then rudolph musgrave give the tiniest of gesture downward and i have tell you this in chief because we two remember he he want you he take you you be he you will always be he give you just a fragment of himself that fragment be worth more than everything i have to offer anne very carefully arrange she rose on the ivy-covered grave i do not know -- meanwhile i give these to we master and my real widowhood begin to-day and as she rise he look at she across the colorful mound and smile half as with embarrassment a lie he think might ameliorate the situation and he bravely hazard a prodigious one be it necessary to tell you that jack love you and that the other never really count he rejoice to see that anne believe he no she assent no not with he oddly enough i be proud of that even now but -- do not you see -- i never love he i be just he priestess -- the priestess of a stucco god otherwise i would know it be not he fault but altogether that of -- the other he grimace and give a banter flirt of he head he say with quiz eye : would it do any good to quote lombroso and maudsley and gall and krafft-ebing and flechsig and so on and to tell you that the excessive use of one brain faculty must necessarily cause a lack of nutriment to all the other brain-cell it would be rather up-to-date there be a deal i could tell you also as to what poisonous blood he inherit but to do this i have not the right and then rudolph musgrave say in all sincerity : ' a wild impetuous whirlwind of passion and faculty slumber quiet there such heavenly _ melody _ dwelling in the heart of it ' she have put aside alike the drolling and the palliative suggestion like flimsy veil i think it would not do any good whatever when grow thing be break by the whirlwind they do not as a rule discuss the theory of air-current as a consolation man such as he be take what they desire it be not fair -- to we other but it be true for all that -- they eye meet warily and for no reason which they share in common they smile together poor little lady of shalott say rudolph musgrave the mirror be crack from side to side be not it i be sorry for life be not so easily dispose of and there be only life to look at now and life be a bewilderingly complex business you will find because the law of it be so childishly simple -- and implacable and one of these law seem to be that in we little planet might make right -- he stay to puff he cigarette oh rudolph dear do not -- do not be just a merry-andrew she cry impulsively before he have time to continue which she perceive he mean to do as if it do not matter and he take she full meaning quite as he have be use in the old time to discourse upon a half-sentence i be afraid i be that rather he say reflectively but then clarice and i could hardly have weather scandal except by make ourselves particularly agreeable to everybody and somehow i get into the habit of make people laugh it be not very difficult i be rather a adept at tell story which just graze impropriety for instance you know they call I the social triumph of my generation and people be glad to see I because i be ` so awfully funny ' and ` simply kill ' and so on and i suppose it tell in the long run -- like the dyer 's hand you know it do tell anne be think it would always tell and that too would be john charteri 's handiwork ensue a silence rudolph musgrave be painstakingly intent upon he cigarette a nestward-plunging bird call to he mate impatiently then anne shake she head impatiently come while i be think i will drive you back to lichfield oh no that would not do at all he say with absolute decision no you see i have to return the boy and i can not quite imagine you carriage wait at the door of ` that mr pendomer ' oh anne fleetingly think _ he _ would have understand but aloud she only say : and do you think i hate she any longer yes it be true i hate she until to-day and now i be just sincerely sorry for she for she and i -- and you and even the child yonder -- and all that any of we be to-day -- be just so many relic of john charteri yet he have do with we -- at last she say this with a inhalation of the breath but she do not look at he take care he say with a unreasonable harshness for i forewarn you i be imagine vain thing i be not afraid somehow but anne do not look at he he see as with a rend shock how like the widow of john charteri be to anne willoughby and unforgotten pulse very strange and irrational and dear perplex he sorely he debate and fling aside the cigarette as a out-moded detail of he hobble part you say i do a noble thing for you i try to but quixotism have its price to-day i be not quite the man who do that thing john charteri have set he imprint too deep upon we we serve he pleasure we be not any longer the boy and girl who love each other she wait in the rise twilight with a yet avert face the world be motionless ineffably expectant as it seem to he and the disposition of all worldly affair the man dimly know be very anciently prearrange by a illimitable and upon the whole a kindly wisdom so that my dear my dear he swiftly say : i do not think i can word just what my feeling be for you always my view of the world have be that you exist and that some other people exist -- as accessory -- then he be silent for a heart-beat appraise she he hand lift toward she and fall within the moment as if it be in impotence anne speak at last and the sweet voice of she be very glad and proud and confident my friend remember that i have not thank you you have do the most foolish and -- the manliest thing i ever know a man to do just for my sake and i have accept it as if it be a matter of course and i shall always do so because it be you right to do this very brave and foolish thing for I i know you joy in do it rudolph you can not understand how glad i be you joy in do it they eye meet it be not possible to tell you all they be aware of through that moment because it be a knowledge so rarely apprehend and even then for such a little while that no man who have sense it can remember afterward aught save the splendor and perfection of it \* \* \* \* \* and yet anne look back once there be just the tall stark shaft and on it john charteri the thing be ominous and vast all color like wet gravel save where the sunlight tip it with clean silver very high above they reach come she quickly say to rudolph musgrave come for i be afraid vi and be we then to leave they with glad face turn to that new day wherein above the ash of old error and folly and mischance and misery they be to raise the structure of such a happiness as earth rarely witness would it not be instead a grateful task more fully to depicture how rudolph musgrave 's love of anne win finally to its reward and these two share the evening of they life in tranquil service of unswerving love come to its own at last undoubtedly since the espousal of one 's first love -- by oneself -- be a phenomenon rarely encounter outside of popular fiction it would be a very gratifying task to record that anne and rudolph musgrave be marry that autumn that subsequently lichfield be astounded by the fervor of they life-long bliss that colonel and -lrb- the second -rrb- mr musgrave be universally respect in a word and they dinner-party be always prominently chronicle by the _ lichfield courier-herald _ and that anne take excellent care of little roger and that she and she second husband prove eminently suit to each other but as a matter of fact not one of these thing ever happen i have be think it over anne deplore oh rudolph dear i perfectly realize you be the best and noblest man i ever know and i have always love you very much my dear that be why i could never abide poor mr pendomer and yet -- it be a feeling i simply can not explain -- that you belong to jack in spite of everything the colonel say why but of course i might have know that jack would never have allow any simple incidental happen such as he death to cause he miss a possible trick anne would have comfort rudolph musgrave but to she discomfiture the colonel be grin however ruefully i be think he state of the only time that i ever to my knowledge talk face to face with the devil it be rather odd how obstinately life cling to the most hackneyed trick of ballad-maker and still naively pretend to enrich she production by the stale device of introduce a refrain -- so that the idlest remark of as much as three year ago keep crop up as the actual gist of the present however be it within my power i would evoke amaimon straightway now to come up yonder through you hearthrug and to answer I quite honestly if i do not tell he on the beach at matocton that this precisely this would be the outcome of you know everything i tell you that i could not quite _ explain _ -- anne say eh but i can my dear he inform she the explanation be that lichfield bear we shape we and make we what we be we may not enjoy a monopoly of the virtue here in lichfield but there be one trait at least which the child of lichfield share in common we be loyal we give but once and when we give we give all that we have and when we have once give it neither common-sense nor a concourse of expostulate seraph nor anything else in the universe can induce we to believe that a retraction or even a qualification of the gift would be quite worthy of we but that -- that be foolish why it be unreasonable anne point out of course it be and that be why i be proud of lichfield and that be why you be to-day jack 's wife and always will be just jack 's wife -- and why to-day i be patricium 's husband -- and why lichfield to-day be lichfield there be something braver in life than to be just reasonable thank god and so we keep the faith my dear however obsolete we find fidelity to be we keep to the old faith -- we of lichfield who have give hostage to the past we remember even now that we give freely in a old time and do not haggle and so we be proud -- yes we be consumedly proud and we know that we have earn the right to be proud a little later colonel musgrave say : and yet -- it take a monstrous while to dispose of we universe 's subtlety i have love you my whole life long as accurately as we can phrase these matter there be no -- no _ reasonable _ reason why you should not marry I now and you would marry I if i press it and i do not press it perhaps it all come of we both have be rear in lichfield perhaps that be why i too have be ` think it over ' you see he add with a smile the rivet in grandfather 's neck be not lightly to be ignore after all no you do not know what i be talk about my dear and -- well anyhow i belong to patricium upon the whole i be glad that i belong to patricium for patricium and what patricium mean to I be the one vital thing in a certain person 's rather hand-to-mouth existence -- oh yes in spite of everything i know it now anne charteri the colonel cry i would not marry you or any other woman breathing even though you be to kneel and implore I upon the knee of a centipede for i belong to patricium and the rivet stay unbroken after all oh and be i be very foolish again anne ask for i have be remember that when -- when jack be not quite truthful about some thing you know -- the truth he hide be always one which would have hurt I and i like to believe that be at least in part the reason he hide it rudolph so he purchase my happiness -- well at ugly price perhaps but he purchase it none the less and i have it through all those year so why should not i -- after all -- be very grateful to he and besides -- she voice break -- besides he be jack you know he belong to I what do it matter what he do he belong to I and i love he and to the colonel 's discomfort anne begin to cry there there he say so the real truth be out at last and tear do not help very much it do seem a bit unfair my dear i know but that be simply because you and i be live in a universe which have never actually commit itself under any penalize bond to be entirely candid as to the law by which it be conduct \* \* \* \* \* but it may be that rudolph musgrave voice quite obsolete view for he say this at a very remote period -- when the beef trust be be investigate in washington when a excited iberian constabulary be still hunting the anarchist who have attempt to assassinate the young king and queen of spain upon they wedding-day when the rebuilding of a earthquake-shattered san francisco be just begin to be talk of as a possibility and when editorial be mostly devote to discussion of what mr bryan would have to say about bi-metallism when he return from he foreign tour and besides it be rudolph musgrave 's beset infirmity always to shrink -- under shelter of whatever grandiloquent excuse -- from make change one may permissibly estimate this foible to have weigh with he a little even now just as in all thing it have always weigh in lichfield with all he generation a old custom be not lightly broken part ten - imprimi so let we laugh lest vain remembering breed as of old some rude bucolic cry of awkward anguish of dream that die without decorum of love lack wing yet strive you-ward in he floundering eternally -- as now even when i lie as i lie now who know that you and i exist and heed not lesser happening i be i be i will be eh no doubt for some sufficient cause i drift defer equivocate dream hazard grow more stout age be no longer love 's idolater -- and yet i could and would not live without you faith that hearten and you doubt which spur lionel crochard _ palinodium _ i so week and month and presently irrevocable year pass tranquilly and nothing very important seem to happen nowadays either for good or ill and rudolph musgrave be content enough true there befall and with increase frequency period when one must lie abed and be coax into take interminable medicine and be minister unto generally because one be of a certain age nowadays and must be prudent but even such necessity these underhanded indignity of time have they alleviation train nurse for example be uncommonly well-informed and agreeable young woman when you come to know they -- and quite lady-like too for all that in we topsy-turvy day these girl have to work for they living unthinkable as it seem the colonel find that he night-nurse a miss ramsay be actually by birth a ramsay of blenheim and for a little the discovery depress he but to be make much of upon whatever term be always treatment to which the colonel submit only too docilely and besides in this queer comfortable just half-waking state the colonel find one have the drollest dream evolve fancy such as be really a credit to one 's imagination for instance one very often imagine that patricium be more close at hand nowadays no she be not here in the room of course but outside in the street at the corner below where the letterbox stand yes she be undoubtedly there the colonel reflect drowsily and they have be so certain she return could only result in unhappiness and they be so wise that whilst she wait for she opportunity patricium herself begin to be a little uneasy she have patrol the block six time before the chance come and it seem to rudolph musgrave drowsily please by he own inventiveness that patricium be glad this afternoon be so hot that no one be abroad except the small boy at the corner house who sit upon the bottom porch-step and as child so often do appear intently to appraise the world at large with a inexplicable air of disappointment now think how rudolph would feel -- the colonel whimsically play at read patricium 's reflection -- if i be to be arrest as a suspicious character -- that be what the newspaper always call they i think -- on he very doorstep and he must have be home a half-hour ago at least because i know it be after five but the side-gate 's latch and i can not ring the door-bell -- if only because it would be too ridiculous to have to ask the maid to tell colonel musgrave he wife want to see he besides i do not know the new house-girl i wish now we have not let old mary go even though she be so undependable about thorough-cleaning and it seem to rudolph musgrave that patricium be tire of pacing before the row of house each so like the other and compare herself to gulliver astray upon a brobdingnagian bookshelf which hold a library set of some huge author she have lose interest too in the new house upon the other side if thing be different i would have to call on they but as it be i be spare that bother at least say patricium just as if be dead do not change people at all then a color woman trim and frillily-capped come out of the watch house she bear some eight or nine letter in one hand and fan herself with they in a leisurely flat-footed progress to the mailbox at the lower corner she look capable be patricium 's grudging commentary in slip through the doorway into the twilight of the hall but it be not safe to leave the front-door open like this one never know -- no i can tell by the look of she she be the sort that can not be induce to sleep on the lot and take mysterious bundle home at night ii and it seem to rudolph musgrave now in the full flow of this droll dream that patricium resentfully note she front-hall have be meddle with this much alone might patricia observe in a swift transit to the parlor she wait there until the maid return and register to the woman 's credit the discreet soft closing of the front-door and afterward the well-nigh inaudible swish of the rear door of the dining-room as the maid go back into the kitchen in any event patricium largely concede she probably do not clash the knife and fork in the pantry after supper like she be hostile armament with any number of cutlass apiece i remember rudolph simply could not stand it when we have ethel so much be satisfactory only -- she parlor be so altered there be -- to give you just she instantaneous first impression -- so little in it broad space of plain color show everywhere and patricium 's ideal of what a parlor should be as befitted the châtelaine of a fine home in lichfield have always be the tangled elegancy of the front show-window of a woman 's exchange for fancy work the room have even be repaper -- odiously as she consider and the shiny floor of it boast just three inefficient rug like dingy raft upon a sea of very strong coffee patricium look in vain for she grandiose plush-covered chair she immaculate tidy and the proud yellow lambrequin embroider in high relief with white gardenia which have formerly adorn the mantelpiece the heart of she hunger for she unforgotten and unforgettable watered-silk papering wherein white rose bloom exuberantly against a yellow background -- which deplorably fade if you do not keep the window-shades down she remember -- and she want back she white thick comfortable carpet which hide the floor completely so that everywhere you tread upon the buxomest of stalwart yellow rose each bunch of which be lavishly tie with wind-blown ribbon then too she cherish spinning-wheel at least two hundred and fifty year old which have look so pretty after she have gilded it and add a knot of pink sarsenet be depart and go as well be the mirror-topped table with its array of china swan and frog and water-lily artistically group about its speckless surface even she prize engraving of michael angelo buonarottus -- contentedly regard he just finish mose while a pope tiptoe into the room through a side-door -- have be remove with all its splendor of red-plush and intricate gilt-framing just here and there in fine like a familiar face in a crowd she could discover some one of she more sedately-colored parlor ornament and the whole history of it -- its donor or else its price the gesture of the shopman even what sort of weather it be when she and rudolph find exactly what i have be look for in the shop-window and the stapyltonian haggle over the price with which patricium have bargain -- such unimportant detail as these now vividly awaken in recollection in fine this room be not she parlor at all and in it patricium be lonely yes yes she would be nowadays the colonel reflect for he himself have never be in thorough sympathy with all the change make by roger 's self-assured young wife thus it be with the first floor of the house through which patricium stray with uniform discomfort this place be home no longer thus it be with the first floor of the house everywhere the equipment be strange or at best arrange not quite as patricium would have place they yet they have not any look of be recently purchase even that hideous stair-carpet be a little worn she note as noiselessly she mount to the second story the house be perfectly quiet save for a tiny shrill continuance of melody that somehow seem only to pierce the silence not to dispel it rudolph -- of all thing -- have in she absence acquire a canary and everybody know what a interminable nuisance a canary be she enter the front room it have be she bedroom ever since she marriage she remember this as with a gush of defiant joy iii so it seem to rudolph musgrave that patricium come actually into the room that have be hers a canary be singing there very sweet and shrill and as in defiant joy its trilling seem to fill the room in the brief pause of he song the old clock from which rudolph have remove the pendulum on the night of agatha 's death would interpose a obstinate slow ticking and immediately the clock-noise would be drown in melody otherwise the room be silent in the alcove stand the bed which have be patricium 's intent upon its occupant be three person with they back turn to she one patricium could easily divine to be a doctor he be twiddle a hypodermic syringe between he finger and the set of he shoulder be that of acquiescence profile of the other she see : one a passive nurse in uniform who be patiently chafe the right hand of the bed 's occupant the other a lean-featured red-haired stranger who sit crouch in he chair and hold the die man 's left hand for in the bed support by many pillow and face patricium be a die man he be very old have thick tumble hair which like he two-week ' beard be uniformly white he eyelid droop a trifle so that he seem to meditate concern something ineffably remote and serious yet not upon the whole unsatisfactory you see and hear the intake of each breath so painfully draw and expel with manifest relief as if the man be very tired of breathing yet the bedclothes heave with he vain effort just to keep on breathing and sometimes he parted lip would twitch curiously rudolph musgrave too could see all this quite plainly in the mirror over the mantel the doctor speak yes -- it be the end professor musgrave he say for this lean-featured red-haired stranger to whom the doctor speak a pedagogue to he finger-tip have once be patricium 's dearly-purchased chubby baby roger and rudolph musgrave stay motionless he know patricium be there but that fact no longer seem either very strange or even unnatural and besides it be against some law for he to look at she until patricium have call he meanwhile just opposite above the mirror and face he be the stuart portrait of young gerald musgrave this picture have now hang there for a great many year the boy still smile at you in undiminished raillery even though he smile ambiguously and with a sort of humorous sadness in he eye once very long ago -- when the picture hang downstairs -- some one have say that gerald musgrave 's life be barren the die man could not now recollect quite who that person be rudolph musgrave stay motionless he comprehend that he be die the greatest of all change be at hand and he who have always shrink from make change be now content enough indeed with rudolph musgrave living have always be a vaguely dissatisfactory business a hand-to-mouth proceeding which he have scramble through as he see now without any worthy aim or even any intelligible purpose he have nothing very heinous with which to reproach himself but upon the other side he have most certainly nothing of which to be particularly proud so this be all that living come to you hear of other people be rapt by splendid sin and splendid virtue and you anticipate that to-morrow some such majestic energy would transfigure you own living and change everything : but the great adventure never arrive somehow and the day be fritter away piecemeal what with eat you dinner and take a wholesome walk and check up you bank account and dovetail scrap of parish register and land-patent and county record into a irrefutable pedigree and see that you clothes be press and look over the newspaper -- and what with other infinitesimal avocation each one innocent none of any particular importance and each consume a irrevocable moment of the allotted time -- until at last you find that living have not necessarily any climax at all and patricium would call he presently once very long ago some one have say that the most pathetic tragedy in life be to get nothing in particular out of it the die man could not now recollect quite who that person be he wonder vaguely what might have be the outcome if rudolph musgrave have whole-heartedly seek not wait for the great adventure if rudolph musgrave have put -- however irrationally -- more energy and less second-thought into live if rudolph musgrave have not be contented to be just a musgrave of matocton well it be too late now he view he whole life now in epitome and much as you may see at night the hackneyed vista from you window leap to incisiveness under the lash of lightning no the life of rudolph musgrave have never rise to the plane of dignity not even to that of seem to rudolph musgrave a connected and really important transaction on rudolph musgrave 's part yet lichfield none the better for rudolph musgrave 's have live be none the worse thank heaven and there be younger man in lichfield -- man who do not mean to fail as rudolph musgrave and he fellow all have fail eh yes what be the toast that rudolph musgrave drink so long ago to the new lichfield which these younger man be make to this new south that have not any longer need of I or of my kind to this new south she do not gaze unwillingly nor too complacently upon old year and dare concede that but with loss of manliness may any man encroach upon the heritage of a dog or of a trotting-horse and consider the exploit of a ancestor to guarantee a innate and personal excellence for to she all former glory be less a jewel than a touchstone and with she portion of it daily she appraise she own do and without vain speech and she high past she value now in chief as fit foundation of that edifice whereon she labor day by day and with augment stroke yes that be it and it be true yet rudolph musgrave 's life on earth be end now -- the only life that he would ever have on earth -- and it have never rise to the plane of seem even to rudolph musgrave a really important transaction on rudolph musgrave 's part then patricium speak low and very low she call to olaf and the dim wistful eye of rudolph musgrave lift and gaze full upon she standing there and be no longer wistful and the man make as though to rise and could not and he face be very glad for in the die man have awaken the pulse of a old strange half-forgotten magic and all he old delight in the girl who have share in and have provoke this ancient wonder-working together with a quite new consciousness of the inseparability of patricium 's foible from he existence so that he be incuriously aware of he imbecility in not have know always that patricium must come back some day not as a glorious unfamiliar angel but unaltered i be glad you have not change why but of course nothing would have count if you have change -- not even for the better patricium for you and what you mean to I be real that only be real -- that we not be demigod but be just what we be once climb together very high where we could glimpse the star -- and nothing else can ever be of any importance what we inherit be too much for we be it not my dear and now it be not formidable any longer oh but i love you very greatly patricium and now at last my dear i seem to understand -- as in that old old time when you and i be glad together -- but he do not say this aloud for it seem to he that he stand in a cool pleasant garden and that patricium come toward he through the long shadow of sunset the lacy fold and furbelow and semi-transparency that clothe she be now tinge with gold and now as a hedge or a flower bed screen she from the level ray be soften into multitudinous graduation of gray and mauve and violet they do not speak but in she eye he find compassion and such tenderness as awed he and then as a light be puff out they be the eye of a friendly stranger he understand for a instant that of necessity it be decree time must turn back and everything even rudolph musgrave be just as it have be when he first see patricium for they have make nothing of they life and so they must begin all over again _ failure be not permit _ he be say _ you be cousin rudolph be not you _ she ask and rudolph musgrave know he have forget something of vast import but what this knowledge have pertain to he no longer know then rudolph musgrave note with a delicious tingle somewhere about he heart that she hair be like the reflection of a sunset in ripple water -- only many time more beautiful of course -- and that she mouth be a inconsiderable trifle a scrap of sanguine curve and that she eye be purple glimpse of infinity the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of the rivet in
