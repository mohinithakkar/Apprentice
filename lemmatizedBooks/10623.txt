_ -rrb- breath of life -lrb- _ she go in there _ -rrb- harry : oh i wish claire would not be strange like that -lrb- _ helplessly _ -rrb- what be it what be the matter dick : it be merely the excess of a particularly rich temperament harry : but it be grow on she i sometimes wonder if all this -lrb- _ indicate the place around he _ -rrb- be a good thing it would be all right if she would just do what she do in the beginning -- make the flower as good as possible of they kind that be a awfully nice thing for a woman to do -- raise flower but there be something about this -- change thing into other thing -- put thing together and make queer new thing -- this -- dick : create harry : give it any name you want it to have -- it be unsettling for a woman they say claire 's a shark at it but what be the good of it if it get she what be the good of it anyway suppose we can produce new thing lord -- look at the one one we have get -lrb- _ look outside turn back _ -rrb- heaven what a noise

eat a egg without salt i must say i do not get claire lately i would like to have charlie emmon see she -- he be fix up a lot of people shoot to piece in the war claire need something to tone she nerve _ up _ you think it would irritate she dick : she would probably get no little entertainment out of it harry : yes dog-gone she she would -lrb- tom _ now take more heroic measure to make himself hear at the door _ -rrb- funny -- how the wind can fool you now by not look around i could imagine -- why i could imagine anything funny be not it about imagination and claire say i have not get any dick : it would make a amusing drawing -- what the wind make you think be there -lrb- _ first make form with he hand then level the soil prepare by _ anthony _ trace line with he finger _ -rrb- yes really -- quite jolly -lrb- tom _ after a moment of peer in at they smile go away _ -rrb- harry : you be another one of the queer duck be not you come now -- give I the dirt have you queer one really get anything -- or do you just put it over on we that you have dick : -lrb- _ smile draw on _ -rrb- not say anything eh well i guess you be wise there if you keep mum -- how be we go to prove there be nothing there dick : i do not keep mum i draw harry : line that do not make anything -- how can they tell you anything well all i ask be do not make claire queer claire 's a first water good sport -- really so do not encourage she to be queer dick : trouble be if you be queer enough to be amusing it might -- open the door to queerness harry : now do not say thing like that to claire dick : i do not have to harry : then _ you _ think she be queer do you queer as you be you think she be queer i would like to have dr emmon come out -lrb- _ after a moment of silently watch _ dick _ who be have a good time with he draw _ -rrb- you know frankly i doubt if you be a good influence for claire -lrb- dick _ lift he head ever so slightly _ -rrb- oh i do not worry a bit about -- thing a husband might worry about i suppose a intellectual woman -- and for all claire 's hate of she ancestor she be get the bug herself why she have time of bore into thing until she do not know you be there what do you think i catch she do the other day read latin well -- a woman that read latin need not worry a husband much dick : they say a good deal in latin harry : but i be say i suppose a woman who live a good deal in she mind never do have much -- well what you might call passion -lrb- _ use the word as if it should not be use brow knit be look ahead do not see _ dick _ 's face turn to he with a laugh _ -rrb- i suppose you know pretty much all there be to know about woman dick : perhaps one or two detail have escape I harry : well for that matter you might know all there be to know about woman and not know much about claire but now about -lrb- _ do not want to say passion again _ -rrb- -- oh feeling -- claire have a certain -- well a certain -- dick : irony harry : which be really more -- more -- dick : more fetch perhaps harry : yes than the thing itself but of course -- you would not have much of a thing that you have irony about dick : oh -- would not you i mean -- a man might harry : i would like to talk to edgeworth about claire but it be not easy to talk to tom about claire -- or to claire about tom dick : -lrb- _ alert _ -rrb- they be very old friend be not they harry : why -- yes they be though they have not be together much of late year edgeworthy always go to the end of the earth to -- meditate about something i must say i do not get it if you have a place -- that be the place for you to be and he do have a place -- best kind of family connection and it be a very good business he father leave he publish business -- in good shape too when old edgeworthy die i would not call tom a great success in life -- but claire do listen to what he say dick : yes i have notice that harry : so i would like to get he to tell she to quit this queer business of make thing grow that never grow before dick : but be you sure that be what he would tell she be not he in the same business himself harry : why he do not raise anything -lrb- tom _ be again at the door _ -rrb- dick : anyway i think he might have some idea that we can not very well reach each other harry : damn nonsense what have we get intelligence for dick : to let each other alone i suppose only we have not enough to do it -lrb- tom _ be now knock on the door with a revolver _ harry _ half turn decide to be too intelligent to turn _ -rrb- harry : do not tell I i be get nerve but the way some of you people talk be enough to make even a aviator jumpy can not reach each other then we be fool if i be here and you be there why can not we reach each other dick : because i be i and you be you harry : no wonder you drawing 's queer a man who can not reach another man -- -lrb- tom _ here reach they by point the revolver in the air and firing it _ dick _ dig he hand into the dirt _ harry _ jump to one side fearfully look around _ tom _ with a pleased smile to see he at last have they attention move the handle to indicate he would be glad to come in _ -rrb- harry : why -- it be tom what the -- -lrb- _ go to the door _ -rrb- he be lock out and claire 's get the key -lrb- _ go to the inner door try it _ -rrb- and she be lock in -lrb- _ try to see she in there _ -rrb- claire claire -lrb- _

here do not shoot yourself -lrb- _ try hard to get the word through _ -rrb- _ shoot _ yourself i mean -- do not -lrb- _ petulantly to _ dick -rrb- it be ridiculous that you can not make a man understand you when he look right at you like that -lrb- _ turn back to _ tom -rrb- read my lip lip i be say -- oh damn where be claire all right -- i 'll explain it with motion we want the salt -lrb- _ go over it to himself _ -rrb- and claire would not let we go out for it on account of the temperature salt temperature -lrb- _ take he egg-cup to the door violent motion of shake in salt _ -rrb- but

on salt tell tom now to go back and get it it be a stormy morning and there 'll be just one opening of the door harry : how can we tell he what we can not make he hear and why do he think we be hold this conversation instead of let he in claire : it would be interesting to know i wonder if he 'll tell we harry : claire be this any time to wonder anything claire : give up the idea of salt for you egg and i 'll let he in -lrb- _ hold up the key to _ tom _ to indicate that for she part she be quite ready to let he in _ -rrb- harry : i want my egg claire : then ask he to bring the salt it be quite simple -lrb- harry _ go through another pantomime with the egg-cup and the miss shaker _ claire _ still stand half-way down cellar sneeze _ harry _ grow all the while less amiable explain with thermometer and flower-pot that there can only be one opening of the door _ tom _ look interested but unenlightened but suddenly he smile nod vanish _ -rrb- harry : well thank heaven -lrb- _ exhaust _ -rrb- that be over claire : -lrb- _ sit on the top step _ -rrb- it be all so queer he lock out on he side of the door you lock in on yours look right at each other and -- harry : -lrb- _ in mockery _ -rrb- and I try to tell he to kindly fetch the salt claire : yes harry : -lrb- _ to _ dick -rrb- well i do not do so bad a job do i quite a idea explain we situation with the thermometer and the flower-pot that be really a apology for keep he out there heaven know -- some explanation be in order -lrb- _ he be watch and see _ tom _ come _ -rrb- now there he be claire and probably pretty well feed up with the weather -lrb- claire _ go to the door stop before it she and _ tom _ look at each other through the glass then she let he in _ -rrb- tom : and now i be in for a time it seem i be not to be in but after i get the idea that you be keep I out there to see if i could get the idea -- it would be too humiliating for a wall of glass to keep one from understanding -lrb- _ take it from he pocket _ -rrb- so there be the other thermometer where do you want it -lrb- claire _ take it _ -rrb- claire : and where 's the pepper tom : -lrb- _ put it on the table _ -rrb- and here be the pepper

begin with you egg tom : -lrb- _ look at he egg _ -rrb- the idea of smash everything be really more intriguing than a egg harry : nice that you feel that way about it claire : -lrb- _ give _ tom _ he coffee _ -rrb- you want to hear something amusing i marry harry because i think he would smash something harry : well that be a error in judgment claire : i be such a naive trust person -lrb- harry _

flighty notion while operate a machine claire : oh harry -lrb- _ not lightly ask _ -rrb- can not you see it would be better not to have return than to return the man who leave it harry : i have some regard for human life claire : why no -- i be the one who have the regard for human life -lrb- _ more lightly _ -rrb- that be why i swiftly divorce my stick-in-the-mud artist and marry -- the man of

its height be see indicate a very high window outside be see the top of a tree this outer wall of the building be on a slant so that the entrance right be near and the left be front right front be a section of a huge square column on the rear of this face the window be hang a picture of sila morton two man be stand before this portrait _ senator lewi _ be the midwestern state senator he be not of the city from which morton college rise but of a more country community farther in-state _ felix fejevary _ now near the age of he father in the first act be a american of the more sophisticated type -- prosperous have the poise of success in affair and place in society _ senator : and this be the boy who found the place eh it be he idea fejevary : yes and he hill i be there the afternoon he tell my father there must be a college here i be not any older then than my boy be now -lrb- _ as if himself surprise by this _ -rrb- senator : well he enlist a good man when he let you in on it i have be tell the college would not be what it be today but for you mr fejevary fejevary : i have a sentiment about it and where we sentiment be there we work go also senator : yes well it be those mainspring of sentiment that win the war -lrb- _ he be please with this _ -rrb- fejevary : -lrb- _ nod _ -rrb- morton college do she part in win the war senator : i know a fine show fejevary : and we be hold up we end right along you 'll see the boy drill this afternoon it be a great place for they here on the hill -- show up from so far around they be a fine lot of fellow you know i presume that they go in as strike-breaker during the trouble down here at the steel work the plant would have have to close but for morton college that be one reason i venture to propose this thing of a state appropriation for enlargement why do not we sit down a moment there be no conflict with the state university -- they have they territory we have ours ours be a important one -- industrially speak the state will lose nothing in have a good strong college here -- a one-hundred-per-cent-american college senator : i admit i be very favourably impressed fejevary : i hope you 'll tell you committee so -- and let I have a chance to talk to they senator : let 's see have not you a pretty radical man here fejevary : i wonder if you mean holden senator : holden 's the man i have read thing that make I question he americanism fejevary : oh -- -lrb- _ gesture of depreciation _ -rrb- i do not think he be so much a radical as a particularly human human-being senator : but we do not want radical human being fejevary : he have a genuine sympathy with youth that be invaluable in a teacher you know and then -- he be a scholar -lrb- _ he betray here he feeling of superiority to he companion but too subtly for he companion to get it _ -rrb- senator : oh -- scholar we can get scholar enough what we want be american fejevary : american who be scholar senator : you can pick 'em off every bush -- pay they a little more than they be pay in some other cheap john college excuse I -- i do not mean this be a cheap john college fejevary : of course not one could not think that of morton college but that -- pay they a little more interest I that be another reason i want to talk to you committee on appropriation we claim to value education and then we let highly train gifted man fall behind the plumber senator : well that be the plumber 's fault let the teacher talk to the plumber fejevary : -lrb- _ with a smile _ -rrb- no better not let they talk to the plumber he might tell they what to do about it in fact be tell they senator : that be ridiculous they can not serve both god and mammon fejevary : then let god give they mammon i mean let the state appropriate senator : of course this state mr fejevary appropriate no money for radical excuse I but why do you keep this man holden fejevary : in the scholar 's world we be know because of he and really holden 's not a radical -- in the worst sense what he do not see be -- expediency not enough the man of affair to realize that we can not always have literally what we have theoretically he be a idealist something of the -- man of vision senator : if he have the right vision he would see that we do not every minute have literally what we have theoretically because we be fight to keep the thing we have oh i sometimes think the man of affair have the only vision take you mr fejevary -- a banker these teacher -- book -- book -lrb- _ push all book back _ -rrb- why if they have to take for one day the responsibility that fall on you shoulder -- big decision to make -- man among man -- and all the time worry irritation particularly now with labor ride the high horse like a fool i know something about these thing i go to the state house because my community persuade I it be my duty but i be the man of affair myself fejevary : oh yes i know you company do much to develop that whole northern part of the state senator : i think i may say we do well that be why after three session i be chairman of the appropriation committee i know how to use money to promote the state so -- teacher that would be a perpetual vacation to I now

enlarge before we can grow -lrb- _ answer _ holden 's _ smile _ -rrb- yes it be ironic but that be the way of it it be a nice thing to open the anniversary with fifty thousand from the steel work -- but fifty thousand dollar -- nowadays -- to a institution -lrb- _ wave the fifty thousand aside _ -rrb- they 'll do more later i think when they see we come into we own meanwhile as you know there be this chance for a appropriation from the state i find that the legislature the member who count be very friendly to morton college they like the spirit we have here well now i come to you and you be one of the big reason for my want to put this over you salary make I blush it be all wrong that a man like you should have these petty worry particularly with mr holden so in need of the thing a

give more money than i could afford to give give time and think that i could have use for personal gain holden : that be true i know fejevary : i do not know just why i have do it sentiment i suppose

because there come to this valley a man who hold he vision for mankind above he own advantage and because that man find in this valley a man who want beauty for he fellow-men as he want no other thing ' holden : -lrb- _ take it up _ -rrb- ` bear of the fight for freedom and the aspiration to richer living we believe that morton college -- rise as from the soil itself -- may strengthen all those here and everywhere who fight for the life there be in freedom and may to the measure it can loosen for america the beauty that breathe from knowledge ' -lrb- _ move by the word he have speak _ -rrb- do you know i would rather do that -- really do that -- than -- grow big fejevary : yes but you see or rather what you do not see be you have to look at the world in which you find yourself the only way to stay alive be to grow big it be be hard but i have try to -- carry on holden : and so have i try to carry on but it be very hard -- carry on a dream fejevary : well i be try to make it easier

-rrb- i do not know why i feel i have to go to greece i know then that i be go to teach something within sociology and i do not want anything i feel about beauty to be leave out of what i formulate about society the greek -- fejevary : -lrb- _ as _ holden _ have pause before what he see _ -rrb- i remember you tell I the greek be the passion of you student day holden : not so much because they create beauty but because they be able to let beauty flow into they life -- to create themselves in beauty so as a romantic young man -lrb- _ smile _ -rrb- it seem if i could go where they have be -- what i have feel might take form anyway i have a wonderful time there oh what would not i give to have again that feeling of life 's infinite possibility fejevary : -lrb- _ nod _ -rrb- a youthful feeling holden : -lrb- _ softly _ -rrb- i like youth well i be just back visit my sister here at the time of the tenth anniversary i have a chance then to go to harvard as instructor a good chance for

this great thing you have get ' and so i stay for i feel that here be soil in which i could grow and that one 's whole life be not too much to give to a place with root like that -lrb- _ a little bitterly _ -rrb- forgive I if this seem rhetoric fejevary : -lrb- _ a gesture of protest silent a moment _ -rrb- you make it -- hard for I -lrb- _ with exasperation _ -rrb- do not you think i would like to indulge myself in a exalted mood and why do not i i can not afford it -- not now will not you have a little patience and faith -- faith that the thing we want will be there for we after we have work we way through the wood we be in the wood now it be go to take we combined brain to get we out i do not mean just morton college holden : no -- america as to get out i think you be all wrong fejevary : that be one of you sweeping statement holden nobody 's all wrong even you be not holden : and in what way be i wrong -- from the standpoint of you senator lewi fejevary : he be not my senator lewi he be the state 's and we have to take he as he be why he object of course to you radical activity he speak of you defense of conscientious objector holden : -lrb- _ slowly _ -rrb- i think a man who be willing to go to prison for what he believe have stuff in he no college need turn its back on fejevary : well he do not agree with you -- nor do i holden : -lrb- _ still quietly _ -rrb- and i think a society which permit thing to go on which i can prove go on in we federal prison have better stop and take a fresh look at itself to stand for that and then talk of democracy and idealism -- oh it show no mentality for one thing fejevary : -lrb- _ easily _ -rrb- i presume the prison do need a clean up as to fred jordan you can not expect I to share you admiration we own fred -- my nephew fred morton go to france and give he life there be some little courage holden in do that holden : i be not try to belittle it but he have the whole spirit of he age with he -- fortunate boy the man who stand outside the idealism of this time -- fejevary : take a good deal upon himself i should say holden : there be not any other such loneliness you know in you heart it be a noble courage fejevary : it lack -- humility -lrb- holden _ laugh scoffingly _ -rrb- and i think you lack it i be ask you to co-operate with I for the good of morton college holden : why not do it the other way you say enlarge that we may grow that be false it be not of the nature of growth why not do it the way of sila morton and walt whitman -- each man be he purest and intensest self i be full of this fervor when you come in i be more and more disappointed in we student they be empty -- flippant no sensitive moment open they to beauty no exaltation make they -- what they have not know they be i conclude some of the fault must be mine the only student i reach be the hindu perhaps madeline morton -- i do not quite make she out i too must have go into a dead stratum but i can get back here alone this afternoon -- -lrb- _ softly _ -rrb- i be back fejevary : i think we 'll have to let the hindu go holden : -lrb- _ astonished _ -rrb- go we best student fejevary : this college be for

out of here holden : well i seem to have miss something -- disgraceful performance -- the hindu madeline -- -lrb- _ stop bewildered _ -rrb- fejevary : you mean to say you do not know about the disturbance out here holden : i go right home after the address then come up here alone fejevary : upon my word you do lead a serene life while you have be sit here in contemplation i have be to the police court -- try to get my niece out of jail that be what come of have radical around holden : what happen fejevary : one of we beloved hindu make himself obnoxious on the campus give out handbill about freedom for indium -- howl over deportation we american boy would not stand for it a policeman see the fuss -- come up and start to put the hindu in he place then madeline rush in and it end in she pound the policeman with she tennis racket holden : madeline morton do that fejevary : -lrb- _ sharply _ -rrb- you seem pleased holden : i be -- interested fejevary : well i be not interested i be

sit and talk with the executive head as you have here with I holden : i do not know perhaps not fejevary : then be reasonable no one be entirely free that be nave it be rather egotistical to want to be we be hold by we relation to other -- by we obligation to the -lrb- _ vaguely _ -rrb- -- the ultimate thing come now -- you admit certain dissatisfaction with yourself so -- why not go with intensity into just the thing you teach -- and not touch quite so many other thing holden : i could not teach anything if i do not feel free to go wherever that thing take I thirty year ago i be ask to come to this college precisely because my science be not in isolation because of my vivid feeling of we as a moment in a long sweep because of my faith in the greater beauty we further living may unfold -lrb- harry _ enter _ -rrb- harry : excuse I miss morton be here now mr fejevary fejevary : -lrb- _ frown hesitate _ -rrb- ask she to come up here in five minute -lrb- _ after _ harry _ have go _ -rrb- i think we have throw a scare into madeline i think as long as she have be take to jail it would be no worse for we to have she stay there awhile she be be hold since one o'clock that ought to teach she reason holden : be there a case against she fejevary : no i get it fix up explain that it be just college girl foolishness -- would not happen again one reason i want this talk with you

toward get fred jordan out of prison it be a disgrace to america that two year after the war close he should be keep there -- much of the time in solitary confinement -- because he could not believe in war it be small -- vengeful -- it be the russium of the czar i shall do what be in my power to fight the deportation of gurkul singh and certainly i shall leave no stone unturn if you persist in you amazing idea of dismiss the other hindu from college for what -- i ask you dismiss -- for _ what _ because they love liberty enough to give they life to it the day you dismiss they burn we high-sounding manifesto mr fejevary and admit that morton college now sell she soul to the -- committee on appropriation fejevary : well you force I to be as specific as you be if you do these thing i

destroy this flesh and blood thing holden : -lrb- _ as one fight to keep he head above water _ -rrb- honesty be not a tenuous remote thing fejevary : there be a kind of honesty in selfishness we can not always have it oh i use to -- go through thing but i have strike a pace -- one do -- and go ahead holden : forgive I but i do not think you have have certain temptation to -- selfishness fejevary : how do you know what i have have you have no way of know what be in I -- what other thing i might have be you know my heritage you think that be leave nothing but i find myself here in america i love those dependent on I my wife -- who be use to a certain manner of live my child -- who be to become part of the america of they time i have never say this to another human being -- i have never

madeline have you no intelligence have not it occur to you that you performance would worry I a little madeline : i suppose it be a nuisance and on such a busy day -lrb- _ change _ -rrb- but if you be go to worry horace be the one you should worry about -lrb- _ answer he look _ -rrb- why he get it all up he make I ashamed fejevary : and you be not at all ashamed of what you have do madeline : ashamed why -- no fejevary : then you would better be a girl who rush in and assault a officer madeline : -lrb- _ earnestly explain it _ -rrb- but uncle felix i have to stop he no one else do fejevary : madeline i do not know whether you be try to be nave -- madeline : -lrb- _ angrily _ -rrb- well i be _ not _ i like that i think i 'll go home fejevary : i think you will not it be stupid of you not

manner -- quietly from feel _ -rrb- madeline have you no love for this place madeline : -lrb- _ doggedly after think _ -rrb- yes i have -lrb- _ she sit down _ -rrb- and i do not know why i have fejevary : certainly it be not strange if ever a girl have a background morton college be madeline fejevary morton 's background -lrb- _ he too now seat by the table _ -rrb- do you remember you grandfather morton madeline : not very well -lrb- _ a quality which seem sullenness _ -rrb- i could not bear to look at he he shake so fejevary : -lrb- _ turn away real pain _ -rrb- oh -- how cruel

you see he be too old then -- fejevary : -lrb- _ he hand up to stop she _ -rrb- i wish i could bring he back for a moment so you could see what he be before he -lrb- _ bitterly _ -rrb- shake so he be a powerful man who be as real as the earth he be strangely of the earth as if something go from it to he -lrb- _ look at she intently _ -rrb- queer you should be the one to have no sentiment about he for you and he -- sometimes when i be with you it be as if -- he be near he have no personal ambition madeline he be ambitious for the earth and its people i wonder if you can realize what it mean to my father -- in a strange land where he might so easily have be misunderstand push down to find a friend like that it be not so much the material thing -- though uncle sila be always make they right -- and as if -- oh hardly conscious what he be do -- so little it matter it be the way he _ get _ father and by that very value keep alive what be there to value why he literally lay this country at my father 's foot -- as if that be what this country be for as if it make up for the hard early thing -- for the wrong thing madeline : he must really have be a pretty nice old party no doubt i would have hit it off with he all right i do not seem to hit it off with the -- speech about he somehow i want to say ` oh give we a rest ' fejevary : -lrb- _ offend _ -rrb- and that i presume be what you want to say to I madeline : no no i do not mean you uncle though -lrb- _ hesitatingly _ -rrb- i be wonder how you could think you be talk on you side fejevary : what do you mean -- my side madeline : oh i do not -- exactly that be nice about he be -- of the earth sometimes when i be out for a tramp -- way off by myself -- yes i know and i wonder if that do not explain he feeling about the indian father tell I how grandfather take it to heart about the indian fejevary : he feel it as you would feel it if it be you brother so he must give he choicest land to the thing we might become ` then maybe i can lie under the same sod with the red boy and not be ashamed ' -lrb- madeline _ nod appreciatively _ -rrb- madeline : yes that be really -- all right fejevary : -lrb- _ irritated by what seem charily state approval _ -rrb- ` all right ' well i be not willing to let this man 's name pass from we time and it seem rather bitter that sila morton 's granddaughter should be the one to stand in my way madeline : why uncle felix i be not stand in you way of course i would not do that i -- -lrb- _ rather bashfully _ -rrb- i love the hill i be think about it in jail i get fuddle on direction in there so i ask the woman who hang around which way be college hill ` right through there ' she say a blank wall i sit and look through that wall -- long time -lrb- _ she look front again look through that blank wall _ -rrb- it be all -- kind of funny then later she come and tell I you be out there and i think it be cork of you to come and tell they they could not put that over on college hill and i know bakhshish will appreciate it too i wonder where he go fejevary : go i fancy he will not go much of anywhere to-night madeline : what do you mean fejevary : why he be hold for this hearing of course madeline : you mean -- you come and get just I -- and leave he there fejevary : certainly madeline : -lrb- _ rise _ -rrb- then i 'll have to go and get he fejevary : madeline do not be so absurd you do not get people out of jail by stop in and call for they madeline : but you get I fejevary : because of year of influence at that it be not simple thing of this nature be pretty serious nowadays it be only you ignorance get you out madeline : i do seem ignorant while you be fix it up for I why do not you arrange for he too fejevary : because i be not in the business of get foreign revolutionist out of jail madeline : but he do not do as much as i do fejevary : it be not what he do it be what he be we do not want he here madeline : well i guess i be not for that fejevary : may i ask why you have appoint yourself guardian of these stranger madeline : perhaps because they be stranger fejevary : well they be the wrong kind of stranger madeline : be it true that the hindu who be here last year be to be deport be america go to turn he over to the government he fight fejevary : i have a idea they will all be deport i be not so sorry this thing happen it will get they into the court -- and i do not think they have money to fight madeline : -lrb- _ give it clean and straight _ -rrb- gee i think that be rotten fejevary : quite likely you inelegance will not affect it

leave I fejevary : what be you drive at madeline : -lrb- _ simply _ -rrb- they can have my money fejevary : be you crazy what _ be _ these people to you madeline : they be people from the other side of the world who come here believe in we draw from the far side of the world by thing we say about ourselves well i be go to pretend -- just for fun -- that the thing we say about ourselves be true so
