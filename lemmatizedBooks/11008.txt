herd of we all draw in one way or another by the war have catch the first american ship the old st paul and with deck crowd with trunk and mail-bag from half a dozen ship steam eastward on the all but empty ocean there be reservist hurry to the color correspondent man go to rescue wife and sister some be hit through they pocketbook some through they imagination -- like the young woman hope to be red cross nurse or to help in some way they be not sure how one have a steamer chair next mine -- a pale broadway tomboy sort of girl in a boyish sailor suit who look as if she need sleep without exactly be on the stage she yet appear to live on the fringe of it and combine the slangy freedom of a chorus girl with a certain quick wisdom and hard sense it be she who discover a steerage passenger on the liverpool dock who have lose he wife and be bring he four little child back to ireland from chicago and while the other cabin passenger fume over they luggage take up a collection for he then and there listen here she would say grab my arm i want to tell you something i be go to see this thing -- d'you know what i mean -- for what it 'll do to I -- you know -- for its effect on my

know -- they do not affect I and i have read about nursing -- i have prepare for this now i do not know how to go about it but it seem to I that a woman who can -- you know -- go right with 'em --

several belgian and a quartet of young frenchman who play card every night and gravely drink bottle after bottle of champagne to the glory of france even the balkan be with we in the shape of a tall soldier-like bulgarian with a heavy mustache and the eye of a kindly and highly intelligent hawk he be go back home -- to fight yes to fight with servium ask some one politely with the usual vague american notion of the balkan state the bulgarian 's eye shine curiously you have a sense of humor he say this man have do newspaper work in russium and america study at harvard and he talk about we politics theater university society generally it be a pity he say and the result of the comparative lack of critical spirit in america that mr roosevelt have be a hero so long there be party papers mechanically print they praise or blame -- and then of course the new york evening post and the springfield republican -- but no general intelligent criticism of idea for a popular idol to meet and answer on the whole he be a good influence -- but in place of something better it be not good for a man to stand so long in the bright sunshine that it be impossible for the mexican to work out they own salvation he doubt i think of bulgarium -- surely we inheritance of turkish rule be almost as bad and of how the nation have respond and of the intensive culture we have at a time when we be only a name to most western european he be but one of those new potentiality which every whisper from the now cloud-wrapped continent seem to be open -- this tall scholar-fighter from the comic-opera land where mr shaw place he chocolate soldier in a steamer chair a frail-looking young woman in a white polo coat look nervously out on the sea she be irish and come of a fight line -- father uncle and brother in army and navy she husband in command of a british cruiser scout the very steamship lane through which we be steam frail-looking but not frail in spirit -- a fighter bear with irish keenness and wit she be ready to prick any balloon in sight she have chase about the world too long after a fighting family to care much about settle down now they could not afford to keep a place in england and live somewhere else half the time -- and after all what be there in be a cabbage she talk little you can learn more about people merely watch they and she lay in she steamer chair and watch she could tell merely by look at they in they civilian 's clothes which be army and which navy man which rn and which merchant - service man we speak of a young lieutenant from a indium artillery regiment yes -- ` garrison-gunner ' she say she be sorry for the german people but the kaiser be quite off he rocker and have to be lick war suddenly reach out for we as we come up to mersey bar and a officer in khaki bellow from the pilot-boat : take down you wireless down it come and there the ship stay for the night while the passenger crowd about a volunteer town-crier who read from the papers that have come aboard and in the strange quiet that descend on a anchor steamship ask each other how true it be that the german military bubble -- a magazine article with that title have be much read on the way over -- have burst slowly next morning we creep up the mersey past a rusty tramp outward bind crowd with khaki-clad man all the shipping be toot as she sweep by and the man cheer and wave they hat at the land they might never come back to the regular landing-stage be take by transport track be hold for troop-train and it be night before we get down to london where crowd and bus storm along as usual and barytone soloist in every music-hall be roar defiance to the kaiser and reiterate that britannium rule the wave into the fog of war that cover the continent a army of englishman have vanish none know where out of it come rumor of victory but as i cross the strand that morning on the way to chare cross a newsboy push a extra into the cab window -- the german be enter brussels yet we fight into the boat train just as if thousand of people be not fight to get away from the very place we hope to reach there be two business man in we coupe go to france a elderly irish lady a intransigent unionist with black goggles and umbrella hope to get through to she invalid brother in diest and a bright sweet-faced little englishwoman in nurse 's dark-blue uniform and bonnet bind for antwerp where she sister 's convent have be turn into a hospital she tell about she little east-coast town as we cross the sunny channel we trail together into the great empty station at ostend and after a hour or two find a few car get away so to speak of they own accord the low checker-board belgian field drift quickly past then bruge with a wounded soldier lean on the shoulder of two companion then ghent there be a great crowd about the station -- man throw out of work man in flat cloth cap smoke pipe -- the town just recover from the panic of that afternoon flag have be haul down -- the american consul be even ask if he do not think it would be safer to take down he flag -- some of the civic guard fear they would be shoot on sight if the german see they in uniform tear off they coat and throw they in the canal other throw in cartridge thousand of gallon of gasolene be pour on the ground and everybody watch the church tower for the red flag which would signal that firing be about to begin le bien public of ghent however protest stoutly because its mail edition have be refuse at the station : it be not alone on the field of battle that one must be brave for we civilian real courage consist in do we ordinary duty up to the last in limburg postman make they round while prussian inundate the region and peasant go right along with they sowing while down the road troops be fall back from the firing-line let we think of we son sleep forever down there in the trench of haelen and tirlemont and aerschot of those brave artilleryman who for twenty day have be wait in the fort at liege the help so many time promise from the ally of we lancer charge into mitrailleuse-fire as if they be in a tournament let we remember that we heroic little infantryman crouch behind a hedge or in a trench keep up they fire for ten hour run until they ammunition be exhaust and force at last to retire wound and wear out without a chief to take order from have have no other thought than that of find some burgomaster or commissioner of police in order not to be take for deserter let we think a little of all these brave man and be worthy of they there be no music-hall in belgium and there be poster on the blank wallum even of little village remind band and hurdy-gurdy player and the proprietor of dance-hall that this be no time for unnecessary noise there be no soldier go gayly off to war the belgian be come back from war they have be ask to hold out for three day and they have hold for three week all they little country be a battle-field and belgium open to the invader it be too late to get to brussels but there be still a train to antwerp at puer soldier be digging trench and string approach with barb wire the dike have be open and part of the country flood farther on we pass the antwerp fort then comely suburb where house have be tear down and acre of tree and shrub -- precious as may be imagine to a people who line they country road with elm and linden like avenue in park and build monument to benevolent-looking old horticulturist -- chop down and burn and go presently into the old city itself dull-flaming with the scarlet gold and black of the belgian flag and with something that seem to radiate from the life itself of this hearty happy people after all they century of trade and war and good food and good art -- like they own rubens and van dyck there be no business not a ship move in the scheldt all who work at all be help prepare for the possible siege those who do not crowd the sidewalk cafe listen to tale from the front guess by the aid of map whither across the silent screen southwest the german avalanche be spread treason betrayal savagery be on everybody 's lip for antwerp you might say have be half german many of its rich and influential man be of german origin although they have live in belgium for year and now the belgian feel they have live there as spy and the seizure of belgium be a act long and carefully plan one be tell of the finding of rifle in german cellar marked preserve of german consul authorize to give prize for the most complete inventory of they neighborhood turn in by amateur spy speak to one man about the ruben descent from the cross still hang in the cathedral i suggest that such a place be safe from bombardment he look up at the lace-like old tower whose chime jangle down through leap shaft and jet of gothic stone have so long be antwerp 's voice they would not stop a minute he say all eastern belgium be cut off brussels to which people run over for dinner and the theater might have be in china meanwhile antwerp seem safe for the time and i return to ghent get a train next day as far south as deynze where the owner of a two-wheeled belgian cart be induce to take I another thirty kilometre on down to courtrai it be rumor that there have be a battle at courtraus -- it be at any rate close to the border and the german right wing and in the general line of they advance we rattle along the hard highroad pave with belgian block with a well-pounded dirt path at the side for bicycle between almost uninterrupted row of low house and tiny field in which man and woman both be work other cart like ours pass by occasional heavy wagon draw by one of the handsome belgian draft-horse and now and then a small loaded cart owner perch on top zip along behind a jolly belgian work dog -- pull as if he soul depend on it and apparently have the time of he life every one be busy not a foot of ground waste a more incongruous place into which to force the waste and lawlessness of war it would be hard to imagine past a old chateau with its lake and pheasant-preserve along the river ly with its mile of flax soak in this peculiarly potent water now dry in countless little cone like the tent of some vast lilliputian army and so at last into courtraus it be like hundred of other quaint old town along the french and flemish border not yet rake by war but motionless with workman idle young man go to the front and nothing for people to do but exchange rumor and wait for the clash to come i stroll round the old square and through some of the wind street one window be fill with tricolor sash carry the phrase : long live we dear belgium may god preserve she on blank wall be this proclamation in parallel column of french and flemish : ville de courtrai avis important a la population courtraisienne stad kortrijk belangrijk bericht aan de kortrijksche bevolking i be about to make a appeal to you reason and you sentiment of humanity if in the course of the unjust war which we be now endure it happen that french or belgian troops bring german prisoner to we city i beseech you to maintain you calm and dignity these prisoner wound or not i shall take under my protection become i say that they be not really to blame for act which they have be order to do under threat of cruel punishment yes i say i shall take they under my protection because my heart bleed to think that they too have leave behind those dear to they -- a aged father a old mother a wife child sister or sweetheart whom separation have plunge into deepest anguish do not forget when you see these prisoner pass by i beg of you and permit yourself to shout at and insult they keep on the contrary the respectful silence appropriate to think man fellow citizen if in these grave and painful circumstance you will listen to my advice if you will recall that it be now thirty year that i have be you burgomaster and during all that time of hard work i have never ask a favor of you i feel sure that you will obey my request and on you side you may be sure that my gratitude will not be want a reynaekt burgomaster although war have not touch courtraus as yet the rumor of it more terrifying often than the thing itself have sweep through all flander along the level highway lead into courtraus troop whole family carry baby and what few household thing they could fling together in blanket cover wagon overflow with man woman and child the speed with which rumor spread be incredible in one village a group of half-drunken man who insist on jeer the german be put at the head of a column and compel to march several mile before they be release the word at once run the length of dozen of highroad that the german be take with they every one between fifteen and fifty i hear the same warning repeat on several of the road about courtraus by man and woman pant red-faced stumble blindly on from they know not what later i meet the same people straggle back to they village good-naturedly accept the jibe of those who have stay behind a linen manufacturer who live in the village of deerlyck not far from courtraus where german scout have be report kindly ask I to come out and spend the night for several mile we drive through the densely populated countryside past row of house whose occupant all seem to know he woman run out to stop he and rattle away in flemish there be excite knot of people every few step and the head keep turn this way and that as if we be all likely to be shoot any minute we drive into the courtyard of the solid old flemish house -- a house in which he and he father before he have live with tiny room full of old painting garden stable and hothouse pack close in the saving belgian fashion and all as spick and span and shine as if build yesterday -- and then into the street again it be interesting to watch this square little man roll sturdily along throw out he stout arm impatiently and fling at the nervous villager -- who treat he almost as a sort of feudal lord -- guttural flemish command to keep cool and not make fool of themselves all at once come out of nowhere a wave of panic sweep down the street like a squall across a still pond bing -- bang go wooden shutter over window the stout housewife fling the bar home and gather up they child door slam window close -- it be like something in a play -- and almost as soon as it take to tell it there be not a head not a sound the low house be one blank wall and we stand in the street alone just such scene as this people must have know in the day when europe be a general battle-ground -- when the french or the spanish come into flander just such village just such housewife slam shutter close -- you can see they now in old flemish picture slowly door and window open head poke out the little street fill the knot of people gather again we walk up and down the linen merchant fling out he arm and he reassurance more and more vigorously half a hour pass and then all at once it come again and this time it be real the german be come down the straight paved highway a mile or so away at the farther end of a avenue of elm which frame they like a tunnel be a band of horseman they be come at a easy trot half a dozen in single file on either side of the road we could see they lance hold rakishly upstand across the saddle then the tail of the near horse whisk to and fro one cross over be outline against the sky and those who could see whisper : one be stand sidewise as if this be somehow important tear roll down the cheek of the woman huddle inside the door before which we stand come nearer and nearer up that long tunnel of tree like one of those unescapable thing see in dream the little gray spot of move figure grow to strange proportion -- the german -- front of that frightful avalanche a few hundred yard away they pull down to a walk and slowly peer sharply out from under they helmet enter the silent street another moment and the leader be alongside and we find ourselves look up at a boy not more than twenty he seem with blue eye and a clean-cut gentle face he pass without a look or word but behind he a young officer soldier-like and smart in the prussian fashion with a half-opened map in he hand ask the way to a near-by village he take the linen merchant 's direction without pause and the horse swing down the side street do you speak english he call back as if in happier time we might have be friend and without wait for a answer trot on into the grow dusk they be but one of hundred of such squad of light cavalry -- uhlan for the most part -- range all over western belgium as far as ostend a dozen or so man in hostile country prepare to be cut to piece if they find the enemy they be look for or to be catch from ambush at any time by some squad of civic guard but as one watch they disappear down they long road to france they grow into something more than that and in the twilight of the quiet countryside these stern shape that ride on without turn lance upstand from tired shoulder become strange grotesque pathetic -- again the german legion of the war lord come too late into a world which must crush they at last knight of the frightful adventure ride to they death chapter ii paris at bay the calai and boulogne route be already close dieppe and havre might at any moment follow you must go now people say in london if you want to get there at all and yet the boat be crowd as it leave folkstone in bright afternoon sunshine we hurry over the channel empty of any sign of war unless war show in its very emptiness next to I sit a young frenchman different from those we have meet before hurry home to fight good-looking tall and rather languid in manner he speak english with a english accent and you would have take he for a englishman a big canvas bag full of golf-club lean against the wall behind he and he have be try to play golf at one of the east-coast seaside place in england but one could not play in a time like this and the young man sigh and wave he hand rather desperately -- one could not settle down to anything so he be go home to fight -- i suggest possibly he say -- the army have refuse he several year ago -- maybe they would take he now very politely in he quiet manner he ask I down to tea when he stand by the rail watch the tawny french cliff draw nearer one notice a certain weary droop to he shoulder in contrast to he well-tanned rather athletic-looking face -- bear a little tired perhaps like the young nobleman in bernstein 's whirlwind he baggage be address to a norman chateau on the other side be a pink-cheeked boy of seventeen all french though he speak english and divide he time between write post-card to the boy he have be visit in england and reading general von bernhardus the first chapter ` the right to make war ' he say i understand that -- yes but the second chapter -- ` the duty to make war ' -- he laugh and shake he head no -- no -- no he be the son of a insurance agent who be already at the front and although under age he hope to enlist we draw nearer dieppe -- tall french house lean inward with tricolor in the window a quay with the baggy red breeches of french soldier show here and there -- just such a scene as they paint on theater curtain at home a smoky tug whistle uproariously there be a patter of wooden shoe as child clatter along the stone jetty and from all over the crowd that have come down to greet we come brave shout of eep-eep hoorah eep-eep hoorah no news or at least no reliable news a lot of wound have be bring in business be stop the great beach desert some think the german would be in dieppe in a day or two we train be suppose to start as soon as the boat arrive and reach pari before ten that night it be after dark before we get away and another day before we crawl into st lazare there be a wild rush for place as soon as the gate open one take what one could and nine of we include three little child be glad enough to crowd into a third-class compartment two lady with the three little child be hurry away from the battle that they husband think be go to be fight near dieppe within a day or two from paris they hope to get to the south of france over and over again the husband say good-by then the guard whistle for the last time albaire and a boy of about six go to the door of the compartment to receive he father 's embrace do not let the german get you cry the father with a great air of gayety and kiss the boy again and again he return to he corner rub he fist into he eye and the tear roll out under they then the two little girl -- twin it seem about four year old in little mushroom hat -- take they turn and they put they fist into they eye and cry and then the two mother begin to cry and the man dab they eye and puff vigorously at they cigar cry good-by over and over and so at last we move out of the station the long train creep stop back creep on again through the open window one catch glimpse of row of poplar-tree and the countryside lie cool and white in the moonlight then come station with sentry stray soldier hunting for a place to squeeze in and now and then empty troop-train jolt by smell of horse in the confusion at dieppe we have have no time to get anything to eat and several hour go by before at a station lunchroom already suppose to be close i get part of a loaf of bread one of the young mother bring out a bit of chocolate the other a bottle of wine and so we have supper -- a souper de luxe as one of they laugh -- all by this time old friend eleven o'clock -- midnight -- the gas intend for a short journey grow dimmer and dimmer presently flicker out we be in darkness -- all the train be in darkness -- we be alone in france wrap in war and moonlight half real being who have be adventure together not for hour but for year the dim figure on the left sigh try one position and another uneasily and suddenly say that if it would not derange monsieur too much she would try to sleep on he shoulder it would not derange monsieur in the least on the contrary you must make yourself at home in france laugh the mother of the two little girl but the other be even more polite nous somme en amerique she murmur the train jolt slowly on a hour or two after midnight it stop and a strange figure in turban and white robe peer in complet complet cry the lady with the little girl but the figure keep stare in and turn chatter to other like he there be a crowd of they man from france 's african colony from algerium or morocco who have be work in the french mine and be now go back to take the place of trained soldier -- the daredevil turco -- send north to fight the german they do not get into we compartment but into the one next to it and as there be no place to sit down stand in patient arab fashion and after a time gradually edge into ours where they squat on the floor they talk broken french or italian or they native speech and now and then break into snatch of a wild sort of song in paris girl run into the street and throw they arm about the brave maroc as they march by but the lady with the little girl feel that they be a trifle smelly and fishing out a bottle of scent she wet a handkerchief with it and pass it round the young frenchman light a match -- three-twenty the little boy rouse from he corner suddenly announce apropo of nothing that the german ought to be drop into kettle of boiling water at once come the voice of one of the little girl sound asleep apparently before this warn he that he must not talk like that or the german might hear and shoot they we jolt on back and suddenly one become aware that the gray light be not that of the moon the lady at my left sit upright the day come she say briskly it grow lighter we pass sentry rifle stack on station platform wood -- the forest of st germain these wood be misty blue in the cool autumn morning there be bivouac fire coffee-pot on the coal and stand beside these fire soldier in kepi and red trousers and heavy blue coat with the flap pin back just such soldier and scene you have see in the war picture of detaille and de neuville bridge more house the rectangular grass-covered face of fort at last just as pari be get up for breakfast into st lazare station heap with trunk and boil with people parisian belated american tourist refugee from northeast village go somewhere anywhere to get away it be September 2 there be mile of closed shop with placard on the shutter : proprietor and personnel have be call to the color no bus or tram the few ` cab pile with the luggage of those try to get away almost no way to traverse the splendid distance but to walk papers could not be cry aloud on the street and the only news be the official communiqué and a word about some servian or russian victory in some un-pronounceable region of the east france be a history a life a idea which have take its place in the world and the bit of earth from which that history that life that think have radiate we can not sacrifice without seal the stone of the tomb over ourselves and we child and the generation to follow we thus george clemenceau be write in l'homme libre and people know that this be true and yet in that ghastly silence of pari break only by the constant flight of military automobile scream through the street on mission nobody understand those leave behind do not even know where the enemy be where the defender be or what be be do to save paris and it gradually and not unnaturally seem to the more nervous that nothing have be do -- the fort be paper the government faithless revolution imminent -- one hear the wildest thing late that afternoon i walk down from the madeleine toward the river it be the hour of the aperitif -- there be still enough people to fill cafe table -- and since Sunday it have be the hour of the german aeroplane it have come that afternoon drop a few bomb -- quelque ordure -- and sail away to return next day at the same hour you have remark explain one of the papers that people who be without wit always repeat they joke and just as i come into the place de la concorde mr taube come up out of the north you must imagine that vast open space with the bridge and river and invalide behind it and beyond the light tracery of the eiffel tower cover with little speck of people all look upward back along the boulevard on roof on both bank all pari in fact be similarly stare -- le nez en l'air and straight overhead so far up that even the murmur of the motor be unheard no more than a bird indeed against the pale sky mr taube circle indolently about pick he moment plot we death i thought of the shudder of outraged horror that run over antwerp when the first zeppelin come it seem the last unnecessary blow to a heroic people who have already stand so much very different be mr taube 's reception here he might have be a holiday balloon or some particularly fancy piece of firework everywhere people be stare upward look through they closed fist through opera-glass out of the arcade of the hotel de crillon one man in a bath-robe and another in a suit of purple underclothes come run to gaze calmly into the zenith until the von have go as the little speck draw straight overhead these human speck scatter over the place de la concorde suddenly realize that they be in the line of fire and scatter just as people run from a sudden shower this be the most interesting thing -- these helpless little human scramble away like ant or beetle to shelter and that tiny insolent bird sailing slowly far overhead this be a bit of the modern war one read about -- it be a picture from some fanciful story of mr h g well they scatter for the arcade and some quaintly enough run under the tree in the near-by champs-elysées there be a bang at which everybody shout there but it be not a bomb only part of the absurd fusillade that now begin they be firing from the eiffel tower whence they might possibly have hit something and from roof with ordinary gun and revolver which could not possibly have hit anything at all in the gray haze that hang over paris the next morning i wander through empty street and finally with some vague notion of look out up the hill of montmartre all paris lay below mysterious in the mist with that strange poignant beauty of something tremble on the verge one could follow the line of the seine and see the dome of the invalide but nothing beyond i go down a little way from the summit and still on the hill turn into the rue des abbess crowd with vegetable cart and thrifty housewife the gray air be fill with they bargaining with the smell of vegetable and fruit and there in front of two man play violin a girl in black with a white handkerchief loosely knot about she throat be singing of the little alsatian boy shoot by the prussian because he cry vive la france and threaten they with he wooden gun true or not it be one of those thing that get believe verse be write about it and picture make of it all over pari -- presently it would be history and this girl true child of the asphalt be fling it at they hold the heart of these broad-faced mother in the hollow of she hand she would sing one verse pause and sell copy of the song then put a hand to she hoarse throat and sing again the music be not sell with the song and it be rather difficult -- a mournful sort of recitative with sudden shift into march rhythm -- and so the people sing the word over and over with she until they have almost learn the tune you can imagine how a frenchman -- he be a young fellow who live in a rear tenement over on the other side of montmartre -- would write that song the little boy who be go to free he brother back there in alsace when he grow up play soldier -- joyeux il murmurait : je suis petit en somme mais viendra bien le jour ou je serai un homme ardeat vaillantus -- the prussian -- monstre odieux -- smash into the village the cry maman maman -- and after each verse a pause and slowly and lower down with the crowd join in petit -- enfant -lrb- little boy close you big blue eye for the bandit be hideous and cruel and they will kill you if they read you brave thought -rrb- ferme te grand yeux bleus the violin mix with the voice of the market-women cry they artichoke and haricot and above they ring -- ardent vaillant audit might have be the voice of pari itself lie down there in she mist pari of lose alsace and hopeless revanche of ardor and charm crushed once as they might be again as the voice of that pale girl in black with she air of come from light and cigarette smoke and of these simple mother rise above the noise of the street half dirge half battle-cry while out beyond somewhere the little soldier in red breeches be fight and the fate of france hang in the balance that morning chapter iii after the marne at the end of the village the road climb again from the ravine and emerge on open field a wall of timber dark and impenetrable as the wood round a old chateau rise at the farther end of these field -- the road cut through it like a tunnel -- and on the brow of the ravine command the road and the little plain be a line of trench here evidently they have fight we walk on down the road below the northern horizon where they be fight now along the aisne roll the sullen thunder of artillery as it have be roll since daylight and the autumn wind cold with the week of equinoctial rain puff out of thicket and across ravine bring every now and then the horrible odor of death ahead to the right one catch the glint of a french infantry 's red trousers a man be lie there face downward on the field then across the open space appear another -- and another -- they be scatter all over that field bright as the red poppy which be grow in the stubble and as still they be in various position one lay on he back with one knee raise like a man day-dreaming and look up at the sky another be stretch stiff with both hand clinch over he chest one lay in the ditch close beside we he head jam into the muddy bank just as he have dive there in fall another grip a cup in one hand and a spoon in the other as if perhaps he might have try to feed himself in the long hour after the battle roll on and leave they there all these be french but just at the edge of the thick timber be a heap -- one could scarcely say of german so utterly do the gray sodden face and sodden gray uniform merge into anonymity a squad of french soldier appear at a turn in the road two officer ride beside they and they be just move off across the field carry shovel instead of rifle look after they beyond the belt of timber one could see other party like theirs on the distant slope to the left and here and there smoke two more french soldier appear push a wheelbarrow fill with cast-off arm with the boyish good nature which never seem to desert these little man in red and blue they stop and offer we a few clip of german cartridge they be bury they own man they say burn the german the dead have be lie here for nearly a fortnight now while the battle line roll northward clear across france we turn back toward crepy passing again through the shatter village of betz for three day it have be the center of a battle the two force lie outside it and shell each other across the town the main street now full of french soldier be in ruin the church on the edge of the ravine smash and gaping and a few peasant woman stand about arm fold patiently tell each other over and over again what they have see past field where the wheat still wait to be stack and thrash past the carcass of horse sprawl stiff-legged in the ditch or in the stubble we tramp on to crepy-en-valoi the country be empty scour by the flood that have sweep across it roll back again and now be thundering foot by foot farther and farther below the horizon to the north the little hotel across from the railroad station in crepy have keep open through it all it be the typical hotel de la gare of these little old town -- a bar and coffee-room down-stair where the proprietor and he wife and daughter serve they fleeting guest a few chamber up-stair where one sleep between heavy homespun sheet and under a feather bed they be use to change and the mere come of army could not be permit to derange they within a fortnight that little coffee-room of theirs have be crowd with english soldier in retreat then with german -- stern on edge sure of be in paris in a few day then with the same german fall back a trifle dismayed but in good order and then the pursue french and now they be serve the man from the troop-train that keep pour up toward the aisne or those of the wound who could hobble over from the hospital train that as steadily keep pour down sometimes they coin money and again when the locomotive unexpectedly whistle see a roomful of noisy man go gallop away leave a laugh and a few sous behind madame would come in from the kitchen raise she arm and sigh something about close they door but after all they know they should keep right on give as long as they have anything to give one of they daughter a strapping light-hearted colt of a girl tell we some of the thing they have see as she pause in the hall after prepare we room she sister stand beside she and together they declaim in a inimitable sort of recitative how the english soldier have come in all laugh and the young officer so handsome but the german soldier be all like this -- and the young woman give a quick gesture as of one take nose and mouth in she hand and pull it stiffly down a bit the french officer and they man be like father and son but the german have a discipline you would not believe -- she have see one officer strike a man with he whip she say because he be not march fast enough and another when a soldier have come too near have kick he and they all think surely they be go into paris -- two day more they have laugh as they drink down-stair pari and then -- kaput you can imagine that gray horde roll through the street -- narrow cobblestoned street with steep-roofed stone house and queer little court and the air over all of have be live in for generation on generation there be the remnant in crepy of one of the house that use to belong to the duke of valoi and at the end of one wind street you find yourself unexpectedly look through a grilled iron gateway into the order stateliness of a old-time chateau on the outward side the wall of the chateau garden drop a sheer thirty or forty foot to the edge of the ravine what a place to wait for a approach enemy one think walk underneath and the german evidently think so too for from this part of town they carefully keep away they burn one house that of a dressmaker so unfortunate as to live next door to a shop in which arm be sell they pillage the house whose owner have run away and they order the town to pay they one hundred thousand franc but those townspeople who have the fortitude to stay behind be not molest the enemy be even polite one woman tell we -- pas peur say the officer who visit she house take off he hat on the gate of another house be scrawl in german script sick woman -- keep away and as we pass the open window sure enough there be the pale young mother lie prop up in bed just as she have be when the german come on another door we read also in german script good people -- they give everything and on several be order to leave those within alone and there be a curious and touching irony in that phrase : gute leute -- schoenen chalk in stiff script by those now fight for they life to the north of we and likely never to see they fatherland again crepy-en-valois more fortunate than some of the town whose mayor be dismiss for reveal a lamentable absence of sang-froid have a mayor who stick to he post he be there when three-fourth of the village have flee and get up from a sick-bed to receive the german commander he see that the latter 's order be carry out and sign the order for the town 's ransom while he daughter hold smelling-salt under he nose whether the mayor of the old town of senli a few mile west of crepy be in any way tactless be scarcely of importance now in so far as it concern he for he and the other hostage be shoot and however little good it may have do anybody he at least give france he life it be say that he order to the townspeople to turn in they arm be not completely obey it be also say -- and this several people of senli tell we -- that a few senegalese lagging behind as the french left fire on the german as they approach and that it be possible that one or two excited civilian have join in grant that civilian do fire after hostage have be give there remain the question of reprisal it be the german commander 's idea that senli should be teach a lesson and this consist of shoot the mayor and the hostage and sack and burn the main street -- a half mile perhaps -- from end to end the idea be carry out with thoroughness and man run along from house to house feed the flame with petroleum and even burn a handsome new country house which stand apart at one end a nice-looking elderly gentleman whom we meet in front of the ruin hotel du nord say that the german come there and find champagne in the cellar after the maitre d'hotel have tell they there be not any set fire to the hotel and as i recall it shoot he how true such story be i can not say but there be no doubt that senli have be punish at least half of the old city on the bank of the wistful nonette -- it be a much larger place than crepy with a cathedral of some consequence -- be smash as utterly as it might have be by a cyclone or a earthquake the systematic manner in which this be do be suggest by the fact that in the long street run parallel to the one pick for destruction nearly every door still carry its chalk order to schoenen one house spare be that of a town fireman i have get five little child he tell the german soldier they be one two three four five year old and i be expect another and they go on these be common sight and sound of that gracious country north of paris -- desert perhaps demolish village the silent countryside with dead horse bit of broken shell smash bicycle or artillery wagon along the road and the tainted autumn wind along the level french road under they arch of elm or poplar cover cart on tall wheel draw by two big farm horse harness one behind another and load with woman child and household goods be begin to move northward as they have move south three week before train similarly pack be creep up to within ear-shot of the constant cannonading and it be on one of these train that we have come in pari recover now from the dismay of three week before keen french imagination be daily turn the war into term of heroism and sacrifice and military glory even editor and play-writer fight at the front be able to send back impression now and then and these strip by the censorship of name and date become almost as impersonal as page tear from fiction sit comfortably at some cafe table read the papers with morning coffee one see the dawn come up over the oise and aisne hear the french seventy-fives and the heavy german siege-gun resume they roar see again for the hundredth time some hitherto unheard-of little man fling away he life in one brief burst of glory and these thrill repeat over and over again without sight or sound of the concrete fact in that strange still city whose usual life have stop produce at last a curious sense of unreality meaux become as far away as waterloo and one read word that have be speak yesterday exactly as one read that the old guard die but never surrender a man could leave the café de la paix and in two hour be under fire where killing be as matter of fact as drive tack and in between these two zone -- the zone where war be at once a highly organize business and a splendid terrible game and that in which its disjointed horrible surface be be turn into abstraction into idea poetry rhetoric -- be this middle ground through which we be now tramp where one see only its silence and ruin and desolation we return to crepy all that night the train go clank through the station pour more man -- frenchman englishman -- into the sodden trench along the aisne for a week it have rain cold shower follow cold shower in pari shiver concierge close they door in the middle of the day in mournful attempt to keep warm -- autumn 's quick sequel to the almost torrid heat in which the army have fight across this same country a fortnight before it be into trench half fill with water that the new man be go -- frenchman trundle over to the bar in big overcoat with they air of good little boy to go gallop back with a bottle of red wine and a long loaf of bread englishman noisy laugh try to talk french with they finger and want a nip of brandy or hot water for they tea there be highlander among they man with neck like tower and straight flat back and a swing of the shoulder -- like band music go past one watch they stride back to they car with a sort of pang what grotesque irony that man like these who in time when war be man 's normal business might have fight they way through must now with all the diseased and hopeless body encumber the earth be cut off by a mere wad of unthinking lead all that night it rain and through the rain and dark train keep pour on up into the terrible north once i hear cattle low as they car clank past and again in the gloomy clairvoyance of night see the face on the field at betz beat on by the rain that have beat they for day and just before a feeble daylight return again the steady rumble of artillery after noon there be a break in the cloud and we start on foot for villers-cotteret some fifteen kilometre away the hard macadam road be no more than dampen and ambulance and motor-truck go scoot by as on a city street occasionally there be a abandon trench once a broken caisson and the wreck of a aeroplane but the wheat be harvest and stack beyond vaumoise the country grow more hilly and the cave and quarry which the german be make such effective use of along the aisne begin to appear and all this time the cannon be thunder -- so close that it seem each hilltop would bring they into view and as the detonation puff across the landscape one even fancy one could feel the concussion in one 's ear up from a field ahead of we a aeroplane rise and in a wide spiral go climb up the sky now almost clear and presently disappear in the north then after satisfy a sentry that we papers be correct -- such thing could be do in those first day -- we get into villers-cotteret instead of desert house we find that nearly every house be quarter soldier there be infantryman dragoon flyer senegalese algerian in white turban and burnoose on they desert horse and everywhere officer we have stumble into a headquarters with somewhat the sensation of walk a tight rope we seek the mayor to ask for permission to stay in town -- finally to ask for safe-conduct to soisson the charming old gentleman undisturbed by war 's alarm politely make they out presently in a hotel full of officer we come on three civilian calmly eat dinner they have arrive by train although there be no train for civilian they be now dine at a long table set for officer from which we have a moment before be turn away and we be rescue by a mysterious be at the head of the table -- a dark bald bright-eyed smile sanguine gentleman who might have be a impresario or a press agent and continually have the air of say as from time to time he actually say : ssst leave it all to I he be a american he say but speak vernacular french the other two civilian be a london chartered accountant and a canadian volunteer -- a young oxford man -- wait for he regiment across the table a big french dragoon just in from the firing-line he horsetail helmet on the chair beside he be also dine this man be as different from the little infantryman we have so often see as the air of that town be different from desert pari just as he be he might have step -- or ridden rather -- from some cavalry charge by meissonier or détaille a splendid fellow -- head to spur all soldier after week of newspaper rhetoric and windy civilian partisanship it be like water in the desert to listen to he -- straight talk from a professional fighting man modest level-headed and like most fight man as contrast with those who stay at home and write about fight ready to give a brave enemy he due the german retirement be not at all a rout when a army be in flight it leave baggage and equipment behind gun in the mud the german have leave very little they be fall back in good order they soldier be good fighter especially when well lead they might lack the individual initiative of frenchman the nervous energy with which frenchman would keep on fight after mere bone and muscle have have enough but they have plenty of courage they officer -- the dragoon pause yesterday he say they have run into a troop of cavalry the german officer order he man to charge and instead they waver and start to fall back he turn on they schweinhunde he shout after they and fling he horse about charge alone straight at the french lance kill he ask the man at the head of the table the dragoon nod it be a pity jolus garçon he be -- he run a hand round a weather-beaten cheek as if to suggest the other 's well-made face -- monocle in he eye -- and he never let go of it until it fall off -- a lance through he heart as we talk two secret-service-men enter demand we papers examine they and direct we to call at the maine for they next morning at eight o'clock now indeed we be walk a tight rope follow the genius who have get we we supper we emerge into the dark street walk down it a few door enter a courtyard full of cavalry horse where man in spur boot be clank up and down stair he thrust a heavy key into a lock open a door and usher we into a empty and elegantly furnished house here be a sombre dining-room with decanter and glass bedroom with satin down quilt spread over the foot of the bed and adjoining one of they a dressing-room with pomade and perfume and row of boot just as its owner have leave it who he might be why we should be here how we mysterious conductor -- who know no one in villers-cotteret and have but land there himself that night -- have arrange this occupation be beyond find out at the moment with military motor-truck rumble past outside soldier come and go in the court and tramp about in the room overhead -- a extension of the adjoining house -- one scarcely thought of try to find out one merely accept it enchain by that uplifted finger and leave it to I for a time we talk under the dining-room light with door bolt and wooden shutter on street and courtyard close as if we be conspirator in russian melodrama and then we sleep the german be evidently much nearer than pari have suppose and we should not have be greatly surprise to find they in the street next morning it be a algerian horseman however muffle up in he dingy white and look rather chilly who be ride past the window as i first look out we go to the mairie -- not the grandfatherly old mayor this time but a sharp-eyed special commissioner of police after all say he when we have put we case you want to get as near the front as possible true i answer we do well he say with a gesture at once final and wholly french you be already farther than that you be inside the line he cross out the safe-conduct and on the laissez-passer write : good for immediate return to pari and carefully set down the date half a hour later we be well on the road to crepy with the thunder which have draw we hither roll fainter and fainter in the north chapter iv the fall of antwerp the storm which be to burst over antwerp the follow night be gather fast when we arrive on Tuesday morning army motor-truck load with dismantle aeroplane and the less essential impediment scream through the street bind away from not toward the front the queen that afternoon be see in the hotel st antoine receive the good-by of various friend consul suddenly lock they door and flee and the cannon rumble along the eastern horizon as they have rumble nearer and nearer for a fortnight be now beyond the outer line of fort and within striking distance of the town that night a hour or two after midnight in my hotel by the water-front i awake to the steady clatter of hoof on cobblestone and the rumble of wheel i go to the window on the narrow side street black as all street have be in antwerp since the night that the zeppelin throw its first bomb and look out it be a moonlight night clear and cold and there along the quaus st michael at the end of the street be a army in retreat they be belgian batter and wear out with they unbroken week of hopeless fight cavalryman on they tired horse artilleryman head sink on they chest drowse on they lurch caisson the patient little foot-soldier rifle sling across they shoulder scuffle along in they heavy overcoat in the dark shadow of the tall old house a few people come out and stand there watch silently and as one feel in a sort of despair all night long man be march by -- and in london they be still read that it be but a demonstration the german be engage in -- down the quay and across the pontoon bridge -- the only way over the scheldt -- over to the tete-de-flandre and the road to ghent they be string along the street next morning boot mud-covered mud-stained intrenching shovel hang to they belt face unshaven for week just as they have come from the trench yet still patient and cheerful with that unshakable flemish good cheer perhaps after all it be not a retreat they might be swing round to the south and st nichola to attack the german flank but before they have cross another army a civilian army flow down on and over the quay for a week people have be leave antwerp now the general flight begin from village to the east and southeast from the city itself people come pour down in wagon draw by huge belgian draft-horse in cart pull by the captivating belgian work dog pant mightily and digging they paw into the slippery cobble on foot lead little child and carry baby and doll and canary and great bundle of clothes and household thing wrap in sheet they surge toward that one narrow bridge and the crowded ferry-boat i see one old woman gray-haired and tan like a indian squaw with work in the field yet with a fine well-made face push a groan wheelbarrow a strap go from the handle over she shoulder and stop now and then to ask the news she would slip off this harness gossip for a time then push on again that afternoon under my window there be a tall wagon a sort of hay wagon in which there be twenty-two little tow-headed child none more than eight or ten and several almost baby in arm by the side of the wagon a man evidently father of some of they stand butter the end of a huge round loaf of bread and cut off slice after slice which the older child break and distribute to the little one two cow be tie to the back of the wagon and the man 's wife squat there milk they all along the quay and in the street lead into it be people like this -- harmless helpless hard-working people go they know not where the entrance to the bridge be soon choke one go away and return a hour later and find the same people wait almost in the same spot and with that wonderful calm and patience of theirs feed they child or give a little of they precious hay to the horse quietly wait they turn while the cannon which have drive they from they home keep on thunder behind they that afternoon i walk up-town through the shutter silent street -- silent but for that incessant rumble in the southeast and the occasional honking flight of some military automobile -- to two of the hospital in one a british hospital on the boulevard leopold the doctor in charge be absent for the moment and there be no one to answer my offer of occasional help if a outsider could be of use as i sit wait a tall brisk englishwoman in nurse 's uniform come up and ask what i want i tell she oh she say and in she crisp english voice without further ado will you help I with a leg she lead the way into she ward and there we contrived between we to bandage and slip a board and pillow under a fractured thigh between whisper of courage courage to the belgian soldier she say that she be the wife of a british general and have two son in the army and a third -- poor boy she murmur more to he than to I -- on one of the ship in the north sea i arrange to come back next morning to help with the lifting and go on to another hospital in the rue nerviens to find that little english lady who cross with I in the ostend boat in August on the way to she sister 's hospital in antwerp here in the quiet ward she have be work while the german sweep down on pari and be roll back again and while the little nation which she and she sister love so well be be club to its knee louvain liege maline namur -- chapter in all the long pitiless story be lie there in the narrow iron bed there be man with face chew by shrapnel man burn in the explosion of the powder magazine at fort waelhem when the attack on antwerp begin -- drag out from the underground passage in which the garrison have seek momentary refuge and where most of they be kill burn and blacken one strong good-looking young fellow able to eat and live apparently be shoot through the temple and blind in both eye it be the hour for carry those well enough to stand it out into the court and give they they afternoon 's airing and smoke one have lose a arm another a whimsical young belgian have only the stump of a left leg when we start to lift he back into he bed he say he have a better way than that so he put he arm round my neck and show I how to take he by the back and the well leg bon he say and again bon when i let he down and then reach out and pat I on the back bon he smile again that night behind draw curtain which admit no light to the street we dine peacefully and well and except for this unwonted seclusion just outside which be the black street and still the endless procession of cart and wagon and shiver people one might have forget in that cheerfully light room that we be not in time of peace we even loiter over a grate fire before go to bed and talk in drowsy and almost indifferent fashion of whether it be absolutely sure that the german be try to take the town it be almost exactly midnight that i find myself listen half awake to the familiar sound of distant cannon one have come to think of it almost as nothing but a sound and to listen with a detach and not unpleasant interest as a man tuck comfortably in bed follow a roll of thunder to its end or listen to the fall of rain it strike I suddenly that there be something new about this sound i sit up in bed to listen and at that instant a far-off sullen boom be follow by a crash as if lightning have strike a house a little way down the street as i hurry to the window there come another far-off detonation a curious wail whistle sweep across the sky and over behind the roof to the leave there be another crash one after another they come at interval of half a minute or scream on each other 's heel as if race to they goal and then the crash or if farther away muffle explosion as another roof topple in or cornice drop off as a house make of canvas drop to piece in a play the effect of those unearthly wail suddenly singing in across country in the dead of night from six -- eight -- ten mile away -- heaven know where -- be as the german intend it to be tremendous it be not easy to describe nor to be imagine by those who have not live in that threaten city -- the last belgian stronghold -- and feel that vast unseen power roll nearer and nearer and now all at once it be here materialize demoniacal a fly death swoop across the dark into you very room it be like one of those dream in which you can not stir from you track and meanwhile boom tzee-ee-ee-ee -- be this one mean for you already there be a patter of foot in the dark and people with white bundle on they back go stumble by toward the river and the bridge motor come honk down from the inner street and the quay which have begin to clear by this time be again jam i throw on some clothes hurry to the street a rank smell of kerosene hang in the air presently a petrol shell burst to the southward lighting up the sky for a instant like the flare from a blast-furnace and a few moment later there show over the roof the flame of the first fire although we could hear the wail of shell fly across they wide parabola both into the town and out from the first ring of fort few burst in we part of the city that night and we walk up as far as the cathedral without see anything but black and silent street every one in the hotel be up and dress by this time some be for leave at once one family pilot by the comfortable belgian servant -- far cooler than any one else -- go to the cellar some gather about the grate in the writing-room to watch the night out the rest of we go back to bed there be not much sleep for any one that night the bombardment keep on until morning lull slightly as if the enemy might be take breakfast then it continue into the next day and now the city -- a busy city of nearly four hundred thousand people -- empty itself in earnest citizen and soldier field-guns motor-truck wheelbarrow dog-carts hay-rick baby-carriage drove of people on foot all flow down to the scheldt the ferry and the bridge they pour into coal barge fill the yawning black hole as african use to fill slave-ship into launch and tug and along the road lead down the river and southwestward toward ostend one thought with a shudder of what would happen if the german drop a few of they shell into that helpless mob and it be only fair to remember that they do not although retreat belgian soldier be a part of it and one of the german aeroplane a mere speck against the blue be look calmly down overhead nor do they touch the cathedral and they agreement not to shell any of the building previously point out on a map deliver to they through the american legation seem to be observe down through that mass of fugitive push a london motor-bus ambulance with several wounded british soldier one of they sit upright support with he right hand a left arm the biceps bind in a blood-soaked tourniquet half tear away they have come in from the trench where they comrade be now wait with they helpless little rifle for a enemy mile away who lay back at he ease and pound they with he big gun i ask they how thing be go and they say not very well they could only wait until the german aeroplane have give the range and the trench become too hot then fall back dig themselves in and play the same game over again follow they be a hospital-service motor-car drive by a belgian soldier and in charge of a young british officer it be he present duty to motor from trench to trench across the zone of fire with the london bus trail behind and pick up wound it be not a particularly pleasant job he say jerk he head toward the distant firing and frankly he be not keen about it we talk for some time every one talk to every one else in antwerp that morning and when he start out again i ask he to give I a lift to the edge of town quickly we race through the place de meir and the desert street of the politer part of antwerp where the night before most of the shell have fall we go crackle over broken glass past gaping cornice and hole in the pavement five foot across and three foot deep and once pass a house quietly burn away with none to so much as watch the fire the city wall along which be the first line of fort draw near then the tunnel pass under it and we go through without pause and on down the road to maline we be beyond the town now bowl rapidly out into the flat belgian country and cling there to the running-board with the October wind blow quite through a thin flannel suit it suddenly come over I that thing have move very fast in the last five minute and that all at once in some unexpected fashion all that elaborate barrier of laissez-passers sauf-conduit and so on have be sweep aside and quite as if it be the most ordinary thing in the world i be spin out to that almost mythical front front indeed it be two front there be a explosion just behind we a hideous noise overhead as if the whole zenith have somehow be rip across like a tightly stretch piece of silk and a shell from the belgian fort under which we have just pass go hurtle down long aisle of air -- farther -- farther -- to end in a faint detonation mile away out of sight in front of we there be a answering thud and -- tzee-ee-ee-er-r-r-ong -- a german shell have go over we and burst behind the belgian fort under this gigantic antiphony the motor-car race along curiously small and irrelevant on that empty country road we pass great hole freshly make neatly blow out of the macadam then a dead horse there be plenty of dead horse along the road in france but they have be so for day this one 's blood be not yet dry and the shell that have tear the great rip in its chest must have strike here this morning we turn into the avenue of tree lead up to a empty chateau a field-hospital until a few hour before mattress and bandage litter the desert room and a electric chandelier be still burn the young officer point to some trench in the garden i have those dig to put the wound in in case we have to hold the place he say it be get pretty hot there be nothing here now however and follow by the london bus with its obedient enlist man do duty as ambulance orderly we motor a mile or so farther on to the nearest trench it be in a orchard beside a brick farmhouse with a vista in front of barbed-wire entanglement and a carefully clean firing field stretch out to a village and tree about half a mile away they have look very interesting and difficult those barbed-wire maze and suburb ruthlessly sweep of tree and house when i have see the belgian prepare for the siege six week before and they be to be of about as much practical use now as picture on a wall there be it will be recall three line of fort about antwerp -- the inner one correspond to the city 's wall a middle one a few mile farther out where the british now be and the outer line which the enemy have already pass they artillery be hide far over behind the horizon tree and the british marine and naval-reserve man who man these trench could only wait there rifle in hand for a enemy that would not come while a captive balloon a mile or two away to the eastward and a aeroplane sailing far overhead give the range and they wait for the shrapnel to burst the trench be hasty affair narrow and shoulder-deep very like trench for gas or water pipe and reasonably safe except when a shell burst directly overhead one have strike that morning just on the inner rim of the trench blow out one of those crater-like hole and discharge all its shrapnel backward across the trench and into one of the heavy timber support a bombproof roof a raincoat hang to a nail in this timber be literally shoot to shred that be where i be stand say the young lieutenant in command point with a dry smile to a spot not more than a yard from where the shell have burst half a dozen young fellow crouch there in the bomb-proof look out at we and grin they be brand-new soldier some of they boy from the london street who have answer the thrilling poster and sign you king and country need you and be send on this ill-fated expedition for they first sight of war the london papers be talk about it as i be write this -- how this handful of nine thousand man part of they recruit who scarcely know one end of a rifle from another be fling across the channel on Sunday night and rush up to the front to be shoot at and rush back again i do not know this then but wonder if this be what they have dream of -- squat helplessly in a ditch until another order come to retire -- when they swing through the london street sing it be a long long way to tipperary two month before yet not one of the youngest and the greenest show the least nervousness as they wait there in that melancholy little orchard under the incessant scream of shell that unshakable british coolness part sheer pluck part a sort of lack of imagination perhaps or at least of nerve leave they as calm and casual as if they be but drill on the turf of hyde park and with it persist that almost equally unshakable sense of class that touch confidence in one 's superior -- the young clerk 's or mechanic 's inborn conviction that whatever that smart clean-cut imperturbable young officer do and say must inevitably be right -- at least that if he be cool and serene you must if the sky fall be cool and serene too we meet one young fellow as we walk through a empty lateral lead to a bomb-proof prepared for wound and the ambulance officer ask he sharply how thing have be go that morning oh very well sir he say with the most respectful good humor though a shell burst just then a stone 's throw beyond the orchard make both of we duck we head a bit hot sir about nine o'clock but only one man hurt they do seem to know just where we be sir but wait till they infantry come up -- we 'll clean they out right enough sir and if he have be order to stay there and hold the trench alone one could imagine he say in that same tone of deference and chipper good humor yes sir thank you sir and stay too till the cow come home we motor down the line to another trench -- this one along a road with field in front and about a couple of hundred yard behind a clump of tree which mask a belgian battery the officer here a tall upstand gravely handsome young man with a deep strong slightly humorous voice and the air of one both bear to and use to command -- the best type of navy man -- come over to meet we rather glad it seem to see some one the ambulance officer have just start to speak when there be a roar from the clump of tree at the same instant a explosion directly overhead and a ugly chunk of iron -- a bit of broken case from a shrapnel shell -- plunge at we very foot the shell have be wrongly time and explode prematurely i say the lieutenant call out to a belgian officer standing not far away can not you telephone over to you people to stop that that be the third time we have be nearly hit by they shrapnel this morning after all -- he turn to we with the air of apologize somewhat for he display of irritation -- it be quite annoying enough here without that you know it be indeed annoying -- very the trench be not under fire in the sense that the enemy be make a persistent effort to clear they out but they be in the zone of fire they range be know and there be no tell when that distant boom thud across the field whether that particular shell might be intend for they or for somebody 's house in town we could see in the distance they captive balloon and there be a couple of scout the officer say in a tower in the village not much more than half a mile away he point to the spot across the barb wire we have be try to get they for the last half-hour we leave they engage in this interesting distraction the little rifle-snap in all that mighty thunder seem only to accent the loneliness and helplessness of they position and spin on down the transverse road toward another trench the progress of the motor seem slow and disappointing not that the spot a quarter of a mile off be at all less likely to be hit yet one feel conscious of a grow desire to be somewhere else and though i take off my hat to keep it from blow off i find that every time a shell go over i promptly put it on again indicate one suspect a decline in what the military expert call morale as we bowl down the road toward a group of brick house on the leave a shell pass not more than fifty yard in front of we and through the side of one of these house as easily as a circus rider pop through a tissue-paper hoop almost at the same instant another explode -- where i have not the least idea except that the dust from it hit we in the face the motor roll smoothly along meanwhile and the belgian soldier drive it stare as imperturbably ahead of he as if he be back at antwerp on the seat of he taxicab you get use to shell in time it seem and decide that you either be or be not go to be hit dismiss responsibility and leave it all to fate i must admit that in my brief experience i be not able to arrive at this restful state we reach at last the city gate through which we have leave antwerp and the motor come to a stop just at the inner edge of the passage under the fort and i say good-by to the young englishman ere he start back for the trench again well he call after I as i start across the open space between the gate and the house a stone 's throw away you have have a experience anyway i be just about to answer that undoubtedly i have when -- tzee-ee-ee-er-r -- a shell just clear the rampart over we head and disappear in the side of a house directly in front of we with a roar and a geyser of dust neither the motor nor a guest 's duty now detain I and wave he good-by i turn at right angle and make with true civilian speed for the shelter of a side street the shell all appear to be come from a southeast direction and in the lee of house on the south side of the street one be reasonably protect keep close to the house-front and dodge -- rather absurdly no doubt -- into doorway when that wail whistle come up from behind i go zigzag through the desert city toward the hotel on the other side of town it be such a progress as one might make in some fantastic nightmare -- as the hero of some eerie piece of fiction about the last man in the world street after street with door lock shutter close sandbag mattress or little heap of earth pile over cellar window street in which the only sound be that of one 's own foot where the loneliness be make more lonely by some forget dog cringe against the closed door and bark nervously as one hurry past here where most of the shell have fall the precede night nearly all the house be empty yet occasionally one catch sight of face peer up from basement window or of some stubborn householder standing in he southern doorway stare into space once i pass a woman bind away from instead of toward the river with she big bundle and once a open carriage with a family in it drive with peculiarly flemish composure toward the quay and as i hurry past the park along the avenue van dyck -- where fresh crater make by explode shell have be dig in the turf -- the swan still float on the little lake placidly dip they white neck under water as if it be a quiet morning in may now and then as the shell 's wail swing over its long parabola there come with the detonation across the roof the rumble of fall masonry once i pass a house quietly burn and on the pavement be lopped-off tree the impartiality with which those far-off gunner distribute they attention be disconcerting peer down one of the up-and-down street before cross it as if a shell be a automobile which you might see and dodge you would shoot across and turn into a cosey little side street think to yourself that here at least they have not come and then promptly see squarely in front another of those crater blow down through the belgian block presently i find myself under the tree of the boulevard leopold not far from the british hospital and recall that it be about time that promise be make good it be time indeed and help with lift they need very literally the order have just come to leave the building bring the wound and such equipment as they could pack into half a dozen motor-bus and retire -- just where i do not hear -- in the direction of ghent as i enter the porte-cochere two poor wreck of war be be lead out by they nurse -- more man burn in the powder explosion at waelhem they seared face and hand cover with oil and cotton just as they have be lift from bed the phrase whistle of shell have take on a new reality since midnight now one be to learn something of the meaning of those equally familiar word they succeed in save they wound although under heavy fire none of the wound could walk none dress himself most of they in ordinary time would have lie where they be for week there be fracture leg not yet set man with face half shoot away man half out of they head and all these have to be dress somehow cover up crowd into or on top of the bus and start off through a city under bombardment toward open country which might already be occupy by the enemy bundle of uniform mud-stained blood-stained just as they have come from the trench be dump out of the storeroom and distribute hit or miss british tommy go out as belgian belgian in british khaki the man whose broken leg i have lift the day before we simply bundle in he bed blanket and set up in the corner of a bus one healthy-looking belgian boy on whom i be try to pull a pair of british trousers seem to have nothing at all the matter with he until it presently appear that he be speechless and paralyzed in both leave arm and leave leg and while we be work a english soldier shoot through the jaw and throat sit on the edge of he bed shake with a hideous rattle cough the hospital be in a handsome stone building in ordinary time a club perhaps or a school a wide stone stairway lead up the center and above it be a glass skylight this central well would have be a charming place for a shell to drop into and one do drop not more than fifty foot or so away in or close to the rear court a few yard down the avenue another shell hit a cornice and send a ton or so of masonry crash down on the sidewalk under condition like these the nurse keep run up and down that staircase during the endless hour or two in which the wound be be dress and carry on stretcher to the street they stand by the bus make they man comfortable and when the first bus be fill they sit in the open street on top of they patiently wait as calm and smile as circus queen on they gilt chariot the behavior of the man in the trench be cool enough but they at least be fight man and but take the chance of war these be civilian volunteer they have not even trench to shelter they and it take a rather unforeseen and difficult sort of courage to leave that fairly safe masonry building and sit smile and helpful on top of a motor-bus during a wait of half a hour or so any second of which might be one 's last there be a american nurse there a tall radiant girl whom they call and rightly morning glory who have be introduce to I the day before because we both belong to that curious foreign race of american what she name be i have not the least idea and if we be to meet to-morrow doubtless we should have to be carefully present over again but i remember call out to she good-by american girl as we pass in the hall during the last minute or two and she say good-by and suddenly reach out and put she hand on my shoulder and add good luck or god bless you or something like that and these seem at the moment quite the usual thing to do and say the doctor in charge and the general 's wife apologize for run away as they call it and the last i saw of the latter be as she wave back to I from the top of a bus with just that look of concern over the desperate ride they be begin which a slightly preoccupy hostess cast over a dinner-table about which be seat a number of oddly assorted guest the strange procession get away safely at last and safely too so i be tell later across the river but where they finally spend the night i never hear i hurry down the street and into the rue nerviens it must have be about four o'clock by that time the bright October morning have change to a chill and dismal afternoon and up the western sky in the direction of the river a vast curtain of greasy black smoke be roll the petrol-tank along the scheldt have be set afire it look at the moment as if the whole city might be go but there be no time then to think of possibility and i slip down the lee side of the street to the door with the red cross flag the front of the hospital be shut tight it take several pull at the bell to bring any one and inside i find a belgian family who have leave they own house for the thicker ceiling of the hospital and the nun back in the ward with they nervous man they servant have leave that morning the three or four sister in charge have have to do all the cooking and housework as well as look after they patient and now they be keep calm and smile to subdue as best they could the fear of the belgian wound who be ready to jump out of bed whatever they condition rather than fall into the hand of the enemy each have no doubt that if he be not murder outright he would be take to germany and force to fight in the east against the russian several who know very well what be go on outside have be find by the nurse that morning out of bed and all ready to take to the street lest they should hear that they comrade in the boulevard leopold have be move the lay sister -- the english lady -- and i withdraw to the operating-room close the door and in that curious retreat talk over the situation no order have come to leave in fact they have be tell to stay they do have a man now in the shape of the belgian gentleman and from the same source a able-bodied servant but how long these would stay where food be to be find in that desolate city when the bombardment would cease and what the german would do with they -- well it be not a pleasant situation for a handful of woman but it be not of themselves she be think but of they wound and of belgium and of what both have suffer already and of what might yet be in store it be of that this frail little sister talk that hopeless afternoon while the smoke in the west spread farther up the sky and she would now and then pause in the middle of a syllable while a shell sing overhead then take it up again meanwhile the light be go and before it become quite dark and my hotel desert perhaps as the rest of antwerp it seem best to be get across town i could not believe that the german could treat such a place and people with anything but consideration and tell the little nurse so she come to the edge of the glass-covered court laughingly say i have best run across it and wonder where we who have meet twice now under such curious circumstance would meet again then she turn back to the ward -- to wait with that roomful of more or less panicky man for the tramp of german soldier and the knock on the door which mean that they be prisoner hurry across town i pass not far from the hotel st antoine a blaze four-story build the cathedral be not touch and indeed in spite of the noise and terror the material damage be comparatively slight soldier be clear the quay and set a guard directly in front of we hotel -- one of the few place in antwerp that night where one could get so much as a crust of bread -- and behind draw curtain we make what cheer we could there be two american photographer and a correspondent who have spend the night before in the cellar of a house the upper story of which have be wreck by a shell a british intelligence officer with the most bewildering way of hop back and forth between a brown civilian suit and a spick-and-span new uniform and several belgian family hope to get a boat down-stream in the morning we sit round the great fire in the hall above which the architect building for happier time have have the bad grace to place a skylight and discuss the time and means of get away the intelligence officer not wish to be make a prisoner be for get a boat of some sort at the first crack of dawn and the photographer who have have the roof blow off over they head heartily agree with he i do not like to leave without at least a glimpse of those spiked helmet nor to desert my friend in the rue nerviens and yet there be the likelihood if one remain of be maroon indefinitely in the midst of the conquer army meanwhile the flight of shell continue a dozen or more fire could be see from the upper window of the hotel and billow of red flame from the burning petrol-tank roll up the southern sky it have be what might be call a rather full day and the wail of approach projectile begin to get on one 's nerve one start at the slamming of a door take every dull thump for a distant explosion and when we finally turn in i carry the mattress from my room which face the south over to the other side of the building and lay it on the floor beside another man 's bed before a shell could reach I it would have to traverse at least three partition and possibly he as well after midnight the bombardment quiet but shell continue to visit we from time to time all night all night the belgian be retreat across the pontoon bridge and once -- it must have be about two or three o'clock -- i hear a sound which mean that all be over it be the crisp tramp -- different from the belgian shuffle -- of british soldier and up from the street come a english voice best foot forward boy and a little farther on : look alive man they have just pick up we range i go to the window and watch they tramp by -- the same man we have see that morning the petrol fire be still flame across the south a steamer of some sort be burn at she wharf beside the bridge -- napoleon 's veteran retreat from moscow could scarcely have leave behind a more complete picture of war than do those young recruit morning come drag up out of that dreadful night smoky damp and chill it be almost a london fog that lay over the abandon town i have just pack up and be walk through one of the upper hall when there be a crash that shake the whole building the sound of fall glass and out in the river a geyser of water shoot up timber and board fly from the bridge and there be dozen of smaller splash as if from a shower of shot i think that the hotel be hit at last and that the german have let civilian escape over the bridge be turn everything loose determine to make a end of the business it be as a matter of fact the belgian blow up the bridge to cover they retreat in any case it seem useless to stay longer and within a hour on a tug jam with the last refugee we be start down-stream behind we up the river a vast curtain of lead-colored smoke from the petrol-tank have climb up the sky and spread out mushroomwise as smoke and ash sometimes spread out from a volcano this smoke merge with the fog and the smoke from the antwerp fire seem to cover the whole sky and under that sullen mantle the dark flame of the petrol still glow to the right as we look back be the blaze skeleton of the ship and on the left antwerp itself the rich old beautiful comfortable city all but hide and now and then send forth the boom of a explode shell like a groan a large empty german steamer the gneisenau maroon here since the war come swing slowly out into the river push by two or three nervous little tug -- to be sink there apparently in midstream from the pontoon bridge which stubbornly refuse to yield come explosion after explosion and up and down the river fire spring up and there be other explosion as the crushed belgian in a sort of rage of devastation become they own destroyer by follow the adventure of one individual i have endeavor to suggest what the bombardment of a modern city be like -- what you might expect if a invade army come to-morrow to new york or chicago or san francisco i have only coast along the edge of belgium 's tragedy and the rest of the story of which we be a part for the next two day -- the flight of those hundred of thousand of homeless people -- be something that can scarcely be tell -- you must follow it out in imagination into its countless uproot disorganized life you must imagine old people struggle along over mile and mile of country road young girl under burden a man might not care to bear tramp until they have to carry they shoe in they hand and go barefoot to rest they unaccustomed foot you must imagine the pathetic effort of hundred of people to keep clean by wash in wayside stream or ditch imagine baby go without milk because there be no milk to be have family shiver in damp hedgerow or against haystack where darkness overtake they and you must imagine this not on one road but on every road for mile after mile over a whole countryside what be to become of these people when they little supply of food be exhaust where could they go even if back to they home it would be but to lift they hat to they conqueror never know but that the next week or month would sweep the tide of war back over they again never in modern time not in we generation at least have europe see anything like that flight -- nothing so strange so overwhelming so pitiful and when i say pitiful you must not think of hysterical woman desperate trample man tear and scream in all those mile one see neither complain nor protestation -- at time one might almost have think it some vast eccentric picnic no it be they orderliness they thrift and kindness they unmistakable usefulness which make the waste and irony of it all so colossal and hideous each family have its big round loaf of bread and its pile of hay for the horse the bag of pear and potato the child have they little doll and you would see some tired mother with she big bundle under one arm and some fluffy little puppy in the other you could not associate they with forty-centimetre shell or burn church and library or anything but quiet home and peaceable helpful life you could not be sweep along by that endless stream of exile and retain at the end of the day any particular enthusiasm for the red glory of war and when we cross the dutch border that afternoon and come on a village street full of belgian soldier cut off and force to cross the line to be intern here presumably until the war be over one could not mourn very deeply they lose chance of martial glory as they unsling they rifle and turn they over to the good-natured dutch guard they have hold back that avalanche long enough these belgian and one feel as one would to see lost child get home again or some one drag from under the wheel chapter v pari again -- and bordeaux : journal of a flight from a london fog these note begin in a london fog and end in the south of france i have hope on reach calai to work in toward the fight along the yser but find it impossible decide to turn about and travel away from the front instead of toward it -- down to see bordeaux while it be still the temporary capital and to see what life might be like in the french provincial town in war time it be not so the young woman at the hotel desk in london say what you would call a fog because she could still see the porter at the street-door -- yet day after day the same rain smoky mist and unbroken gloom one breakfast and tramp the street by lamplight as if there be no such thing as sun -- recall vaguely a world in which it use to be -- wood with the leaf turn new york on a bright autumn morning enchant tropical dawn through this viscous envelope -- a sort of fungus throw off by it -- newspaper keep appear -- slaughter

row on the river -- fade into this nightmare of hate and smoky lamplight the psychology be very simple but too much it seem for censor and even editor and unfortunately at a time like this not the light-hearted sportsmanlike fight man at the front nor sober people leave behind in home but newspaper be likely to be a outsider 's most constant companion a sort of spiritual asphyxiation overtake one at last in which the mere stony briticism of the london hotel seem to have a part if you awake again into that taste of soft-coal smoke go down to another of those staggering lamp-lit breakfast but why stagger can you not take coffee and roll in london as well as in some paris café it would seem so yet it can not be do the mere sight and sound -- or lack of sound -- of that warm softly

of smoke from some patrolling destroyer or battleship and all along this cliff walk belgian -- stroll with they child sit on the bench look out to sea just beyond that hazy white wall to the east -- the cliff of france -- the fight for calai be be fight -- they can almost hear the cannon in the stillness as they drift by you catch bit of they talk : it be two o'clock in the morning when we leave antwerp and imagine -- it be not three metre from we doorstep that the shell burst we walk forty kilometre that night and in the morning ------- on the balcony of some one 's summer-house now turn

garden other take the sunshine some with they wheel-chairs push through the shrubbery close to the high iron fence to be pet by nurse-maid and child as if they be animal in a sort of zoo the belgian stroll by on the cliff walk smile at this quaint picture for sun and space and quiet seem to have wipe out they terror -- that pass through be as far away as that now hide in the east be it merely quiet and sun perhaps it be the look of a nice little people who know that now they have a history refugee to be sure yet one can fancy they look back some day from they tight little village canal and beet-field on afternoon like this as on the day of they great adventure -- when they could sit in the sun above the sea at folkestone and look across the channel to the haze under which they son and husband and brother and king be fight for the last corner of they country calai Saturday belgian officer park of belgian military automobile up-country a little way the german go down in ten of

in antwerp as they and they wound roll away in london bus from the hospital in the boulevard leopold this morning stroll round the town i run into a couple of english correspondent there be yet several hour before they need address themselves to the arduous task of describe fight they have not see and they talk with a good humor one sometimes miss in they correspondence of german collectivism and similar thing one have spend a good deal of time in germany they be the only people who have solve the problem of industrial city without slum -- you must say that for they of course in those model town of theirs you have get to brush you tooth at six minute past eight and sleep on you left side if the police say so -- they be astonishing people for do what they be tell one day in

light-hearted would be as different as corneille and shakespeare as dickens and duma -- and in the same way a englishman have be tell I in a london club a few night before of the extraordinary detachment of tommy atkin take almost any of those little french soldier -- they have get a pretty good idea what the war be about -- at any rate they have get a sentiment about it perfectly clear and conscious and they 'll go to they death shout for la patrie now tommy atkin be not the least like that he do not fight -- and you know how he do fight -- for patriotism or glory at least not in the same conscious way he would fight just as well against another of he own regiment -- if you know what i mean he be just -- well look at the soldier ' letter the german be sentimental -- they be all martyr the frenchman be all hero but tommy atkin -- well he be just play football the idea this englishman be try to express be put in another way by a british sailor at the time of the sinking of the

wet nose of the german submarine come up for a look round and then out of that hideous welter the voice of a sailor the unalterable briton in the face of all this modern science and sea magic grab a anchor or whatever it be he see first and bellow : smash the blighter 's head there be phrase like these which could only have be say by the people who say they they be like window suddenly open down

comme c'est drole la nature Sunday it be dusk when we reach boulogne last night -- frosty dusk with the distant moan of a fog-horn and under the mist hilly street busy with soldier and bright with light it make one think of a college town at home on the eve of the great game so keen and happy seem all these fit young man -- officer swing by with they walking-stick soldier spin yarn in smoky cafe -- for the great game of war the hotel be full of wounded or officer -- to boulogne come the steady procession of british transport -- but a amiable porter lead I to a little side street and a

take in the sunshine of some tropical port and with its cheerful hot stove the place combine the air of a french cafe with the cosiness of a english inn very comfortable indeed i lean over one of the table that run along the wall while two british soldier alongside gossip and sip they beer and run over the column of la boulonnaise here too war seem a jolly man 's game and i come to military court

michel to five year in prison and a fine of five hundred franc falk to twenty year at force labor and these few word of newspaper type which nobody else seem to be notice somehow -- as if one have stub one 's toe -- disturb the picture they do not fit in with the rakish gray motor-car label australium i see after dinner nor the young infantryman i run across on a street corner who have be in the fighting ever since mon and be but down for a rest before jump in again nor the busy street and buzz cafe but across they for some reason all evening one could not help see henriede falk twenty-seven year old of landenheissen start down toward paris last August singing deutschland uber alle and wonder what he might be think about the great game of war fifteen year from now while i be take coffee this morning my mariner-host walk up and down the cafe deliver himself on the subject of mine in the north sea the german begin it now the english must take it up but as for he speak as one who have follow the sea it be poor business why could not people knock each other out in a stand-up fight like man in a ring instead of strew the open road with explosive walk about town after breakfast i run into a young man whom i have last see in a white linen uniform wait patiently on the orderly ' bench of the american ambulance at neuilly the ambulance be as hard to get into as a exclusive club for the wood be full these day of volunteer who lead rather decorative life in time of peace have be shake awake by the war into help out overtax embassy make bed in hospital do whatever come along with a childlike delight in the novelty of work this young man wear a red cross button now and pause long enough to impart the follow -- characteristic of the thing we non-combatant hear daily and which authentic or not help to make life interesting : 1 a english general just down from the front have tell he that four thousand soldier have be send out as a burial party after the fight along the yser and have bury by actual count thirty-nine thousand german 2 in a temporary hospital near the front some fifty german and indian wound be put in the same ward in the night the indian get up and cut the german ' throat i climb up through narrow cobblestoned street to the higher part of the town it be pleasant up here in the frosty morning -- old house archway and court and the bell toll people to church up the long hill as i go down come three hearse in black and silver after the french fashion with driver in black coat and black-and-silver cocked hat people stop as they pass a woman cross herself man take off they hat -- farther up the hill a french sentry suddenly straighten and present arm the three casket be drape in flag -- not the tricolor but the union jack no mourner follow they and as the ancient vehicle climb over the brow of the hill the people keep look feeling perhaps that something be lack wonder who the stranger might be who have give they life to france Monday paris again -- a gray pari with bare tree-trunks dead leaf on the sidewalk and in the air the chill of approach winter across the gray distance one fancy now and then to have see the first stray flake of snow and in some old street between tall gray house lean backward sidewise each after its fashion -- as some girl pale with shawl wrap about she shoulder hurry past with a quick upcasting of dark eye one think of mimi and the third act of la boheme old sentiment old song and verse return in this strange gray stillness -- that spirit so gracious delicate penetrate and personal which have draw so many through the year become more moving and real there be more animation in the street now : shop be open cab toot down the avenue de l'opera the greater part of the night but most of the house-front be still shutter and still tourist pleasure-seeker and the banality they bring be go -- every thought and energy be with the man fight on that long line across the north it be a pari of the french -- of a france unite as never before perhaps purify by fire ardent resolute defend she life and she precious inheritance the temporary capital Tuesday a journalist actually protest in print against the big loaf of coarse bread long as half a stick of cord-wood and almost as hard -- remember the almost carnivorous joy with which a frenchman devour bread -- to which the military government at the beginning of the war condemn paris the explanation be that roll and fancy bread take too much time and there be not enough baker leave to do the work -- and inspector see that the law be obey whether amiable baker think they have time or not and people want light bread curly roll pain de fantaisie all very well for general gallienus say the journalist he like hard bread but why must several million people go on crack they tooth because of that idiosyncrasy the government be obdurate if fancy bread be make only the big baker would have time to make it little one would be without client and that this highly centralized paternal government can not allow hard bread it be then for another while at least -- c'est la guerre Thursday we have a dining-car on we bordeaux express to-day the first since war be declare to-morrow night sleeping-car go back again -- more significant than one might think who have not see the france of a few month ago when everything be turn over to the army and people sit up all night in day coach to cover the usual three hour from dieppe to pari down through the heart of france -- tour poitier angouleme -- past trim little french river narrow wind still and deep with row of poplar close to the water 's edge and still a certain air of coquetry in spite of bare branch and fall leaf -- past brown field across which team of oxen one sedate old farm horse in the lead be draw the furrow for next spring 's wheat it be the old man who be plough -- except for those in uniform there be scarce a young man in sight and everywhere soldier -- wounded one bind for southern france reserve not yet send up vine begin to appear low brown line across stony field then just after dark across the garonne and into bordeaux where the civil government obligingly flee when the enemy be roll down on pari in the first week of September bordeaux Monday bordeaux be a day 's railroad ride from paris -- twelve hour away from the german cannon which even now be only fifty mile north of the boulevard twelve hour nearer spain and africa and you feel both these thing all about you be the wine country -- the name of town and village round about read like a wine-card -- and as you be lunch in some little side-street restaurant a table be move away a trap-door open and monsieur the proprietor look on while the big cask of claret be roll in from the street and lower to the cellar and the old cask haul up again you be close to the wine country and close to the sea -- to oyster and crab and ship -- and to the hot sun and more exuberant spirit of the midi the pretty black-eyed bordelaise -- there be pretty girl in bordeaux -- often seem closer to madrid than to pari even the bordelai accent have a touch of the mediterranean and the crisp word of pari be break up and even a extra vowel add now and then until they ripple like spanish or italian pe-tite-a ma - dame-a rattle some little newsboy ingratiate himself with a indifferent lady of uncertain age and the porter will bring you boot in no time-in une-a pe-tite-a mi-nute-a the war be in everybody 's mind of course -- no one in france think of anything else -- but there be none of that silence and tenseness that emotional tremor one feel in paris the german will never come here one feel no matter what happen and as you read the communiqués in la petite gironde and la liberté du sud-ouest the war seem farther away i feel pretty sure than it do in front of the newspaper bill-board in new york in fact one of the first and abide impression of bordeaux be that it be a great place for thing to eat -- oyster from marenne lobster and langouste pear big as cantaloupe pomegranate mushroom -- the little one and the big cepe of bordeaux -- yellow date just up from tunis the fruiterer ' shop not only make you hungry but into some of they you may enter and find a quiet little room up-stair where the proprietor and he wife and daughter in the genial french fashion will serve you with a cosey little dinner with wine for three franc in front of the family grate fire and the privilege of order up anything you want from the shop-window below there be attractive little chocolate and pastry shop and cheerful semi-pension restaurant where whole family include in these day minor politician with axis to grind and occasional young woman from the boulevard all dine together in a warm bustle of talk smoke the gurgle of claret and tear off chunk of hard french bread while madame the proprietress a handsome dark-eyed rather spanish-looking bordelaise sail round subdue the impatient smile at those who wish to be smile at and order she faithful waiter about like a drill-sergeant and then there be the chapon fin when you speak to some elderly gentleman with fastidious gastronomical taste and a acquaintance with southern france of you intention of go to bordeaux he murmur reminiscently : ah yes there be a restaurant there he mean the chapon fin it be famous in '70 when the government come here before and to-day when the young king of spain motor over from biarritz he dine there come down on the train i read in the revue des deux mondes the recollection of a gentleman who be here in ' 70 - '71 and be here again now he be incline to be sarcastic about the present chapon fin in he day one have good food and do not pay exorbitantly now one need a quasi-official introduction to penetrate and the stylish servant guard the door like impassable dragon ask with a discreet air if monsieur have take care to warn the management of he intention of take lunch we penetrate without apparent difficulty -- possibly owe to the exalted position of the two amiable young attach who entertain I -- and the food be very good there be diplomat of all sort to be see a meridional head waiter and a interesting restaurant cat one end of the room be a artificial grotto and into and out of the canvas rock this enormous cat keep creep thrust he round face and blaze eye out of unexpected hole in the manner of the true carnivora as if he have be train by the management as a entertainer the head waiter would have lure a anchorite into temporary abandon toward the end of the evening we discuss the probable character of a certain dessert suggest some doubt of take it you might as well have doubt he honor mai monsieur he wave he arm c'est delicieux c'est merveilleux c'est quelque choose -- slowly with thumb and first finger press together -- de r-r-raf-fi-we it be to this genial provincial city that the president and he minister have come they distribute themselves about town in various public and private building the senate choose one theater for its future meeting-place and the chamber of deputy another and from these place sometimes the most incongruous -- one hear for instance of m delcasse maintain he dignity in a bedroom now use as the office for the minister of foreign affair -- the red tape be unwound which eventually send the life-blood of the remotest province flow up to its appoint place at the front there must be plenty of real work for a army like that of france stretch clear across the country from switzerland to the channel could not live unless it have a smoothly run civil machine in the quiet country behind neither of the chamber be in session and except that the main street be busy -- one be tell that one hundred thousand extra people be in town -- you might almost never know that anything out of the ordinary have occur thing must be very different of course from '71 when beat to she knee and threaten with revolution france have to decide between surrender alsace and lorraine and go on with the war the theater be close but there be moving-picture show a occasional concert and twice a week under the auspices of one of the newspaper a conference i go to one of these give by a french professor of english literature in the university of bordeaux on the timely subject : kipling and greater england you can imagine the piquant interest of the scene -- the polite matinee audience the row of erudite frenchman sit behind the speaker the table the shaded lamp and the professor himself a slender dark gentleman with a fine grave face point black beard and penetrate eye -- suggest vaguely a prestidigitateur -- try by sheer intelligence and delicate critical skill to bridge the gap of race and instinctive thought and feeling and make he audience understand kipling say the reporter of one of the bordeaux papers next day : through the kiple evoke by m cestre we admire the english and those who fight in the great wind of the north sea that combat rude and brave we admire the faithful indigene gather from all she dominion to put they muscular arm at the service of the empire it would indeed have be difficult to pay a more graceful compliment to the entente cordiale than to try to run the author of soldier three and the barrack room ballad and with he the nation behind he into the smooth mould of a conference -- that mixture so curiously french of clear thinking and graceful expression of sensitive definition and personal charm all blended into a whole so intellectually neat and modulate that a audience like this may take it with the same sense of be cheer yet not inebriate with which they ally across the channel take they afternoon tea a frenchman of a generation ago would scarcely have recognize the england picture by the amiable bordeaux professor and i be not sure that in this entirely altruistic big brother of little nation the english would have recognize themselves but at any rate polite flutter of applause punctuate the talk and at the end m cestre ask he audience to rise as he pay he final tribute to the people now fight the common battle with france they all stand up and smile up at the left-hand proscenium-box salute the british ambassador sir franci bertie with long and enthusiastic applause a man in the gallery even venture a heep heep and every one drift out very content indeed in the foyer i see one lady carefully spell out with she lorgnette one of the word on the list post there of the subject for conference ah she say considerably reassure apparently keeple but then she may have come in late Thursday the war have be hard on the main business of the neighborhood of course -- germany be the heaviest buyer of bordeaux wine russium next and not as much as usual be go to england the vintage this year like that of 70 be say to be good however and though the young man have go and the wine-making be not as gay as usual there be enough old man and woman leave to do the work i visit one of the older wine house -- nearly two century old -- and tramp through cellar which burrow on two level under a whole city block there be some two million bottle down there in the dark and dust there be something patriarchal and princely about such a house almost unknown in we business at home -- from the portrait of the founder from the caskmaker at lunch-time broil they own fish over a huge fireplace and draw wine from the common cask as they have do for generation the stencil in the shipping-room -- baltimore bogota bueno aire chicago calcutta christianium caraca -- from thing like these to the personality and point of view of the man who have the business in charge now wine begin the charming gentleman who show we round be a living thing and though you could see that he have show many people about in he day -- and be not unaware of what might interest they -- that he be in short a advertiser of the most accomplished kind yet one could also see that he like he work and believe in it and grow wine as a amateur grow fancy tulip and not as a mere salesman to be sure he be incline to slur over the importance of white wine while champagne and its perfidious maker do not interest he in the least but of the red wine of bordeaux its lightness bouquet and general beneficence and the delicate and affectionate care with which it be handle one could have hear he talk all day now and then younger house discover thing that be go to revolutionize the wine trade of course he say we examine such thing we look in we book where record of all we experiment be keep and there we find that we try that new thing in 1856 -- or 1756 perhaps far underground we come on some of the huge majorum big as nine ordinary bottle the king of spain run over to bordeaux one day and come to we and say : ` i have get two hour what can you show I ' we say : ` we can show you we cellar ' ` very well ' say he ` go ahead ' when he come to the majorum he say : ` what on earth do you do with those ' ` they be use when there be a christening or a wedding or some great event and when a king visit we we give he two ' so they send the majorum to the young king and the king send back a polite note just as if he be anybody else and that be all of that story most of the newspaper which follow the government to bordeaux have return to the capital but that intransigeant government-baiter the venerable george clemenceau still continue he bombardment from close range he paper be formerly l'homme libre -- the free man -- but on be suppress this fall by the censor its octogenarian editor gayly change its name to the chained man -- l'homme enchainé -- and continue fire the mayor of a pari commune in '71 prime minister from 1906-9 the editor of various papers and senator now clemenceau be properly fear and he be offer it be say a place in the present government but would accept no post but the highest he prefer he role of political realist and critical privateer a sort of mr shaw of french politics hit a head wherever he see one the imperfection of the french army sanitary service the censorship and the demoralization of the postal service since the war have be favorite target recently there have be much complaint of the difficulty of get news from man at the front m vivianus the premier in a address at reim venture to say that it be he duty to organize administer and intensify the national defense on this innocent phrase the eye of m clemenceau fall the other day and he now fling off a characteristic three-and-a-half-column front-page salvo so adroitly combine the premier 's remark with the actual pitiful fact that the reader almost feel that intensify the suffering of parent and friend of man fight for they country be something in which the present government take delight i wish there be space to quote the editorial i may at any rate quote from one or two of the letter write to m clemenceau to suggest a stay-at-home aspect of the war of which we do not hear much this be from the mayor of pont-en-royan : officially he write on September 29 i be ask to notify the family of the soldier regnier of he death in the midst of they cry and tear the family show I the last letter receive that very morning and date the 27th September two day before now the notice of he death be date September 7 and i say to the father : ' i would not give you too much hope you son probably die the 27th suddenly perhaps and the secretary charge with write the letter i have receive forget a figure -- instead of 27 he put 7 meanwhile as a doubt exist i will do what i can to clear the matter up ' the administrative counsel reply to I : ` there have be no error the notice of decease be date September 27 if then the soldier write the 27th he be not dead we shall inform the ministry and you on you side should write to the hospital where he be be treat ' i write to the chief doctor at besancon no response i send he a telegram with the reply prepay no response i write he a third letter this time a trifle sarcastic i receive finally a despatch : ` regnier be not know at this hospital ' i still have the telegram in my hand when to my house come the sister of the dead soldier in mourning and beam and give I a letter ` it be my brother who have write we ' so there be no mistake the dead man write on the 2d October ` very well ' say i to the family ` be you sufficiently reassure now ' some day after i receive from the red cross hospital at besancon a letter give I news of regnier and explain that there be several hospital in the town that they have only just receive my letter etc etc i do not think more of the matter until October 23 when i receive a circular from the prefecture of isere ask I to advise the regnier family that the soldier regnier wound be be treat at the hospital of besancon at last i think the affair be close when to-day October 30 i receive the enclosed despatch send by i know not whom inform I that the soldier regnier be unknown in the hospital of besancon oh my head my head you can imagine what this slash old privateer would do with a letter like this the censor will not permit he to make any comment very well -- he wish to make none you see mr vivianus it be not one of those execrable parliamentarian who make these complaint it be a mayor a humble mayor officially designate by you to transmit to he people the striking result of you ` organization ' of you ` administration ' of you ` intensification ' in the cruelly delicate matter of give news to family he supply the picture and you see in plain daylight you ` intensification ' at work what do you think of it what can you say about it do you believe that because you have give to you censor the right -- pardon I the power -- to make white space in the column of newspaper that that be go to suppress the fact do you believe etc etc in the same editorial be a letter from a father whose two son on the firing-line have receive none of the family letter since the beginning of the war and write pathetically ask if they parent and little sister be ill or how they have offend a wife enclose a letter from she husband tell how he be suffer from the cold because of insufficient clothing a doctor write protest because there be not a single bottle of antitetanic serum in he field-hospital we find m clemenceau in he lodgings late one afternoon -- a leonine old gentleman bundle up in cap and overcoat before a little grate fire while a secretary run through the big heap of letter pile on the bed in the corner of the room be a roll-top desk -- the sanctum evidently of the chained man as m clemenceau be insistent that he should not be interview i may not repeat the exceedingly lively talk on all sort of people and thing with which he regale we once -- and it do not take long -- he get go one purely personal little bit of information may be pass on however in the hope that it may be as interesting to other practitioner of a laborious trade as it be to I we be talk of the facility with which he reel off day after day column of lively finish prose and i ask whether he write in longhand dictate or use a typewriter this question seem to amuse and interest the old war-horse greatly he go to he desk and bring back a sheet of paper half of which be cover with a small firm handwriting it be he next day 's broadside not yet finish there be nothing mysterious about it he say i get up at half past three every morning i be at that desk most of the day i go to bed at nine o'clock if i have to write a banal note it might take time but there be certain idea which i have work with all my life i work a good many year without express they they be all in my head and when i want they i have only get to take they out i be eighty-three year old and if i could not express myself by this time -- the old gentleman lift he eyebrow smile whimsically and with a quick movement of shoulder and hand conclude -- it would be a public calamity -- a malheur public i thought of the padded life of some of we literary charlatan and editorial gold brick at home of the clever young artist ruin as painter by become popular illustrator the young writer content to substitute overpay banality and bathos for honest work and i must confess that the sight of this indomitable old fighter who have know great man and hold high place in he day and now at eighty-three get up before daylight to pound out in longhand he column of vivid prose stir every drop of what you might call one 's intellectual sport blood of he opinion i know little of the justice of he attack less and to be quite frank i suspect he be something of a trouble-maker but as he stand there bundle up in he overcoat and cap in that chilly lodging-house room witty unsubdued full of fight and of charm he seem to stand for that wonderful french spirit -- for its ardor and penetration its fusion of sense and sensibility its tireless intelligence and unquenchable fire Monday the consul of cognac it sound like a musical comedy when we meet on the steamer last August not quite so odd when we bump into each other in bordeaux and now it turn out to mean in addition to be a young university of virginia man thoroughly acquaint with the people he have to deal with living in a town where the tower of franci i 's castle still stand rowing on a charming old river in the summer and in these day hear a charming old french gentleman vice-consul tell how he fight against the prussian in '70 cognac be a real place it appear -- a old town of twenty thousand people or so and it be really where cognac come from all other brandy be of course as one will learn here mere upstart eaux-de-vie we go through some of the cellar to-day as venerable and vast as the claret cellar in bordeaux although not quite as interesting perhaps because not so alive for wine be a living thing as the man say in bordeaux and it must be ignobly boil and destroy before turn into a distilled spirit to some this pale spiritual essence may possess a finer poetry -- the cellar be more fragrant at any rate all the young man have go to the front -- they wages continue as usual -- and the work be carry on by woman and old servitor scarcely one of the latter under seventy they be point out as example of the beneficent effect of the true cognac -- these old boy who have inhale the slightly pungent fragrance of the cellar and bottling-room all they life you get this perfume all over cognac it come wander down old alleyway out from under dark arch people live literally in a fine mist of it the very stone be turn black by the faint fume there must be score of town south of pari which look more or less like this -- the young man go or drilling in the neighborhood the school turn into hospital the little old provincial hotel shelter family flee from pari there be several such at we hotel nice comfortable people -- you might think you be in some semi-summer-resort hotel at home -- ridgefield conn for instance in winter time the making of cognac occupy nearly every one one way or another and it have make the place next to the richest town of its size in france they make the cognac and they make the bottle for it in a glass factory on a hill overlook the town -- about as airy and pleasant a place for a factory as one could imagine the molten glass be pour into mould the mould close -- psst a stream of compress air turn in the bottle blow and there you be -- a score or so of they turn out every minute as we come out of the furnace-room into the chilly afternoon a regiment of reservist tramp in from a practice march in the country some be young fellow wear uniform for the first time apparently some look like convalescent draft back into the army they take one road and we another and half a hour later swing down the main street of cognac behind a chorus of shrilling bugle all over france south of pari they must be march like this these frosty afternoon come up from bordeaux the other night we miss the regular connection and have to spend the night at sainte the tall quizzical rather grim old landlady of the neat little hotel de la gare -- characteristic of that rugged france which tourist who only see a few street in paris know little about -- be plainly puzzle there we be two able-bodied man and p ------ say nothing about be consul merely remark that he live in cognac in cognac the old woman repeat look from one to the other and then add as one put a unanswerable question : but you be not soldier we go out for a walk in the frosty air before turn in there be scarce a soul in the street but at the other end of the town a handful of young fellow pass on the other side singing they be boy of the 1915 class who have be call out and in a few day would be get ready for war in paris you will see young fellow just like they decorate with flag and feather drive round town in rattle-trap wagon like picnic party return on a summer night at home arm in arm and keep step these boy of sainte be singing as they march : il est rouge et noir et blanc et fendu au derriere -- d he be red white and black and split up the back they see themselves doubtless march down the street of berlin as now they be march down the street of sainte -- and they keep fling back through the frosty dark : il est rouge -- et noir -- et blanc -- et fendu -- au derriere -- d chapter vi the great day they be play the categorical imperative that evening at the little theater in unter den linden it be a old-fashioned comedy lay in the vienna of 1815 -- two love-story lightly and quaintly tell across which through the chatter of a little viennese salon we dimly see napoleon return from elba and hear the thunder of waterloo a young cub of a saxon schoolmaster full of simple-hearted enthusiasm and philosophy come down to the austrian capital and take up by a kindly coquettish young countess become the tutor of she cousin a girl as simple as he the older woman with she know charm the younger with she freshness present a dualism more bewildering than any he have ever read about in he philosophy book and part of the fun consist in see he fall in love with the younger in term of pure reason and finally when the motherly young countess have quietly get he a professorship at konigsberg present to he delighted elise he categorical imperative you can imagine that thoroughly german mixture of sentiment and philosophy the quaint reference to a prussium not yet in its present sense begin to exist how to that audience -- nearly every one of whom have a son or husband or brother at the front -- the century suddenly seem to close up and the napoleonic day become part of they own grosse zeit you can imagine the young schoolmaster and the frivolous older man go off to war and the two woman console each other and with what strange eloquence the word of that girl of 1815 watch they from the window come down across the year : why be it that from time to time man must go and kill each other there it stand in the paper -- two thousand more man -- it write itself so easily but that every one of they have a wife or mother or sister or a -- and when they cry they eye out that mean that it be a victory and when some brave young fellow have fall he be only one of the ` force ' -- so and so many man -- and nobody even know he name you must imagine they come back from the war and pale benign lean on they cane as return hero do in play talk across the footlights to real young soldier you have just see limp in with real wound -- pink-cheeked boy with head and foot bandage and iron cross on black-and-white ribbon tuck into they coat home from east prussium or the aisne then between the act you must imagine they pour out to the refreshment-room for a look at each other and something to eat -- will they never stop eat -- father and mother and daughter with they butterbrod and schinken and big glass of beer in the genial german fashion beam on the young hero limp by or with head bandage like schoolboy with mumps grin in spite of they scar and when they drift out into the street at last softened and bring together by the play -- the street with its light and flag officer in long blue-gray overcoat and soldier everywhere and a military automobile shooting by perhaps with its gay ta-tee ta-td -- the extra be out with another russian army smash and two more ship sink in the channel the old newspaper woman at the friedrichsstrasse corner be chant it hoarsely zwei englische dampfer gesunken -- and they read that the sand have run the prologue be speak the curtain rise on the tragedy of england 's destiny great day indeed day of achievement of utter sacrifice and fling all into the common cause round the corner from unter den linden under the dark window of the information bureau you may see part of the price it be still and desert there except for a lone woman with a shawl over she head try to read by the light of the street-lamp the casualty list you must imagine a building like the post office in new york for instance or the auditorium hotel in chicago with a band of white paper like newspaper spread out and paste end to end run along one side round the corner and down the other not inch but yard rod two city block almost of microscopic type column of name arrange in the systematic german way -- lightly wound badly wound -- schwer verwundet -- gefallen some have die of wound -- tot -- some dead in the enemy 's country -- in feindesland gefallen rank on rank blur off into nothingness endless file of type pale as if the soul of the dead be crowd here one try to think of the categorical imperative in a new york playhouse -- of the desperate endeavor to make the young schoolmaster really look simple and boyish and yet as if he might have hear of kant and of convince the two lady that they lose they sweet comfortableness by dress like professional manikin how the piece might succeed with luck or if it could somehow be make fashionable and how here with all the unaffected and affectionate intelligence with which it be play -- and watch -- it be but part of the week 's work and in spite of the desperation of the time you might have see a dozen such audience in berlin that night -- and yet tourist generally speak of berlin compare with some of the german provincial city as a rather graceless new sort of place full of bad sculpture and prussian arrogance you might have see they at the opera or symphony concert at shakespeare strindberg or the german classic we use to read in college or standing in line at six o'clock sandwich in hand so that they might sit through a performance of peer gynt with the grieg music begin at seven and last till after eleven a wonderful night with poetry and music and splendid scene and act and a man 's very soul develop before you all the time -- sandwich and beer and more music and poetry until that tragedy of the egoist be no longer a play but a part of you so many year of live almost add to one 's life yes it be all here along with the forty-two-centimetre shell -- good music and good beer and good love of both simplicity homely kindness and gemutlichkeit mere talk about play would not be much encourage in germany nowadays in one of the cologne papers the other day there be two imaginary letter -- one sign one who mean well ask that there be a little relief from war poem war article and the like and the other sign one who mean better demand if it be possible for any german to waste time in artistic hair-splitting when the germanic people in greater danger than in they entire history stand with they back to the wall face and hold back the world a berlin dramatic critic go through the motion of review a new performance of hedda gabler the other morning finally dismiss the matter as woman 's trouble -- if anybody can be interested in that nowadays yet a woman ask at the same time that the finer and sweeter voice of peaceful society be not forget conclude she letter with east and west the cannon thunder but in man 's soul sound many bell and it be not necessary that they should always and forever be drown out i mention the theater only as a easy illustration of that many-sided vitality one feel at once on enter germany that development of all a people 's capability material and spiritual which be sum up i suppose in that hapless word kultur you may not like german learning or german art and consider the one pedantic and the other heavy and uninspired a frenchman write very feelingly the other day in the revue des deux mondes about a return to the old french culture a escape from what he describe as the german habit of accumulate mere fact to something that in addition to feed the brain nourish the taste as well -- carry with it so to speak a certain spiritual fragrance you may be of this persuasion the thing one can not escape however in germany whether one like its manifestation or not be the vitality the moral and intellectual force everywhere apparent whether it be apply to smash fort or stage a play when a people can hold back england and france with one hand and the russian avalanche with the other and cut off from oversea trade and living on ration almost yet to take but one of the first example maintain the art of the theater at a level which make that of new york or london in the most spacious time of peace seem crude and infantile one be confront with a fact which a reporter in he travels must record -- a force which as the say go must be reckon with so far as the special business of keep the war go be concern this vitality after seven month of fight in spite of those list in dorotheenstrasse seem ample here in berlin which be a all day 's express journey from either front you see thousand of fit young man march through the street singing and whistle you be tell of million ready and wait to go every one seem confident that germany will win -- indeed with a unity and resolution which could scarcely be more complete if they be defend they last foot of territory determine that germany must win when i be in london in the autumn a man who have make a fly trip to berlin say that the german capital make he think of a man with he foot on the table smoking a cigar and pretend to be unconcerned although he know all the time in he heart that he be doom i find little to suggest such a picture the thing that at once impress the stranger along with the apparent reserve strength be the moral earnestness behind that strength the passionate conviction that they be fight a defensive fight that they be right i shall not attempt to explain this here but merely record it as a fact possibly all people in all great war believe they be right -- and that be why there be great war cross the frontier from rotterdam i stop for a day or two at cologne the proprietor of the hotel a typical big hearty german of the commercial class such as you might expect to find run a brewery at home or a bank or coffee plantation in south america come out of he office when he hear english speak there be no loose englishman in germany nowadays i suppose you be surprise to see the dom yes he laugh point toward the cathedral tower in whose shadow we stand and then -- what do you think about the war i ask he what he think well he say and with the air of brushing aside what be take for grant before consider more doubtful issue of course we win he show I a photograph of he son just make a officer in a few week he say maybe i volunteer myself he be fifty-five year old but thoroughly fit he double up a big right arm and laughingly grip it like iron he boom and there be five million man like I not man -- soldier i find myself the other evening after zigzag all over berlin with a address give I at a typewriter agency in a little apartment on the outskirts of the town the woman who live there have be a stenographer in the city until the war cut off she business and she be now support herself with the six mark -lrb- one dollar and fifty cent -rrb- weekly war benefit give by the municipality and by make soldier ' shirt for the war department at fifty pfennig -lrb- twelve and one-half cent -rrb- a shirt she be glad to get typewriting and without word on either side at once get to work so we proceed for a page or two until something be say about a iron cross stick inside a soldier 's coat that be the iron cross of the second class she interrupt they put that inside the first class they wear outside and as if she could keep still no longer she suddenly fling out almost without a pause : my brother have the iron cross i have seven brother in the army three be in the east and three be in the west and one be in the hospital he be shoot three time in the leg -- here -- and here -- and here they hope to save he leg but he will always be lame he get the iron cross he be at dixmude they march up singing ` deutschland ueber alle ' they be all shoot down there be three hundred of they and every one fall they know they must all be shoot but they march on just the same singing ` deutschland ueber alle ' they know they be go against the english and nothing could stop they she brother would go back if he have to crawl back -- if only she could go and not have to sit here and wait i tell you she say when you first come in that i be german and i ask you if you be a american because i know that dreadful thing have be say in america about we kaiser and i will not have such thing say to I we kaiser do not want the war -- he do everything he could to prevent the war -- no ruler in the world ever do more for he people than we kaiser have do and there be not a man woman or child in germany who would not fight for he and this you must remember be from a woman whose support be cut off by the war and who be make a living by sew shirt at twelve and a half cent a shirt i walk down the busy high street that night in cologne and the bright shop-window with they chocolate and fruit -- apple from canada and hood river -- crowded cafe people overflow sidewalk into the narrow street somehow remind I of the cheerful bordeaux i tramp through in November there be indeed many french suggestion in cologne and in the shop they still sometimes call a umbrella a parapluie a american who live in cologne tell I that the decrease in the number of young man be noticeable and that eleven son of he friend have be kill to a stranger the city look normal with the usual crowd one do notice the people about the war bulletin-board they be not boy and street lounger but grave-looking citizen and they wife and daughter people who look as if they might have son or brother at the front the express from cologne to berlin pass through essen where the krupp gun be make the coal and iron country of westphalium and the plain of the west it be a country of large city whose border often almost touch where some tall factory chimney be almost always on the horizon all these chimney be pour out smoke there be a reason of course why iron-works should be busy and manufacture go on -- if not as usual at any rate go on the muddy plain between the factory town be green with winter wheat the crop which be to carry the country through another year meanwhile one be tell the railroad rights of way would be plant and land not need for beet -- for with no sugar go out germany can produce more now than she need -- also be seed to wheat here in berlin we be it seem be starve out but in the complex web of a modern city it be rather hard to tell just what that mean : in ordinary time for instance germany import thirty-five million dollar ' worth of butter and egg from russium which of course be not come in now yet butter seem to appear and at a central place like the victorium cafe at the corner of unter den linden and friedrichsstrasse two soft-boiled egg cost fifty pfennig or twelve and a half cent which be but two and a half cent more than they cost before the war and that include a morning paper and a window from which to see berlin go by even be berlin in a journalistic sense starve one presume the cosmopolitan in the tea-room of the kaiserhof or adlon or esplanade would still have they tray of fancy cake to choose from and find no difficulty in get plenty to eat at a -- for they -- not unreasonable price for week white bread have have to contain a certain amount of rye flour and rye bread a certain amount of potato -- the so-called war bread -- and except in the better hotel one be serve unless one order specially with only two or three little wisp of this kriegsbrod for frenchman this would mean a real privation but german eat so little bread comparatively speak that one believe the average person scarcely notice the difference every one must have he bread-card now with coupon entitle he to so many gram a day -- about four pound a week -- which the waiter or baker tear off when the customer get he bread without these card not so much as a crumb can be have for love or money yet with all this stiff and not unamusing red tape you morning coffee and bread and butter cost from thirty pfennig -lrb- seven and one-half cent -rrb- in one of the berlin automat to one mark fifty pfennig -lrb- thirty-seven cent -rrb- in the quiet of the best hotel meat be plentiful and cheap particularly beef and in any of the big popular beer restaurant so common in berlin a ordinary steak for one person cost from thirty-five to fifty cent pork the mainstay of the poorer people be comparatively expensive because hog have be make into durable hard sausage for the army and potato also expensive have be buy up in large quantity by the government to be sell in the public market to the poor a few pound to each person at a moderate price there be say to be eight hundred thousand prisoner now in germany and the not entirely frivolous suggestion have be make that the horde of hungry russian capture in the east be more dangerous now than they be with gun in they hand yet there be no visible sign of such poverty as one will see in certain part of london or chicago in time of peace and a woman in charge of one of the soup-kitchen where people pinch by the war get one substantial meal a day at ten pfennig tell I there be no reason for any one in berlin go hungry meanwhile the scarcity of flour only add fuel to the people 's patriotism and they be tell everywhere on red placard that england never can starve they out if every german do he economical duty where so much thinking be do for the people and do so efficiently it be difficult not to feel that everything be somehow arrange and one find it difficult to become acutely anxious while the hundred of crowded cafe be run full blast until one o'clock every morning and the seal in the tiergarten have the bottom of he tank cover with fresh fish he be too indolent to eat society in its more visible decorative sense be as forget as it be in france as it must be in such a time there be no dance or formal party every one who be not go about he civil business have in one way or another go to the war the gay young man be at the front the idle young woman knit or nurse or help the poor and it be a adventure uncommon enough to be remember to meet on the street a pretty young lady merely out to take the air with hand in she muff and trot in front of she the timorous dachshund muzzle like a ravening tiger and look at the world askance with he rueful eye the apparent quietness and gravity be partially due to the lack of a yellow or in the british or american sense of the word popular press there be none of that noisy hate continually din into one 's ear in london by papers which to be sure represent neither the better-class english civilian nor the light-hearted fighting man at the front yet which be entertainingly write do contain the news and get themselves read the german papers print comparatively little of what we call news they hide unpleasant truth and accent pleasant one and be work all the time to create a definite public opinion but they partisanship be that of official proclamation rather than that of overworked and underpaid reporter strive to please they employer with all the desperation of servant work for a tip the yelp after spy the heaping of adjective on every trifling achievement of british arm the ill-timed talk of snatch the enemy 's trade in a war theoretically fight for a high principle all that journalistic vulgarity -- which might be as characteristic of we own papers under similar circumstance -- one be mercifully spare this taciturnity be astonishing toward the work of the man at the front a few day ago flag be fling out all over berlin at the news of hindenburg 's victory military attach be say that there have be nothing like this since napoleon up and down the street the newswoman be croak : sechsund-zwanzig tausend russen gefangen hindenburg zahlt noch immer -lrb- twenty-six thousand russian capture and hindenburg 's still count -rrb- and all you could find in the papers be the general staff report that at one place the fighting have be very severe up to the present we have make some twenty-six thousand prisoner etc and even this laconic sentence lose in the middle of the regular communiqué beginning : yesterday on the belgian coast after a period of inactivity the picturesqueness and personality of the war be leave to the stage and the innumerable weekly and humorous papers yet even here there be little or no tendency to group achievement around individual commander -- it be we army not the man although even german collectivism can not keep hindenburg 's dependable old face off the post-cards nor regiment of young lady from send he letter and liebesgaben in the theater you see the feldgrau hero in dugout in flander or in galician trench see the audience weep when the german mother send off she seven son or the bearded father meet he youngest boy schwer verwundet on the battle-field or cheer when the curtain go down on noble blond giant in spiked helmet dangle miniature frenchman by the scruff of the neck and force craven highlander to bite the dust you may even see a submarine dive down into green water see the torpedo slide into the tube breech-block close and -- now -- for kaiser and fatherland -- by means of a image throw on a screen from the periscope see the english cruiser go up in a tower of water and founder in all this comment there be a very different feeling for each of the three ally the russian do not count so to speak they be dangerous because of they number and must be fling back but the feeling toward they be not unlike that toward a herd of stampede range cattle toward the french there be no bitterness either rather a sort of pity and the wish to be think well of one be remind now and then of the german captain quarter at sedan in zolum 's debacle who while conscious of the strength behind he yet want he involuntary host to know that he too have be to pari and know how to be a galant homme man tell you they have put up a mighty good fight say or speaking of the young french sculptor allow to go on with he work in the prison camp at zossen or the flower-bed in front of the french barracks there -- but of course the french be a artistic people you can allow they liberty like that every now and then in the papers one run across some anecdote from france in which the frenchman be permit to make the retort at the expense of the english toward john bull there be no mercy he be show naked try to hide himself with neutral flag he be sprawl in he mill with a river of french blood flow by from the battle-field of france while the cartoonist ask france if she can not see that she be do he grind for he he be hobnob cheek by jowl with cannibal and black man and he be seriously discuss as a traitor to the germanic people and the white race a german woman tell I the other day that in she house it be the custom to fine everybody in the family ten pfennig if they come down to breakfast without say : gott strafe die englander -lrb- god punish the english -rrb- in a recent ulk there be a cartoon of a young mother hold up she baby to he proud father with the announcement that he have speak he first word and what do he say gott strafe england america be criticise for supply the ally with arm -- shades of south american revolution and the old ypiranga -- while permit itself without sufficient protest to be shut off from send food to germany yet in spite of this and the extremely difficult situation create by the submarine blockade the individual american be not embarrassed unless mistaken for a englishman or unless he find some supersensitive patriot in a restaurant or theater who object even to hear english at the frontier the honest custom inspector land first thing on a copy of tartarin sur les alpes which i have pick up at the railroad news-stand in the hague franzosisch he declare flap over the page next it be a bundle of letter of introduction the top one of which happen to be in english englische briefe and forthwith he bellow for help a young officer saunter out from the near-by office salute and say good morning glance at tartarin with a smile and toss it back into the bag at letter and passport say it must be very interesting to see both side and so after a question or two to the train for koln on the way to berlin from koln that rainy afternoon i go into the dining-car toward five o'clock attire in a pepper-and-salt tweed suit and heavy tan boot and speak german with evident pain tactfully ask -- everybody else drink beer -- for tea the man across the way whisper to he companion and stare a middle-aged man farther up the aisle stand stock-still and stare a young woman at the other end of the car turn round and gaze over the back of she chair whisper aghast to she companion : englaender not particularly enliven by the cup that cheer i regain my compartment presently and glare out at the sodden landscape with now and then a shot at the other occupant who have get on at essen or one of the western station and sit the day out without a word one of those disagreeable prussian evidently -- until actually need to know i break the silence by ask which station we arrive at in berlin he answer with perfect good humor and we begin to talk i mention the tea incident ignorant people he say dismiss they with a wave of the hand they ought to have see my little flag -- he have -- and anyhow a gentleman be a gentleman and they be fight england not individual englishman then revert to my apology for my german he amiably shift into french and so we talk until reach berlin when hope that i would get what i come for he shake hand and wish I bon voyage so you never can tell the militarism which any man in the street-car at home can tell you all about and which cramb and bernhardus make so interesting and understandable be here on the spot not so easy to put one 's finger on apparently nobody ever hear of bernhardus and you might talk with every man you meet for a fortnight without find any one who could tell you -- as any young girl who happen to sit next you at dinner can tell you at home -- about the german belief in war as a great blessing because it be the only way of assert you own superior idea over the other man 's inferior idea and thus get a world ahead people want to smash england of course because as they explain she bring on the war and be try to starve they and they roar with the applause when the lightning-change man at the wintergarten impersonate hindenburg because hindenburg be a grand old scout who be keep those million of slovenly russian from overrun we tidy busy well-ordered germany but treitschke -- who be he and then of course it be not always easy to put one 's finger on just what people mean by militarism some have object to militarism because they do not like the manners of the german waiter at the savoy and some because -- well those people somehow rub you the wrong way it be not universal conscription because many nation have that nor the amount spend per capita on soldier and ship for we ourselves spend almost as much as the german and the french even more one of we old-school cattleman use to shoot all the game cut all the timber and use all the water he want to would doubtless say without see a soldier that it be they damned police no when people think they be talk about german militarism they be quite as likely to be talk about the way german face be make or about german collectivism -- the uncanny ability german have for take order for team-work for turn every individual energy into the common end one may however run across a certain feeling toward war quite local and unconscious yet very different from the french love of gloire and the english keenness for war as a sort of superior fox-hunting or football you be let we say watch one of the musical comedy which the war have inspire the curtain rise on a darkened stage through whose blackness you presently discover twinkling far below as if you be look down from a aeroplane the light of pari the silver thread of the seine and its bridge there be a faint whir and two face emerge vaguely from the dark -- the hero and heroine swinging along in a taube and as they fly they sing a wistful little waltz song a sort of cradle song : ich glau-u-be ich glau-u-be da oben fliegt ` ne taube they be think so the song run that there be a taube overhead it have fly here out of its german nest and let 's hope it will not let anything fall on they and as they sing the young man make a motion with he hand there be a sort of glowworm flash and a few seconds later away down there among the pari roof a puff of red smoke and fire the illusion be perfect and the audience be enchant -- that ride through the velvet night so still so quaint so roguish in its way and the flash far below that have fling some unsuspecting citizen on the cobblestone like a bundle of old rag and whir gently the taube sail on through the night : ` ich glaube da oben fliegt ich glaube ` ne taube ' again the glowworm flash and a moment later over on the left bank not far from the luxembourg apparently another of those eloquent little puff of fire the crowd be as delighted as child would be with burst soap-bubble or we be let we say at woran wir denken -lrb- what we be think of -rrb- with delightful music and such verse as we rarely enough hear in musical comedy at home in the spotlight there be a square young man dress in a metallic coat and conical helmet so as to suggest the famous forty-two-centimetre shell -- the shell which make a hole like a cellar and smash the belgian fort as if a earthquake have strike they and singing with he a exquisite nun-like creature in a dove-colored robe typify the taube they be sing to each other : i be delicate and slender and make for the salon and i be the biggest smasher in all the present season high up above the cloud i fly at heart 's desire and i be a child of krupp 's whom nobody know about i fly trackless as a breath i slash on with smoke and roar they be in love with each other you see the taube and the forty-two-centimetre shell the brummer or grumbler as they call it in germany -- could anything be more piquant you should hear they -- the chaste chic nun-like taube and the thick-chested old brummer singing that he be she dear old grumbler and she he soft swift dive : suesser dicker brummer du mein taubchen zart und flink there be a sort of poetry about this -- a new sort of poetry about a new sort of war and it might possibly be prove that such poetry could only come from a people so breed to arm that they do not shrink even in imagination from the use to which arm must be put -- a people in love with war have a mystical feeling for its instrument such as they remote ancestor have for they battle-axis and double-edged sword i shall not attempt to do this -- heaven preserve american from be judge by they musical comedy -- and doubtless the child even of we most devoted advocate of universal peace have play with lead cannon and toy soldier i merely speak of it this curious mixture of refinement and brutality as something which it strike I we american -- who always do everything exactly right -- would not have think of do in just that way many of the way of this people be not we way you have hear let we say of the german parade step sometimes laugh at as the goose step in england and at home i be lunch the other day with a american military observer and he speak of the parade step and the effect it have on he do you ever see it he demand have you any idea of the moral effect of that step you see those man march by every muscle in they body taut and tingling as steel wire every eye on the emperor and when they bring those foot down -- bing bang -- the physical fitness it stand for the unity determination -- why it be the whole german idea -- nothing can stop 'em do you ever see one of these soldier salute yes i have see hundred of they and i have be make extremely ill at ease one day in my hotel when a young officer with whom i have start in the american fashion comfortably to shake hand suddenly whack he heel together like a couple of indian club and stiff as a ramrod snap he hand to he cap do you ever see they salute they do not do it like a baggage porter -- there be nothing servile about it they square off and bring that hand to they head and look that officer square in the eye as if to say : ` now damn you salute I ' and he get he salute too -- like a man you may not like this salute or you may not like the parade step but you can be very sure of one thing -- that it be not the militarism that push civilian off the sidewalk nor permit a officer to strike he subordinate -- though these thing have happen in germany -- that be hold back england and france and drive the russian million out of east prussium it be something bigger than that peasant and prince these man be die gladly back up by fitness discipline and a passionate unity such as the world have not often see this and not the futile nurse ' tale with which the american public permit itself to be divert during the early week of the war be what strike one in germany it be a fact like the german be in belgium which you have get to face and think about whether you like it or not berlin February 1915 chapter vii two german prison camp visit a prison camp be somewhat like touch at a island in the night -- one of those tropical island for instance whose curious and crowded life show for a instant as you steamer leave the mail or take on a load of deck-hand and then fade away into a few twinkling light and the sound of a bell across the water you may get permission to see a prison camp but may not stay there and you be not expect generally to talk to the prisoner you can but walk past those row of eye with all they untold story much as you might go into a theater in the midst of a performance tramp through the audience and out again it be a strange experience and leave one hope that somebody -- some german shut away in the south of france one of those quick-eyed frenchman in the human zoo at zossen -- be keep a diary for while there have always be prison camp have there ever be -- at least since rome -- such menagerie as these behind the barbed-wire fence at zossen -- zossen be one of the prison near berlin -- there be some fifteen thousand man the greater number be frenchmen drove of those long blue turned-back overcoat and red trousers flow sluggishly between the row of low barracks frenchman of every sort of training and temperament sweep here like dust by the war into common anonymity i do not remember any picture of the war more curious and as it be uncanny than the first sight of zossen as we motor come lurch down the muddy road from berlin -- that huge forget eddy that slough of idle aimless human being against the gray march sky milling slowly round and round in the mud but the french be only part of zossen there be russian -- shaggy peasant such as we see in cartoon or play at home and mongol russian with flat face and almond eye who might pass for chinaman there be wild-eyed turco from the french african province chatter untame arab play leap-frog in front of they german commandant as impudently as street boy back in they native bazaar there be all the tribe and caste of british indian -- i have get twenty different kind of people in my mohammedan camp say the lieutenant who be show I about -- squat gurkha from the himalaya minus they famous knife -- tall black-bearded sikh with the face of prince there be even a few lone englishman though most of the british soldier in this part of germany be at doberitz whether or not zossen could be call a show camp it seem at any rate about as well manage as such a place could be the prisoner be house in new clean one-story barracks well feed so far as one could tell from they appearance and that of the kitchen and storeroom they could write and be write to and they be compel to take exercise the roman catholic have one chapel and the greek catholic another and there be a effort to permit indian prisoner to observe they rule of caste as we tramp through barracks where chilly indian russian with broad high cheek-bone sensitive-looking frenchman with quick liquid eye jump to they foot and stiffen at attention as the commandant pass a young officer who have live in england before the war and be now act as interpreter volunteer he guileless impression the turco be a bad lot -- fight gambling and steal from each other -- there be trouble with some of they every day the russian be dirty good-natured and stupid the english -- well frankly he be surprise at they lack of discipline and general unruliness -- all except some of the indian and those he must say be well-trained -- fine fellow and good soldier one could surmise the workings of he mind as one thought of the average happy-go-lucky tommy atkin and then come across one of those tall straight hawk-eyed sikh and see he snap he heel together and he arm to he side and stand there like a bronze statue it be a dreadful job get the frenchman to take exercise -- they can not understand why any one should want to work merely to keep himself fit aside from this idiosyncrasy they be of course the pleasantest sort of people to get along with we see frenchman sort mail in the post-office painting sign for street make blanket out of paste - together newspaper -- everywhere they be treat as intelligent man to whom favor could be grant and of course there be this difference between the french and english of the early week of the war -- the french army be one of universal conscription like the german and business man and farmer writer singer and painter be lump in together there be one particularly good-looking young man a medical officer who fling up he head to attention as we come up he help we a lot -- this man say the commandant and lay he hand on the young man 's shoulder the frenchman 's eye dilate a trifle and a smile flash behind rather than across he face -- one could not know whether it be gratitude or defiance a sculptor who have win a prize at rome and several other artist have have a room set aside for they to work in some be make post-card some more ambitious drawing and in the sculptor 's studio be the head of the young doctor we have just see and a unfinished plaster group for a camp monument on the wall be a sign in latin and french -- unhappy the spirit which worry about the future a facetious warning that any one who loaf there longer than three minute be likely to be kill and the follow artistic creed from la fontaine : ne for fan point noire talent nous ne ferion rien avec grace jamai un lourdaud quoiqu'il fosse ne saurait passer pour gallant -lrb- do not strain you talent or you 'll do nothing gracefully the boor will not pass for a gallant gentleman no matter what he do -rrb- the german at different time in they history have conquer the french and humbly look up to and imitate they generally speak they study and try to understand the french and they own intellectuality and idealism be thing french-men might be expect to like or at any rate be interest in yet it be one of history 's or geography 's irony that the frenchman go on he way neither know nor want to know the blond beast over the rhine -- jamai un lourdaud quoiqu'il fasse the young sculptor must have smile when he tack that verse on the wall of he prison ruhleben be a race-track on the outskirts of berlin and a detention camp for english civilian this be quite another sort of menagerie you can imagine the different kind of englishman who would be catch in germany by the storm -- luxurious invalid take the water at baden-baden gold coast negro roust-about from rusty british tramp at hamburg agent manufacturer professor librarian officer from channel boat student of music and philosophy all these luckless civilian -- four thousand of they -- have be herd together in the stable paddock and stand of the ruhleben track the place be not as suit for a prison as the high land of zossen the stall with they four bunk be dismal enough and the loft overhead with little light and ventilation still worse some have suffer semi-invalid for instance unable to get along with the prison ration but the interesting thing about ruhleben be not its discomfort but the remarkable fashion in which the prisoner have contrived to make the best of a bad matter the musician have they instrument send in and organize a orchestra the professor begin to lecture and teach until now there be a sort of university with some fifty different class in the long room under the grand stand and on the evening when we have the privilege of visit ruhleben it be to see a dramatic society present bernard shaw 's androcle and the lion the play begin at six o'clock for the camp light be out at nine and it be in the dusk of another one of berlin 's rainy day after slither through the tiergarten and past the endless concrete apartment-house of charlottenburg that we taxicab swing to the right lurch down the lane of mud and stop at the gate of ruhleben inside be a sort of mild morass overspread with englishman -- professional-looking man with months-old beard pink-cheeked young fellow as fresh as if they have just step off piccadilly man in fade knicker-bocker and puttee man in sailor blue and brass button man with flat cap and cockney accent one with a thermos bottle and crisp right you be -- a good-natured half-humorous half-tragic cross-section of the london street drift about here in the german mud there be still a few minute before the play begin and we walk through some of the barracks with the commandant a tall bronzed officer of middle age with gracious manners one of those olympian german who resemble they english cousin of the same class each barrack have its captain and over these be a camp-captain -- formerly a english merchant of berlin -- who go with we on we round the stable be crowd with bunk and man -- like a cattleship forecastle one young man fulfil doubtless he english ritual of dress for dinner be punctiliously shave although it be now practically dark in another corner the devotee of some system of how to get strong and how to stay so strip to the skin be slowly and with solemn precision raise and lower a pair of light dumb-bell some salute as private soldier would some bow almost as to a friend with a cheery guten abend herr baron there seem indeed to be a very pleasant relation between this gentleman soldier and he gentleman prisoner and the camp-captain lag behind tell how one evening when they have sing elijah the man have stand up and give three english cheer for the commandant while he wife who have come to hear the performance stand beside he laugh and wipe she eye as you get closer to war you more frequently run across such thing the fighting man kill ruthlessly because that they think be the way to get they business over but for the most part they kill without hate for that in its noisier and more acrid form you must go back to the man who be not fight to the overdriven and underexercised journalist sizzle and thunder in they swivel-chair the dimly light hall under the grand stand be already crowd as we be lead to we seat on a rostrum face the stage with the commandant and one of he officer there be a red draw curtain footlights make with candle and biscuit tin and so string on a wire that at a pull between the act they could be turn on the spectator a program have be print on the camp mimeograph the camp orchestra be tuning up and a special overture have be compose by a young gentleman with the beautiful name of quentin morvaren you will doubtless recall mr shaw 's comedy and the characteristic realistic fun he have with he roman and christian martyr and the lion who remember the mild-mannered androcle who have once pull a sliver from he foot dance out of the arena with he instead of eat he and you can imagine the peculiarly piquant eloquence give to the dialogue between mr shaw 's meek but witty christian and they might-is-right roman captor speak by british prisoner in the spring of 1915 in a german prison camp before a german commandant sit up like a statue with he hand on he sword the roman captain be a writer the centurion a manufacturer androcle a teacher of some sort the call-boy for the fight in the arena a cabin-boy from a british merchant ship and the tender-hearted lion some genius from the hall even after month of this sodden camp it be possible to find a youth to play lavinium with so pretty a face such a velvet voice such a pensive womanliness that the flat-capped ribald young cockney in the front row blush with embarrassment a professor of archaeology or something say that he have never see more accurate reproduction of armor though this be make but of gilded and silvered cardboard -- in short if mr shaw 's fun be ever better bring out by professional player they must have be very good indeed it be a island within a island that night there under the ruhleben grand stand -- english speech and irish wit in that german sea you should have see the two young patrician drift in with the regulation drawl of the piccadilly nut -- i say he-ah 's some christian -- let 's chaff they the crowd be laugh the commandant be laugh the curtain close in a whirl of applause one have forget there be a war the applause continue the player straggle out falter back from the part in which they have forget themselves into normal self-conscious englishman there be a moment 's embarrassed pause then the rattle of a sabre as the tall man in gray-blue rise to he foot danke ihnen meine herren aeusserst nett he say briskly -lrb- thanks gentleman very clever indeed -rrb- he turn to we nod in stiff soldierly fashion sehr nett sehr nett he say and lead the way out between a lane of englishman suddenly become prisoner again chapter viii in the german trench at la bassée we have come down from berlin on-one of those excursion which the german general staff arrange for the military observer and correspondent of neutral country you go out a sort of zoo -- we party include four or five american a greek a italian a diminutive spaniard and a tall preoccupy swede -- under the direction of some hapless officer of the general staff for a week perhaps you go hurtle through a closely articulate program almost as personally helpless as a package in a pneumatic tube -- night express race military motor snap-shot at this and that down a bewildering vista of long gray cape heel clicking stiff bow from the waist and military salute you be under fire one minute the next shooting through some capture palace or barracks or museum of antique at noon the guard be turn out in you honor at four you be watch distant shell-fire from the belgian dune at eleven crawl under a down quilt in some french hotel where the price of food and wine be fix by the local german commandant everything be do for you -- more of course than one would wish -- the gifted young captain-conductor speak english one minute french or italian the next get you up in the morning to bed at night past countless sentry and thick-headed guard demand a auswei contrive never to cease look as if he have step from a band-box and presently pop you into you hotel in berlin with the curious feeling of never have be away at all it be not of course a ideal way of work -- not like put on a hat and stroll out to war as one sometimes could do in the early week in belgium and france the front be a big and rather accidental place however -- you can scarcely touch it anywhere without bring back something to help complete the civilian 's puzzle picture of the war we moment come in the german trench before la bassée when with the english so near that you could have throw a baseball into they trench both side begin to toss dynamite bomb at each other we have come across to cologne on the regular night express shift to a military train and so on through aix louvain brussels and by the next morning 's train down to lille armentiere be only eight mile away ypre fifteen and a little way to the south neuve chapelle where the english offensive have first succeed then be throw back only a few day before spring have come over night the country be green sparkling with canal and little stream and the few belgian peasant leave be try to put it in shape for summer a few be plough with horse other laboriously go over they field foot by foot with a spade once we pass half a dozen man drag a harrow every tree in this country where wood be grow like any other crop be speckled with white spot where branch have be trim away and below the timber be pile -- heavy log for lumber smaller one cut into firewood -- the very twig pile as carefully as so many stack of celery so fresh and neat and clean-swept do it seem in that soft sunshine that one forget how empty it be -- so empty and repress that one awake startle to see three shaggy farm horse gallop off as the train roll by kick up they heel as if they never have hear of war it seem frivolous almost impertinent and the landsturm officer lean in the open window beside I in the passageway think perhaps of he own home across the rhine laugh and breathe a deep-chested kolossal we pass enghien leuze tournaus all with that curious look of a run-down clock on the outskirts of one town half a dozen little child stop spin top in the road to demand tribute from the train they be pinch little child with the worried prematurely old face of factory child and they beg insistently almost irritably as if payment be long overdue good-natured soldier toss they chocolate and sausage and slice of buttered kriegsbrod which they take without thanks still repeat in a curious jumble of german and french pfennig venir pfennig -- pfennig -- pfennig venir ' two officer from division headquarters be wait for we in the station at lille -- one a tall easy-going young fellow in black motor-gauntlet who look as if he might a few year before have row on some american college crew the other in the officer ' gray-blue frock overcoat with fur collar a softer type with quick dark eye and smile and the pleasant slightly languid manners of a young legation secretary we have just time to glance at the broken window in the station roof the two or three smash block around it and be hurry to that most empty of place -- a modern city hotel without any guest -- when three gray military motor-car with the imperial double eagle in black on they side whirl up the officer take the lead we happy family distribute itself in the other and with cut-out drum a soldier beside each chauffeur blow a warning and a occasional gay ta-ta ta-ta on a silver horn we whirl out into the open country we pass a church with a roof smash by a aeroplane a few day before -- and catch at the same time the first b-r-r-rurm from the cannonade to the west -- a supply-train a overturn motor-van and here and there packed ammunition wagon and gun presently in the lee of a little brick farmhouse a short distance from the village of auber we alight and with warning that it be better not to keep too close together walk a little farther down the road not a man be in sight nor a house nor gun not even a trench yet we be as a matter of fact in the middle of a battle-field from where we stand it be not more than a mile to the english trench and only two mile to neuve chapelle and even as we stand there from behind we from a battery we have pass without see come a crash and then the long spinning roar of something mill down aisle of air and a far-off detonation from the direction of neuve chapelle tssee-ee-rr bong over we head from the british line come a answering wail and in the field a quarter of a mile beyond we there be a geyser of earth and slowly float away a greenish-yellow cloud of smoke from all over the horizon come the wail and crash of shell -- a artillery duel as the official report call it the sort of thing that go on day after day somebody want to walk on to the desolate village which raise its smash wall a few hundred yard down the road the tall young officer say that this might not be do -- it would draw the enemy 's fire and as if to accent this advice there be a sudden bang and the corner of one of the house we be look at collapse in a cloud of dust under these wail parabola swing invisibly across from horizon to horizon we withdraw behind the farmhouse for lunch -- sandwich frankfurter keep hot in a fireless cooker and red wine -- when far overhead a double-decker english aeroplane suddenly sail over we it seem to be about six thousand foot above we so high that the sound of its motor be lose and its speed seem but a lazy level drift across the blue do it take those three motor-car and those little dot for some reconnoitr division commander and he staff aeroplane not only drop bomb but signal to they friend there be a uncomfortable amount of artillery scatter about the country and we watch with peculiar interest the movement of this tiny hawk but already other gun as hide as those that might be threaten we have come as it be to the rescue a little ball of black smoke suddenly puff out behind that sailing bird and presently a sharp crack of a burst shrapnel shell come down to we ear another puff of smoke closer one in front above below they chase round he like swallow in all the drab hideousness of modern warfare there be nothing so airy so piquant so pretty as this we bird and he pursuer disappear in the north over the level country to the south float a german observation balloon and presently we rumble over a canal and through the shatter village of la bassée la bassée have be in the war despatch for month and look it its church use as a range-finder apparently be a gray honeycomb from which each day a few shell take another bite roof be tear off street strew with broken glass and brick yet it be in such house and they cellar that soldier fight in the trench in a neighborhood like this come back for a rest dismal little island which mask the army one do not see at the front the custom of billeting soldier in house -- possible in territory so closely build up -- add to the vagueness of modern warfare american associate army with tent when we mobilize ten thousand man at san antonio you be in a city of soldier ten thousand man in this war disappear like water in sand some of they be in the trench some in village like this out of the zone of heavier fire but within a few minute ' walk of they work so to speak other be distribute farther back over a zone perhaps ten mile deep crisscross with telephone-wire and so arrange with assemble station reserve and sub-reserve that the whole be a closely knit organism all the way up to the front there be continual movement in this body -- the man in the trench go back after forty-eight hour to the near-by village after day or week of this service back clear out of the zone of fire fresh man come up to take they place and so on all you see as you whirl through be a sentry here a soldier 's head there at a second-story window a company shuffling along a country road woman watch we from the door of la bassée -- still go on live here somehow as human being will on the volcano 's very edge -- and child be play in the street husband go food go the country sweep bare -- why do they not go too but where here at any rate there be a roof overhead -- until a shell smash it -- and food soldier be glad to share there must be strange story to tell of these little island on the edge of the battle where the soldier who be go out to be kill and the woman whose husband perhaps be go to help kill they huddle together for a time victim of a common storm we whirl past they down the road a bit then walk up a gentle slope to the right over this low ridge from the english trench rifle-bullets whistle above we head in the shelter of a brick farmhouse a dozen or so german soldier be wait after trench service to go back to la bassée they be smallish mild-looking man dust with the yellow clay in which they have burrow -- clothes boot face and hand -- until they look like miller how be the english some one ask do they know how to shoot a weary sort of hoot chorus out from the dust-covered man gut genug they say the house be strew with rusty cartridge clip and smash brick we wait while we chaperon bring the battalion commander -- a mild-faced little man more like a school-teacher than a soldier -- and it be decide that as the trench be not under fire at the moment we might go into they he lead the way into the communication trench -- a straight-sided wind ditch shoulder-deep and just wide enough to walk in comfortably yellow clay be pile up overhead on either side and there be a wooden sidewalk the ditch twist constantly as the trench themselves do so as not to be sweep by enfilade fire and after some hundred of yard of this twist we come to the : first-line trench and the man 's dugout it be really a series of little cave with wall of solid earth and roof of timber and sand-bag proof against almost anything but the plunge flight of heavy high-explosive shell the floor of these cave be higher than the bottom of the trench so that a ordinary rain would not flood they and cover with straw and they be full of man asleep work over this and that -- from one come the smell of frying ham the trench twist snakelike in a general north and south direction and be fit every few foot with metal firing-shield loophole for rifle and machine gun in each outer curve face the enemy a firing platform about waist-high have be cut in the earth with similar armored port-hole the german have be hold this trench for three month and its whole outer surface be frost a sulphurous yellow from the smoke of explode shell shrapnel-casing and rust shell-nose be stick everywhere in the clay and each curve expose a bit of surface to the enemy be honeycomb with bullet hole in one or two place sand-bags cave and all have be tear out except for a occasional far-off detonation and the more or less constant and so to speak absent-minded crack of rifle a mere keep awake apparently and let the man in the opposite trench know you be awake the afternoon be peaceful pink-cheeked youngster in dusty feldgrau stiffen and clap they hand to they side as officer come in sight hear english with a amazement not difficult to imagine and doubtless be as anxious to talk to these strange being from a world they would say good-by to as we be to talk to they at one of the salient angle where a platform have be cut we stop to look through a periscope : one can not show head or hand above the trench of course without draw fire and look out of this curious shut-in world as man do in a submarine -- just as the lady in the old-fashioned house across from we in new york sit at she front window and see in a slanting mirror everything that happen between she and the avenue we have not be tell just where we be go -lrb- in that shut-in ditch one have no idea -rrb- and there in the mirror beyond some straggle barb wire and perhaps seventy-five yard of ordinary grass be another clay bank -- the trench of the enemy highlander gurkha heaven know what -- you could see nothing -- but -- over there be england so this be what these young soldier have come to -- here be the real thing drum beat trumpet blare the klingelspiel jingle at the regiment 's head and with flower in you helmet and you wife or sweetheart shoulder you rifle as far as the station -- and you should see these german woman march out with they man -- you go march out to war you look out of the window of various railway train then they lead you through a ditch into another ditch and there across a stretch of mud which might be you own back yard be a clay bank which be you enemy and one morning at dawn you climb over you ditch and run forward until you be cut down and when you have so to speak be throw in the stream for the other to cross over and the trench be take and you be put out of the way under a few inch of french earth then perhaps inasmuch as experience show that it be not worth while to try to keep a trench unless you have capture more than three hundred yard of it the battalion retire and start all over again we have walk on down the trench turn a bend where two tree have be blow up and fling across it when there be a dull report near by follow a moment later by a tremendous explosion out toward the enemy 's trench unsere minen -lrb- one of we bomb -rrb- laugh a young soldier beside I and a crackle of excitement run along the trench these bomb be cylinder about the size of two baking-powder tin join together fill with dynamite and explode by a fuse they be throw from a small mortar with a light charge of powder just sufficient to toss they over into the opposite trench the german know what be come and they be laugh and watch in the direction of the english trench vorsicht vorsicht there be a dull report and at the same moment something shoot up from the english trench and very clear against the western sky come flop over and over toward we like a bottle throw over a barn vorsicht vorsicht it sail over we head behind the trench there be a instant 's silence and then whong and a pile of dirt and black smoke be fling in the air again there be a dull report and we send a second back -- this time behind they trench -- and again -- vorsicht vorsicht -- they send a answer back four time this be repeat a quainter way of make war it would be hard to imagine they might have be boy play anty-over over the old house at home bomb of this sort have little penetrate power if throw in the open they go off on the surface much like a gigantic firecracker they be easy to dodge by daylight when you can see they come but throw at night as part of a general bombardment include shrapnel and heavy explosive shell or explode directly in the trench they must be decidedly unpleasant the bomb episode have divide we two officer and myself wait on one side of the bend in the trench toward which the bomb be throw the other go ahead it be several minute before i rejoin they and i do not learn until we be outside that they have be take to another periscope through which they see a space cover with english dead there be perhaps two hundred man in khaki lie there they say some hang across the barbed-wire entanglement at the very foot of the german trench just as they have be throw back in the attack which have succeed at neuve chapelle several englishman have get clear into the german trench before they be kill here be another example of the curious localness of this dug-in warfare that one could pass within a yard or two of such a battle-field and not know even that it be there by another communication trench we return to the little house the sun be low by this time and the line of figure walk down the-road toward the automobile in its full light perhaps the glass of some british lookout pick we up -- at any rate the whisper of bullet become uncomfortably frequent and near and we have just get to the motor when -- tssee -- ee -- rr bong a shell crash into the church of la bassée only three hundred yard in front of we before ours have start another fly on a lower trajectory it seem shriek over we head and burst beside the road so close to the first motor that it throw mud into it apparently we be both observe and seek after and as the range of these main highway up and down which troops and munitions pass be perfectly know there be a rather uncomfortable few minute ere we have whirl through la bassée with the woman watch from they door -- no racing motor for they to run away in -- and down the tree-arched road to ordinary life again no not exactly ordinary though we ourselves go back to a comfortable hotel for the big city of lille which have show trolley-car and a certain amount of animation earlier in the day be now at dusk like a city of the dead the chambermaid shrug she shoulder with something about a punition and when ask why they be punish say that some french prisoner have be bring through lille a week or two before and naturally the people shout ` vive la france ' so the military governor as we observe next morning in a proclamation post on the blank wall across the street inform the inhabitant that they apparently do not as yet understand the seriousness of the situation order the city to pay a ` fine of five hundred thousand franc and the citizen for two week to go within door at sundown and not stir abroad before seven next morning another poster warn people that two english aviator have be oblige to come down within the city that they be still at large and that any one who hide they or help they escape would be punish with death in addition to which the commune would be punish too it be through black and silent street therefore that we troop be lead from the hotel in which we be lodge to one in which we dine here everything be warm and light and cheerful enough boyish lieutenant with close-clipped head after the german fashion be tell each other they adventure and here and there be older officer who look as if war have wear they a bit and they have come here to forget for a moment over a bottle of champagne and the talk of some old friend the bread be black and hard but the other food as usual in france with wine plenty and cheap and even some of the round-shelled coppery oyster -- capture somehow in spite of blockade and bombardment -- just up from ostend it be bedtime when we emerge into the black street again to discover with something like surprise a sky full of star and a pale new moon the rest of that civilian tour be very civil indeed -- a sort of loop-the-loop of belgium with scarce a pause for breath you can imagine _ that cosmopolitan menagerie troop next morning up the stone stair of the castle of the count of flander in ghent at noon inspect old lace in bruge and people come home from church the german guard change and the german band playing in the central square at two o'clock lunch in one of the ostend summer hotel now full of german officer at four pause for a tantalizing moment in middelkerk while the german gun we be not allow to see on the edge of the town be bang away at the british at nieuport down the beach next day brussels -- out to waterloo in a cloud of dust -- the congo museum -- the king 's palace at laaken a old servitor with a beard like the tall king leopold 's lead these vandal through it and look unutterable thing -- a word with the civil governor here -- a charming lunch at a barracks there -- in short a wild flight behind the man with the precious auswei we see and sometimes meet a good many german officer in a rather familiar way many of the younger man remind one of we university man at home several of the older man resemble they well-set-up english cousin this seem particularly true of the navy which have acquire a type -- lean keen firm-lipped young man with a sense of humor -- entirely different from the german often see in cafe with no back to he head and a neck overflow he collar particularly interesting be those who call back ` into uniform from responsible position in civil life be attack as if building for all time the appallingly difficult and delicate task of improvise a government for a complex modern state and win the tolerance if not the co-operation of a conquered people confident that they subjection be but for the day we progress everywhere be down a continuous aisle of heel-clicking and salute sometimes when we have to pass through three row of passport examiner between platform and gate these formality seem rather excessive in the grenadier barracks in brussels we have be take through sleeping-room cool storeroom with they beer barrel and loop of sausage -- all make by the regiment -- and be just enter the kitchen when a giant of a man see he superior officer snap stiff as a ramrod and as it be every german subordinate 's duty to do bellow out he meldung -- who and what the man in he room be and that they be go to have meat and noodle soup for dinner no frenchman englishman or american could be teach let alone achieve of he own free will the utter self-forgetfulness with which this vast creature every muscle tense breathing like a race-horse roar or rather explode : herr hauptmann mannschafts-kuche-desten-landwehr - regiment belegt-mit-einem-unter-offizier-und-zehn-mann wir essen heute suppe mit nudeln und fleisch zu befehl he have step down a century and a half from the grenadier of the great frederic and even we host may have smile it be different with the soldier ' salute or the ordinary come to attention which we see repeat score of time a day whatever man might be do however awkward or inconvenient it might be whether any one see they or not they stop short at the sight of these long gray-blue coat and stiffen chin up eye on they superior hand at they side if they be talk they become silent if laugh they face smooth out and into they eye come a expression which when you have see it repeat hundred of time you will not forget it be a look of seriousness self-forgetfulness of almost religious devotion not to the individual but to the idea for which he stand i see a soldier half-dress through a barracks window under which we pass send after he officer who do not even see he that same look the look of a man who have just volunteer to charge the enemy 's trench or who see nothing absurd in say the german fear god and nothing else in the world one seem to see the soul of germany at least of this great time in these man 's eye the belgian soul we do not see much of but there come glimpse of it now and then in antwerp we stop in a little café for a cup of chocolate it be a raw cheerless morning with occasional snowflake whipping by on the damp north wind the street be all but desert and in the room that use to be full of smoke and talk there be only empty table and you could see you breath a man be scrub behind the bar and a pale girl in black come out from behind the cashier 's counter to make we chocolate it be good chocolate as antwerp chocolate be likely to be and as we be get ready to go out again i ask she how thing be she glance around the room and answer that they use to have a good business here but the good time be go -- les beaux jours sont partis two other drift over and ask question about the bombardment she answer politely enough with the air of one to whom it be a old story now -- she have leave on the second day when the building across the way be smash and walk catch ride stumble along with the other thousand have get into holland as to why the city fall so quickly -- she pull she shawl about she shoulder and murmur that there be thing people do not know if they do they do not talk about they and the german -- how be they they have no complaint to make the girl say the german be well behave -- tre correct possibly then -- it be we young italian who put the question -- the belgian would just as soon i do not catch the whole sentence but all at once something flash behind that non-committal cafe proprietress 's mask moi je suis fiere d'etre belge say the girl and as she speak you could see the color slowly burn through she pale face and neck -- she be proud to be a belgian -- they hope that one could keep and there would come a day we could be sure of that -- un jour de revanche but business be business and people who run cafe must as every one know not long indulge in the luxury of personal feeling the officer turn up they fur collar and we button up we coat and she be sit behind the counter the usual little woman in black at the cafe desk as we file out we captain pause as we pass give a stiff little bow from the waist touch he cap gallantly and say : bon jour mademoiselle and the girl nod politely as café proprietress should and murmur blank as the wall in the antwerp street : bon jour monsieur chapter ix the road to constantinople rumanium and bulgarium the express left budapest in the evening all night and all next day roll eastward across the hungarian plain and toward dusk climb up through the cool carpathian pine and over the pass into rumanium vienna and the waltz they still be play there berlin and its iron exaltation slow-rumbling london -- all the west and the war as we have think of it for month be so to speak on the other side of the earth we be on the edge of the east now roll down into the balkan into that tangle of race and revenge out of which the first spark of the war be fling since coffee that morning the lonely train have offer nothing more nourishing than the endless hungarian wheat-field with they row of peasant man and woman work comfortably together and row of plough creep with almost incredible leisure behind black water-buffalo cattle but as we roll down into predeal through the rain there at last in the dim station lamp glitter the brass letter and brown paint of the compagnie internationale des wagon lit -- and something to eat the car of this beneficent institution -- survivor of a europe that once seem divide between tourist and hotel-keeper -- outdash the most dashing war correspondent insinuate themselves wherever civilian be find at all and once aboard you carry you oasis with you as you do in a pullman through we own alkali and sage-brush the steward -lrb- he culture be intensive though it may not extend beyond the telegraph - pole and include the word for food in every dialect between ostend and the golden horn -rrb- have just bring soup and a bottle of thin hungarian claret when the other three chair at my table be take by a rumanian family return from a holiday in budapest -- a urbane gentleman of middle age a shy little daughter and a dark-eyed wife glitter with diamond who look a little like nazimova monsieur be a stranger say the rumanian presently speak in french as rumanian be likely to do and we begin to talk war i ask -- a question the papers have be ask for week -- if rumanium would be draw into it within ten day we shall be in he say and on which side oh he smile against austrium of course that be in April when i come through rumanium three month later soldier be train everywhere in the hot field bucarest be full of officer the papers and cafe still buzz with war talk rumanium be still go in but since the recapture of lemberg and the russian retreat the time be not so sure -- not it seem until after the harvest at any rate i ask the rumanian what he think about italy italy begin as a coquette she will end -- he make the gesture of count money into he hand -- she will end as a cocotte he wave a forefinger in front of he face elle n'est plus vierge he say the wife demur italy be poor and little she must need coquette after all il faut vivre -- one must live something be say of america and the feeling there and the wife announce that she would like of all thing to see america but -- she do not wish to go there with she husband i suggest that she come with I -- a endeavor to rise to the rumanian mood which be receive with tolerant urbanity by she husband and by the lady who look like nazimova with very cheer expression of assent when you return from constantinople she flash back as they leave the table do not forget these be the first rumanian i have meet they be amiable they speak french -- it almost seem as if they have hear the tale that be usually tell of they little capital and be try to play the appropriate introduction to bucarest here it be this little nation only a trifle larger than the state of pennsylvanium a half-latin island in a ocean of magyar and slav on the north be russium on the south the grave and stubborn bulgar -lrb- slav at any rate in speech -rrb- on the west hungary and here between the carpathian and the black sea this frenchified remnant of the empire of ancient rome they speech when it be not french be full of latin echo and a rumanian however mixed he blood be as fond of think himself a lineal and literal descendant of the roman colonist as a new englander be of ancestor in the mayflower at the alhambra in bucarest next evening after the cosmopolite artiste have do then-perfunctory turn and return to they street clothes and the audience to begin the more serious business of the evening the movie man in the gallery throw on the screen -- no not some military hero nor the beautiful queen whose photograph you will remember but the head of the roman emperor trajan and the listless crowd drowse cynically in its tobacco smoke break into obedient applause just as they would at home at the sight of the flag or a picture of the president bucarest like all the capital of spanish america be another little pari but the rumanian possibly because unhamper by sombre spanish tradition or perhaps any tradition at all succeed more completely in borrow the vice and escape the virtue of the great capital they be suppose to imitate it would be more to the point to call bucarest a little bueno aire there be much the same showiness a similar curious mixture of crudeness and luxury but bueno aire be one of the world 's great city and always just beyond the asphalt you can somehow feel the pampa and its endless cattle and wheat the rumanian capital be a town of some three hundred thousand people in a country you could lose in the argentine and there be nothing comparatively speak to offset its light-mindedness to suggest reality behind all this life of patisserie you should see the calea vittorei on one of these warm summer evening between five and eight it be a narrow strip of asphalt wind through the center of the town with a tree-shaded drive at one end and the hotel sidewalk cafe and fashionable shop at the other and up and down this narrow street in motor in open victoria drive by russian coachman in dark-blue velvet gown reach to they heel all bucarest crowd to gossip flirt and see down the center in the open carriage flow a stream of woman -- and many look like nazimova -- social distinction so iron out with enamel paint and powder that almost all might be café chantant singer or dressmaker ' marionette some city have eagle on they crest and some volcano if you be go to design a postage-stamp for bucarest it strike I that the natural thing would be a woman in the corner of a open victorium -- after see score of they all alike you feel as though you could do it in a minute : one slash line for the hat two coal-black hole and a dash of carmine in a patch of marble white and a pair of silk-covered ankle cross and point in a way that seem parisian enough after one have become use to the curious box in which woman enclose they foot in berlin come up from bulgarium which be not unlike come from idaho or montana or from turkey where woman as something to be see of man in public do not exist or even across from the simple plain of hungary these enamelled orchid flow forever down the asphalt seem at the moment to sum up the place -- they be bucarest officer in light blue in mauve and maroon -- mince butterfly who look as if a hour 's march in the sun would send they to the hospital ogle they from the sidewalk along with they be many young blood out of uniform barbered and powdered like chorus man make up for they work you will see few young man in europe with whom the notion of general conscription and the horror of war can be associate with less regret stream of more frugal nymph without victoria but with the same rakish air push along with the sidewalk crowd hat pin like a wafer over one ear coiffure draw trimly up from powdered neck waiter scurry about the café table crowd in these day with politician amateur diplomat spy ammunition agent heaven know what push out on the sidewalk the people on the sidewalk be crowd into the street motor honk hoof clatter the air be fill with automobile smoke the smoke carry the smell of cigarette and coffee and woman 's perfume -- it be bucarest joyeux some french music-hall singer -- when i come through it be miss nita-jo -- will tell you all about it at one of the open-air theater in the evening all about the people you bump into in this sunset promenade -- des gens d'la haute des petits crevés des snobs des sportsmans des coquet les noctambules les vieux noceurs les grandes cocotte -- oui tous en choeur -- all about capsa 's which though but a little pastry shop and tea-room be as seriously regard in bucarest as delmonico 's or the blackstone which be of course with dreadful seriousness -lrb- to see one of the gilded youth of bucarest enter capsa 's at five-thirty solemnly devour a large chocolate eclair and as solemnly stalk out again be a experience itself -rrb- and all about the politician and the man who be run thing everything be in miniature you see in a little nation like this which although only as large as one of we smaller state have a king and court diplomat and army and foreign policy all in the family so to speak and the chanteuse will sing amusing verse about the prime minister as if she really know what he be go to do and curiously enough -- for thing be sometimes very much in the family indeed in these little capital -- maybe she do know of course the calea vittorei be not rumania though a good deal more so than fifth avenue be america nor be the officer pose there those who would have much to do with direct the army if rumanium go to war ten minute away from the city limit and you might be ride through the richest farming country in wisconsin or illinoi : hour after hour of corn and wheat orchard hop and vineyard cultivate by peasant who though most of they have no land and little education at least look care-free and dress themselves in exceedingly please homespun linen hand-embroidered clothes then higher land and hill as thick with the tower of oil-well as western pennsylvanium and just before you cross into hungary the cool pine of the carpathian and the villa of sinaium the summer home of the court the diplomat and the people one do not see very often perhaps in the afternoon parade it be a pleasant and a rich little country you can easily understand why its ruling class should love it and set apart from they slav and magyar neighbor by speech and temperament want to gather all rumanian under one flag and push that too into its place in the sun and this of course be rumanium 's time -- the time of all these little balkan nation which have be bully and flatter in turn by the power that need they now and cut up and trade about like so much small change rumanium want the province of bessarabium on she eastern border a strip of which russium once take away she want the austrian province of bukowina and the hungarian banat of temesvar on the west but most of all the pine forest and the people of transylvanium just over the divide -- you cross it come from budapest -- largely rumanian in speech and sympathy though a province of hungary as the rumanian figure it out they once stand astride the carpathian -- a cheval -lrb- on horseback -rrb- as they say -- and so they feel they must and should stand now we be a nation of fourteen million soul -- six less than hungary but a homogeneous state solidly base we soil give we mineral and fuel and almost suffice for we need we people be one of the most prolific in the world and certainly not the least intelligent we have behind we a continuity of national existence lack in other nation in this quarter of the globe in we modern epoch we have assimilate french culture with indisputable success and have give in every field proof of a great faculty of adaptability and progress we can become the most important second-class power in europe the day after the war stop in fifty year when we population will have pass twenty-five million a great power we shall be a nation content with we lot and for that reason a factor for peace a greater rumanium respond not only to we idea but to the interest of europe the magyar have have every chance and they have lose it be now we turn this be a characteristic editorial paragraph from la roumanie which be the voice of mr take ionesco who more than anybody else be the voice of those who want war once in the government but at the moment out of it mr ionesco keep up a continuous bombardment of editorial and speech and with his-vigor verve and facility remind one a bit though a younger man of clemenceau and he l'homme enchainé rich well-informed daring and clever with a really fascinating gift of expression he will talk to you in french english -lrb- he wife be english -rrb- rumanian -- i do not know how many other language -- about anything you wish always with the air of one who know we have no such adventurous statesman or statesmen-adventurer at home -- man who have all the wire of european diplomacy at they finger end look at people include they own in the aggregate without any worry over the folk at home know what they want much better than they do and to get it for they be quite ready to send a few hundred thousand to they death mr ionesco write a long double-leaded editorial every day and very often he print with it the speech or speech he make the night before in a time like this he say those of he way of think can not say too much they must be like the french academician who never stop write now and then in the interval of fan the spark of war he take he reader behind the scene of european politics of which he know about as much perhaps as any one i arrive in paris the 31st of December 1912 in the evening m poincaré receive I the 1st of January at half past eight o'clock in the morning -- a absurd hour in pari but i have to go to london in the afternoon and m poincaré to the elysee at ten o'clock for the felicitation of the new year i ask m poincaré for the support of france in we difficulty with bulgarium m poincaré say i say and later event prove that i be right he be always sure of himself like this -- no doubt no half-truth everything clear and irresistible i go to see mr ionesco one evening in bucarest -- a porte-cochere opening into a big stone city house a anteroom with a political secretary and several lieutenant and presently a quiet richly furnished library and mr ionesco himself a polished gentleman of continental type full of animation and sophisticated charm bow from behind a heavy library table the room the man the facile syllogistic sentence in which it be establish that austria-hungary be already moribund that germany could never win that rumanium must go in with the entente -- it be like the first scene from some play of european society and politics : one of those smooth hard swiftly move thing the parisian bernstein might have write across it i could not help see the berlin i have just leave and people stand in line with they sandwich at six o'clock to get into the opera or theater -- the live human being behind that abstraction germany and i say that it seem unfortunate that two people with so many apparent grounds of contact as the german and french must so misunderstand each other they temperament and culture be different to be sure but they be both idealistic sentimental people to whom thing of the mind and spirit be important it seem particularly unfortunate that everything should be do to force they apart instead of bring they together mr ionesco listen with some impatience unfortunate no doubt but what do you wish war itself be unfortunate -- we must take the world as it be no they be with france and down with the german france conquer mean the end of rumanium subservience to austria france victorious freedom fresh air he give I a copy of a speech in which he gladly admit that he be a responsible factor people talk of go slow and spare blood well they might get something by sit still even become a great country but they could never become a great nation it be not territory and population they want but the sword of rumanium to join in remake the map of europe when the delegate gather around the green table they do not want the one from rumanium as he be at the congress of berlin only able to make visit to chancellery he must go in the same door with they and say : in proportion to my population i have shed as much blood as you he have always regret not have child never so much as to-day but if he have a dozen son and know that all of they would fall in the war he would not be cast down even if the territory they wish could be occupy by a simple act of gendarmerie -- he would say no -- they must enter budapest itself -lrb- it be only twenty-four hour ' railway journey from bucarest -rrb- -- not till then would austria admit rumanium 's superiority people accuse he of work for himself who be take ionesco in comparison with the fate of a race as for ambition well he have one and only one -- he want to see the rumanian tricolor float from buda palace and before he die to know the moment in which he could pass before he eye the eighteen hundred year of rumanian history from the arrival of trajan at severin to the entry of ferdinand at budapest and cry : now lord let thy servant go in peace for mine eye have see the saving of my race the rumanian tricolor be no nearer buda palace when i return several month later but mr ionesco be no less hot for war even if germany win he say they still should go in because they would at least keep they own and germany 's respect go to war -- the phrase be inexact we have be at war for eleven month only other be firing at we but we be not firing at they we be in a war that will decide we existence but the soldier die to defend we rights instead of be we soldier be soldier of the ally the ally will win but if any one think that have win without we they will have win for we he must be mad they victory without we may preserve we material life but it will never save we moral life nor that of future generation mr ionesco and those who agree with he belong it will be observe with the romanticist -- they be for the bright face of danger great stake and win or lose put all to the touch those who do not agree with they be man without soul haggler and trader as if a nation could figure out the number of cannon-shot and prisoner and go where the go 's good it make interesting reading as you sit at one of the café table with the crowd flow by and the five-o'clock papers come fresh from the press the other side -- and it include the king and most of the government inasmuch as rumanium have not yet go to war -- have the more difficult task of make caution interesting in they editorial and speech ionesco and he follower be jingo try to drive the nation to a rumanian sedan a people be great not only for its number of soldier but for its civilization its artist and intellectual a nation militarize be mark for eternal death for a people life by its thought and not by force there be a amusing retort the afternoon i return to bucarest to one of the fire-eating retired general picture the quaint old fellow as think that people be bear only to die bravely and know nothing of rumanium 's rule as the defender of latinism in the balkan toot the funereal flute and show we the mountain -- there be to be you tomb there be a time when the russian be take przemysl when rumanium 's tide seem to be at the flood -- if ever it be go to be that chance be lose and rumanium find herself stand squarely in the track of the stream of ammunition which use to flow down from duesseldorf to the turk -- when i be at the front with the turk practically all the ammunition box i saw and there be hundred of they be marked gut uber rumanien -- and later in russium 's path to bulgarium and servium one of these day a hot thrill might run down the calea vittorei and all at once capsa 's and the other little booth in this miniature vanity fair would seem strange and far-away but until that day one could fancy the romanticist and realist lambast each other in the papers the soldier grind away in they dusty camp the pretty lady roll gayly down the sprinkle asphalt and the chanteuse singing over the footlights : que pense le premier ministre on n'sait pa -- -lrb- what think the prime minister nobody know -- -rrb- be he for the german have he make a convention with perfidious albion nobody know the gate to constantinople only the danube separate rumanium from bulgarium yet the people -- of the two capital at least -- be as different as the french and scotch the train leave bucarest after breakfast you be ferry over the river at rustchuk at noon and after trail over the shoulder of long rolling plateau be up in the mountain in sofium that evening the change be almost as sharp as that between ostend and folkestone you leave french or the half-latin rumanian language for a slavic speech and the cyrillic or russian alphabet name end in sco or ano -lrb- ionesco filipesco bratiano -rrb- for name end in off -lrb- radoslavoff malinoff ghenadieff antinoff and the like -rrb- and all the show and vivacity the cafe and cocotte of bucarest for a clean little mountain capital as determine and serious as some new town out west it seem though of course such impression be mostly chance that the difference begin at the border in rumanium at the hungarian border they take away my passport which in time like these be like take away one 's clothes and though i assure the custom inspector that i be on my way to constantinople and in a hurry it require four day ' wait in bucarest and innumerable visit to the police before the paper be return every one apparently on the train have the same experience -- the austrian drummer look wise and muttered baksheesh and in bucarest a evil-eyed hotel porter keep pull I into corner say that this taking of passport be a regular commerce and that for five franc he would have it back again there be a popular legend that the clerk in bucarest hotel be suppose to offer incoming guest all the choice of a mohammedan paradise and the occasional misogynist who prefer a room to himself be receive with sympathy and the wish politely express that monsieur will soon be himself again my own experience be less ornate but price be absurdly high the waiter 's check frequently need revision and one have a vague but more or less continual sense of swimming among shark these symptom be absent in bulgarium the border official seem sensible man who would listen to reason the porter coachman waiter and the like crude rather than cleverly depraved and the air of sofium clear and clean in more sens than one modern bulgarium be only a couple of generation old and though all this part of the world have be invade and reinvade and fight over since the beginning of thing the little kingdom -lrb- it seem more like a republic -rrb- have the air of a new country the aristocracy have be wipe out before bulgarium get she autonomy in 1878 and unlike rumanium where the greater portion of the land be in the hand of large proprietor bulgarium be a country of small farmer of shepherd peasant each with he little piece of land the man who now direct its fortune be the son and grandson of very simple people possibly it be because we american be also a new people with still some of the prejudice of pioneer that we be likely to feel something in common with the people of this peasant state they seem to I at any rate the most american of the balkan people there be of course one concrete reason for this : robert college and the american school for girl -lrb- constantinople college -rrb- at constantinople it be man educate at robert college who become the leader of modern bulgarium the only bulgarian i have know before -- i meet he on the steamer -- have go from a little village near sofium to harvard he married sister have learn english at the american school for girl she husband a macedonian bulgar have work he way through yale the amiable old general who be always in the library at the sofium club at tea time ready to tell how the dardanelle and constantinople could be take have learn english at robert college and have a son there the photographer who develop my film also have a son there -- and so on snow-capped mountain rise just behind sofium and the brown hill thereabout like the rolling plateau along the shoulder of which the train crawl on the way down from rumanium be speckled with sheep sometimes even in sofia you will meet a shepherd patiently urge he little flock up a modern concrete sidewalk and stop now and then for some passer-by to pick up a lamb heft it poke it and feel its wool before decide whether or not he should take it home for dinner these shepherd wear roomy short box-coat of sheepskin with the leather outside and the wool turn in like a motor-coat homespun breeches embroider very likely in blue and lace from the knee down and a sort of moccasin or lace soft shoe they be as common in the street of sofium as be the over-barbered young snipe in the street of bucarest on market day the main down-town street be fill with they -- long-limbed slow-moving old fellow with eye and forehead wrinkle from year of squint in the bright plateau sun face bronze and weather like a old farmhouse shuffling down the pavement and into and out of shop with the slow soft-footed gait of so many elk and if you be design a stamp for bulgarium you might well put one of these hard-headed old countryman on it just as in the other capital you would put the girl in the victorium patter down the asphalt two newspaper correspondent of the more or less continuous string that be file from one bulgarian leader to another to find out what bulgarium be go to do amiably permit I to trail about with they and thus to see and talk a little with some of those who be steer bulgarium 's exceedingly delicate course -- man whose grandfather very likely wear those sheepskin coat with the wool turn in none have the peculiar verve and dash of take ionesco but one or two be decidedly smooth in a grave slightly heavy way and all suggest stubbornness intense patriotism and a keen eye for the main chance there be little society or formal entertaining in sofium little display and little apparently of that state of mind which in bucarest be suggest by the handsome two-horse public carriage at a time when there be not enough horse and carriage to go round one-horse carriage be impracticable because the rumanian or at least the bucareiio think one horse beneath he dignity while a trolley - car -- although there be trolley-car -- be of course not to be think of people on the street and in the park be nice-looking rather than smart and the young officer from the military school who be everywhere as fine and soldier-like young man as i have see anywhere in europe they and the common soldier with they fine shoulder and chest and wiry torso look as though they be make for they work and take to it like duck to water the palace be on the central square -- a unpretentious building in the tree with a driveway lead up from two gate at which stand two motionless sentry each with one stiff feather in he cap it be such a entrance as you might expect to find at any comfortable country place at home and one day when some student volunteer go by on a practice march and cheer as they pass i see the king with the queen and one or two other stroll down the drive and bow just as if he too be some comfortable country gentleman there be a music-hall in sofium but on the two night i go to it there be scarce twenty in the audience there be various beer garden with music and of course move picture but it be interesting in contrast with bucarest to find the crowd go to the national theater to see tolstous 's living corpse the stock company moderately subsidize by the government give drama and opera on alternate night i barely get a seat for the tolstous play and the doorkeeper say that the house be always sell out the bulgarian in short be simple and what the rumanian would call serieux -- you must abandon all notion of finding here anything like the little comic-opera kingdom invent by some of we novelist it be in bulgarium as i recall it that mr shaw put arm and the man and the fun lay as you will remember in the contrast between the outworn feudal notion of the native and the intense matter-of-factness of the modern swiss professional soldier you will recall the doubt of the heroine 's male relative as to whether bluntschlus be good enough for she they ingenuous attempt to impress he by describe the style in which she be accustom to live and he unimpressed response that he father have so and so many table-cloth so many horse so many hundred of plate etc who be he then -- king of he country oh no indeed -- he run a hotel mr shaw 's fun be all right of itself but have about as much application to bulgarium or sofium as to wyoming or denver by one of those frequently fascinating chance of geography this little nation which have a territory about as big as ohio be set squarely in front of the main gate to constantinople and saw in consequence the power which ruthlessly bully it yesterday now almost at its foot rumanium stand in russium 's path on the one hand and with its railway in germany 's on the other but bulgarium do both and in addition block the whole western frontier of turkey and the only feasible chance to land a army from the aegean after they disastrous attempt to run the dardanelle in march the english and french have be somewhat in the position of a army try to capture jacksonville florida for instance and instead of march over from georgium compel to go away down to key west and fight they way up through the everglade they have in front of they hill behind hill and a intrenched enemy whom they could not see generally and who could always see they behind they be only a strip of beach the sea and the more or less uncertain support of they ship so narrow be they foothold that even if they have have more man they could scarce find place to use they could they but land in bulgarium they might cut off the turk from europe at once accumulate at they leisure a sufficient force and push down methodically from a proper base to the chatalja line fight like man instead of amphibious duck the thing look easy and the twisted hill and hidden battery of gal-lipoli peninsula be so heart-breaking a maze to fling good man into that you can well imagine the ally use what pressure they could but if it be important to they that the gate be open -- let alone that bulgarium come in herself -- it be just as important to the german and austrian that it be close and who be to say that if bulgarium throw in she lot with the ally and attack the turk the central power might not even start a grand offensive down through serbium -- and people talk of this in sofium month before it actually begin -- connect up they line all the way to constantinople -- and good-by to they little peasant state and she hard-won independence a little state must think of these thing she have not the man nor the staggering supply of ammunition lightly to go into a world war like this and then the bulgarian have have they finger burn once -- they be not look for adventure you will remember the balkan war of 1912-3 and how the bulgar fight they way down almost to constantinople and be everybody 's hero for a time then come the quarrel between the balkan ally and presently bulgarium be fight for she life -- serbium on the west greece on the south turkey on the east -- and then when she be quite helpless the rumanian come down from the north to perform the coup de grace it be not a particularly sport performance on the part of the rumanian nor could the turn over to they of the bulgarian part of the province of dobrudja greatly increase bulgarium 's trust in the power which permit it in the treaty of bucarest it be we own fault a englishman say to I speak somewhat sardonically of the failure of the rumanian to go in with italy in spite of have accept a timely loan from england we put we money on the wrong horse no they 'll keep on talk -- they be the chap who want to get something for nothing think of the treaty of bucarest and the way we pat rumanium on the back -- she be the gendarme of europe then ` gendarme of europe ' i tell you that any army that would do what the rumanian do to bulgarium have something wrong with its gut a army go where it be order of course but it be true nevertheless that the bulgarian be likely to think of they neighbor on the north as people who want to get something for nothing and that they who have bear the brunt of the war with turkey lose everything they have gain the turk drive from europe calmly move back to adrianople rumanium take the whole of dobrudja bulgarian macedonium go to serbium and greece however much bulgarium may have be to blame for the break-up of the balkan league -- and she be stubborn and headstrong to say the least -- there be no deny that the treaty of bucarest do not give she a square deal it be one of those treaty of peace -lrb- and you might think that the man who sit around the green table and make such treaty would learn it after a time -rrb- that be really treaty of war no bulgarium be not look for adventure nor accept promise unless she have security that they would be carry out you could not talk to any intelligent bulgarian five minute without feel the bitterness leave by the treaty of bucarest and the fix idea that bulgarian macedonium must come under the flag again but though this be true and the army mobilize and on a fine day every other man on the street of sofia a officer the stubborn bulgar be still sit tight if they get what they want without fight for it they be not anxious to throw away another generation of young man as they have throw they away for nothing in the balkan war by this negative policy -- the pressure that be to say of not go to war -- bulgarium have induce turkey by the time i come through sofium again three month later to turn over enough territory on the east so that the bulgar could own the railroad down to dedeagatch and reach the aegean without be oblige to go into turkey and out again it even seem that bulgarium might be able to keep she neutrality to the end she compromise with turkey be not so odd as it seem to many at first she have fight the turk to be sure but now get what she want and when you come to think of it it might well be more comfortable from the bulgar ' point of view to have the invalid ottoman in constantinople than the healthy and hungry russian both these small state in they present hope fear and danger be a instructive spectacle to those who fancy that in the crowded arena of europe a little nation can always do as it want to or that its neutrality be always the simple open-and-shut matter it look to be for instance in the first week of August 1914 we be likely at home to look on all this cold-blooded weigh of the chance of war with little patience to think of all these aspiration as merely somebody else 's land fear or envy of we neighbor international hatred be almost unknown with we all that be leave behind three thousand mile away and the green water in between permit we to indulge in the rare luxury of altruism yet these hatred these fear and ambition inherit and carefully nourish be just as real -- particularly in little state like these -- as the fact odd and apparently unreasonable as it may be that in a bit of country which might be include in one of we larger state one lot of people should speak french and think like latin and another speak slavic and think another way and that neither want to be absorb by the other any more than we want to be compel to speak spanish or be absorb by the mexican the aspiration of both these little country have reality behind they it be a fact that one get a whiff of french clarity and verve in rumanium though it come from a small minority educate in france and the rumanian people may be no more latin than we be and it be a interesting notion -- though perhaps only a notion -- that rumanium should be the outpost or rear-guard of latinism in this part of the world a bit of the restless west on the edge of the orient for virility and earnestness like that of the bulgar there be a place not only in the balkan but everywhere the quality they have show in they short life as a independent nation be those which deserve to be encourage and preserve and if it be true that this war be be fight to establish the right of little nation to live one of the task it ought to accomplish it seem then be to give the bulgar back at least part of what be take from they chapter x the adventure of the fifty hostage gallipolus lie by the sea of marmora and look out across it to the green hill of asia just where the blue marmora narrow into the dardanelle it be one of those crowd little turkish town set on a blaze hillside -- tangled street unpainted gray weather-warped frame house with overhang latticed window and roof of red tile little walled-in garden with dark cedar or cypress and a few dusty rose fountain with turkish inscription where the street fork and woman come to fill they water-jar -- a dreamy smelly sun-drenched little town drowse on as it have drowse for hundred of year nothing ever happen in gallipolus -- i speak as if the war have not happen the graceful greek sloop with they belly sail and turned-up stem and stern come sailing in much as they must have come when the persian instead of the english and the french be batter away at the hellespont the grave long-nosed old turk pull at they bubble pipe and sip they little cup of sweet black coffee the camel train dusty and tinkling come wind down the narrow street from the thracian wheat country and go back with oversea merchandise do up in fade carpet and box of standard oil the wind blow from the north and it be cold and the marmora gray it blow from the south and all at once the world be warm and sea and sky be blue -- so soft so blue so alive with lift radiance that one do not wonder the turk be content with a cup of coffee and a view nothing ever happen in gallipolus -- then the war come and everything happen at once it be a still may morning a Sunday morning when the english and french send some of they ship up into the gulf of saro on the aegean side of the peninsula over behind gallipolus eight or ten mile of roll country shut away the aegean and make people feel safe enough they might have be in the other war which have touch gallipolus but a few mile of country be nothing at all to the gun of a modern battleship a observation-balloon look up over the western horizon there be a sudden thunder and all at once the sky above gallipolus rain scream shell and death you can imagine -- at any rate remember antwerp i could very well imagine -- how that hurricane of fire sweeping in without warn from people know not where must have seem like the end of the world you can imagine the people -- old man with turban undo veil woman cry baby -- tumble out of the little bird-cage house and down the narrow street off go the minaret as you would knock off a icicle from the mosque on the hill the mosque by the water-front go down in a cloud of dust and up from the dust from a petrol shell shoot a geyser of fire stone come rumble down from the old square tower which have stand since the day of bayazid the fade gray house squashed like egg it be all over in a hour -- some say even twenty minute -- but that be long enough to empty gallipolus to kill some sixty or seventy people and drive the rest into the cave under the cliff by the water or across the marmora to lapsaki now while the bombardment of gallipolus may not appear from a merely human point of view a particularly sport performance yet as most of those kill be soldier as gallipolus have be a staff head-quarter not long before and always have be a natural base for the defense of the dardanelle the attack be doubtless justified by the rule of war it happen however that people who live in defenseless bombard town be never interested in the rule of war so a new and particularly disturbing rumor go fly through the crowded street of constantinople it be a city of rumor this beautiful bewildering bagdad of the west where all the race of the world jostle each other in the narrow street and you never know how the man who brush past you live -- let alone feel and think the constantinople trolley-car be divide by a curtain on one side of which sit the man on the other the veil woman when there be several woman the conductor slide the curtain along so that half the car be a harem when there be none he slide it back and there be no harem at all and life be like that you be at once in a modern commercial city and a ancient mohammedan capital and never know when the one will fade out like a picture on a screen and leave you in the orient face its mystery its fatalism its vengeance that come in a night you can imagine what it must become walled in with war and censorship with the english and french bang away at the dardanelle gate to the south the russian bear growl at the door of the bosporus so close that you can every now and then hear the rumble of cannon above the din of constantinople -- just as you might hear they in madison square if a enemy be bombard the fort at sandy hook you wake up one morning to hear that all the influential armenian have be gather up and ship to the interior you go down to the ordinary-looking hotel breakfast-room and the three german take coffee in the corner stop talk at once at lunch some one stoop to whisper to the man across the table there be a moment 's silence until the waiter have go and the man across the table mutter : the g v say not to worry -- g v mean grand vizier to-morrow the goeben be to be blow up or there will be a revolution or a massacre -- heaven know what into a atmosphere like this with wound pour back in thousand from the dardanelle there come the news of the bombardment of gallipolus and with it go the rumor of reprisal -- all the english and french left behind in constantinople and there be a good many who have be permit to go about they business more or less as usual be to be collect man woman and child take down to the peninsula and distribute in the unfortified town the american ambassador would notify england and france through washington and if then the ally choose to bombard theirs be the risk the american ambassador mr morgenthau set about to see what could be do presently the word go round that the woman might stay behind but the man high and low must go they come flock to the embassy already besought for week by french sister of mercy and armenian in distress some beg for a chance to escape some ready to go anywhere as they share of the war the turk be finally induce to include only those between twenty and forty and at the last moment this be cut to a even fifty -- twenty-five british subject twenty-five french the plan eliminate naturally the better-known remnant of the french and english colony and disappoint the chief of police who have not unreasonably hope as he wistfully put it to have some notable of the fifty probably not more than a dozen have be bear in england or france the other be native of malta greece -- the usual levantine yet if these young bank clerk and tradesman be not important accord to newspaper standard they be presumably important to themselves they be very important indeed to the wife and mother and sister who fight up to the galata sea wall that Thursday morning weep and wail and wave they wet handkerchief through the iron fence the hostage one or two of whom have be call to they door during the night and march away without time to take anything with they have be put aboard a police boat about the size of a new york revenue cutter and herd below in two little cabin with ten fierce-looking constantinople policeman in gray astrakhan cap to guard they it be from the water-line port-hole of these cabin that they wave they farewell with they be a sturdy bearded man in black knickerbockers and clerical hat the rector of the crimean chapel in constantinople -- a cambridge and church of england man and a one-time dweller in the wild of kurdistan who though not call have volunteer to go the first secretary of the american embassy mr hoffman philip a adventurous humanitarian whose experience include a english university the rough rider and service as american minister to abyssinium also volunteer not of course as hostage but as friendly assistant both to the turkish authority and to they prisoner to he be give the little deck-cabin large enough for a man to stretch out on the seat which run round it here also the clergyman volunteer be presently permit and here too thanks to passport vouch-safe by the chief of police the chronicler of the expedition mr suydam of the brooklyn eagle and myself the passport mysterious scratch in turkish do not arrive until the last minute and with they come the chief the great bedrus bey himself -- a strong man and a mysterious one pale inscrutable with dark brooding eye and velvety manners calculate to envelop even a cup of coffee and a couple of boil egg in a air of sinister romance the chief regret that the craft be not a serious passenger boat for we should probably have to spend the night aboard arrangement for the hostage and ourselves would be make at gallipolus though just what they would be it be difficult to say as there be he say no hotel in the place and the house be all destroy with this cheerful prospect he bid we farewell and all be ready we wait two hour and finally just before noon with deck-hand hang life belt along the rail to be ready for possible english submarine churn through the crowded shipping of the golden horn round stamboul and out into the blue marmora the difficulty of the next few day -- for which most of the hostage city-bred and use to the bake-shop round the corner be unprepared -- promptly present themselves lunch-time come but there be no lunch there be not even bread philip and suydam have tin thing and the former some cake which by tea-time that afternoon -- so appallingly soon do the spoil child of town get down to fundamental -- seem a almost immoral luxury but the luckless fifty already unstrung by the worry of the last forty-eight hour feed on salt sea air and it be not until sundown that one of the british come to ask what should be do philip dig into he corned beef and what be leave of the bread and so we curl up for the night the hostage and policeman below the rest of we in the deck-house roll up in all the blanket we have for one of the black sea wind be blow down the marmora and it be as cold as November the launch come up to gallipolus wharf in the night and not long after daylight we be shake out of we blanket to receive the call of the mutessarif or local governor a big slow saturnine man in semi-riding-clothes with the red fez and a riding-whip in he hand who speak only turkish and limited himself to few word of that he be accompany by a sort of secretary or political director -- a plump little man with glass and a vague slightly smile preoccupy manner who act as interpreter the governor and philip be address as excellence the secretary as monsieur le directeur and consider that all concerned be only half awake and we only half dress the interview which include the exchange of cigarette and many salute be extremely polite we join the mutessarif and he secretary in a stroll about the town it be desert -- close shutter empty house and shop not so much as the chance to buy a round flat loaf of black bread -- a shell of a town with a few ravenous cat prowl about and forget chicken peck the bare cobblestone we see the shell hole in the little mohammedan cemetery where four people come to visit the tomb of they father have be kill the smash mosque yawn house-front and dangling rafter and there come over one a indescribable irony as one listen in this eastern world of blaze sun blue sky and blue water to the same grievance and indignation one have read in london editorial and hear in the beet-field of flander month ago the mutessarif take we to a little white villa on the cliff by the sea with a walled garden flat black cedar and a view of the marmora and we breakfast on tea bread and butter and egg meanwhile the hostage have be march to a empty frame house on the beach from the upper window of which while gendarme guard the street-door they be gloomily peer when we return to the launch philip uneasy at the emptiness of the town and leisurely fashion in which thing be likely to move start for lapsakus across the marmora for food and blanket and suydam and i stroll about the town we have go but a few step when we observe a aimless-looking individual in fez and civilian clothes follow we we tramp up-hill twist through several of the hot little alley-like street -- he follow like we shadow we lead he all over town he toiling devotedly behind and when we return to the beach he sit himself down on a wood-pile behind we as might some dismal buzzard await we demise he or some of he fellow sleuth stick to we all that day once for exercise i walk briskly out to the edge of the town and back again the shadow toddle after i go up to the basin beside the ruin mosque a sort of sea-water plaza for the town and take a stool outside a little cafe which have awaken since morning take coffee the shadow blandly take coffee also which he consume silently as we have no common tongue rise as i rise and follow I back to the beach out in the marmora which be but little wider here than the hudson at tappan zee transport cram with soldier go steam slowly southward a black destroyer on the lookout for submarine hug they flank and break trail ahead of they over the hill to the south toward maido and the dardanelle roll the distant thunder -- the cannon the hapless fifty look out of they house on the beach have be send down to stop -- and all about we in the dazzling turkish sunshine be soldier and supply-train landing disembark push toward the front fine-looking man they be too these infantry-men bronzed well-built fellow with heavy high cheek-bone longish nose black mustach and dark eye who whatever they quality of initiative might be look to have no end of endurance and ability to stay put bullock-cart drag by big black buffalo cattle carry they head far back as if they big horn be too heavy for they crowd the street lead to the quay and camel string in group of five come swing in or kneel in the dust wave they long bird-like neck and lift up a mournful bellow as if protest in a bored oriental way at a fate which compel they to bear burden for the nagging race of man it be to a accompaniment of these howl that a young turkish officer come over to find out who these stranger might be we speak of the hostage and he at once say that it be a excellent idea the english and french be very cruel -- if now they choose to bombard if a man throw a penny into the sea he say he lose the penny it be not the pocket-book that be hurt i do not quite grasp this proverb but remark that after all they be civilian and have do nothing that be true he say but the english and french have be very unjust to we civilian they force we to another injustice -- c'est la guerre toward the end of the afternoon the hostage closely guard be march up into the town and lodge in two empty house -- literally empty for there be neither bed nor blanket chair nor table -- nothing but the four wall a few have bring mattress and blanket but the greater number city-bred young fellow unused to look after themselves out of door have only the clothes they stand in the north wind hold directly the sun go down it be cold again and only half feed with the provision philip bring over from lapsakus they spend a dismal night ' huddle on the bare floor under they suitcase or whatever they could get to cover they and expect another bombardment at dawn we on the contrary -- that be to say philip and he two guest -- be take to a furnished house over-look the marmora -- the house as it presently appear from the picture of waterloo on the wall and the english novel in a bookcase up-stair lately occupy by the british consular agent to he excellency a room to himself up-stair with a real bed be give the historian be make perhaps even more comfortable on mattress on the dining-room floor we be all sleepy enough to drop on they at once but another diplomatic dinner have be plan it appear and turkish politeness can no more be hurry nor overcome than can that curious impassive resistance which a turk can maintain against something he do not wish do it be nine o'clock before we sit down with the mutessarif he secretary and the voluble journalist to a whole roast kid a rather terrifying but exceedingly palatable dish stuff with nut rice and currant and accompany by some of the wine of lapsaki rice pudding and a huge bowl of raw egg which be eat by crack the shell elevate one 's head and toss they down like oyster the dinner be serve by one dimitrus a brawny slow-moving greek dimitrus be dress in a home-spun braid jacket and homespun turkish trousers shape like baggy riding-breeches and he complete impenetrability to new idea be only equal by the solemnity and touch willingness with which he receive they it be after he have serve we in the ignoble capacity of dish-washer and burden-carrier for several day that we be inform one evening by the governor 's secretary in he vague way that dimitrus be a architect architecte naturel suggest the urbane philip and the governor 's secretary assent slow dimitrus might be but once he grasp a idea no power could drag it from he when one ask he where he learn to build house of a certain style he always reply that so they be build by pappadopoulo -- pappadopoulo be dead these twenty or thirty year dimitri the secretary venture have be architect of the mosque on the water-front and when he find that we be please with this idea everything else in gallipolus become dimitrus 's the lighthouse the hospital the three white house by the quay -- we have but to mention a building and he would promptly murmur in he dreamy half-quizzical way oui-i-i c'est dimitrus early next morning just after we have discover that under the cliff be water like liquid lapi lazulus and flat-topped rock rise just above it on which you would not have be in the least surprised to find mermaid comb they hair or siren sit and that it be a simple matter to climb down and be mermen the clergyman-volunteer arrive with report of the first night it have be dismal there be one or two intransigent kicker and the aesthetic young frenchman who spend he idle time draw picture of fashion-plate young lady have become so unstrung that he have regularly throw a fit and be unconscious for half a hour until they could massage he back to life again humor be quite go out of they and when the clergyman suggest that it be a compliment to be send out to be shoot at -- flattering at any rate to the prowess of the ally -- a frenchman emphatically deny it pa du tout he explode while we talk there be a knock at the front door and through the grate we see the red fez and vaguely smile visage of the mutessarif 's secretary it be the first of a series of visit which before we leave gallipolus be renew almost every hour of dialogue deserving a better immortalization than can be give here you must imagine on one side of the dining-room table the plump little bey with he fez and glass quick little salute each time he take a match or cigarette face he the tall urbane philip in ineffable flannel or riding-clothes -- for the embassy secretary be one of those who believe that clothes should express rather than blot out the inner man cigarette -- coffee -- assurance to he excellency that the house be he to monsieur le directeur of we pleasure and profound consideration minute pass a hour -- the bey know no such thing as time the other be as unhurried as he the talk in somewhat halting french be of war weather french culture marriage those dreadful russian punctuate by delicate but persistently recur reference on one side to mattress and food for the hostage by the little bey 's deep sigh and he mais que fairef that but what can be do like the mexican 's who know fall like a curtain on every pause it be the bey 's answer to all life 's riddle -- the plight of the hostage the horror of war he own dream of be governor of a province close to constantinople one can hear he now through that cloud of cigarette smoke mai -- with a pause and scarcely perceptible lifting of the shoulder -- que faire we go across to lapsaki again that day to get blanket and buy or order mattress and find it much what gallipolus must have be a few day before -- sunshine and soldier camel load with stretcher and red cross supply the hot little twist street noisy with trader and refugee you can imagine the excitement over this mysterious stranger with a unlimited supply of gold lira and big silver medjidy ask not what kind of blanket but how many do they have how long would it take they to make not one but fifty mattress greek trader jew from the dardanelle one or two hybrid youth in fez and american clothes with recommendation from american y m c a 's -- it be a great afternoon for lapsakus a round-faced jolly german nurse drop all alone in the little town by the chance of war meet we in the street and later we go to she hospital it have be start only a fortnight before there be no bed and the wounded lay on narrow mattress on the floor one man whose face be a mere eye and nose poke through patch of plaster have be burn at gallipolus another up from the dardanelle have a hideous wound in he cheek discharge constantly into he mouth in spite of it he take philip 's cigarette and smoke it he be dead when we come back three day later on another mattress be a poor little brown bundle a boy of twelve or thirteen hit in the spine and paralyze by a fragment of shell at gallipolus and now delirious philip later take he back to constantinople to the x-ray and care that might save he life it be sundown when we get back to the hostage with we spoil the thing have begin to get on they nerve the english say little determined evidently to remain briton to the last but some of the levantine let themselves go completely a pale gentleman with a poetic beard a barber by profession be among the most eloquent it be not a jail it be a mad-house he cry another declare that without bedding doctor or medicine shut up here until the end of the war probably they must at least have food -- that be a need primordial another stand apart whack he chest and address the empty air c'est moi c'est moi qui n ' a pas d'argent -- it be he who have no money and nothing to cover he and what do they want he to do if he have come down to be shoot at well and good but if he be to be freeze and starve by inch philip smooth they down as best he could and return to invite the governor 's secretary to stay for dinner a repast for which hassan the embassy khavass who accompany the expedition have procure as he put it some fresh eggy from a nice little man the bey who that morning have lean toward the french now warm to america the french be enlighten he say but without moral the english civilized but jealous if he have any son he would send they to america the only place where young man be both civilized and properly serieux in the midst of these amiable speculation it be suggest that in view of the difficulty of get mattress the government might even requisition they the suggestion draw a regretful sigh from the bey for turkey be a constitutional country he say the shop and house be close and they owner go and there be no way in which such a thing could be do in addition to hassan 's eggy philip 's man Friday the incomparable levy have construct some rice pudding and it be in despair that he announce just before they be to be serve that two have go by the cat we have indeed by this time attract most of the cat in gallipolus they streak through the room like chain lightning and in the dead of night go gallop over the piano keyboard with sound so blood-curdling that suydam put he mattress on the sofa and he sleeping-bag on top of that and shut himself in defy they the incomparable levy be italian by he birth and cheerfulness jewish on he father 's side turkish by the fez he wear and a life spend in guide stranger about constantinople he have the face of a dean of a diplomatic corps or one of those comfortable old gentleman in spat who have become fixture in some city club it be he employer 's humor to befriend and defend he in private but to he face assume with the most delicate irony that this marvel among man be always late forgetful rattle-brained and credulous and it be levy 's gift to play up to this assumption to hang on he employer 's word with breathless anxiety to relax into a paternal smile when safe and to support he omelet and he delay with oath and circumlocution stranger even than the dish themselves they be odd enough those dinner sit in we little oasis of light in that desert town not know what the next hour might bring next day we again go to lapsakus and although the entire industrial resource of the place have apparently be corner in the meantime by a dardanelle jew return with several more mattress and the promise of the remainder we find the hostage more cheerful with the relief money philip have distribute the day before and the food they have be able to buy they have shake themselves together gifted cook have turn up they have make a baseball out of rag paint humorous sign on the doorway of they room -- they have actually begin to sing and now with that curious subsequentness with which thing sometimes happen in turkey the mutesarif discover half a dozen mattress himself and announce that to-morrow there would be enough for all nay more -- the government would allow each hostage four piaster a day for food a cook would be bring down from constantinople and meal serve in a restaurant that they might be save as he secretary observe from the unlovely odeurs de ` cuisine then it be discover that the man might stroll about town provide they be in group they go to the beach and discuss the feasibility of swim they even demur against the constantinople cook as limit they means of amusing themselves the aesthetic young man recover now polish he shoe and put a lavender handkerchief in he breast pocket the hostage be in a fair way to annex the desert village when a bombshell burst in the shape of a despatch from the american ambassador that permission have be obtain for all to come home the change wind now swing full upon we scarcely have the message arrive ere the mutessarif secretary follow it lament that we must go a peacock repose majestically in the arm of a patient hamal appear at the front door a souvenir for he excellency appear also out of thin air a neat little horse and phaeton and a trooper perch on a high turkish saddle with a rifle sling rakishly across he back and the bey himself glass fez and all astride a arab steed we be to be take for a drive toward the end of it we reach the flour-mill the only modern edifice in this ancient town and be usher into the office to sit in a constrain circle with the slightly ironical-looking young proprietor -- accustomed perhaps to such visit -- and he associate while coffee and cigarette be bring the engineer a italian welcome we in french the proprietor who speak nothing but turkish smile inscrutably and overhead in several brass cage canary sing philip gazing upward admire they song whereat the bey at once announce that they be he the american protest that much as the gift delight he taste and rouse he gratitude it be impossible to think of carry a canary back to constantinople if you please insist the imperturbable bey it be yours scarcely have we return indeed before another patient hamal knock lug the hapless bird the hostage not to be outdo invite philip the bey and ourselves to lunch there be chicken soup and chicken and salad and native wine and for the corner of the improvise table where the guest be seat the hospitable young man have actually procure several bottle of gallipolus champagne the barber with the poetic beard leap to he foot as fluent in welcome we as he have be in protestation a few evening before while the aesthetic young man smile pensively down at a long-stemmed fleur-de-lis which he slowly twirl in he finger the cashier of a constantinople department store sing from tosca with he as leader they all sing -- a song of the pyrenee mountaineer then a waltz from the cafe chantant : bien gentiment l'on se balade c'est la premiere promenade -- in another week we should have have a gallipoli glee club and so end the adventure of the fifty hostage who go out to be shoot at -- the end of the comedy which have its climax at the begin the next morning we be up at daylight and after several hour ' delay the mutessarif and he lieutenant come down to permit we to leave there be cigarette and salute the secretary scribble in turkish character on he knee the governor sign the permit and we say good-by to gallipolus next morning we again thread the shipping in the golden horn the ten policeman who have look so formidable a week before express a wish for what be leave of the tinned corned beef and with hackman yell from the street and caique man shout from the water the fifty hostage be swallow up in the sunshine and smell and clatter of constantinople chapter xi with the turk at the dardanelle the little side-wheeler -- she have be build in glasgow in 1892 and do duty as a bosporus ferry-boat until the war begin -- be suppose to sail at four but night shut down and she still lay at the wharf in stamboul we contrived to get some black bread hard-boiled egg orange and helva from one of the little hole-in-the-wall shop near by watch pera and its ascend roof turn to purple and the purple to gray and black until constantinople be but a string of light across galata bridge and a lamp here and there on the hill then toward midnight with light douse and life-belt string along the rail -- for english submarine be in the marmora -- we churn quietly round the corner of stamboul and into the cool sea the side-wheeler be bind for the dardanelle with provision for the army -- bread in bag big hamper of green bean and cigarette -- and among they we be admit by grace of the minister of war and papers cover with seal and turkish character which neither of we could read we try to curl up on top of the bean -lrb- for the marmora be cold at night and the bean still hold some of the warmth of the field -rrb- but in the end take to blanket and the bare deck all night we go chunk southward -- it be well over a hundred mile from constantinople to the upper entrance to the strait -- and shake ourselves out of we blanket and the cinder into another of those blue-and-gold morning which belong to this part of the world you must imagine it behind all this strange fighting at the dardanelle -- sunshine and blue water a glare which make the westerner squint moon that shine like those in the tropics one can not send a photograph of it home any more than i could photograph the view from my hotel window here on pera hill of stamboul and the golden horn you would have the silhouette but you could not see the sunshine blaze on white mosque and minaret the white mosque blaze against terra-cotta roof and dusty green cedar and cypress the cypress lift dark and pensive shaft against the blue -- all that splendid exquisite radiance which burst through one 's window shutter every morning and make it seem enough to look and a waste of time to try to think it be the air the god and hero use to breathe they fight and play indeed over these very water and wind-swept hill leander swam the dardanelle -lrb- or hellespont -rrb- close to where the irresistible and bouvet be sink the wind that blow in we face that morning be the same that ripple the drapery of the winged victory as we go chunk southward with we bean and cigarette we could see the snow of olympus -- the mysian olympus at any rate if not the one where jove the cloud-compelling use to live and white-armed juno and palla blue-eyed maid if only we passport have take we to troy we could have look down the plain of ilium to the english and french ship and australian and french colonial fight up the hillside across the bay we get tea from the galley and-with bread and helva -lrb- a insinuate combination of sugar and oil of sesame which taste of peanut and be at once a candy and a sort of substitute for butter or meat -rrb- make out a breakfast a turkish soldier the only other occupant of the deck survey these preparation impassively then take off he boot climb on a settee and stand there in he big bare foot with fold hand face as he think toward mecca the boat be head southwest and he look to starboard so that he face as a matter of fact nearly due west he have kneel and touch he forehead twice to the bench and be go on with the mussulman prayer when the captain a rather elegant young man who have serve in the navy murmur something as he pass the soldier look round thoughtfully without embarrassment surprise or hurry step from the settee point it toward the asiatic shore and step up again resume he devotions five time that day as the faithful be command he say he prayer -- a sight that follow we everywhere that week one evening after dusk on another boat a fireman come up from below climb on a settee and begin he prayer several passenger who have not see he in the dark walk in front of he he break off revile they in true fire-room style then with a wide gesture as though sweep the air clear ahead of he all the way to the holy city begin at the beginning again soldier up in the gallipolus hill the captain on the bridge a stevedore work on a lighter in the blaze of noon with the winch engine squeal round he -- you turn round to find a man busy the moment before stand like a statue hand fold in front of he face the east nothing stop he no one seem to see he he stand invisible in the visible world -- in a world apart ` indeed to which the curious self-conscious westerner be not admit where doubtless he be no more than the dust which the other shake from he foot before he be fit to address he god the marmora narrow we pass gallipolus on the european side where the english and french hostage have have they curious adventure the week before and on into the dardanelle proper and the zone of war it be some forty mile down this salt-water river -lrb- four mile wide at its widest and between the fort of chanak kale and kilid bahr near its lower end a fraction over a mile -rrb- from the marmora gateway to the aegean on the leave be lapsakus and the green hill of asia cultivate to they very top on the right europe and the brown hill of the peninsula now fill with gun and horse and man over there up that narrow strip of europe run down between the dardanelle and the aegean the ally have be try for week to force they way to constantinople they have begin in February you will recall when they bombard the fort at the outer entrance to the dardanelle -- sedd ul bahron the european side at the tip of the peninsula and kum kale across the bay on the asiatic shore these fort occupy somewhat the relation to constantinople that sandy hook do to new york although much farther away -- they face that be to say the open sea and the gun of the fleet heavier than those of the old fort could stand off at a safe distance and demolish they when the ship push on up the strait toward kilid bahr and chanak kale -- somewhat like try to run the narrow at new york -- there be a different story they be now within range of shore battery and there be anchor mine and mine send down on the tide on march 18 the irresistible ocean and bouvet be sink and it begin to be apparent that the dardanelle could not be force without the help of a powerful land force so in April landing party be send ashore : at kum kale and sedd ul bahr at kaba tepe and art burnu some twelve or fourteen mile farther north on the aegean side of the peninsula and at another point a few mile farther up at sedd ul bahr and along the beach between kaba tepe and art bumu the ally make they landing good dig themselves in and reinforce by the fire of the ship begin a trench warfare not unlike that which have drag on in the west the peninsula be but ten or twelve mile wide at its widest and the dardanelle side be within range of the fleet 's great gun firing clear overland from the aegean it be by this indirect fire that maido be destroy and gallipolus partly smash and empty of its people there be place toward the end of the peninsula where turkish infantryman have to huddle in they trench under fire of this sort come from three direction whenever the invader have it behind they be naturally at a advantage whenever it cease they be likely to be drive back the turk on the other hand have the advantage of number of fight on a inside line and of a country one hill rise behind another on the defense of which depend they existence as a nation in europe under these condition the fighting have be go on for week the english and french hold they ground at sedd ul bahr and arus burnu but get no nearer constantinople and as we go chunk down the strait that night and into ak-bash in the dark two new force be come in the next day a german submarine -- come all the way round through the mediterranean -- be to sink the triumph and the majestic while another american correspondent who have intend to come with we but take the transport nagara instead see the head of a english submarine poke through the marmora a blond young man in overalls and white jersey climb out of the conning-tower will you give we time to get off cry the american the only one on board who could speak english yes say the young man and be damned quick about it ten minute later from the boat into which they have tumble the passenger see a cloud of yellow smoke and the nagara simply disintegrate and sink and with she the heavy siege-gun she be take to the dardanelle pleasantly unaware of what might as well have happen to the bread and bean we draw up to a hill-side speckled with light a wharf and a hospital boat smell of iodoform through a cabin window of which a doctor be peacefully eating dinner box and sack be pile near the wharf and from over behind the hill with startling nearness come the nervous crack crack crack-crack-crack of rifle and machine-gun fire we go to sleep to the tune of it move a few mile down the coast in the night and crawl out into a world of dusty brown -- brown hillside and camel and soldier and sack of wheat pile on the flat immerse in a amber dawn this be the destination of the side-wheeler and by sunup we be load into a machine with a horse several goat three or four passenger and four barefooted boatman who push we over the strait to chanak kale we be now at the narrowest part of the dardanelle behind we on the european side the old round tower of kilid bahr and medjidie fort in front fort hamidie and on the horizon to the south where the strait open into the sea the tiny silhouette of several of the ally ' ship chanak be smash like the town in west belgium and but for the garrison and the turkish and german commandant tuck away in the tree all but desert except by fly and half-starved cat these unhappy creature leave behind in the flight be everywhere and in front of the bake shop they crowd in literal score -- gaunt mangy claw and batter from constant fight it be hot there be little to eat and after hour of wrangle it appear that we precious scratch of turkish take we to the gallipolus instead of the asiatic side the two be under different jurisdiction though the fault be not ours the local commandant have the right to ship we back to constantinople and after a sort of delirium of fly cat gendarme muggy heat and debate night descend to find we go to sleep in the middle of a vegetable farm in a house lately inhabit by whirling dervish with two lynx-eyed police-man in gray lamb 's - wool cap seat at the gate by they we be march next day to the wharf and suddenly there translate into the upper ether by the german admiral and he thoughtful aid who on they way to the headquarters of the land force across the strait whirl we over in style in a torpedo-boat we land at the same place at which we have touch in the dark two night before -- busy and blaze now in the afternoon sun with gang of stevedore shuffling to and from the ship at the brand-new wharf turkish officer gallop about on they thick-necked bobtail fiery little stallion and the dusty flat half a mile across perhaps between its encircle hill crowd with ox and horse cart camel train and pile of ammunition-box and sack of food the admiral and he aid be greet by a smart young german officer with a monocle and gallop off into the hill while we fall into the hospitable hand of another german a civilian volunteer in red fez and the blue and brass button of the merchant marine cast here by the chance of war he be a hamburg-american captain lately sail between bueno aire and hamburg and before that on a atla line boat between the caribbean and new york he talk english and seem more than half american indeed and when he speak of the old chelsea hotel just across the street from the y m c a gymnasium in which i have play hand-ball we be almost back in twenty-third street he take we up to he tent on the hill overlook the man and store and he explain reasonably safe from the aeroplane which fly over several time a day over he cigarette and tea and bottled beer we talk of war and the world it be the captain 's delicate and arduous duty to impose he tight german habit of work and ship-shapeness on camel driver stevedore and official use to the looser more leisurely method of the east he could not speak turkish be helpless without he interpreter at best a civilian among soldier -- man have get iron cross for easier job than that he talk of the news -- great news for he side -- of the triumph and open he navy list make a pencil mark she be off he say the book be full of mark in methodical sailor fashion he have be cross they off since the war begin : british and german -- blucher scharnhorst irresistible goliath and the rest -- million of dollar and hundred of man at a stroke where 's it go to end he demand there be seven hundred good man go maybe -- how many do the triumph carry and we think it be good news if a man should invent something that would kill a hundred thousand man at once he would be a great man now what be that the english be hang on to sedd ul bahr -- they might try to make another gibraltar of it they aeroplane come up every day there be a french-man with a long tail -- he only come to the edge of the camp and as soon as the battery open up turn back but the englishman do not stop for anything he drop a bomb or two every time he pass -- one man must have be square under one for they find piece of he but never do find he head it be not so much the bomb that do the damage it be the stone blow out by the explosion if you be stand anywhere within sixty foot when it go off you be likely to be kill the captain have have trench dig all over camp into which they could jump -- have one for himself just outside the tent all you hope for when one of those fellow be overhead and the shrapnel chasing after he be that the next one would take he fair and square and bring he down yet that fellow take he life in he hand every time he fly over he be fight for he country too the captain sigh it be we first duty to present ourselves to the commandant of the peninsular force field-marshal liman von sander -- liman pasha as he be generally call in turkey -- and the captain find a carriage presently and send we away with a soldier guard we carriage be a talika one of those little gondola-like covered wagon common in the country there be a seat for the driver the occupant lie on the floor and adjust themselves as best they can to the bumping of the hilly road the country remind one of part of we own west -- brown hill with sparse pine and scrub-oak meadow ablaze with scarlet poppy and over all blue sky sunshine and the breeze from the near-by sea we pass camel train mule train horse and tent mask with brush here evidently be the man we have see march day after day through the constantinople street -- march away to war in the silent eastern fashion without a wave handkerchief a girl to say good-by to or a cheer here they be and yet here they be not for the brush and tangled hill swallow they up as thoroughly as army be swallow up in the village of belgium and france we pass even these sign of war and come into pine and open meadow -- we might have be drive to somebody 's trout preserve the wagon stop near a sign tack to a tree and we walk down a wind path into a thicket of pine there be tent set in the bank and cover with bough and out of one come a tall square-jawed german officer button he coat he wave aside we passport with the air of one not concern with such detail ask if we speak german -- or perhaps we would prefer french -- and motion down the path to a sort of summer-house with a table and chair tell a orderly to bring tea this be the headquarters of the fifth army and this the commander-in - chief a bird-man might have fly over the neighborhood a dozen time without guess that they be there we be hide in the pine and only a occasional far-off br-r-rum-m from the cannon in the south break the stillness some one have bring up a cask of native claret from chanak and the field-marshal 's staff be help to put it into the bank in front of the arbor a professor of chemistry -- until the war call he back to the color -- be shovel and show the turkish soldier how the cask should be slant another of the superintendent have live for ten year in america and be enthusiastic over the charm and future of davenport iowa presently tea come and thin little sandwich and cigar and over these the commander-in-chief speak with complete cheerfulness of the general situation the english and french could not force the dardanelle no more could they advance on land and now that the submarine have arrive the fleet which have be bothersome would be take care of he speak with become sorrow of the behavior of italy and do not mar this charming little fete champetre with any remark about american shipment of arm the ex-banker from davenport also speak of the italian and with a rather disconcerting vigor consider that they be recent ally the young aide-de-camp whom we have see at the wharf declare that the turkish soldier be the best in the world it be a very different army from that which have be defeat in the balkan war and the endurance and tenacity of the individual soldier be beyond anything he have ever see a man would see a dozen of he comrade kill alongside he by a high-explosive shell and only shrug he shoulder and say that now at any rate they be all in paradise one continually hear similar comment and there can be no doubt of the turkish soldier 's bravery and he unusual ability to endure hardship no one who have wrangle with a minor turkish official and experience the impassive resistance he be able to interpose to anything he do not want to do will underestimate what this quality might become translate into the rugged physique and impassivity of the common soldier westerner have hear so long of the sick man of europe and he imminent decease that they be likely to associate political with physical weakness and think that the pale brooding official type familiar in photograph be the every-day turk as a matter of fact the every-day turk be tough-bodied and tough-spirited use to hard living and hard work the soldier you see swing up pera hill or in from a practice march dust-covered and sweating and send out through the dusty cedar a wail sort of chant as they come -- these be as splendid - look fellow as you will see in any army in europe they be dress in businesslike fashion in dust-colored woollen tunic and snug breeches with puttee and wear a rather rakish-looking fold cap -- a sort of conventionalize turban not unlike the soldier hat child make by folding newspaper this protect the eye and the back of the neck from the sun they be strong and well make with broad high cheek-bone a black mustache generally and hawk eye some look as the tartar warrior who sweep over eastern europe must have look some with they good-natured face and vigorous compactness remind one of japanese infantryman during the early fighting on the peninsula the wound come up to constantinople after day on the way in wagon perhaps over horrible road in commandeer ferry-boat and freighter yet one scarcely hear a sound a murmur of complaint gray and gaunt with the mud of the trench still on they they would be help into ambulance and drive off to the hospital silent themselves and through crowd as silent as those which have watch they march away a few week before from that little oasis in the pine we drive with a pass sign by the field-marshal himself take we to the height above arus burnu to a point near the south front a hill in the center of the peninsula from which we could see both the dardanelle and the aegean and to a camp beneath it where we be to spend the night it be dark when we wagon lurch into this camp and a full hour pass before the baffled turk could convince themselves that we pass and we be all that they should be and put we into a tent nevertheless a orderly poke he head in good-naturedly enough at seven next morning with tea and goat 's cheese and brown bread and we captain host a rather wildish-looking young man from the asiatic interior come to say he have telephone for permission to take we to the height above kaba tepe and arus burnu the camp be the office so to speak of the division commander with he clerk telephone operator commissary machinery and so on the commander himself live at the immediate front it be like score of other camp hide away in the hill -- brush-covered tent dig into the hillside look like rather fade summer-house arbor-like horse-shed cover with branch hide in ravine every wagon gun or piece of material that might offer a target to a aeroplane cover with brush they be even paint gray horse that morning with a brown dye a big 38-centimeter unexploded shell drop into a near-by village by the queen elizabeth and with difficulty push up on end now by a dozen man be show we and presently we climb into the carriage with the captain and go rock over the rough road toward the aegean the country remind one of the californium foot-hill in the dry season and I particularly of hondura and the road from the pacific up to tegucigalpa -- gravelly brown hill and tangled valley with sparse pine and scrub-oak rocky slope down which tinkle brown and white flock of sheep and goat sunshine and scarlet poppy and fresh wind and over all a curious quiet busy web of war a long shoulder sharp against the blue with a brown camel train amble down it a ravine with its arbor-like shelter for cavalry wounded soldier in cart or ride when they be able to ride now and then a officer on he cranky little stallion -- the whole countryside bristle with defense up one of the hot little valley we climb leave the carriage and walk up a trail cut into the bank past man and horse hide away like bandit and come at last to the top and several tent dig into the rim of the hill it be the headquarters of essad pasha defender of janina in the last war and division commander in this sector of the front he receive we in he tent beside a table litter with map and papers -- a grizzled good-natured soldier who address we in german and might indeed have pass for a german he apologize for the cramped quarter explain that they be likely at any time to be bombard and have to live in what be practically a trench and then at once in the turkish fashion appear a orderly with tiny cup of sweet coffee thing be quiet at the moment he say there be nothing but the desultory crack-crack of sniper come from one know not just where the every-day voice of the trench -- possibly the enemy be dismay by the loss of the triumph he have see it all he say from this very spot -- a sight one be not likely to see more than once in a lifetime the great ship have roll over like a stricken whale she torpedo-net be out and as she turn over these net close down on the man struggle in the water and sweep they under he too express entire confidence in the turk 's ability to stop any farther advance and call a aid send we to the periscope which poke its two eye through a screen of pine branch a few yard away and look over the parapet and down on the first-line trench and the sea we be high above the aegean and opposite the island of imbro which lift its hazy blue on the western horizon and be use as a base by part of the fleet to the south rise the promontory of kaba tepe clear of the enemy now we turkish major say and stretch northward from it past we and arus burnu the curving rim of beach hold by the english more than a month have pass since the landing and the heavy fighting of the next few day in which the australian and new zealander under a hail of shrapnel churn up the water between ship and shore succeed in get a foothold a month and more have pass and though they still hold they ground apparently they could do no more the yellow line of they first trench twist along the rim of the hill below we perhaps a quarter of a mile away and directly behind it lay the blue sea how much elbow-room they might have between they trench and the water one could not tell so completely foreshorten be the space between cliff rise from a narrow strip of foreshore here however and apparently they have push just over the cliff rim -- the first hill above the sea they tent store and landing-place be out of sight directly in front of the english trench be the first-line turkish trench in some place not more than fifteen or twenty foot away so close indeed that when there be fight they must have fight with revolver hand-grenade shovel anything they could lay they hand on at the moment it be quiet but for the constant crack crack-crack of sniper we could look down on the back and head of the turkish soldier except for a wisp of smoke rise here and there from some hidden camp cook-stove there be not a sign of life in the english trench sniper be attend to that even here in the second-line trench on top of the second hill no one be allow to show he head and it be all the more curious to see a squad of turkish soldier digging away below as calmly as so many market-gardener in a potato-field they be run another trench behind the several that already line the slope and must have be hide by a rise of ground though look down from above they seem to be out in the open the position of the english do not seem enviable they have trench directly in front of they and several hundred foot above they a second line -lrb- from which we be look -rrb- dominate the whole neighborhood the first-line turkish trench be too close to they own to be bombard from the ship so that that preliminary advantage be cut off the second-line defens in the twist gully over the hill could stand bombardment about as well as could trench anywhere -- and behind they be the water they be very literally between the devil and the deep sea with the periscope we work from kaba tepe on the left clear across the ground in front of we to the north over in the west by hazy imbro be five or six ship there be another fleet in the north to-ward the gulf of saro and little black beetle of destroyer crawl here and there across the blue sea floor the major take we into he tent for cigarette and another thimbleful of the coffee he too have be educate in germany speak german and french and with he quick bright eye and soft smile would easily have pass for a frenchman or italian they have just have a seven hour ' armistice to bury the dead and bring in the wound some of whom have be lie between the trench for a week the english have propose the armistice a officer have come out from each side and they have have a long pow-wow and draw up a write agreement with meticulous care lest there should be a misunderstanding or danger of break the truce everything the major say have be most good-natured and correct the english have send a diplomat in addition to they military delegate a civilian whom he have know well in constantinople it be altogether quaint and interesting meeting and talk with this man with whom he might so to speak have be play bridge the night before -- sehr nett sehr nett he say with he soft smile while he be wait to receive the english delegate five shrapnel - shell have be fire at he he say but he understand that it be a mistake and make no protest and during the truce a wounded turk have refuse to take the water a english officer have try to give he firing at the englishman instead a little fanatical perhaps but then -- and again the major smile in he charming way -- a little fanaticism in one 's soldier be a good thing no one do not care to be hang on to that strip of beach with those australian and new zealander we drive back to camp for lunch which we have in the captain 's little brush-covered balcony set into the hill he do not eat but show we he photograph very smooth and dapper compare with he bristle service face take with he two child one a little girl and the other a grave little boy with a face like a miniature pasha the captain come from the asiatic side near broussa on the slope of olympus and be all turk without any foreign frill or a word of english german or french he take no lunch but eat some of the helva leave over from stamboul and then start with we up the hill behind the camp this be about midway in the peninsula and face south from the summit we look down over the twist hill pockmark with hole from shell and aeroplane bomb to the marmora on the left and on the right to the aegean and hazy imbro and in front almost to the end of the peninsula the sun be down in the west and in its track a cruiser steam a mile or two out from the coast while from under arus burnu where we have be that morning a transport put out rather recklessly it seem and go straight across the open water from the south and west there be the continual br-r-umr-m br-r-um-m of big gun and over kaba tepe way we could see shell burst we sit there for a hour or so wait for one of the little speck out on the blue sea floor to fire or sink and then as nothing happen return to camp a orderly bring we supper that night -- mutton bread and cheese haricot stew fruit and coffee -- and we dine on a little table outside the tent with the twilight turn to moonlight and the sheep-bell tinkle against the opposite hill soldier be carry they supper from the cook tent -- not at all the bread-and-cigarette diet with which one be always be tell the hardy turk be content he may be content but whenever i see he eat he have meat and rice and often stewed fresh bean or fruit -- certainly better food than most turkish peasant or artisan be accustom to at home i sit outside watch the moon rise and listen to the distant crack crack-crack of rifle and machine-gun fire from over arus bumu way evidently they be fight in the trench we have see that morning the orderly who have serve we withdraw a little way be stand like a statue in the dusk hand fold in front of he say he last prayer of the evening beyond from a bush-covered tent come the jingle of a telephone and ` the singsong voice of the young turkish operator relay message in german -- ja ja kaba tepe ousedom pasha morgen frith hier multepe ja ja and to this and the distant rattle of battle we go to sleep chapter xii soghan-dere and the flier of ak-bash next morning after news have be telephone in that the submarine have get another battleship the majestic we climb again into the covered wagon and start for the south front we drive down to the sea and along the beach road through maido -- bombard several week before cross-country from the aegean and nothing now but bare burnt wall -- on to kilid bahr jam with camel and ox-cart and soldier and then on toward the end of the peninsula we be now beyond the narrow and the dardanelle to the leave a bit farther out be the water in which the irresistible ocean and bouvet be sink and even now off the point ten or twelve mile away hang the smoke of sister ship we drive past the big gun of the fort past field-gun cover the shore past mask battery and search-light beside we along the shore road mule train and ox-cart and camel train be toiling along in the blaze and dust with provision and ammunition for the front once we pass four soldier carry a comrade badly wound on a stretcher pad with leaf after a hour or so of bump we turn into a transverse valley as level almost as if it have be make for a parade-ground high hill protect it north and south a little stream run down the center -- it might have be make for a storage base and camp more brush-covered tent and arbor for horse be string along the hillside one above the other sometimes in half a dozen terrace we drive into the valley get out and follow the orderly to a brush-covered arbor close on every side but one out of which come a well set-up bronze bright-eyed man of fifty or thereabout who welcome we like long-lost friend it be colonel shukrus bey commander of the fifteenth division we be the first correspondent who have push thus far and as novel to he apparently as he be charming to we he invite we into the little arbor coffee be bring and then tea and speak german to suydam and french to I he talk of the war in general and the operation at the end of the peninsula with the greatest good humor and apparent confidence in the ultimate result we talk be continually punctuate by the rumble of the big gun over the plateau to the south that be ours that be theirs he would explain and presently with a young aide-de-camp as guide we climb out of the valley and start down the plateau toward sedd ul bahr the ally ' foothold here be much wider than that at a burnu in the general landing operation of April 25 and 26 -lrb- one force be send ashore in a large collier from which after she be beach the man pour across anchor lighter to the shore -rrb- the english and french have establish themselves in sedd ul bahr itself and along the cliff on either side this position be strengthen during the week of fight which follow until they appear to be pretty firmly fix on the end of the peninsula with a front run clear across it in a general northwest line several kilometre in from the point the valley we have just leave be soghan-dere about seven mile from sedd ul bahr and the plateau across which we be walk lead on the right up to a ridge from which one could look down on the whole battle-field or to the leave straight down into the battle itself the sun be get down in the west by this time down the road from camp man be carry kettle of soup and rice pilaf to they comrade in the trench and from the end of the plateau come continuous thundering and the crack crack crack of infantry fire the road be strew with fragment of shell from previous bombardment and we solicitous young lieutenant fear we might draw fire pull we behind a bush for a minute or two whenever the aeroplane fly back and forth in the west seem to be squint at we the enemy could see so little he say that whenever they see anything at all they fire twenty shot at it on principle for two mile perhaps we walk until from the innocent-looking chaparral behind we there be a roar and a shell wail away over we head out into the distance we could see the end of the peninsula where the coast curve round from eski hissariik toward sedd ul bahr and two of the enemy 's cruiser steam slowly back and forth under the cliff firing presumably as they steam now they be hide under the shore now they come in view and opposite eskus hissarlik swing round and steamed west again in front of we just over the edge of the plateau which there begin to slope downward be the trench of the turk ' left wing now under bombardment the ridge just hide the shell as they strike but we could see the smoke from each now a tall black column like the jack johnson of the west now a yellowish cloud that hang long afterward like fog -- and with it the continuous rattle of infantry fire several flier be creep about far up against the ` blue look for just such hide battery as that which keep bark behind we and out in front and to the right come the low br -- r -- um -- m of heavy gun fight like this have be go on for week the ship have the advantage of they big gun by day the turk recover themselves apparently at night they be on they own ground -- a succession of ridge one behind the other -- and they could not only always see but generally look down on a enemy who could not generally see they and the enemy 's man supplies perhaps even he water -- for this be a dry country at all time and after June there be almost no rain -- must come from he ship if english submarine be in the marmora so too be german submarine off the dardanelle and if the turk be lose transport the english be lose battleship the situation hold too many possibility to make prophecy safe -- i merely record the fact that on the afternoon of may 27 i stand on the plateau above sedd ul bahr and perhaps five mile from it in a air line and still find myself a regrettable distance from the ally ' front the sun be shine level down the road as we return to camp and soldier be still tramp peacefully up to the front with they kettle of food meanwhile the colonel have prepare a little exhibition for we six or eight soldier stand in line each with a dish and spoon and in the dish a sample of the food for that night we start at the top and taste each : soup mutton stew green bean new-baked bread stew plum and a particularly appetizing pilaf make out of boil whole wheat and raisin everything be good and the beam colonel declare that the first thing in war be to keep you soldier well feed we dine with he in he tent : soup and several meat course and cherry compote and at the end various kind of nut include the crack hazelnut commoner in turkey than banana and peanut at home he hope to come to america some day and think we must soon develop the military strength to back we desire for peace unless there be to be continual war new york 's climate the cost of fruit in germany and other peaceful subject be touch on and the colonel say that it be a honor to have we with he -- ours we brilliantly respond -- and a pleasant change from the constant talk and thought of war he have be six year in the field now what with the italian and balkan campaign and that be a good deal of war at a stretch after excuse ourselves though the amiable turk say that he be in no hurry we be lead to a sort of tent de luxe line in scarlet with snaky decoration in white and when the young aid discover that we have bring no bed with we he send out and in a moment have not only cot and blanket but mattress and sheet and pillow and pillow-case he ask if we have father and mother alive at home and brother and sister and if we too have be soldier it surprise and puzzle he that we have not and that we army be so small he be only twenty-two and a lieutenant and he have a brother and father also in the army with a great air of mystery he have he orderly dig a bottle of cognac out from he camp chest and after we have drunk each other 's health he give we he card with he name in turkish and french he bring a table and put on it a night candle in a saucer of water a carafe of drinking water and give I a pair of slipper -- in short he do for we in that brush-covered camp in the gallipolus hill everything that could be do for a guest in one 's own house you can scarcely know what this mean without have know the difficulty of mere existence once you leave constantinople and get into the war zone and colonel shukrus bey and lieutenant ahm akif will be remember by at least two american when any one talk of the terrible turk i awake shortly after daylight thinking i hear a aeroplane strumming in the distance and be drowsily wonder whether or not it be fancy when a crash echo up the valley we both hurry out it be sunup a delicious morning and far up against the southern sky the little speck be sail back toward the west there be a flash of silver just under the flier -- it be a english biplane -- and a moment later another crash farther away neither do any damage a few minute later we be look at the remains of the bomb and propeller-like wing whose whirling as it fall open a valve that permit it to explode on strike its mark until it have fall a certain number of metre we be tell mere strike the ground would not explode it -- a device to protect the airman in case of accident to he machine or if he be force to make a quick landing in the fresh still morning with the camp just wake up and the curious turkish currycomb clink away over by the tethered horse we aerial visitor add only a pleasant excitement to this life in the open and we go on with we dress with great satisfaction little dream how soon we be to look at one of those little fly speck quite differently we breakfast with the colonel in he arbor on bread and ripe olive and tea and walk with he round the camp through a hospital and into a old farmhouse yard where the gunsmith be go over stack of capture gun and the damage rifle of the wound while the bee leave behind in some clumsy old box hive buzz away as of yore wiser than man the colonel observe there be english enfield and french rifle of the early ninety and a mitrailleuse to which the turk have fit a new wooden base there be rifle with smash barrel with stock bore through by bullet clean-cut hole that must have go on through the man who hold they -- live man like ourselves quick choke instant of terror the ghost of -- which we be poke and peer into there in the warm sunshine we say good-by to the colonel for we pass take we but to the valley and he have stretch a point in send we down the plateau the evening before and i bumped back to kilid bahr we do not want to leave this part of the world without a sight of troy and as we have duly present ourselves in gallipolus and be now by way of come from it rather than constantinople and the turkish official to whom the orderly take we write without question a permission to cross to chanak kale we sail with no misgiving alas for troy and look down on a modern battle from the height of ilium a truculent major of gendarme hurry we from the asiatic shore as if we have come to capture it we might not land we might not write a note to the commandant to see if the permission to stop in chanak for which we have wire to constantinople the day before have arrive we might not telephone -- we must go back to europe and write or telephone from there so back to europe and after consultation and telephone back to asia again and this time we succeed in effect a landing and a audience with the commander of the defens of the dardanelle djevad pasha he be sit under a tree in a garden look out over the sea gate which with the aid of he two german colleague ousedom pasha and merten pasha it be he task to keep shut -- a trim young turk more polished and european than the major of gendarme but no less firm a american 's wish to see the troy he might never be so near again bore he excessively we could not stay -- we might not even spend the night there be a boat that evening and on it we must go gendarme guard we while we wait -- we who the night before have sleep in a scarlet-lined tent -- and gendarme hang at we heel as we and three patient hamal with the baggage tramp ignominiously through chanak kale 's ruin street the boat we go by be the same little side-wheeler we have come down on crowd with wound now mud-stained blood-stained just as they have come from the trench across the water with no place to lie but the bare deck the stifle hold be pack with they they curl up about the engine-room grating -- for it be cold that night -- yet there be no complaint a tired sigh now and then a moan of weariness and the soldier wrap he army overcoat a little closer about he curl up like a dog on a door-mat and leave the rest to fate a big round yellow moon climb up out of asia and pour its silver down on they and on the black hill and water still as some inland lake the side-wheeler tie up at ak-bash for the night and it be not until the middle of the next morning that it be decide that she should cross and leave she wound at lapsakus instead of go on up to constantinople we lug we baggage off and hunt up we old friend the hamburg-american captain to see what might be do till some other craft appear he finally put we aboard a sort of enlarged tug which might be go up that afternoon or evening it be about midday the sun blaze down on the crowded fiat on box sack stevedore wrap up in all the variegated rag of the east shuffling in and out of the ship on gang digging pile lumber boiling water cooking soup on officer in brown uniform and brown lamb 's - wool cap on horse ox-team and a vast herd of sheep which have just pour out of a transport and spread over the plain when from the hill come two shot of warn a enemy aeroplane be come the gang scatter like water-bug when a stone be throw into the water they run for the hill drop into trench to the beach and throw themselves flat on the sand into the water -- all as they run look up over they shoulder to where far overhead whirred steadily nearer that tiny terrible hawk a hidden battery roar and -- pop -- a little puff of cotton float in the sky under the approach flier another and another -- all the nervous little battery in the hill round about be come to we rescue the bird-man safely above they draw on without flinch we have look up at aeroplane many time before and watch the pretty chase of the shrapnel and we lean out from under the awning to keep the thing in view look i say to suydam she be come right over we and then all at once there be a crash a concussion that hit the ear like a blow a geyser of smoke and dust and stone out on the flat in front of we through the smoke i see a horse with its pack undo and flop under its belly trot round with the wild aimlessness of horse in the bull-ring after they have be gore man be run and in a tangle of wagon half a dozen ox on the ground be give a few spasmodic kick man streak up from the engine-room and across the wharf -- after all the wharf would be the thing he would try for -- and i find myself out on the flat with they just as there come another crash but this time over by the barbarossa across the bay black smoke be pour from the turkish cruiser as she get under way and with the shrapnel puff chase hopelessly after the flier swing to the southward and out of right officer be gallop about yell order over in the dust where the bomb have strike a man be saw furiously away at the throat of the ox -lrb- there be seven of they and there would be plenty of beef in camp that night at any rate -rrb- there be a dead horse two badly wound man and a hundred foot away a man lie on he face hatless just as he have be blow there : dead or as good as dead it appear that two flier have come from opposite direction and most of the crowd have see but the one while the other drop the bomb it have strike just outside the busiest part of the camp aim very likely at the store pile there it have make a hole only five or six foot wide and two or three foot deep but it have blow everything in the neighborhood out from it as the captain have say hole you could put you fist in be tear in the flank of the ox by fly stone and chunk of metal and the tire of some of the wagon sixty or seventy foot away have be cut through like wax the ground be clear the man return to work and we even go in swimming but at every unexpected noise one look upward and when about five o'clock the crowd scatter again i will confess that i watch that little speck buzz nearer on a line that would bring he straight overhead with a interest considerably less casual than any i have bestow on these bird before there we be confine in we little amphitheatre there be that diabolical bird peer down at we and in another minute somewhere in that space would come that earth-shaking explosion -- a mingling of crash and vohou ' there be no escape it no dodge it nothing to get under but empty air i have decide that the beach about a hundred yard away from the wharf be the safest place and hurry there but the speck overhead as if anticipate I seem to be aim for the precise spot it be difficult under such circumstance to sit tight reasoning calmly that after all the chance of the bomb 's not landing exactly there be a good many to one -- you demand at least the ostrich-like satisfaction of have something overhead so i scurry over to the leave to get out from under what seem he line of flight when what should he do but begin to turn this be really rub it in a bit to fly across as he have that morning be one thing but to pen one up in a nice little pocket in the hill and then on a vertical radius of three or four thousand foot to circle round over one 's head -- anything yet devise by the human nightmare be crude and immature to this but be it overhead if behind and travel at fifty or sixty mile a hour the bomb would carry forward -- just enough probably to bring it over and if apparently over still the bomb would have be several seconds in fall -- it might be right on top of we now should we run backward or forward : here be a place in between some grain-bag but the grain-bag be open toward the wharf and the wharf be what he be aim at and a plank blow through you -- no the trench be the thing but -- quick he be overhead the beach the bag the ditch all the way round the camp and suydam gallop after somewhere in the middle of it a hideous whiffling wail come down the sky : trrou trrou trou -- and then a crash the bomb have hit the water just off the end of the pier i keep on run there be another trrou trrou another geyser of water and the bird have fly on i be on the edge of the camp by this time and that strange afternoon end when one of a gang of ditch-digger swathe in bright-colored rag address I in english a greek-turk from the island of marmora who climb out of the trench in which he and he gang have be hide announce that he have live in new york for five year in fortieth street and work for the morgan line and beg that i get he out of this nerve-racking place and where he belong somewhere on board ship there be crowd like he -- greek armenian turk not want as soldier but impressed for this sort of work they be unload fire-wood long after dark that night when we boat at last get under way we pause till sunup at lapsakus creep close to shore through the marmora and once through float wreckage -- board and a galvanized-iron gasolene tank -- apparently from some transport sink by a submarine and after dark with light out as we have start round the corner of stamboul chapter xiii a war correspondent ' village the press department of the foreign office in vienna duly present the application to the press bureau of the ministry of war the latter convey it to the kaiserliche und konigliche armee-oberkommando kriegs-presse-quartier a day 's railroad journey nearer the front the commandant make he recommendation to the chief of the general staff the permission itself percolate back to vienna presently and early next morning i take the teschen express it be one of those semi-military train which run into this region behind the front -- officer and courier civilian with military pass just before we start a young officer and he orderly say good-by to they wife he be one of those amiable blue-eyed young austrian who seem a sort of cross between german and french and the orderly be much such another man only less neatly make and sensitive and there be the same difference in they wife and they good-by the orderly salute he officer turn click he heel and salute he officer 's lady before he embrace he solid wife the latter rather proud to be in such company beam like a stove as the two man look down from the car step but the girlish wife of the captain bit she lip look nervously from side to side wink faster and faster until the tear begin to roll down she cheek then the train start the orderly wave he hand but the young officer lean quickly forward draw he wife toward he and kiss she on one of the wet eyelid we cross into hungary rolled northeastward for five or six hour into the vag valley with its green hill and vineyard and ruin castle and finally come to a little place consist almost entirely of consonant in the tatra foot-hill two blond soldier in blue-gray salute take my luggage show I to a carriage and drive to a village about a mile away -- a little white village with a factory chimney for the new day a dingy chateau for the old and a brook run diagonally across the square with goose quack in it and woman pound clothes it be mid-afternoon yet lunch have be keep wait and the officer who receive I say he be sorry i have bother to eat on the train he tell I where lodgings have be make ready and that a orderly would take I there and look after my personal need they dine at eight and at five if i feel like it i would probably find some of they in the coffee-house by the chateau meanwhile the first thing to do be to take one 's cholera vaccination -- for no one could go to the galician front without be geimpft -- and just as soon as i could take the second a week later we should start for the russian front in this fashion be stranger welcome to the presse-quartier or rather to that part of it -- this little hungarian village -- in which correspondent live during the interval of they trip to the front the austrian have pleasant manners they court be next to that of spain the most formal in europe and ordinary life still retain many of the older courtesy every time i come into my hotel in vienna the two little boy at the door jump up and extend they cap at arm 's length a assistant porter farther in do the same the head porter behind the desk often follow and occasionally all four execute the maneuver at once so that it be like a musical comedy but for the music the ordinary salutation in vienna as common as we hello be i have the honor -lrb- ich habe die ehre -rrb- in hungary -- of course one must not tell a hungarian that he be austrian -- people tell you that they be you humble servant before they say good morning and those who really be humble servant not only say kiss the hand but every now and then do it it be natural therefore perhaps that the austro-hungarian should treat war correspondent -- often in these day suppose to be extinct -- not only seriously but with a certain air they have not only the air but indeed a more elaborate organization than any of the other belligerent at the beginning of the war england permit no correspondent at all at the front france be less rigid yet it be month before group of observer begin to be take to the trench germany take correspondent to the front from the first but these excursion come at irregular interval and admission to they involve a good deal of competitive wire-pulling between the correspondent themselves the austro-hungarian on the other hand prepare from the first for a large number of civilian observer include news and special writer photographer illustrator and painter and to handle they satisfactorily organize a special department of the army this presse-quartier once admit to which -- the fakir and fly-by-night be suppose to be weed out by the preliminary red tape -- they be assume to be serious workman and treat as the army 's guest the presse-quartier be divide into two section : a executive section with a commandant responsible for the arrangement of trip to the various front and the general business of censorship and publicity and a entertainment section so to speak also with its commandant whose business it be to board lodge and otherwise look after correspondent when they be not on trip to the front at the time i visit the presse-quartier the executive section be in teschen the correspondent live in nagybiesce two or three hour ' railroad journey away it be to this village -- the most novel part of the scheme -- that i have come that afternoon and here some thirty or forty correspondent be live write past adventure set forth on new one or merely invite they soul for the moment under a regime which combine the function of tourist ' bureau rest-cure and a sort of military club for the time be they be part of the army -- feed lodge and transport at the army 's expense and unable to leave without formal military permission they be suppose to enlist for the whole war so to speak and most of the austro-hungarian and german correspondent have so remain -- some have even write book there -- but observer from neutral country be permit to leave when they feel they have see enough isolate thus in the country the only mail the military field post the only telegram those that pass the military censor correspondent be as safe as in siberium they on the other hand have the advantage of a established position of live inexpensively in pleasant surroundings where they relation with the censor and the army be less those of policeman and of suspicious character than of host and guest to be welcome here after the usual fretful dangling and wire-pulling in war office anteroom and city hotel -- with hill and ruin castle to walk to a brook ripple under one 's bedroom window and all the time in the world -- seem idyllic enough we be quarter in private house and as there be one man to a family generally he be put in the villager 's room of honor with a tall porcelain stove in the corner a feather bed under he and another on top each man have a soldier servant who look after boot and luggage keep he supply with cigar and cigarette from the quartier commissariat -- for a paternal government include even tobacco -- and charm the simple republican heart by whack he heel together whenever speak to and fling back jawohl we breakfast separately whenever we feel like it on the roll with the glass of whip cream and coffee usual in this part of the world lunch and dine -- officer and correspondent -- together there be soldier waiter who with military precision tell how many piece one might take and on every table big carafe of hungarian white wine drunk generally instead of water for beer one pay extra the commandant and he staff include a doctor and the officer guide not on excursion at the moment sit at the head of the long u-shaped table any one who come in or go out after the commandant be seat be suppose to advance a bit into this u catch he eye bow and receive he return nod the silver click of spur of course accompany this salute when a officer leave the room and the austro-hungarian and german correspondent generally snap they heel together in semi-military fashion all we going and coming indeed be accompany by a good deal of manner people who have see each other at breakfast shake hand formally half a hour later in the village square and one bow and be bow to and hear the singsong ` habe die ehre a dozen time a day nagybiesce be in northern hungary and the peasant round about be slovak -- sturdy solid blond people with leg the same size all the way down many of they still reap with scythe and thrash on the barn floor with old-fashioned flail and one afternoon there be a curious plaintive singing under my window -- a party of harvester oldish man and brown barefooted peasant girl who have finish they work on a neighbor farm and be cross we village on they way to they own the quartier naturally stir thing up a good deal in nagybiesce there be one week when we could not go into the street without be surround by little girl with pencil and card ask for we autogram the candy shop keep by two girl wife whose husband be at the front do a vast business and the young woman have somebody to talk to all day long the evening the news come that warsaw have fall candle be light in all the window on the square and the band with the villager behind it come to serenade we as we be at dinner the commandant bow from the window but a young hungarian journalist lean out and without a moment 's hesitation pour forth a torrent for fully fifteen minute with scarce a pause for breath i tell he that such impromptu oratory seem marvellous but he dismiss it as nothing i be politiker he explain with a wave of he hand one day a man come into lunch with the news that he be off on the best trip he would have yet -- he be go back to vienna for he ski to go down into the tyrol and work along the glacier to the battery position another man a budapest painter start off for a indefinite stay with a army corps in bessarabium he be to be indeed part of the army for the time be and all he work belong to the army first as this be be write a number of painter send out on similar expedition have be give a exhibition in vienna -- portrait and pencil sketch much like those frederic remington use to make foreigner not intend to remain in austria-hungary could not expect such privilege naturally but if they be admit to the quartier at all they be send on the ordinary group excursion like the home correspondent themselves indeed the wonder be -- in view of the comparative ease with which neutral correspondent drift about europe : the naivete to put it mildly with which the wildest romance have be print in american newspaper that we be permit to see as much as we do when a group start for the front it leave nagybiesce in its own car which except when the itinerary include some large city -- lemberg for instance -- serve as a little hotel until they come back again the car be a clean second-class coach of the usual european compartment kind two man to a compartment and at night they bunk on the long transverse seat comfortably enough we take one long trip of a thousand mile or so in this way take we own motor on a separate flat car and even a orderly servant for each man each of these group be of course accompany by a officer guide -- several be detail at the quartier for this special duty -- whose complex and nerve-racking task it be to answer all question make all arrangement report to each local commandant pass sentry and comfortably waft he flock of civilian through the maze of barrier which cover every foot so to speak of the region near the front the thing correspondent be permit to see differ from those see on the other front less in kind than in quantity more trip be make but there be and can be little place for a civilian on a front any spot in which over a strip several mile wide from the heavy artillery position of one side to the heavy artillery of the other may be in absolute quiet one minute and the next the center of fire there be no time to bother with civilian during a offensive and if a retreat be likely no commander wish to have country describe which may presently be in the hand of the enemy hide battery in action reserve move up wound come back flier trench quiet for the moment -- this be about as close to actual fight as the outsider under ordinary circumstance can expect to get on any front the difference in austria-hungary be that correspondent see these thing and the battle-field and capture city not as mere outsider pick up from a hotel and presently to be drop there again but as in a sense a part of the army itself they have they commandant to report to they camp and uniform -- the gold-and-black presse-quartier arm band -- and when they have finish one excursion they return to headquarters with the reasonable certainty that in another ten day or so they would start out again chapter xiv cannon fodder at the head of each iron bed hang the nurse 's chart and a few word of history these history have be take down as the wound come in after they muddy uniform have be remove they have be bath and could sink at last into the bless peace and cleanness of the hospital bed and through they as through the large end of a telescope one look across the hot summer and the hungarian field now dusty and yellow to the winter fighting and freezing in the carpathian possibly the doctor say you would like to see one of these case the young fellow be scarce twenty a strapping boy with fine tooth and intelligent eye he look quite well you could imagine he pitch hay or dance the czarda with he hand on he girl 's waist and she hand on he as these hungarian peasant dance round and round for hour together but he would not dance again as both he foot have be amputate at the ankle and it be from the stump that the doctor be unwrap the bandage the history read : while do sentry duty on the mountain on march 28 we be leave twenty-four hour without be relieved and during that time my foot be freeze the doctor speak with professional briskness he himself would not have try to save any of the foot -- better amputate at once at the line of demarcation get a good flap of healthy tissue and make a proper stump that scar tissue 'll never heal -- it 'll always be tender and break when he try to use it he have be here four month now and you can see how tender it be the boy scowl and grin as the doctor touch the scar for we english and those thing under the sheet he seem to have much the same feeling of strangeness : both be something foreign rather uncomfortable he look relieve when the bandage be on again and the white sheet draw up we have dozen of they during the winter -- one hundred and sixty-three frozen foot and one hundred frozen hand in this hospital alone they have to be drive back from the front in cart for day sometimes when they get here they foot be black -- literally rot away nothing to do but let the flesh slough off and then amputate we stroll on down the sunny clean-smelling ward the window be open they be play tennis in the yard below on a bench under a tree a young hungarian soldier one arm in a sling and a girl be read the same book Sunday be a very genial day in budapest the café table be crowd orchestra play everywhere and in dozen of pavilion and on the grass and gravel outside they peasant and the humbler sort of people be dance the danube -- beautiful if not blue -- flow through the town pest be on one bank and buda on the other beside a wooded hill climb steeply up to the old citadel somewhat as the west bank of the hudson climb up to storm king i first come on the danube at budapest in the evening after dinner and see close in front of I what look to be some curious electric-light sign it seem odd in war time and i stare for a moment before i see that this strange design be really the black opposite bank with its zigzag stream of lamp few city have so naturally beautiful a drop-curtain and instead of spoil it with gas-works ' and grain-elevator as we should do the hungarian have be thoughtful enough to build a tree-covered promenade between the danube and the string of hotel which line the river in front of each of these hotel be a double row of table and a hedge and then the tree under which while the orchestra play all pest come to stroll and take the air between coffee-time and the late hungarian dinner hundred of city have some such promenade but few so genial and cosey a one as that of budapest -- not the brittle gayety of some more sophisticated capital but the simpler light-heartedness of a people full of feel fond of music and talk and ready to share all they have with a stranger the band play tune from we musical comedy but every now and then -- and this be what the people like best -- they swing into the strange rolling passionate-melancholy music of the country wherever the tzigany music come from it seem hungarian at any rate -- fiery and indolent and haphazard rolling on without any particular rhyme or reason now pile up and now sink indolently back as the wave roll up and fall back on the sand people will listen to it for hour and you can imagine one of those simpler daredevil -- a hussar for instance -- in he blue-braided jacket red breeches and big cavalry boot listen and drink and think of the fight he have win and the girl he have lose get sorry for himself at last and break he glass and weep and be very happy indeed there be a club in budapest -- at once a club and a luxurious villa almost too crowd with rug and fine furniture when you go to play tennis instead of the ordinary locker-room one be usher into a sort of boudoir fill with chippendale furniture it be a delightful place to get exercise with tea serve on a garden table between set yet when i be in budapest the place be almost desert it be not it seem the season that people come there although just the season to use such a place for six week they come here and nothing could bring they back again they do thing only in spurt so to speak : they go off on hunting trip to the end of the earth bring back animal for the zoo then off to they country place and -- flop then there be a racing season and they play polo and race for a while then -- flop i have never see such interesting photographer ' show-window as there be in budapest partly this be because the photographer be good but partly it must he in the hungarian themselves -- such vivid interesting unconventional face these people look as if they ought to do the act and write the music and novel and play and paint the picture for all the rest of the world if they have not do so it must be because along with they natural talent they have this indolence and tendency to flop and not push thing through it be this budapest so easy-going and cheerful that come drift through the hospital window with the faint sound of band music that Sunday afternoon on all the park bench and the path wind up to the citadel in a hundred shady corner and walk soldier with cane and bandage be sit with they best girl laugh with they hold hand the boy with miniature flower-garden in they hat tinsel grass and red-white-and-green rosette could sit with they arm round they sweetheart as much as they want to for everybody know that they have just be call to the color and this be they farewell i look over more of the history -- not in the ward where one be of course more or less a nuisance but in the room where they be file in hundred lot some of the man be still in the hospital some have die most of they go back to the front there be many of these foot case : while on outpost duty in the carpathian during a snow-storm i feel the lower part of my body become powerless not be able to walk be carry back and put on train next day we be stop because russian be ahead of we and oblige to leave train wait two day without food or medical attention then put on train for budapest my regiment be in the carpathian and on or about January 20 my foot refuse to obey i hold out for four day and then report ill toe amputate right foot i belong to german grenadier regiment no -- on February 6 while sleep in open snow i feel numbed in foot put on light duty but on 8th report ill and doctor declare foot freeze march 12 during heavy snowstorm russian attack we one of my comrade be shoot in stomach and i take off my glove to bandage he all at once we regiment sound ` storm ' and i have to rush off to attack forget my glove i have both my hand freeze i be field-cornet of the -- german grenadier i be since the beginning of the war in belgium and france and at end of November send to russian poland and January 1 to carpathian on February 6 while retire to prevent the russian surround we i be shoot in thigh at 1500 yard distance and fall within a few minute i get two more shot that be just like a german comment the nurse they always begin by tell just who they be and what they be do a hungarian would probably just say that he be up in the mountain and it be cold these soldier be like big child some of they and they tell we thing sometimes while in carpathian on January 20 i report to my lieutenant foot freeze he say dig a hole and when you be quite freeze we will put you in i stand it another seven day then we have to retreat i go myself to the doctor my foot be then black already debreczen hospital six day then here both amputate the foot be go at any rate whatever the lieutenant may have say we return to the german field-cornet he come in walk -- a fine tall man we have only one place to bathe the man in then : a big tank -- for everything be improvise and there be no hot-water heater -- and one of the doctor tell he he could use he own bath up-stair but he say no he would stay with he man he seem to be get on all right then one morning the doctor touch he leg and he hear that crackle sound -- it be gas infection they just slit he leg down from hip to knee but it be no use -- he die in three hour practically all the wound be infect when the man come in but suppose he could have pick up something in that bath he come in walk through most of the german history one could see the german army turn now this way now that against they world of enemy as they say : i belong to -- regiment german infantry and be station since march 1 in carpathian i be in active service since the start have do belgium france and russium while at battle of luneville with troop of about forty man storm battery capture they for which decorate with iron cross shift to carpathian after march in severe cold finger and foot freeze while in france attack i be hit in head by shrapnel in hospital fourteen day then send to carpathian on December 7 with austro-hungarian troops wound in arm and while creep back hit five time in fifteen minute lay all afternoon in trench i think those be the three who come in together one night all singing ` die wacht be rhein ' they all have the iron cross they be a noisy lot they all get well and go back to the front again here be three picture from the galician fighting : wound by shrapnel near przemysl bandage by comrade and help to house only occupant old woman lay on straw two day no food call to man pass they have I move in cart seventy mile to hospital stay eight day start on train then take off for three day then to budapest during fight at lupkow pass i be wound by two pistol-shot first one fire by russian officer hit I in chest run back to my company and in darkness take by one of we officer for russian and shot in arm while digging trench strike by a rifle-bullet in two place lay in trench two hour when find by russian infantryman who hurriedly dress I and put I out of firing-range on horse blanket in old trench later find by we soldier carry to base and dress there then to field-hospital then in cart to railroad station go few kilometre by train but become so ill have to be take off for two day then send to budapest seventeen day two month in hospital return to front we call that man ` professor ' say the nurse he be a teacher of some sort there be a boy here at the same time a pole but he could speak english : just out of the university -- cracow i think he be in serbium and be shoot through the temple he lose the sight of both eye several in the serbian fighting have strike river mine one who have be order to proceed across the river save near sabac remark that he be tell afterward they have strike a float mine and that seven be kill and thirteen wound the serbian campaign be not pleasant the serbian do not hold up they hand as the big childlike russian sometimes seem to have do they fight as long as they can stand then there be disease and lack of medical supplies and service ` they come in cover with mud and with fracture do up with twig -- just as they have be dress on the field sometimes a fractured hip would be bind with a good-sized limb from a tree reach all the way from the man 's foot to he waist yet the wonder be what nature and the tough constitution of these young man will do with intelligent help we come to what they call a face case wound November 4 in galicium by rifle-fire on right side of face and right hand dress by comrade then lose consciousness until arrive here -lrb- ` he probably mean ' explain the nurse ` that he be delirious and do not realize the time ' -rrb- physical examination -- right side of face blow away lower jaw break into several piece extend to left side tooth on lower jaw loose part of upper jaw go and tongue expose infected operate -- several piece of lower jaw remove and two piece wire together in front from the desk drawer the nurse pick out several photograph -- x-ray picture of little round shrapnel bullet embed in flesh of bone splintered by rifle-bullet and shoot through the surround flesh as if they have be explode one or two black foot cut off above the ankle one of a group of convalescent stand on the hospital step there he be she say pointing-to a man with a slightly crooked jaw -- the man whose history we have just read we save it it be not such a bad face after all the worst wound of course do not come to a hospital so far from the front as this -- they never leave the battle-field at all in turkey for instance where travel be difficult very few of those shoot through the trunk of the body ever get as far as constantinople -- nearly all of the patient be wound in the head arm or leg on over a thousand patient in this budapest hospital the follow statistics be base : rifle wound 1095 shrapnel 138 shell 2 bayonet 2 sabre 1 hand-grenade 1 frozen foot 163 frozen hand 100 rheumatism 65 typhoid 38 pneumonia 15 tetanus 5 gas infection 5 death 19 -- septicemia 7 pneumonia tetanus typhoid 1 it be dark when i start down-stair through that warm brooding stillness of a hospital at night the ward at the head of the stair be hush now and the hall lamp shine across the white trousers of a orderly dozing in he chair within the shadow of the door and past the screen draw in front of it dimly light the foot of the line of bed where the man lay sleep nothing could happen to they now -- until they be sound again and the order come to go out and fling themselves again under the wheel the doctor on duty for the night coat off be stretch on he sofa peacefully read under a green lamp and as i go down-stair past the three long ward the only sign of life be in a little circle of light cast by a single lamp over the bed of one of the new patient light up the upturned profile of a man and the fair hair of the young night nurse bend over he and silently change the cloth on he chest we dine late that evening on a open balcony at the top of the house people in vienna and budapest like to eat and drink in the open air below we lay the dark velvet of the park with a occasional lamp and beyond over the roof of pest the light of buda across the river up through the tree come the voice of man singing i ask what this might be they be man my friend explain who have have they leg amputate there be fifty-eight of they and the people who own the big empty garden across the street have set it aside for they to live in there they could sit in the sun and learn to walk on they artificial leg -- it be a sort of school for they i go to see it next morning -- this garden of legless man they be scatter about under the tree on bench two by two some with bandaged stump some with crutch some with no leg at all they hobble over willingly enough to have they picture take although one of they mutter that he have have he take seventy time and no one have send he a copy yet the matron gather they about she arrange they rather proudly so that they wound would show one look to be quite all right -- because he have artificial leg boot and all below the knee come say the matron show the gentleman how you can walk and the obedient man come wabble toward we in a curious slightly rickety progress like one of those toy which be wind up and set go on the sidewalk at the matron 's suggestion he even drop one of he cane he could almost stand alone indeed like some of the political argument for which million of healthy young fellow like he obediently go out to fight the augusta barracken hospital be on the outskirts of budapest -- a characteristic product of the war wholesale healing for wholesale maiming -- 1000 bed and all the essential in what two month before be a vacant lot by the railroad track the building be long one-story pine barracks just wide enough for two row of bed with a aisle down the center the space between the barracks be fill in thrifty european fashion with vegetable-garden and they be set on neat street through which the patient can be wheel or carry to and from the operating and dress room without go up or down stair train come in from the observation hospital near the front where all wound now stay for five day until it be certain they have no contagious disease and switch right up to the door of the receiving-room the man give they name pass at once to another room where they uniform be take away to be disinfect thence to the bathroom then into clean clothes and to bed it be a city of the sick -- of healing rather -- and on a bright day with crowd of convalescent sit about in they linen pajamas in the sun stretcher-bearer go back and forth the capable-looking surgeon with they strong kind face pretty nurse in nun-like white it all have the brisk rather jolly air of any vigorous organism go full blast ahead we have be through it see the ward of strap handsome childlike russian as carefully look after by the hungarian as if they be they own when we officer guide remark that in a hour or two a transport of four hundred new wound would be come in we wait in the receiving-room where a young convalescent have be bring out on a stretcher to see he peasant family -- a weather-beaten father a mother with a kerchief over she head two solemn little round-faced brother with tyrolean feather in they cap bench be arrange for those able to sit up clerk prepared three writing-desk orderly lay a row of stretcher side by side for fifty yard or so along the railroad track the transport be late the sun go and i go down to the other end of the yard to get a picture of some russian i have see two day before we have walk through they ward then and i remember one very sick boy to whom one of the nurse with we have give a flower she be wear and how he have smile as he put it to he face with he gaunt white hand it do not take long she have say when they get like that they have so little vitality to go on and some morning between two and five -- and sure enough he bed be empty now a troop-train be rush by as i come back cover with green branch and flower they go by with a cheer -- that cheer which sound like a cheer sometimes and sometimes when two train pass on adjoining track so fast that you only catch a blur of face like the windy shriek of lose soul then come a sound of band music and down the road outside the high wire fence a little procession lead by soldier in gray-blue playing chopin 's funeral march behind they come the hospital hearse priest and a weep peasant family the little procession move slowly behind the wail trumpet -- it be a honor give to all who die here except the enemy -- and must have seem almost a sort of extravagance to the convalescent crowd up to the fence who have see score of they comrade bury in a common trench opposite we the drum roll and the band begin the austrian national hymn then they stop the soldier escort fire they rule in the air that end the ceremony and the hearse move on alone then the convalescent drift back toward we most of they would soon be ready for the front again and many glad of it if only to be man in a man 's world again one of the nurse speak of some of the other she have know one man slash he hand with he knife in the hope of stay behind even the bravest must gather themselves together before the leap only those who have see what modern gun can do know how much to fear they for a week or so after they come in lot of they be daze they just lie there scarcely stir all that part of it -- the shock to they nerve -- we see more of than the doctor do when the word come to go out again they have all the physical symptom of intense nervous excitement even nausea sometimes the train come at last -- two long section of sleeping-car a officer step off click he heel and salute and the orderly start unload the man those who could walk at all be help from the door the other -- man with broken hip leg in cast and so on -- be pass out of the window on stretcher hold over the orderly ' head in the receiving-ward they be set down in row before the three table most of they clutch they papers as they come each man give he name and regiment and such particulars and the address of some one of he family to whom notice could be send it be one clerk 's duty to address a post-card tell he family of he condition and that he be in the hospital these card be already rule off into column in each of which the word lightly wound wound severely wound ill very ill be print in nine of the language speak in austria-hungary the clerk merely have to put a cross on the proper word here for instance be the lightly wound column in german hungarian and the other dialect : leicht verwundet konnyen megse-besult lehce ranen lekko raniony lecko ranenkus leggiermente jcrzto lako ranjen lahko ranjen usor ranit a number be russian -- fine big clear-eyed fellow with whom these genuine hun chat and laugh as if they be they own man on one stretcher come a very pale round-faced little boy about twelve with stubbly blond hair clip short and a enchanting smile he have be carry water for the soldier somebody say when a piece of shrapnel take off one of he foot possibly he be one of those little adventurer who run away to war as boy use to run away to sea or the circus he seem entirely at home with these man at any rate and when one of the hungarian bring he a big tin cup of coffee and a chunk of black bread he wriggle himself half upright and go to work at it like a veteran as soon as the man be register they be hurry out of they uniform and into the bathroom at the door two nurse in white -- so calm and clean and strong that they must have seem like goddess in that reek of steam and disinfectant and festering wound -- receive they ask each man how he be wound and quickly as if he be a child snip off he bandage unless the leg or arm be in a cast and turn he over to the orderly those who could walk use shower the other be bath on inclined slab even the worst wounded scarcely make a sound and those who could take care of themselves limp under the shower as if they have be hospital boarder before and wait for and even demand with a certain peremptoriness they little bundle of belongings before they go on to the dressing-room discipline possibly though one could easily fancy that all this organize kindness and comfort suddenly envelop they be enough to raise they for the moment above thought of pain as they lift the man on the dressing-table and loosen the pillow-like bandage under he drawn-up thigh a thick sickening odor spread through the room as the last bit of gauze packing be draw from the wound the greenish pus follow and stream into the pan the jagged chunk of shell have hit he at the top of the thigh and plough down to the knee the wound have become infected and the connect tissue have rot away until the leg be now scarcely more than a bone and the two flap of flesh the civilian think of a wound generally as a comparatively decent sort of hole more or less the width of the bullet itself there be nothing decent about this wound it be such a slash as one might expect in a slaughter ox it have be slit farther to clean the infection until you could have thrust you fist into it and as the surgeon work the leg partly from weakness partly from the man 's nervousness tremble like a leaf first the gauze stuff into the cavity have to be pull out the man of a age that suggest that he might have leave at home a peasant wife slightly fade and weather-worn like himself cringe and dig he nail into the under side of the table but make no outcry the surgeon squeeze the flesh above and about the wound the quick-fingered young nurse flush the cavity with a antiseptic wash then clean dry gauze be push into it and slowly pull out again the man -- they have nickname he pop -- breathe faster this panting go into a moan which deepen into a hoarse cry and then as he lose hold of himself completely he begin a hideous sort of sharp yelp like a dog this be a part of war that doctor and nurse see not rarely and in one hospital but in all hospital and every morning when the long line of man -- ` pus tank ' we call 'em last winter mutter one of the young doctor -- be bring in to be dress there be such a leg that day in the barracken hospital the case describe here be in the american red cross hospital in vienna such individual suffering make no right or wrong of course it be a part of war yet the more one see of it and of this cannon fodder the people on whom the burden of war really fall how alike they all be in they courage simplicity patience and long-suffering whether hungarian or russian belgian or turk the less simple be it to be convince of the complete righteousness of any of the various general idea in whose name these man be tortured i suspect that only those can hate with entire satisfaction and success who stay quietly at home and read the papers i remember ride down into surrey from london one Sunday last August and read a editorial on louvain -- so well write so quiver with noble indignation that one 's blood boil as they say and one could scarcely wait to get off the train to begin the work of revenge perhaps the most moving passage in this editorial be about the smoking ruin of the town hall which i later see intact i have think occasionally since of that editorial and of the thousand of sedentary fire-eater and hate-monger like the writer of it -- man who live forever in a cloud of word bounce from one nervous reaction to another without ever touch the ground and rejoice in they eloquence go down from they comfortable breakfast to they comfortable office morning after morning and demand slaughter annihilation heaven know what not -- man who could not endure for ten minute that small part of war which any frail girl of a trained nurse endure hour after hour every morning as part of the day 's work if i have stay in london and continue to read the lie of but one side i should doubtless by this time be able to loathe and despise the enemy with a entire lack of doubt discomfort or intelligence but have be in all the country and read all the lie the problem be less simple how many people who talk or write about war would have the courage to face a minute fractional part of the reality underlie war 's inherit romance people speak with pleasant excitement of flash sabre without the remotest thought of what flash sabre do a sabre do not stop in mid-air with its flash where a meissonier or a detaille would paint it -- it go right on through the cord and vein of a man 's neck sabre wound be not very common but there be one in the vienna hospital that morning -- a v-shaped trench in which you could have lay four finger fiat down through the hair and into the back of the man 's neck so close to the big blood-vessel that you could see it beat under its film of tissue -- the only thing between he and death i thought of it a day or two later when i be read a book about the austrian army officer 's life write by a english lady and come across the phrase : ` sharpen sabre ' be the joyful cry be joyful if you can when you know what war be and know it know also that it be the only way to do you necessary work the absurd and disgusting thing be the ignorance and cowardice of those who can slaughter a army corps every day for lunch with word and would not be able to make so trivial a start toward the crush they be forever talk about as to fire into another man 's open eye or jam a bayonet into a single man 's stomach among the utopian step which one would most gladly support would be a attempt to send the editor and politician of all belligerent country to serve a week in the enemy 's hospital chapter xv east of lemberg -- through austria-hungary to the galician front we leave nagybiesce in the evening climb that night through the high tatra stop in the morning at kaschau long enough for coffee and a sight of the old cathedral roll on down through the country of robber baron ' castle and tokay wine and come at length in the evening to munkac and the foot of the high carpathian this be close to the southernmost point the russian touch when they come pour down through the carpathian pass and one of the place in the long line where german and austro-hungarian join force in the spring to drive they back again munkac be where the painter munkacsy come from it be down to munkac through silesium and the tatra that the troop-train come in April while snow be still deep in the carpathian now it be a feeding-station for fresh troops go up and wound and prisoner come down the officer in charge have no notion we be come but no sooner hear we be stranger in hungary than we must come in not only to dinner but to dine with they at they table we have red-hot stuff paprika pod liptauer cheese mixed salmon-pink with paprika and these and other thing wash down with beer and cataract of hospitable talk some one whisper that a bit of cheese might come in handy in the breakfastless cholera-infested country into which we be go that night they insist we must take not merely a slice but a chunk as big as a small trunk we look at the soup-kitchen where they could feed two thousand a day and taste the soup we see the dressing-station and a few wounded wait there and all on such a breeze of talk and eloquent explanation that you might have think you have step back into a century when suspicion and worry and nerve be unknown the hungarian be like that -- along with they indolence and romantic melancholy -- lively and hospitable and credulous with stranger nearly all of they be good talker and by sheer fervor and conviction can make almost any phrase resemble a idea and a real idea as good as a play hungarian be useful when trench must be take by storm just as the sober tyrolean mountaineer be better for sharp-shooting and slow resistance one of the interesting thing about the austro-hungarian army as well of course as a inevitable weakness be the variety of race and temperament hide under these blue-gray uniform -- hungarian austrian croatian slovak czech thing in universal use like post-card and paper money often have they word print in nine language and a austro-hungarian officer may have to know three or four in order to give the necessary order to he man and he man can not fight for the fatherland as the german do they must rally round a more or less abstract idea of nationality and one of the surprise of the war doubtless to many people have be that its strain instead of disintegrate appear to have beat this loose mass together at the table that evening be a middle-aged officer and he aid on they way to a new detail at the front they be simple and soldier-like and after the flash bosom of the sedentary hinterland it be pleasant to see these man who have be on active service since the beginning without a single medal the younger hungarian be one of those slumber daredevil who combine a compact rugged shape -- strong wrist hair low on the forehead -- with the soft voice and shy manners of a girl he speak a little german and english in the slow almost plaintive hungarian cadence but all we could get out of he about the war be that it have make he so tired -- so ` mude ' he have go to school in zurich but could not tell we swiss lieutenant the name of he teacher -- he could not remember anything any more he say with he plaintive smile he have a little factory in budapest and have go back on furlough to see that thing be ship-shape but it be no use he could not tell they what to do when he get there common enough we captain guide observe he have be in the fight along the san until invalide back to the presse-quartier and there be time then he say when for day it be hard for he to remember he own name we climb up into the mountain in the night and he have we up at daylight to look down from creak six-story timber bridge build by the austro-hungarian engineer to replace the steel railroad bridge blow up by the russian we pass a tunnel or two a big stockade full of russian prisoner mill round in they brown overcoat and down from the pass into the village of skole here we be to climb the near-by height of ostry which the hungarian of the corps hoffmann storm in April when the snow be still on the ground and orientiren ourselves a bit about this carpathian fighting i have look back at it through the history and the amputated foot and hand in the hospital at budapest -- now in the muggy air of a late August morning we be to tramp over the ground itself there be in this party of rather leisurely reporter a tall wise slow-smiling young swede who have go to sea at twelve and be captain of a destroyer before leave the navy to manage a newspaper a young polish count amiably interested in many sort of learning and nearly all sort of lady -- he have see some of the carpathian fighting as a officer in the polish legion one of the swiss citizen officer -- one can hear he now whack he heel together whenever he be present and fairly hissing oberleutnant w -- aw schweiz and a young bulgarian professor who speak german and a little french but unlike so many of the bulgarian of the older generation who be educate at robert college no english the bulgarian be intensely patriotic and there be nothing under sun moon or star which this young man do not compare with what they have in sofia german tactic russian novel sky-scrapers music steamship -- no matter what -- in a moment would come he bei uns in sofia -- -lrb- with we in sofium -rrb- and he characteristic febrile gesture thumb and forefinger join other finger extend pump emphatically before he face then there be we captain guide from the regular army a volunteer automobile officer a soldier servant for each man -- for the austrian do such thing in style -- and even on a separate flat car we own motor the carpathian here be in the neighborhood of three thousand five hundred foot high -- a tangle of pine-covered slope as steep as a roof sometimes and remind one a bit of we oregon cascade on a much-reduced scale you must imagine snow waist-deep the height furrow with trench the frosty balsam stillness split with scream shell and shrapnel and the rat-tat-tat of machine gun imagine yourself flounder upward with winter overcoat blanket pack rifle and cartridge-belt -- any one who have snow-shoe in mountain in midwinter can fancy what fight mean in a place like this man 's foot and hand be freeze on sentry duty or merely while asleep -- for the soldier sleep as a rule in the open merely huddle in they blanket before a fire -- the severely wound simply drop in the snow and for most of they no doubt that be the end of it puffing and steam in we rain-coat we climb the fifteen hundred foot or so to the top of the mountain up which the russian have build a sort of cork-screw series of trench twist one behind the other we reach one sky-line only to find another look down at we barbed-wire entanglement and spanish rider cross the slope in front of they -- it be the sort of place that look to a civilian as if it could hold out forever the difficulty in country like this be of course to escape flanking fire you fortify yourself against attack from one direction only to be enfilade by artillery from some ridge to right or leave that be what the austrian and german do and follow they artillery with a infantry assault capture one of the upper russian trench from this it be only a matter of a few hour to clear out the other except for the visit of a few peasant the battle-field have scarcely be touch since the snow melt the hillside be pepper with shell hole the trench litter with old hand-grenade brown russian over-coat the rectangular metal cartridge clip case -- about like biscuit tin -- which the russian leave everywhere and some of the brush-covered shelter in which the russian have live with they spoon and wet papers and here and there a cigarette box or a tube of tooth-paste might have almost be live in yesterday the valley all the way back to skole be string with the brush and timber shelter in which the russian have camp -- the first of thousand of cut-up pine-tree we be to see before we leave galicia all the drab and dreary side of war be in that little mountain town -- smash house sidewalk street and fence splash with lime against cholera store close or just keep alive and here and there sign threaten spy and state that any one find carry explosive or build fire would be shoot i go into one fairly clean little cafe where it seem one might risk a cup of tea -- you be not suppose to drink unboiled or unbottled water in such neighborhood -- and the dismal old jew who keep the place tell I that he have be there since the war begin he make a sour face when i say he must have see a good deal a lot he could see he say six month in a cellar gesteckt there be a certain amount of cholera all through eastern galicium especially among the peasant not so well house often as the soldier and not nearly so well feed and take care of every one who go into galicium have to be vaccinate for cholera and in the army this have all but prevent it in a whole division living in a cholera-infected neighborhood there would be only one or two case and sometimes none at all the uncomfortable rumor of it be everywhere however and one be not suppose to eat raw fruit or vegetable and in some place hand-shaking even in a officer ' mess be prohibit russian prisoner be work about the station as they be all over eastern austria-hungary -- big blond easy-going child apparently quite content we warsaw pole talk with one of they who seem to mourn only the fact that he do not have quite so big a ration of bread as he have have as a soldier he have come from siberium where he have leave a wife and three child -- four maybe by this time he say some rascally austrian might have make another one beyond skole we leave the mountain -- look back at that impose wall on the horizon one could fancy the russian come down from the north and think there we shall stand -- and ride northward through a pleasant shallow valley country past ruthenian settlement with they three-domed church and house steep-roofed with heavy thatch some of these ruthenian follow the little russian of the south gogol 's country be not enthusiastic when the russian come through among other the russian government have make great propaganda give money for church and so on so that the apparently guileless peasant occasionally reveal artillery position the austrian say by drive they cattle past they or by smoke signal from cottage chimney we stop for dinner at strij another of those drab dusty half-jewish town fill now with german and austro-hungarian soldier officer proclamation and all the machinery of a staff headquarters and the next morning roll into lemberg the russian capture it in the first week of the war hold it through the winter and then after the czar have from a balcony in the town formally annex it to the empire forever and a day in April the austro-hungarians retake it again in June there be smash window in the railroad station but otherwise to a stranger come in for the first time lemberg seem swing along a big modern city of some-two hundred thousand people almost as if nothing have happen with a officer from general bom-ermolh 's staff and map we drive out to the outlying fortification where the real fighting have take place the concrete gun position the permanent infantry protection with loophole in concrete and all the trench and barb wire look certainly as if the russian have intend to stay in lemberg the full explanation of why they do not must be leave for the present what happen at one fortified position a few mile southwest of lemberg be plain enough here in pleasant open farming country be a concrete and earth fort protect by elaborate trench and entanglement in front of which for nearly a mile across the field be a open field of fire infantry might have charge across that open space until the end of the war without get any nearer but the offensive do not of course try that over behind distant clump of tree and a wooded ridge on the horizon they plant they heavy battery on a space perhaps three hundred yard long some sixty of these heavy gun concentrate they fire the infantry push up under its protection the fort fall and the garrison be capture with it it be by such use of artillery that herd of prisoner be sometimes gather in just before the charge infantry reach the trench the cataract of artillery fire which have be pour into it be suddenly shift back a few hundred yard where it hang like a curtain shut off escape the success of such tactic demand of course finish work from the artillery-man and perfect co-ordination between artillery and infantry at lunch a few day later in cracow a young austrian officer be tell I how they have once arrange that the artillery should fire twenty round and on the twenty-first the infantry without wait for the usual bugle signal to storm should charge the trench at the same instant the artillery-man be to move up they range a couple of hundred yard the maneuver be successful and the russian catch huddle under cover before they know what have happen though lemberg 's cafe be gay enough and the old jew in gaberdine with the orthodox curl dangle before each ear doze peacefully on the park bench still the russian be only a few hour ' motor drive to the eastward and next morning we go out to see they all of the country through which we drive be in a way the front -- begin with the staff head-quarter and go on up through wagon-train reserve horse camp ammunition-station and so on to the first-line trench themselves sweep up through this long front on a fine autumn morning be to see the very glitter and bloom of war wound and suffer burned town and broken life -- all that be forget in the splendid panorama -- man and motor and flier and gun the cheerful smell of hay and coffee and horse the clank of heavy truck and the jangle of chain all in beautiful harvest country in the contagion of push on shoulder to shoulder and the devil take the hindmost toward something vastly interesting up ahead every one be well and strong and the least of they lift up and glamour over by the idea that unite they all the pettiness and smallness of every-day existence seem brush aside for no one be work for money or himself and every man of they may be ride to he death flippant young city butterfly jump to they foot and gravely salute when they elder enter the loutish peasant fling up he chin as if he would defy the universe what a strange and magic thing be this discipline or team-work or whatever you choose to call it by which some impudent waiter for instance who yesterday would have growl at he tip will to-day fling he chin up and he hand to he side and beam like a boy merely because he captain show guest through the camp deign to peer into he mess-can and slapping he affectionately on the cheek ask he if the food be all right we whiz into the village of kamionka on the upper bug across which the russian have be drive only a few day before they trench be just within the wood a scant mile away and the smoke of they camp-fire curl up through the tree across the much-talked-of bug which resemble here a tide-water river split with swampy flat be the trench they have leave they trail along the river bank bent with it almost at a right angle and the austro-hungarian battery have be so place that a crisscross fire enfilade each trench from the attic observation station into which we climb the officer direct the attack could look down the line of one of the trench and see they own shell rip it to piece it be a sight you could see once in a lifetime say one of the young artillery-man still string up with the excitement of the fight -- exactly what be say to I at arus bumu by a turkish officer who have see the triumph go down that attic be like a scene in some military melodrama with its tattered roof its tripod binoculars peer at the enemy the businesslike officer dusty and unshaven the field-telegraph operator squat in one corner with a receiver strap to he ear we walk across the rafter to a adjoining room where there be two or three chair and a old sofa have schnapps all round and then go out to walk over the position in front be the wabbly foot-bridge run across by the pioneer and on the swampy flat the little heap of sod throw up by the first line as they push across -- wade up to they neck part of the way -- under fire on the near bank the austro-hungarian trench have run between the tomb of a old jewish burying-ground and from the earth wall here and there project a bone or a crumble skull the russian trench on the other bank wound through a farmyard in the same impersonal way -- pig-pens orchard chicken-coop all thought of merely as shelter it be just to the left of a pig-pen that a russian officer have hold he machine gun until the last minute pour in a flank fire he do he work be the young officer 's comment we lunch with a corps commander and dine with a genial old colonel and he staff and between time motor through level farming country to a position to the northward on the rata a tributary of the bug both side be watch each other here from they sausage-shaped captive balloon and a few aeroplane be snoop about but at the moment all be quiet the austro-hungarian have be wait here for over a fortnight and the artillery-man have polish up they battery position as artillery-man like to do when they have time two be in a pasture so neatly roof over with sod that a birdman might fly over the place until the cow come home without know gun be there another hide just within the shadow of a pine forest be as attractive as some rich man 's mountain camp the gun position as snug as yacht cabin the officer 's lodge make of fresh sweet-smelling pine log and in a little recess in the tree a shrine have be build to st barbara who look out for artillery-man the infantry trench along the river cut in the clean sand and neatly timbered and loopholed be like model trench on some exposition ground through these loophole one could see the russian trench perhaps a mile away and in between the peasant woman bright red and white splash in the yellow wheat be calmly go ahead with they harvest all along the galician front we see peasant work thus and regard this elaborate game of war very much apparently as busy farmer regard a draghunt or a party of city fisherman at one point we have to come out in the open and cross a foot-bridge please -- lieutenant one of the soldier protest as the officer with we step out standing erect it be not safe the officer crouch and hurry across and so do we but just before we do so up out of the field where they have be mow straight through this gap come a little company of barefooted peasant woman with they bundle of gleanings on they head and talk in that singsong monotone of theirs as detach as so many bird they go pat-patting across the bridge if one of these woman could but write she impression of war they have do they part these peasant woman and old man and child all over galicium round the burn village right through barbed-wire entanglement up to the very trench stretch the yellow wheat somehow they have plough and sow and bring it to harvest and now with scythe with knife even sometimes they be get it under cover at home we know gleaner generally only in rather sentimental picture here we see they day after day barefooted woman and child go over the stubble and pick up the forget wheat head and arrange they in one hand as if they be a bouquet there will be no wheat waste this year and with they everywhere be the russian prisoner swing scythe bind grain sometimes come down the road without even a guard sprawl in the sun on a load of straw it would be hard to find a place where war seem more a vast theatricalism than in some of these hungarian and galician neighborhood there seem to be no enmity whatever between captor and prisoner everywhere the latter be make themselves useful in the field in road-making about railroad yard and several officer tell I that it be surprising how many good artisan carpenter iron-worker and so on there be among they the russian get exactly the same food as the hungarian soldier and be pay a few cent a day for they work you would see man in the two uniform hobnob in the open freight-car as the work-train roll up the line and sometimes a score or so of husky russian work in the wheat guard by some miniature lone landsturm man of all the various war victim i have see these strike I as the most lucky -- they could not even like the wound be send back again we drive back through the dark that night and in the bright wave circle of a automobile search-light with the cool breath from the pine in we face see that long front roll back again now and then a soldier would step into the white circle and hold up he arm struggle between he awe of this snort motor with its imperial double-eagle flag and its sharp-voiced officer muffle in gray coat -- between he peasant 's habit of take off he hat and let such people blow by and he soldier 's order to stop every-thing that pass he stop we nevertheless and the pass be laboriously read in the light of he electric lamp before we go on again in the dark and quiet all the countless joint and wheel of the vast organism be still mysteriously turn once in a cloud of dust we pass troops march toward the front -- tired face laugh face -- the shout man in the road and then the glimpse of a couple of red cross man kneel by a soldier who have give out on the way once in the black pine cow drive by two little frightened peasant child once a long line of bearded jew bind with pack on they back for what be leave of they home a supply-train a clank battery and now and then other motor like ours with shroud gray figure streak by in a flash mist of dust next day swing southward into another sector of the front over beautiful rolling hill rather like the genesee valley we drum up a hill and come out at the top in a village square it have once be a white little village cling to the skirt of a old chateau -- the village of swirz and count lavasan 's chateau -- and both be now black and tumble wall in the center of the square people be singing -- a strange little crowd and strange mournful singing we think at first it be a funeral service for the woman be weep as they sing but as the auto-mobile sweep up beside they we see that it be man the woman be crowd round -- live man go away to war they be man who have not be call out because the russian hold the country and by one of fate 's irony now that the enemy have be beat and drive home they must go out and fight at a little table by the side of the square sit the recruit officer with he pen and ledger and the village school-master a grave intelligent-looking young man who must have hold such a place in this half-feudal village as he would have do a hundred year ago be do he best to glamour over the very realistic loss of these wife and sweetheart with patriotism 's romance he sing and obediently they all wail after he the old song of scatter poland -- poland be not lose yeszcze polska I zginela pokus my zygemy the song stop there be a word of command and the little squad start away the woman cling to they man and cry aloud the child hang to they skirt begin to wail too there be something creepy and horrible like the cry of tortured animal in that uncontrolled cry there in the bright morning sunshine the schoolmaster speak to they bluntly tell they to go back to they home and they work and obedient and a little quieter now they drift away with apron to they face and they little child cling to they skirt -- back to they cottage and the winter ahead this picture do not fit in very well with we rollick military panorama but we be soon over the hill and half a hour later be breakfast on pate-de-foie-gras sandwich and champagne with a charming old corps commandant at a round table set outdoors in a circle of tree that must have be plant for that very purpose cheer and stiffen by many bow and heel clicking and warm hospitality we hurry off to a artillery position near the village of olszanica just under the brow of a hill we be stop and tell that it be dangerous to go farther and we skirt off to the right under cover to the observation station itself more little swiss chalet more hospitable officer and out in front across a mile of open country the russian trench through a periscope one could see russian exercise they horse by ride they round the circle -- as silent and remote and of another world as a picture on a biograph screen you see that clump of tree say the young officer one of they battery be just behind there those be not real tree they be put there by the russian i swing the glass to the left pick up a company of man march hello hello he whisper then after a moment 's scrutiny : no -- they be we man after all war be not always so different from the old day when man have a time for fight and a time for go in to powder they wig the division commander stand a little behind we remark : we shall fire from the right-hand battery over behind the hill and then from the leave -- the one you pass near the road then turn to a officer at the field telephone he say you may fire now there be a moment 's pause from over the wood behind we come a whr-r-rong and out over the sunny field a shell go mill away to send back a faint report and show a puff of cotton above the trench to the right it be a bit short -- the next fall better another nod another whr-r-row \/ from somewhere behind we and this time the cottony puff be just short of the clump of tree where the russian have conceal they battery i pick up the spot through the glass and -- one might have know -- there be one of those eternal peasant calmly swing he scythe about fifty yard short of the spot where the shrapnel have explode i could see he straighten up glance at it then go on with he mowing again there be a certain elegance a fine spaciousness about these artillery-man and they work which make one more content with war again no huddle in muddy trench here wait to be smash by jagged chunk of iron -- everything clean aloof scientific exact a matter of fine wire cross on a periscope lens of elevation wind pressure and so on and everything in the wide outdoors and do so to say with a magnificent gesture people drive high-power motor-car and ride strong horse because of the sense of power it give they -- how about stand on a hill look over mile of splendid country to where a huddle of ant and hobby-horse speck -- say a battalion or two -- be just crawl around a hill or jam on a narrow bridge and then to scatter they herd they chase they from one horizon to another with a mere mr jone you may fire now and a wave of the hand the division commander take we back a mile or so to he headquarters for lunch the russian slowly wake up and send a few perfunctory shell after we as we go over the hill and here be another genial party with three hoch for the guest at the end even out here in empty galicium the soldier get they beer we be not quite so temperate as the russian the general smile a little alcohol -- not too much -- do 'em good a young lieutenant who sit next I regale I with he impression of thing in general the russian have squander ammunition he say in the early day of the war -- they would fire twenty round or so at a single cavalryman or anything that show itself they be short now but a supply would come evidently every now and then for they would blaze away for a day or so then there would be a lull again they be short on officer too but not so much as you might think because they keep they officer well back of the line generally they artillery be better than the infantry as a rule the latter shot carelessly and generally too high both he and the officer at my leave -- a big farmer-like commissary man -- speak most amiably of the russian the latter tell of one place where both side have to get water out of the same well and there be no trouble no he say in he deep voice they be not hose use the same word bad one would apply to a naughty boy they be a particularly chipper lot these artilleryman and when i tell the young lieutenant who have be assign to speak french to I under the notion that i be more at home in that language that i have stop at queen hotel instead of the st antoine in antwerp and that the belgian army have cross the scheldt and the pontoon bridge have be blow up directly in front of the hotel he say that he would certainly engage room there for the next bombardment as he wave good-by we be present while in lemberg to general bom-ermollus and lunch at the headquarters mess we also meet major-general bardolf he chief of staff and chief of staff of the assassinate crown prince the latter describe to we the campaign about lemberg and it be interesting to hear the rasping accent he give to a word like durchbrechung for instance as if he be a prussian instead of a austrian and to observe the frankness with which he ascribe the difference that have come over the spirit of the austro-hungarian army to the come of mackensen and the german west of lemberg the pleasant country lose its war-time air and in przemysl the two or three lonely landsturm man guard the wreck fortification twice take and twice blow up by retreat army light candle to take we through the smash gallery and accept a few heller when we come out with quite the bored air of professional museum guide the town of przemysl itself be untouched the greater part of the visible damage to the fort some distance outside the town be do by the dynamite of the retreat army in one place however we see the crater of one of the 42-centimetre shell which have be talk about oftener than they have be use the austrian thirty-point-fives have do much of the smash ascribe to the forty-two and ordinary work like that of bombard a city or infantry trench by cannon of smaller caliber a genuine forty-two have be drop here however we be tell on a building use by the russian to store ammunition and the building have simply disappear there be nothing left but a crater sixty or seventy foot across and eighteen to twenty foot deep we trail westward through tarnow where the great drive first break through and on to the pleasant old university city of cracow on the frontier of the poland of which it be once the capital and to which it belong until the partition of 1795 it be toward cracow that the russian be drive when they first start for berlin and they be but a stone 's throw away most of the winter we get to cracow on the emperor 's birthday and see a military mass on the great parade-ground with the commandant of the fort standing uncovered and alone face the altar behind he he staff and perhaps a hundred yard behind they and stretch for a quarter of a mile down the field the garrison at the interval in the mass the whole garrison fire salute the volley go down the field a battalion at a time now and then reinforce by the cannon on kosciusko hill cracow be polish in atmosphere and feeling and even in the few hour we be there one hear a good deal of polish hope and ambition the independence which russium be to grant must come now it would appear from some one else the pole want a king of they own but apparently they prefer to be under the wing of austrium rather than of germany the german who have lay rather a firm hand on the part of poland they have occupy might not fall in with this notion and one could detect here one of those cloud no bigger than a man 's hand which dramatist put in the first act and which often swell to interesting proportion before the final curtain go down chapter xvi in the dust of the russian retreat warsaw have fall and ivangorod and the center of the german and austro-hungarian army sweep across eastern europe like beater across a prairie be now before brest-litovsk this be the apex of this central triangle of russian fort a city and a rail-road center as well as a fortress and the last strongly fortify place on the direct road to moscow it seem as if the russian must make a stand here and even though we be four or five day get there the heavy artillery be not yet up and there might still be time we wind through the green hill and under the ruin castle of northern hungary in the afternoon roll slowly up across silesium and into russian poland in the night and come at noon to radom only sixty-five mile south of warsaw hindenburg have be here in October 1914 when he invade poland to draw off the russian from galicium then the russian offensive have roll over the place the russian have hold it all the winter now they be a hundred and fifty mile eastward -- beyond the vistulum and the bug -- boog not bug by the way -- and just hang to the edge of poland the war have scarcely touch budapest and vienna -- scarcely touch the ordinary city surface that be to say in hotel and cafe street and park life flow on almost as brightly as ever farther north in the hungarian town and village life still go on as usual but one feel the grip of war -- you might not go there nor move about without a military pass beyond radom where now in the pleasant park the very literary polish young people be stroll reading as they walk there be so to speak no ordinary life at all -- only the desert of war and the curious intense and complicated life of those who make it we car be hitch to a long transport-train -- for it would be another two day before the automobile would come back for we from the front -- and we ride into this desert polish country toward ivangorod it have all be fight over at least twice -- railroad station and farm building burn bridge dynamite telegraph-poles cut down the station now be mere board shelter for a commandant and a soldier ' lunch-room the bridge timber bridge fling across by the pioneer and the sawed-off telegraph-pole splice between railroad rail to save cut new one be stick back into the ground like fork the russian have a rather odd way of burn station and leave the rail the important thing intact but here and there they have neatly destroy they for mile by explode a cartridge under the end of each the country be level here -- field intersperse with dark pine forest plant in the european fashion to be grow and harvest like any other crop -- park of live telephone-post thick as the quill of a porcupine and through these pine and across the field be the eternal russian trench carefully build timber-lined sometimes roof and sod over with rifle hole under the eaves barbed-wire entanglement seven row deep sometimes trail in front of they through timber through the long grass and flower of marsh-land a wicked foggy band against the green as far as one could see along the galician front and in the carpathian i have see mile after mile of such trench timber-work wire and spanish rider leave behind good as new until it begin to seem as if war be a peculiarly absurd game consist principally in chop down good tree and digging ditch and then go somewhere else in front of ivangorod great preparation have be make there be no town here but the great fortress with its citadel barracks machine-shops garden church and protect fort be almost a city in itself it have a garrison of twenty thousand and its gigantic concrete wall cover over with earth and grass its moat and barb wire look formidable enough it have no modern heavy artillery however and even if it have artillery in a fix know spot be comparatively helpless against the mobile gun screen by hill and timber besieger can bring against it elaborate earthwork have therefore be throw up several mile to the west of the fortress but these become useless when the enemy cross the vistulum to north and south swing round to cut off the one way out -- the railroad to brest-litovsk the russian might have shut themselves in and wait -- not very long probably -- until the big thirty-point-fives smash the fort to piece they choose to get out in time blow up the railroad bridge across the bug burn the barracks and with enough dynamite to give a good imitation of a earthquake tumble the wall and gallery of the fortress into melancholy heap of rock it be dusk when we roll into ivangorod and into the thick of that vast and complicate labor which go on in the rear of a advance army -- all that laborious building up which follow the retreat army 's orgy of tear down -- bridge builder a acre or two of transport horse blacksmith and iron-worker a semi-permanent bakery the oven on wheel like thrashing-machine engine drop spark and send out a sweet warm steamy smell of corn and wheat it never stop this bakery night or day and the bread be pile up in a big tent near by like cord-wood and here you could see the amount of trouble that can be make by blow up a railroad bridge first of course a new timber bridge have to be fling across and the vistulum be a good two hundred yard wide here and the river be high up ahead the army be fight forward dependent for the moment on what come across that bridge a train arrive hundred of ton of freight which normally would roll across the river in a few puff of a cigarette the car must be open each box and sack take out by hand carry down a bank load into a wagon the wagon creep over the pontoon struggle through the sand on the other side then each piece must be unloaded and put on a train again a axle break the return line wait a hour for the other to cross a sixty-foot pine log for the new railway bridge wedge fast in turn a corner and stop everything -- you must imagine they at it all day sweating and swearing in all the dialect of the dual monarchy -- all night with fagged horse and driver daze with sleep in the blaze of a search-light reach out over the river meanwhile a tall timber railroad bridge be creep across there be no pile-driver engine and at each cluster of pile fifteen or twenty russian prisoner in they brown service uniform hang to as many rope -- heave whack heave whack -- in quaint retribution for what a few stick of dynamite have do a fortnight before a thousand fresh hungarian troops have just come in next morning and be wait for they coffee when the word come by field-telephone that a russian flier be drop bomb about twenty kilometre away it be fine hunting-ground -- man horse store and the new bridge -- but he sail away and we drive a dozen mile up the vistulum to new alexandrium burn during the envelop movement on ivangorod all along the way be trench telltale yellow line of sand wind among the pine gun position barb wire and every now and then a big plane-tree with ladder run up to a artillery observation platform i climb up one of they on cleat worn by russian boot for a look at the vistulum and the string of red cross barge fill with wound go up the river the child hereabout at any rate will revere the russian for they pioneer have carry that wind stairway up to the very tip-top of the tree in a manner only see in dream or picture-book all the farmhouse have be burn and the peasant be just return we pass several tired mother with baby in shawl hang from they shoulder and little boy trudge behind with some rusty kettle or coffee-pot and once a woman standing in the ruin of she house of which only the chimney be leave calmly cook she dinner new alexandrium a pleasant little town grow up round a old chateau and use as a sort of summer resort by warsaw people be nothing but blacken chimney and heap of brick the russian have burn everything and the inhabitant who have flee into the pine be just now begin to straggle back some have set up little stand in front of they burned house and be try to sell apple plum pear about the only marketable thing leave some be clean brick and try to rebuild some contented themselves with roofing over they cellar and while we be observe these domestic scene the army which have take the outer fort by assault the precede night be march into burn brest-litovsk it be another day before the motor come and we could get under way and whirl through such a cross-section of a modern army 's life as one could scarcely have see in the west of europe since the german first come roll down on paris no suburban warfare this none of that hideous burrow blow up methodically squash out yard after yard of trench and man this be war in the grand old style -- a army on the march literally down road smoky with dust and sunshine across bridge they own pioneer have build a river of man and horse wagon and gun from one hazy blue horizon to another and all these man have come from victory and know they be march to it how far they be go none could tell but the god be with they -- so might the grand army have look when it start eastward a hundred year ago man and horse have be pour down that road for week -- on each side of the macadam highway the level unfenced field be trample flat it be fully one hundred and twenty mile as the motor road run to brest-litovsk and there be scarce a moment when if we be not in the thick of they we be not at least in sight of wagon motor horse and man and of course this be but the rear of the army the fight man proper be up in front the dust hang like fog in the autumn sunshine driver be black with it in the distance on parallel road it climb high in the still air like smoke from burn village and out of this dust as we whiz on we soldier chauffeur whistle in mouth shriek for room appear pontoon train -- big steel scow on top beam underneath cut number and ready to put together train of light farm wagon wide at the top slant toward the middle commandeer from all over austria-hungary at the beginning of the war and drive some by soldier but oftener by civilian with the yellow austrian band on they arm heavy ammunition wagon draw by four horse with a soldier outrider astride one of the leader and from time to time column of reserve older man for the most part bind for guard duty probably shuffling along in loose order round and through these wagon-train in a swirl of dust rumble and sway big motor-truck and once or twice scatter everything with a lilting ta-te ta-da the gray motor the flash of scarlet pale blue and gold and the bronze begoggled imperial visage of some one high in command once we pass a big austrian mortar cover with tarpaulin by the side of the road and again two big 20-centimetre gun which have not have time to get up to brest-litovsk this be where you find the heavy artillery nowadays quite as likely as in a fort on some hard highway where it can easily be move and sheltered not behind concrete but some innocent-looking apple-tree each fence corner be chalk with letter and number intelligible to the driver who pass that way each bridge down to the few board across a ditch have be examine by the pioneer rebuild if necessary and a neat little sign set up on it tell whether or not the heavy artillery could safely cross flow back toward this huge confident onrushing organism the peasant -- timid halt weary and dust-covered with wagon heap with furniture bed hay for the horse with the littlest child and those too old to walk -- be return to the char ruin of they home they too -- like the grass -- have they unconquerable strength the same patience and quiet courage which have strike I in antwerp as peculiarly belgian be here again in these pole slovak and ruthenian whose boy perhaps be fight with the army which have drive the belgian out you would see peasant mother with they child hang from they shoulder -- woman who have be tramp for day perhaps and might have day yet to tramp before they reach the heap of char brick that have once be a home nearly all have a cow sometimes pull back on its halter and fill the air with lamentation sometimes harness with the horse to the family wagon they have they pet dog and bird the little girl they kitten from the front of one wagon poke the foolish head of a colt baby scarcely big enough to sit up cram they little finger into they eye to shut out the dust bigger child to whom the ride would be no doubt the event of they life laugh and clap they hand and old man on foot take off they cap after the fashion of the country and bow gravely as we whirl past it seem as if it be we who should do the salute from the field as we whirl into and out of layer of air sharply as one do in a motor come now the odor of ripe straw now a whiff of coffee from a goulash cannon steam away behind its troop like the calliope in the old-fashioned circus and now and then from some thicket or across a clover field the sharp dismaying smell of rot flesh the countryside lay so tranquil under the August sun that it be only when one see a dead animal lie in a open field that one recall the fire that a few day before must have crisscross this whole country as now doubtless in constant cavalry fight and rear-guard skirmish it be crisscross the country up ahead half a hour short of brest-litovsk a unfinished bridge turn we off into a potato field the soft ground have long since be pound flat as the army swing round to the north have cross on a pontoon a mile or two lower down the motor plunge snarled and stop and again as we shovel in front and push behind we know why army burn bridge behind they past we as we sweat there the slow but surer wagon-train plough forward one a german train stop beside we to bait they horse -- officer of the landwehr or landsturm type who look as if they might be as doubtless they be lawyer professor or successful business man at home they be from a class who with we would generally be helpless in the field yet these bronzed bearded thoughtful-looking man seem just as familiar with the detail of they present job as with the work they have leave behind ever since we have cross into poland this sober steel-gray stream have be mingle with and stiffen we lighter-hearted more boyish blue-gray stream of austrian and hungarian here be man who know what they be do believe in it and have the will to put it through one thought of emerson 's earnest of the north wind whenever they come in sight those who talk of frightfulness and get they notion of german soldier from the vaporing of sedentary publicist who know no more of they than may be see through the pipe smoke of they own editorial room be destine to a melancholy awakening you may prefer you own way but you can not make they prevail by blackguard the other man 's weakness you must beat he where he be strong lie and the snobbish ridicule with which we magazine and papers have be full run off man like these like water off a duck these man be in earnest they have work to do no one who have hear they sing the wacht be rhein through the starlight of garrison town all the way from the channel to the carpathian will talk of they be stolid but they have it be true no coltishness they be grow up and this discipline of theirs do not mean as so many people seem to think it do be compel to do what you do not want to do it mean do what you be tell to do as well as it possibly can be do no matter how small it be nor who be look on -- a sense of duty which make every switchman behind the line act as if he be von hindenburg the thing of theirs this will-power and moral earnestness be one of the thing that last -- something before which the merely frivolous have always go down and always will the road down which we be go be in a general way the path already take by the austrian and hungarian troops which have storm the outer work at kobilany two day before and be the first to enter the town what happen be much like what have happen at ivangorod a german corps cross the bug to north and south and close in on the rail-road the sixth austro-hungarian corps under corps general of infantry arz attack the center the russian send the entire civil population eastward remove they artillery and everything of value they could take and set fire to the city there be a brief artillery preparation to which the russian who all through this retreat appear to be short in ammunition and artillery reply for a time then the outer fort be storm and when the sixth corps enter the burn city the russian except for the rear-guard prisoner be go we swing past a freight yard litter with over-turned car through a tangle of wagon -- army wagon push one way and distract peasant the other -- over a pontoon across the narrow bug and on into the town a city of sixty-five thousand people with the exception of a church or two and house that could almost be count on one 's finger be a waste of gaping window and blacken chimney the russian ' purpose be not altogether clear for the town be they town and its destruction at this time of the year could not seriously embarrass a well-provisioned confident enemy but they have at any rate wipe it off the map not a woman a child a glimmer of peaceful life only smoulder ruin the occasional abandon rifle and cartridge-box of the army that have retire and the endless wagon-train of the army pursue they all the dust through which we have ride since morning seem to have gather over that dismal wreck it be a fog in the street on which darkness be already settle -- street without a lamp or a sound except that from the onflowing train through this dust we try to find the headquarters of the sixth army corps to its commander we pass take we and without he we have no reason for be in brest-litovsk nobody know where the sixth be two hungarian officer hurry by in a commandeered carriage shout back something about the church with a blue cupola somebody else say near the schnapps factory a beam young lieutenant help to disentangle wagon-train at the main street comer say that the sixth have march at three that morning we have drive all day with nothing to eat but a bit of war bread and chocolate we be black with dust there be not a crumb in the place that do not belong to the army and we sit there in the thickening dusk almost as much adrift as a raft in mid-ocean the two army -- wagon-train that be to say -- be cross each other at that corner the german be go one way the austro-hungarians the other -- tired dust-covered horse and man anonymous cog in the vast machine which have be follow the man ahead since the day before like enough and might go on into another day before they could make camp young hungarian officer greet one another gayly and exchange the day 's adventure and news young german ride by slim serious and self-contained now the stream would stop as one line try to break through the other puzzle driver would yank they horse back then some determine section commander would come charge back fling he horse into the tangle -- wagon tongue jam into the canopy in front protestation in german hungarian polish slovak goodness know what until at last one line give way and the other shot forward through the dust again i have be in another capture city with the besiege then and when i think of antwerp it be of the creepy bright stillness during the bombardment -- the autumn sun the smell of dead leave the shutter street without a sound except when a shell come scream in from the country or a block or so away there be a detonation and some facade come rumble down but when i think of brest-litovsk it will be of dust -- dust like fog and thicken with the smoke and twilight -- and that strange wild creak stream of wagon fight through it as they might have fight in the day when europe be young and whole race of man come pour over the frontier we start off finally on foot through street silent as the grave -- not a person not a lamp not so much as a bark dog as queer and as creepy as some made-up thing in a theater once we stumble past a naked and dismembered trunk set up beside a doorway -- a physician 's manikin that chance or some sinister clown have leave there once -- and one of the strangest sound i ever hear -- behind the closed up-stair shutter of a apothecary 's shop whose powder and poison be strew over the sidewalk a piano haltingly play with one finger at last a light a open door a sentry -- and this be indeed theatrical -- a light room and a long table set with candle flower and wine the commander of the sixth corps have just be decorate with the order pour le mérite and he and he officer be dine before take up the march he welcome we in the true hungarian style grab I by the arm and ask if i be hungry apologize for they frugal war-time fare tell how splendidly he man have behave have a word and a place for every-body as if we be all old friend there be three room full of officer and every-one half rise and bow in military fashion as we make we way between the table to we seat at the end of the third a amiable young signal-officer who have be at he telephone some thirty kilometre away when the city be take and be off at three next morning sit opposite I and tell with great spirit how the only common language between he and some of he polyglot man be the english he have learn in school and they have pick up in america we sleep on commandeered mattress that night on the floor of a vacant house with a few hungarian hussar still sing over the victory in the back yard and get up to find the crowded town of the night before as empty as the old camp-ground the day after the circus we stroll through some of the empty street and into the citadel where a handful of german soldier be guard a placid tan-colored little herd of russian prisoner recross the pontoon bridge as crowd as it have be the afternoon before and then stop at kobilany fort on the way back to ivangorod the brief austrian fire have be accurate there be shell hole inside the fort along the parapet and one frightful bull 's - eye which have strike square on the inner concrete rim and blow chunk of concrete as well as its own steel all over the place the rifle-men left in this embrasure be kill at a stroke and they blood remain freshly dry on the stone of various uncomfortable place i have see in the war this be one -- leave behind in a open concrete fort to cover the retreat of artillery and wait with a pop-gun rifle until the enemy decide that he artillery have silence you and that it be time to storm one outer angle of the fort have be blow up and the rest be to have be dynamite but a nimble pole fear that he might be blow up too before the order come to retire have so we be tell cut the electric wire just why brest-litovsk be give up must be leave for those who have have a more comprehensive view of all the cause behind the russian retreat it be plain to any one however that although this outer fortress have be take by storm and a certain amount of damage do to the attack force by mine lay in front of it scarcely more than nominal resistance consider the original preparation have be make again we whirl down the ivangorod road through a stream of wagon and peasant ' cart almost as thick as the day before we take a new road this time but the desert trench still cross the field and creep up toward they behind tree through the greasy black mud of pasture-land be those eloquent little shelter scarcely more than a basketful of earth throw up by the skirmisher as they run forward drop and dig themselves in we come to radom and turn southward again there be people smoke come from cottage chimney goose-girl with they spotless and absurdly peaceful goose once a group of peasant -- young man and barefooted girl -- sit on the grass rest from they work in the field as the train pass one of the boy fling he arm round the neck of the tan young nymph beside he and over they roll fight like good-natured puppy they be the very peasant we have see drag through the dust of the brest-litovsk road and this the same country though it look so strangely bright and warm and full of people war have blow over it that be all and life which be so much stronger than the strongest field-marshal which can be bent beat down and crushed some-time like the grass be grow back again the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of antwerp to gallipolus by
