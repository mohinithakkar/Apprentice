save the padre from be post as a deserter he have a uneasy feeling that peter would one day suddenly sicken of the war and that he would find himself in pari or on the riviera we have a uneasy feeling that peter would one day develop a curiosity as to the bosch horse ration and stroll across the line and we should lose the padre a thing we could ill afford to do for by this time he have take we under he wing spiritually and bodily on sunday he would appear in we midst drag a folding harmonium and hold church parade lead the hymn in he twitter bird-like voice then the spinster lady of he old
