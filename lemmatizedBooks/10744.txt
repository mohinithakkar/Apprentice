understand that please to begin with that you will at once and distinctly recall dr sharpe -- and he wife i make no doubt indeed it be because the history be a familiar one some of the unfamiliar incident of which have come into my possession that i undertake to tell it my relation to the doctor he wife and they friend have be in many respects peculiar without enter into explanation which i be not at liberty to make let I say that those portion of they story which concern we present purpose whether or not they fall under my personal observation be accurately and to the best of my judgment impartially related nobody i think who be at the wedding dream that there would ever be such a story to tell it be such a pretty peaceful wedding if you be there you remember it as you remember a rare sunrise or a peculiarly delicate may-flower or that strain in a simple old song which be like oriole and butterfly and dew-drop there be not many of we we be all acquaint with one another the day be bright and harrie do not faint nor cry there be a couple of bridesmaid -- pauline dalla and a miss -- jone i think -- besides harrie 's little sister and the people be well dress and well look but everybody be thoroughly at home comfortable and on a level there be no annihilating of little country friend in gray alpaca by city cousin in point and pearl no crowding and no crush and i believe not a single front breadth spoil by the ice harrie be not call exactly pretty but she must be a very plain woman who be not pleasant to see upon she wedding day harrie 's eye shine -- i never see such eye and she throw she head back like a queen whom they be crowning she father marry they old mr bird be a odd man with odd notion of many thing of which marriage be one the service be he own i afterwards ask he for a copy of it which i have preserve the covenant run thus : -- appeal to you father who be in heaven to witness you sincerity you do now take this woman whose hand you hold -- choose she alone from all the world -- to be you lawfully wed wife you trust she as you best earthly friend you promise to love to cherish and to protect she to be considerate of she happiness in you plan of life to cultivate for she sake all manly virtue and in all thing to seek she welfare as you seek you own you pledge yourself thus honorably to she to be she husband in good faith so long as the providence of god shall spare you to each other in like manner look to you heavenly father for he blessing you do now receive this man whose hand you hold to be you lawfully wed husband you choose he from all the world as he have choose you you pledge you trust to he as you best earthly friend you promise to love to comfort and to honor he to cultivate for he sake all womanly grace to guard he reputation and assist he in he life 's work and in all thing to esteem he happiness as you own you give yourself thus trustfully to he to be he wife in good faith so long as the providence of god shall spare you to each other when harrie lift she shine eye to say i _ do _ the two little happy word run through the silent room like a silver bell they would have tinkle in you ear for week to come if you have hear they i have be thus particular in note the word of the service partly because they please I partly because i have since have some occasion to recall they and partly because i remember have wonder at the time how many married man and woman of you and my acquaintance if honestly subject they union to the test and full interpretation and remotest bearing of such vow as these could live in the sight of god and man as lawfully wed husband and wife wedding be always very sad thing to I as much sadder than burial as the beginning of life should be sadder than the end of it the readiness with which young girl will flit out of a try prove happy home into the sole care and keep of a man whom they have know three month six twelve i do not profess to understand such knowledge be too wonderful for I it be high i can not attain unto it but that may be because i be fifty-five a old maid and have spend twenty year in boarding-house a woman read the grace of a man at sight he fault she can not thoroughly detect till she have be for year he wife and he fault be so much more serious a matter to she than hers to he i be think of this the day before the wedding i have step in from the kitchen to ask mr bird about the salad when i come abruptly at the door of the sitting-room upon as choice a picture as one be likely to see the door be open through the house and the wind sweep in and out a scarlet woodbine swing lazily back and forth beyond the window dimple of light burn through it dot the carpet and the black-and-white marbled oilcloth of the hall beyond in the little front parlor frame in by the series of doorway be harrie all in a cloud of white it float about she with a idle wavelike motion she have a veil like fret pearl through which she tinted arm shine faintly and the shadow of a single scarlet leaf tremble through a curtain upon she forehead she mother cry a little as mother will cry the day before the wedding be smooth with tender touch a tiny crease upon the cloud a bridesmaid or two sit chatter on the floor glove and favor and flower and bit of lace like hoar frost lay scatter about and the whole be repicture and reflect and reshade in the great old-fashioned mirror before which harrie turn herself about it seem a pity that myron sharpe should miss that so i call he in from the porch where he sit read stuart mill on liberty if you form you own opinion of a man who might spend a livelong morning -- a October morning quiver with color alive with light sweet with the breath of drop pine soft with the caress of a wind that have filter through mile of sunshine -- and that the morning of the day before he wedding -- read stuart mill on liberty -- i can not help it harrie turn suddenly see we -- meet she lover 's eye stand a moment with lift lash and bright cheek -- creep with a quick impulsive movement into she mother 's arm kiss she and float away up the stair it be a perfect fit say mr bird come out with one corner of a very dingy handkerchief -- somebody have just use it to dust the parian vase -- at she eye and though to be sure it be none of my business i catch myself say under my breath -- it be a fit for life for a _ life _ dr sharpe dr sharpe smile serenely he be very much in love with the little pink-and-white cloud that have just flutter up the stair if it have be drift to he for the venture of twenty lifetime he would have feel no doubt of the fit nor i be sure would harrie she steal out to he that evening after the bridal finery be put away and kneel at he foot in she plain little muslin dress she hair all out of crimp slip from she net behind she ear -- harrie 's ear be very small and shaded off in the color of a pale apple-blossom -- up-turn she flush and weary face put away the book please myron myron put away the book -lrb- somebody on bilious affection -rrb- and look for a moment without speak at the up-turned face dr sharpe have spasm of distrust himself amazingly perhaps most man have -- and ought to he face grow grave just then that little girl 's clear eye shine upon he like the light upon a altar in very unworthiness of soul he would have put the shoe from off he foot the ground on which he tread be holy when he speak to the child it be in a whisper : -- harrie be you afraid of I i know i be not very good and harrie kneel with the shadow of the scarlet leaf upon she hair say softly how could i be afraid of you it be _ i _ who be not good dr sharpe could not have make much progress in bilious affection that evening all the time that the sky be fading we see they wander in and out among the apple-tree -- she with those shine eye and she hand in he and when to-morrow have come and go and in the die light they drive away and miss dalla throw old grandmother bird 's little satin boot after the carriage the last we see of she be that she hand be clasp in he and that she eye be shine well i believe that they get along very well till the first baby come as far as my observation go young people usually get along very well till the first baby come these particular young people have a clear conscience -- as young people 's conscience go -- fair health a comfortable income for two and a very pleasant home this home be on the coast the townspeople make shoe and mind they own business dr sharpe buy the die practice of a antediluvian who believe in camomile and castor-oil harrie mend a few stocking make a few pie and watch the sea it be almost enough of itself to make one happy -- the sea -- as it tumble about the shore of lime harrie have a little seat hollow out in the cliff and a little scarlet bathing-dress which be surprisingly become and a little boat of she own moor in a little bay -- a pretty shell which she husband have have make to order that she might be able to row herself on a calm water he be very thoughtful for she in those day she use to take she sewing out upon the cliff she would be demure and busy she would finish the selvage seam but the sun blaze the sea shine the bird sing all the world be at play -- what could it matter about selvage seam so the little gold thimble would drop off the spool trundle down the cliff and harrie sinking back into a cushion of green and crimson sea-weed would open she wide eye and dream the wave purple and silver and break into a mist like powdered amber the blue distance melt softly the white sand glitter the gull be chatter shrilly what a world it be and he be in it think harrie then she would smile and shut she eye and the child of israel see the face of mose that mose ' face shone and they be afraid to come nigh he harrie wonder if everybody 's joy be too great to look upon and wonder in a childish frightened way how it might be with sorrow if people stand with veil face before it dumb with pain as she with peace -- and then it be dinner-time and myron come down to walk up the beach with she and she forget all about it she forget all about everything but the bare joy of life and the sea when she have don the pretty scarlet suit and creep out into the surf -- at the proper medicinal hour for the doctor be very particular with she -- when the warm brown wave break over she face the long sea-weed slip through she finger the foam sprinkle she hair with crystal and the strong wind be up she be a swift swimmer and as one watch from the shore she lithe scarlet shoulder seem to glide like a trail of fire through the light water and when she sit in shallow foam with sunshine on she or flash through the dark green pool among the rock or float with the incoming tide she great bathing-hat drop shadow on she wet little happy face and she laugh ring out it be a pretty sight but a prettier one than that she husband thought be to see she in she boat at sunset when sea and sky be aflame when every flake of foam be a rainbow and the great chalk-cliff be blood-red when the wind blow she net off and in pretty petulance she pull she hair down and it ripple all about she as she dip into the blaze west dr sharpe use to drive home by the beach on a fair night always that he might see it then harrie would row swiftly in and spring into the low broad buggy beside he and they ride home together in the fragrant dusk sometimes she use to chatter on these twilight drive but more often she creep up to he and shut she eye and be as still as a sleepy bird it be so pleasant to do nothing but be happy i believe that at this time dr sharpe love he wife as unselfishly as he know how harrie often write I that he be very good she be sometimes a little troubled that he should know so much more than she and have fit of read the newspaper and review she french and study case of hydrophobia or some other pleasant subject which have a professional air she husband laugh at she for she pain but nevertheless he find she so much the more entertaining sometimes she drive about with he on he call or amuse herself by make jelly in fancy mould for he poor or sit in he lap and discourse like a bobolink of croup and measles pull he whisker the while with she pink finger all this as i have say be before the first baby come it be surprising what vague idea young people in general and young man in particular have of the rub and jar of domestic life especially domestic life on a income of eighteen hundred american constitution and country servant throw in dr sharpe know something of illness and baby and worry and watch but that he own individual baby should deliberately lie and scream till two o'clock in the morning be a source of perpetual astonishment to he and that it -- he and mr sharpe have they first quarrel over he persistence in call the child a it -- that it should _ invariably _ feel call upon to have the colic just as he have fall into a nap after a night spend with a die patient be a phenomenon of the infant mind for which he be to say the least unprepared it be for a long time a mystery to he masculine understanding that biddy could not be nursery-maid as well as cook why what have she to do now nothing but to broil steak and make tea for two people that whenever he have harrie quietly to himself for a peculiarly pleasant tea-table the house should resound with sudden shriek from the nursery and there be _ always _ a pin in that baby be forever a fresh surprise and why when they have a house full of company no girl and harrie down with a sick-headache he son and heir should of _ necessity _ be threaten with scarlatina be a philosophical problem over which he speculate long and profoundly so gradually in the old way the old sweet habit of the long honeymoon be break harrie dream no more on the cliff by the bright noon sea have no time to spend make scarlet picture in the little bathing-suit have seldom strength to row into the sunset she hair loose the bay on fire and one to watch she from the shore there be no more walk up the beach to dinner there come a end to the drive in the happy twilight she could not climb now upon she husband 's knee because of the heavy baby on she own the spasm of newspaper reading subside rapidly corinne and racine gather the dust in peace upon they shelf mr sharpe make no more fancy jelly and find no time to inquire after other people 's baby one become use to anything after a while especially if one happen to be a man it would have surprise dr sharpe if he have take the pain to notice -- which i believe he never do -- how easily he become use to he solitary drive and disturbed tea to miss harrie 's watch face at door or window to sit whole evening by himself while she sing to the fretful baby overhead with she sweet little tired voice to slip off into the spare room to sleep when the child cry at night and harrie up and down with he by the hour flit from cradle to bed or pace the room or sit and sing or lay and cry herself in sheer despair of rest to wander away on lonely walk to step often into a neighbor 's to discuss the election or the typhoid in the village to forget that he wife 's conversational capacity could extend beyond biddy and teethe to forget that she might ever hunger for a twilight drive a sunny sail for the sparkle and freshness the dream the pet the caress all the silly little lover ' habit of they early married day to go he own way and let she go hers yet he love she and love she only and love she well that he never doubt nor to my surprise do she i remember once when on a visit there be fairly frighten out of the propriety by hear she call he dr sharpe i call she away from the child soon after on pretence of help I unpack i lock the door pull she down upon a trunk tray beside I fold both she hand in mine and study she face it have grow to be a very thin little face less pretty than it be in the shadow of the woodbine with absent eye and a sad mouth she know that i love she and my heart be full for the child and so for i could not help it i say -- harrie be all well between you be he quite the same she look at I with a perplexed and musing air the same o yes he be quite the same to I he would always be the same to I only there be the child and we be so busy he -- why he love I you know -- she turn she head from side to side wearily with the puzzle expression grow on she forehead -- he love I just the same -- just the same i be _ he wife _ do not you see she draw herself up a little haughtily say that she hear the baby cry and slip away but the perplexed knot upon she forehead do not slip away i be rather glad that it do not i like it better than the absent eye that afternoon she leave she baby with biddy for a couple of hour go away by herself into the garden sit down upon a stone and think harrie take a great deal of comfort in she baby quite as much as i wish to have she woman whose dream of marriage have fade a little have a way of transfer they passionate devotion and content from husband to child it be like anchor in a harbor -- a pleasant harbor and one in which it be good to be -- but never on shore and never at home whatever a woman 's child may be to she she husband should be always something beyond and more forever crown for she as first dearest best on a throne that neither son nor daughter can usurp through mistake and misery the throne may be leave vacant or voiceless : but what man cometh after the king so when harrie forget the baby for a whole afternoon and sit out on she stone there in the garden think i feel rather glad than sorry it be when little harrie be a baby i believe that mr sharpe take that notion about have company she be grow out of the world she say turn into a fungus petrify have forget whether you call you seat at the music hall pew or settee and be as afraid of a well-dressed woman as she be of the croup so the doctor 's house at lime be for two or three month overrun with visitor and vivacity father and mother make fatherly and motherly stay with the hottest of air-tights put up for they benefit in the front room sister and sister-in-law bring the fashion and get up tableau cousin come on the jump miss jone pauline dalla and i be invite in turn and the child have the mumps at cheerful interval between the doctor be not much in the mood for entertaining miss dalla he be a little tired of company and have have a hard week 's work with a epidemic down town harrie have not see she since she wedding day and be pleased and excited at the prospect of the visit pauline have be one of she eternal friendship at school miss dalla come a day earlier than she be expect and as chance would have it harrie be devote the afternoon to cut out shirt any one who have sit from two till six at that engaging occupation will understand precisely how she back ache and she temple throb and she finger sting and she neck stiffen why she eye swim she cheek burn she brain be deaden the child 's voice be insufferable the slamming of a door a agony the past a blot the future unendurable life a burden friendship a myth she hair down and she collar unpinned miss dalla have never cut a shirt nor i believe have dr sharpe harrie be groan over the last wristband but one when she hear she husband 's voice in the hall harrie harrie you friend be here i find she by a charming accident at the station and drive she home and miss dalla gloved perfumed rustling in a very become veil and travelling-suit of the latest mode sweep in upon she harrie be too much of a lady to waste any word on apology so she run just as she be in she calico dress with the collar hang into pauline 's stately arm and hold up she little burning cheek to be kiss but she husband look annoyed he come down before tea in he best coat to entertain they guest biddy be take a afternoon that day and harrie bustle about with she ache back to make tea and wash the child she have no time to spend upon herself and rather than keep a hungry traveller wait smooth she hair knot a ribbon at the collar and come down in she calico dress dr sharpe glance at it in some surprise he repeat the glance several time in the course of the evening as he sit chat with he wife 's friend miss dalla be very sprightly in conversation have read some have think some and have the appearance of have read and think about twice as much as she have myron sharpe have always consider he wife a handsome woman that nobody else think she so have make no difference to he he have often look into the saucy eye of little harrie bird and tell she that she be very pretty as a matter of theory he suppose she to be very pretty now that she be the mother of he three child and break she back to cut out he shirt miss dalla be a generously frame well-proportioned woman who carry long train and tie she hair with crimson velvet she have large serene eye white hand and a very pleasant smile a delicate perfume stir as she stir and she wear a creamy lace about she throat and wrist calico be never become to harrie and that one with the palm-leaf do not fit she well -- she cut it herself to save expense as the evening pass in reaction from the weariness of shirt-cutting she grow pale and the sallow tint upon she face come out she feature sharpen as they have a way of do when she be tired and she have little else to do that evening than think how tired she be for she husband observe as he remark afterwards that she do not feel like talk kindly entertain she friend himself as they go up stair for the night it strike he for the first time in he life that harrie have a snub nose it annoy he because she be he wife and he love she and like to feel that she be as well look as other woman you friend be a bright girl he say encouragingly when harrie have hush a couple of child and sit wearily down to unbutton she boot i think you will find she more easy to entertain than cousin mehitabel then see that harrie answer absently and how exhaust she look he express he sorrow that she should have work so long over the shirt and kiss she as he speak while harrie cry a little and feel as if she would cut they all over again for that the next day miss dalla and mr sharpe sit sewing together harrie cramp she shoulder and blacken she hand over a patch on rocko 's rough little trousers pauline play idly with purple and orange wool -- she finger be white and she sink with grace into the warm color of the arm-chair the door be open into the hall and dr sharpe pass by glance in as he pass you husband be a very intelligent man harrie observe miss dalla study she lavender and lemon thoughtfully i be much interested in what he say about pre-adamic man last evening yes say harrie he know a great deal i always think so the little trousers slip from she black finger by and by and she eye wander out of the window absently _ she _ do not know anything about pre-adamic man in the afternoon they walk down the beach together -- the doctor he wife and they guest -- accompany by as few child as circumstance would admit of pauline be stately in a beach-dress of bright brown which shaded softly into one another it be one of miss dalla 's peculiarity that she never wear more than one color or two at the same time harrie as it chance wear over she purple dress -lrb- rocko have tip over two ink-bottle and a vinegar-cruet on the sack which should have match it -rrb- a dull gray shawl she bonnet be blue -- it have be a present from myron 's sister and she have no other way than to wear it miss dalla bound with pretty foot from rock to rock rocko hang heavily to he mother 's finger she have no glove the child would have spoil they she dress drag in the sand -- she could not afford two skirt and one must be long -- and between rocko and the wind she hold it up awkwardly dr sharpe seldom notice a woman 's dress he could not have tell now whether he wife 's shawl be sky-blue or pea-green he know nothing about the ink-spot he have never hear of the unfortunate blue bonnet or the mystery of short and long skirt he might have go to walk with she a dozen time and think she very pretty and proper in she appearance now without the vaguest idea what be the trouble he understand that something be wrong a woman would have say mr sharpe look dowdy and old-fashioned he only consider that miss dalla have a pleasant air like a soft brown picture with crimson light let in and that it be a air which he wife lack so when rocko drag heavily and more heavily at he mother 's skirt and the doctor and pauline wander off to climb the cliff harrie do not seek to follow or to call they back she sit down with rocko on the beach wrap herself with a savage hug in the ugly shawl and wonder with a bitterness with which only woman can wonder over such trifle why god should send pauline all the pretty beach-dress and deny they to she -- for harrie like many another dowdy woman whom you see upon the street my dear madam be a woman of fine keen taste and would have appreciate the soft brown no less than yourself it seem to she the very sting of poverty just then that one must wear purple dress and blue bonnet at the tea-table the doctor fall to reconstruct the country and miss dalla who be quite a politician in miss dalla 's way observe that the horizon look brighter since tennessee 's admittance and that she hope that the cloud & c -- and what _ do _ he think of brownlow & c & c tennessee exclaim harrie why how long have tennessee be in i do not know anything about it miss dalla smile kindly dr sharpe bit he lip and he face flush harrie you really _ ought _ to read the papers he say with some impatience it be no wonder you do not know anything how should i know anything tie to the child all day harrie speak quickly for the hot tear spring why do not you tell I something about tennessee you never talk politics with _ I _ this begin to be awkward miss dalla who never interfere -- on principle -- between husband and wife gracefully take up the baby and gracefully swing she dainty geneva watch for the child 's amusement smile brilliantly she could not endure baby but you would never have suspect it in fact when pauline have be in the house four or five day harrie who never think very much of herself become so painfully alive to she own deficiency that she fall into a permanent fit of low spirit which do not add either to she appearance or she vivacity pauline be so pretty and bright she write to I i always know i be a little fool you can be a fool before you be marry just as well as not then when you have three baby to look after it be too late to make yourself over i try very hard now to read the newspaper only myron do not know it one morning something occur to mr sharpe it be simply that she husband have spend every evening at home for a week she be in the nursery when the thought strike she rock slowly in she low sewing-chair hold the baby on one arm and try to darn stocking with the other pauline be -- she do not really know where be not that she voice upon the porch the rocking-chair stop sharply and harrie look down through the blind the doctor 's horse be tie at the gate the doctor sit fan himself with he hat in one of the garden chair miss dallas occupy the other she be chat and twist she golden wool about she finger -- it be noticeable that she use only golden wool that morning she dress be pale blue and the effect of the purple would not have be good i think you call be go to take till dinner myron call harrie through the blind i think so too say myron placidly but they do not seem to will not you come down harrie thank he say in a pleasant _ nonchalant _ way that she could not leave the baby it be almost the first bit of act that the child have ever be guilty of -- for the baby be just go to sleep and she know it she turn away from the window quietly she could not have be angry and scold or noisy and cry she put little harrie into she cradle creep upon the bed and lay perfectly still for a long time when the dinner-bell ring and she get up to brush she hair that absent apathetic look of which i have speak have leave she eye a stealthy brightness come and go in they which she husband might have observe if he and miss dalla have not be deep in the woman question pauline see it pauline see everything why do you not come down and sit with we this morning she ask reproachfully when she and harrie be alone after dinner i do not want you husband to feel that he must run away from you to entertain I my husband 's idea of hospitality be generous say mr sharpe i have always find he as ready to make it pleasant here for my company as for he own she make this little speech with dignity do both woman know it for the farce it be to do miss dalla justice -- i be not sure she be not a bad-hearted woman she be a handsome woman she have come to lime to enjoy herself those September day and night be fair there by the dreamy sea on the whole i be incline to think that she do not know exactly what she be about _ my _ perfumery never last say harrie once stoop to pick up pauline 's fine handkerchief to which a faint scent like unseen heliotrope cling it cling to everything of pauline 's you would never see a heliotrope without thinking of she as dr sharpe have often say myron use to like good cologne but i can not afford to buy it so i make it myself and use it sunday and it be all blow away by the time i get to church myron say he be glad of it for it be more like mr allen 's hair restorer than anything else what do you use pauline sachet powder of course say miss dalla smile that evening harrie steal away by herself to the village apothecary 's myron should not know for what she go if it be the breath of a heliotrope thought foolish harrie which make it so pleasant for people to be near pauline that be a matter easily remedy but sachet powder you should know be a dollar a ounce and harrie must need content herself with the american which could be have for fifty cent and so of course after she have spend she money and make she little silk bag and put they away into she bureau drawer myron never tell _ she _ for all she pain that she remind he of a heliotrope with the dew on it one day a pink silk bag fall out from under she dress where she have tuck it what be all this nonsense harrie say she husband in a sharp tone at another time the doctor and pauline be drive upon the beach at sunset when turn a sudden corner miss dalla cry out in real delight -- see that beautiful creature who can it be and there be harrie out on a rock in the opal surf -- a little scarlet mermaid comb she hair with she thin finger from which the water almost wash the wedding ring it be -- who know how long since the pretty bathing-suit have be take down from the garret nail what sudden yearning for the wash of wave and the spring of girlhood and the consciousness that one be fair to see have overtake she she watch through she hair and she finger for the love in she husband 's eye but he wade out to she ill-pleased harrie this be very imprudent -- very i do not see what could have possess you myron sharpe love he wife of course he do he begin about this time to state the fact to himself several time a day have she not be all the world to he when he woo and win she in she rosy ripening day be she not all the world to he now that a bit of searness have creep upon she in a married life of eight hard-working year that she _ have _ grow a little sear he feel somewhat keenly of late she have a dreary draggled look at breakfast after the child have cry at night -- and the night when mr sharpe 's child do not cry be like angel ' visit it be perhaps the more noticeable because miss dalla have a peculiar color and coolness and sparkle in the morning like that of open flower _ she _ have not be up till midnight with a sick baby harrie be apt to be too busy in the kitchen to run and meet he when he come home at dusk or if she come it be with she sleeve roll up and a apron on miss dalla sit at the window the lace curtain wave about she she nod and smile as he walk up the path in the evening harrie talk of rocko or the price of butter she do not venture beyond poor thing since she experience with tennessee miss dallas quote browning and discuss goethe and talk parepa and they have no light and the September moon shone in sometimes mr sharpe have mend to do and as she could not sew on she husband 's button satisfactorily by moonlight would slip into the dining-room with kerosene and mosquito for company the doctor may have notice or he may not how comfortably he could if he make the proper effort pass the evening without she but myron sharpe love he wife to be sure he do if he wife doubt it -- but why should she doubt it who think she doubt it if she do she give no sign she eye he observe have brighten of late and when they go to she from the moonlit parlor there be such a pretty color upon she cheek that he use to stoop and kiss they while miss dalla discreetly occupy herself in kill mosquito of course he love he wife it be observable that in proportion to the frequency with which he find it natural to remark he fondness for harrie he attention to she increase he inquire tenderly after she headache he bring she flower when he and miss dalla walk in the autumn wood he be particular about she shawl and wrap he beg she to sail and drive with they he take pain to draw he chair beside hers on the porch he pat she hand and play with she soft hair harrie 's clear eye puzzle over this for a day or two but by and by it might have be notice that she refuse he ride shawl herself be apt to be with the child when he call she and shrink in a quiet way from he touch she go into she room one afternoon and lock the child out a east wind blow and the rain fall drearily the doctor and pauline be play chess down stair she should not be miss she take out she wedding-dress from the drawer where she have lay it tenderly away the hoar-frost and fret pearl fall down upon she fade morning-dress the little creamy glove hang loosely upon she worn finger poor little glove poor little pearly dress she feel a kind of pity for they innocence and ignorance and trustfulness she hot tear fall and spot they what if there be any way of creep back through they to be little harrie bird again would she take it she child 's voice sound cry for she in the hall three innocent baby -- and how many more -- to grow into life under the shadow of a wreck and loveless home what have she do what have they do harrie 's be a strong healthy little soul with a strong healthy love of life but she fall down there that dreary afternoon prone upon the nursery floor among the yellow wedding lace and pray god to let she die yet myron sharpe love he wife you understand discuss elective affinity down there over the chessboard with miss dalla -- he love he wife most certainly and pray why be she not content it be quite late when they come up for harrie she have fall into a sleep or faint and the window have be open all the time she eye burn sharply and she complain of a chill which do not leave she the next day nor the next one morning at the breakfast-table miss dalla calmly observe that she should go home on Friday dr sharpe drop he cup harrie wipe up the tea my dear miss dalla -- surely -- we can not let you go yet harrie can not you keep you friend harrie say the proper thing in a low tone pauline repeat she determination with much decision and be afraid that she visit have be more of a burden than harrie with all she care be able to bear dr sharpe push back he chair noisily and leave the room he go and stand by the parlor window the man 's face be white what business have the day to close down before he like a granite wall because a woman with long train and white hand be go out of they harrie 's patient voice come in through the open door : -- yes yes yes rocko mother be tired to-day wait a minute pauline sweeping by the piano brush the key a little and sing : -- drift drift on and on mast and oar and rudder go fatal danger for each one we helpless as in dream what have he be about the air grow sweet with the sudden scent of heliotrope and miss dalla push aside the curtain gently i may have that sail across the bay before i go it promise to be fair to-morrow he hesitate i suppose it will be we last say the lady softly she be rather sorry when she have speak for she really do not mean anything and be surprise at the sound of she own voice but they take the sail harrie watch they off -- she husband do not invite she to go on that occasion -- with that stealthy sharpness in she eye she lip and hand and forehead be burn she have be cold all day a sound like the toll of a bell beat in she ear the child 's voice be choke and distant she wonder if biddy be drunk she seem to dance about so at she ironing-table and wonder if she must dismiss she and who could supply she place she try to put my room in order for she be expect I that night by the last train but give up the undertaking in weariness and confusion in fact if harrie have be one of the doctor 's patient he would have send she to bed and prescribe for brain-fever as she be not a patient but only he wife he have not find out that anything ail she nothing happen while he be go except that a friend of biddy 's drop in and mr sharpe burning and shiver in she sewing-chair dreamily catch through the open door and dreamily repeat to herself a dozen word of compassionate irish brogue : -- folk as lave folk cryin ' to home and go sailin ' round with other woman -- then the wind latch the door the doctor and miss dalla draw in they oar and float softly there be gray and silver cloud overhead and all the light upon the sea slant from low in the west : it be a red light in which the bay grow warm it strike across pauline 's hand which she dip as the mood take she into the wave lean upon the side of the boat look down into the water one other sail only be to be see upon the bay they watch it for a while it drop into the west and sink from sight they be silent for a time and then they talk of friendship and nature and eternity and then be silent for a time again and then speak -- in a very general and proper way -- of separation and communion in spirit and break off softly and the boat rise and fall upon the strong outgoing tide drift drift on and on hummed pauline the west pale a little leave a haggard look upon the doctor 's face a honest man the doctor be say a honest man who love he wife devotedly but who can not find in she that sympathy which he higher nature require that comprehension of he intellectual need that -- i always feel a deep compassion for such a man interrupted miss dalla gently such a man question the doctor in a pensive tone need not be debar by the shallow conventionality of a unappreciative world from a friendship which will rest strengthen and ennoble he weary soul certainly not say pauline with she eye upon the water dull yellow green and indigo shades be creep now upon its ruddiness pauline -- dr sharpe 's voice be low -- pauline pauline turn she beautiful head there be marriage for this world true and honorable marriage but for this world but there be a marriage for eternity -- a marriage of soul now myron sharpe be not a fool but that be precisely what he say to miss pauline dalla out in the boat on that September night if wiser man than myron sharpe never utter more unpardonable nonsense under similar circumstance cast you stone at he perhaps so say miss dalla with a sigh but see how dark it have grow while we have be talk we shall be catch in a squall but i shall not be at all afraid -- with you they be catch indeed not only in a squall but in the steady force of a drive northeasterly storm setting in doggedly with a very ugly fog if miss dalla be not at all afraid -- with he she be nevertheless not sorry when they grate safely on the dull white beach they have have a hard pull in against the tide sky and sea be black the fog crawl like a ghost over flat and cliff and field the rain beat upon they as they turn to walk up the beach pauline stop once suddenly what be that i hear nothing a cry -- i fancy a cry down there in the fog they go back and walk down the slippery shore for a space miss dalla take off she hat to listen you will take cold say dr sharpe anxiously she put it on she hear nothing -- she be tired and excited he say they walk home together miss dalla have sprain she white wrist try to help at the oar he draw it gently through he arm it be quite dark when they reach the house no lamp be light the parlor window have be leave open and the rain be beat in how careless in harrie say she husband impatiently he remember those word and the sound of he own voice in say they for a long time to come he remember they now indeed i fancy on rainy night when the house be dark the hall be cold and dreary no table be set for supper the child be all cry dr sharpe push open the kitchen door with a stern face biddy biddy what do all this mean where be mrs sharpe the lord only know what it mane or where be mrs sharpe say biddy sullenly it be high time in I own belafe for she husband to come ashkin ' and inquirin ' she close all in a hape on the floor upstairs with she bath-dress go from the nail and the front door swingin ' -- I never findin ' of it out till it coom tay-time with all the child cryin ' on I and I head shplit with the noise and -- dr sharpe stride in a bewildered way to the front door oddly enough the first thing he do be to take down the thermometer and look at it go out to bathe in a temperature like that he mind run like lightning while he hang the thing back upon its nail over harrie 's ancestry be there not a traditionary great-uncle who die in a asylum the whole future of three child with a insane mother spread itself out before he while he be button he overcoat shall i go and help you find she asked miss dalla tremulously or shall i stay and look after hot flannel and -- thing what shall i do _ i _ do not care what you do say the doctor savagely to he justice be it record that he do not he would not have exchange one glimpse of harrie 's little homely face just then for a eternity of sunset-sailing with the friend of he soul a sudden cold loathing of she possess he he hate the sound of she soft voice he hate the rustle of she garment as she lean against the door with she handkerchief at she eye do he remember at that moment a old vow speak on a old October day to that little missing face do he comfort himself thus as he step out into the storm you have ` trust she ' myron sharpe as ` you best earthly friend ' as luck or providence or god -- whichever word you prefer -- decree it the doctor have but just shut the door when he see I drive from the station through the rain i hear enough of the story while he be help I down the carriage step i leave my bonnet and bag with miss dalla pull my water-proof over my head and we turn we face to the sea without a word the doctor be a man who think and act rapidly in emergency and little time be lose about help and light yet when all be do which could be do we stand there upon the slippery weed-strewn sand and look in one another 's face helplessly harrie 's little boat be go the sea thunder out beyond the bar the fog hang a dead weight upon a bury world we lantern cut it for a foot or two in a ghostly way throw a pale white light back upon we face and the weed and bit of wreck under we foot the tide have turn we put out into the surf not know what else to do and call for harrie we lean on we oar to listen and hear the water drip into the boat and the dull thunder beyond the bar we call again and hear a frightened sea-gull scream _ this _ yere 's wastin ' valooable time say hansom decidedly i forget to say that it be george hansom whom myron have pick up to help we anybody in lime will tell you who george hansom be -- a clear-eyed open-hearted sailor a man to whom you would turn in trouble as instinctively as a rheumatic man turn to the sun i can not accurately tell you what he do with we that night i have confuse memory of search shore and cliff and cave of touch at little island and inlet that harrie fancy of the peculiar echo which answer we shouting of the look that settle little by little about dr sharpe 's mouth of the sobbing of the low wind of the flare of lantern on gaping green wave of spot of foam that writhe like nest of white snake of notice the puddle in the bottom of the boat and of wonder confusedly what they would do with my travelling-dress at the very moment when i saw -- i be the first to see it -- little empty boat of we haul alongside of the toss silent thing of a bit of a red scarf that lay coil in its stern of we drift by and speak never a word of we coast along after that for a mile down the bay because there be nothing in the world to take we there but the dread of see the doctor 's eye when we should turn it be there that we hear the first cry it be shoreward say hansom it be seaward cry the doctor it be behind we say i where be it a sharp sobbing cry strike the mist three or four time in rapid succession -- hush suddenly -- break into shriek like a frightened child 's -- die plaintively down we struggle desperately after it through the fog wind and water take the sound up and toss it about confused and bewildered we beat about it and about it it be behind we before we at we right at we leave -- cry on in a blind aimless way make we no reply -- beckon we slip from we mock we utterly the doctor stretch he hand out upon the solid wall of mist he grope with they like a man strike blind to die there -- in my very hear -- without a chance -- and while the word be upon he lip the cry cease he turn a gray face slowly around shiver a little then smile a little then begin to argue with ghastly cheerfulness : -- it must be only for a moment you know we shall hear it again -- i be quite sure we shall it again hansom hansom make a false stroke i believe for the first time in he life snap a oar and overturn a lantern some drift-wood cover with slimy weed wash heavily up at we foot i remember that a little disabled ground-sparrow chase by the tide be flutter and drown just in sight and that myron draw it out of the water and hold it up for a moment to he cheek bend over the rope george speak between he tooth to I : -- it may be a night 's job on ' t findin ' of the body the what the poor little sparrow drop from dr sharpe 's hand he take a step backward scan we face sit down dizzily and fall over upon the sand he be a man of good nerve and great self-possession but he fall like a woman and lay like the dead it be no place for he hansom say softly get he home I and the neighbor can do the rest get he home and put he baby into he arm and shet the door and go about you business i have leave he in the dark on the office floor at last miss dalla and i sit in the cold parlor and look at each other the fire be low and the lamp dull the rain beat in a uncanny way upon the window i never like to hear the rain upon the window i like it less than usual that night and be just try to brighten the fire a little when the front door blow open shut it please say i between the jerk of my poker but miss dalla look over she shoulder and shiver just look at that latch i look at that latch it rise and fall in a feeble flutter way -- be still for a minute -- rise and fall again when the door swing in and harrie -- or the ghost of she -- stagger into the chilly room and fall down in a scarlet heap at my foot pauline bound against the wall with a scream which pierce into the dark office where the doctor lay with he face upon the floor it be long before we know how it happen indeed i suppose we have never know it all how she glide down a little red wraith through the dusk and damp to she boat how she toss about with some dim delirious idea of find myron on the ebb wave that she find herself strand and tangle at last in the long matted grass of that muddy cove start to wade home and sink in the ugly ooze hold chill and scratch by the sharp grass blind and frighten by the fog and call as she think of it for help that in the first shallow wash of the flow tide she must have struggle free and find she way home across the field -- she can tell we but she can tell no more this very morning on which i write a unknown man imprison in the same spot in the same way overnight be find by george hansom dead there from exposure in the salt grass it be the walk home and only that which could have save she yet for many week we fight she husband and i hand to hand with death seem to _ see _ the life slip out of she and watch for wander minute when she might look upon we with sane eye we keep she -- just a mere little wreck with draw lip and great eye and shattered nerve -- but we keep she i remember one night when she have fall into she first healthful nap that the doctor come down to rest a few minute in the parlor where i sit alone pauline be wash the tea-thing he begin to pace the room with a weary abstracted look -- he be much worn by watch -- and see that he be in no mood for word i take up a book which lay upon the table it chance to be one of alger 's which somebody have lend to the doctor before harrie 's illness it be a marked book and i run my eye over the pencil passage i recollect have be strike with this one : a man 's best friend be a wife of good sense and good heart whom he love and who love he you believe that say myron suddenly behind my shoulder i believe that a man 's wife ought to be he best friend -- in every sense of the word he _ best friend _ -- or she ought never to be he wife and if -- there will be difference of temperament and -- other thing if you be a man now for instance miss hannah -- i interrupted he with hot cheek and sudden courage if i be a man and my wife be _ not _ the best friend i have or could have in the world _ nobody should ever know it -- she least of all -- myron sharpe _ young people will bear a great deal of impertinence from a old lady but we have both go further than we mean to i close mr alger with a snap and go up to harrie the day that mr sharpe sit up in the easy-chair for two hour miss dalla who have feel call upon to stay and nurse she dear harrie to recovery and have really be of service detail on duty among the baby go home dr sharpe drive she to the station i accompany they at he request miss dalla intended i think to look a little pensive but have she lunch to cram into a very full travelling-bag and forget it the doctor with clear courteous eye shake hand and wish she a pleasant journey he drive home in silence and go directly to he wife 's room a bright blaze flicker on the old-fashioned fireplace and the wall bow with pretty dance shadow harrie all alone turn she face weakly and smile well they make no fuss about it after all she husband come and stand beside she a cricket on which one of the baby 's dress have be throw lay between they it seem for the moment as if he dare not cross the tiny barrier something of that old fancy about the light upon the altar may have cross he thought so miss dalla have fairly go harrie say he pleasantly after a pause yes she have be very kind to the child while i have be sick very you must miss she say poor harrie tremble she be very weak yet the doctor knock away the cricket fold he wife 's two shadowy hand into he own and say : -- harrie we have no strength to waste either of we upon a scene but i be sorry and i love you she break all down at that and dear I they almost have a scene in spite of themselves for o she have always know what a little goose she be and pauline never mean any harm and how handsome she be you know only _ she _ do not have three baby to look after nor a snub nose either and the sachet powder be only american and the very servant know and o myron she _ have _ want to be dead so long and then -- harrie say the doctor at he wit 's end this will never do in the world i believe -- i declare -- miss hannah -- i believe i must send you to bed and then i be such a little skeleton finish harrie royally with a great gulp dr sharpe gather the little skeleton all into a heap in he arm -- it be a very funny heap by the way but that do not matter -- and to the best of my knowledge and belief he cry just about as hard as she do the tenth of January the city of lawrence be unique in its way for simoom that scorch you and tempest that freeze for sand-heap and sand-hillock and sand-road for man digging sand for woman shake off sand for minute boy crawl in sand for sand in the church-slip and the gingerbread-window for sand in you eye you nose you mouth down you neck up you sleeve under you _ chignon _ down you throat for unexpected corner where tornado lie in wait for bleak uncomforted sidewalk where they chase you dog you confront you strangle you twist you blind you turn you umbrella wrong side out for dimmykhrat and bad ice-cream for unutterable circus-bill and religious tea-party for uncleared ruin and mill that spring up in a night for jaded face and busy foot for a air of youth and incompleteness at which you laugh and a consciousness of growth and greatness which you respect -- it -- i believe when i

thousand two third be girl these page be write as one set a bit of marble to mark a mound i linger over they as we linger beside the grave of one who sleep well half sadly half gladly -- more gladly

healthy labor watch they closely : you can read they history at a venture a widow this in the dusty black with she can scarcely remember how many mouth to feed at home worse than widow that one : she have put she baby out to board -- and humane people know what that mean -- to keep the little thing beyond its besotted father 's reach there be a group who have just come over a child 's face here

closely muffle though the day be mild she wear a fade scarlet hood which heighten the pallor of what must at best have be a pallid face it be a sickly face shaded off with purple shadow but with a certain wiry nervous strength about the muscle of the mouth and chin : it would have be a womanly pleasant mouth have it not be cross by a white scar which attract more of one 's attention than either the womanliness or pleasantness she eye have light long lash and shone through they steadily you would have notice as well have you be use to analyze crowd another face -- the two be side by side -- dimpled with pink and white flush and frame with bright black hair one would laugh at this girl and love she scold she and pity she caress she and pray for she -- then forget she perhaps the girl from

and of find a still spot where she might think she thought undisturbed wander away over the eastern bridge and down to the river 's brink it be a moody place such a one as only apathetic or healthy nature -lrb- i wonder if that be tautology -rrb- can healthfully yield to the bank slope steeply a fringe of stunt aspen and willow spring from the frozen sand : it be a sickening airless place in summer -- it be damp and desolate now there be a sluggish wash of water under foot and a stretch of dreary flat behind belated locomotive shriek to each other across the river and the wind bear down the current the roar and rage of the dam shadow be begin to skulk under the huge brown bridge the silent mill stare up and down and over the stream with a blank unvarying stare a oriflamme of scarlet burn in the west flicker dully in the dirty curdling water flare against the window of the pemberton which quiver and drip asenath think as if with blood she sit down on a gray stone wrap in she gray shawl curtain about by the aspen from the eye of passer on the bridge she have a fancy for this place when thing go ill with she she have always bear she trouble alone but she must be alone to bear they she know very well that she be tired and nervous that afternoon and that if she could reason quietly about this little neglect of dick 's it would cease to annoy she indeed why should she be annoy have he not do everything for she be everything to she for two long sweet year she drop she head with a shy smile she be never tire of live over these two year she take positive pleasure in

he be to inquire the way to newbury street when he see the tear on she shrunken cheek dick could never bear to see a woman suffer i would not cry he say simply sit down beside she tell a girl not to cry be a infallible recipe for keep she at it what could the child do but sob as if she heart would break of course he have the whole story in ten minute she he in another ten it be common and short enough : -- a down-east boy fresh from he father 's farm hunting for work and board -- a bit homesick here in the strange unhomelike city it might be and glad of some one to say so to what more natural than that when she father come out and be please with the lad there should be no more talk of newbury street that the little yellow house should become he home that he should swing the fantastic gate and plant the nasturtium that he life should grow to be one with hers and the old man 's he future and theirs unite unconsciously she remember -- it be not exactly pleasant somehow to remember it to-night -- just the look of he face when they come into the house that summer evening and he for the first time see what she be she cape have fall off in the full lamplight he kindly blue eye widen with shocked surprise and fall when he raise they a pity like a mother 's have creep into they it broaden and brighten as time slide by but it never leave they so you see after that life unfold in a burst of little surprise for asenath if she come home very tire some one say i be sorry if she wear a pink ribbon she hear a whisper it suit you if she sing a little song she know that somebody listen i do not know the world be like this cry the girl after a time there come a night that he chance to be out late -- they have plan a arithmetic lesson together which he have forget -- and she sit grieving by the kitchen fire you miss I so much then he say regretfully stand with he hand upon she chair she be try to shell some corn she drop the pan and the yellow kernel roll away on the floor what should i have if i do not have you she say and catch she breath the young man pace to the window and back again the firelight touch she shoulder and the sad white scar you shall have I always asenath he make answer he take she face within he hand and kiss it and so they shell the corn together and nothing more be say about it he have speak this last spring of they marriage but the girl like all girl be shyly silent and he have not urge it asenath start from she pleasant dream just as the oriflamme be furl into gray suddenly conscious that she be not alone below she quite on the brink of the water a girl be sit -- a girl with a bright plaid shawl and a nod red feather in she hat she head be bent and she hair fall against a profile cut in pink-and-white del be too pretty to be here alone so late thought asenath smile tenderly good-natured del be kind to she in a certain way and she rather love the girl she rise to speak to she but conclude on a second glance through the aspen that miss ivory be quite able to take care of herself del be sit on a old log that jut into the stream dabble in the water with the tip of she foot -lrb- have she live on the avenue she could not have be more particular about she shoemaker -rrb- some one -- it be too dark to see distinctly -- stand beside she he eye upon she face asenath could hear nothing but she need to hear nothing to know how the young fellow 's eye drink in the coquettish picture besides it be a old story del count she reject lover by the score it be no wonder she think in she honest way standing still to watch they with a sense of puzzle pleasure much like that with which she watch the print-window -- it be no wonder they love she i would love she if i be a man : so pretty so pretty she be just good for nothing del be -- would let the kitchen fire go out and would not mend the baby 's apron but i would love she all the same marry she probably and be sorry all my life pretty del poor del asenath wonder whether she wish that she be like she she could not quite make out it would be pleasant to sit on a log and look like that it would be more pleasant to be watch as del be watch just now it strike she suddenly that dick have never look like this at she the hum of they voice cease while she stand there with she eye upon they del turn she head away with a sudden movement and the young man leave she apparently without bow or farewell spring up the bank at a bind and crush the undergrowth with quick uneasy stride asenath with some vague idea that it would not be honorable to see he face

step upon the stair without turn she head she father have kiss she to-night be not that enough why sene what be the matter with you dick mount the stair and touch he lip to she forehead with a gently compassionate smile she flee from he with a cry like the cry of a suffocate creature shut she door and lock it with a ringing clang she be walk too far and get a little nervous say dick screw up he lamp poor thing then he go into he room to look at del 's photograph awhile before he burn it up for he mean to burn it up asenath when she have lock she door put she lamp before the looking-glass and tear off she gray cape tear it off so savagely that the button snap and roll away -- two little crystal semicircle like tear upon the floor there be no collar about the neck of she dress and this heighten the plainness and the pallor of she face she shrink instinctively at the first sight of herself and open the drawer where the crimson cape be fold but shut it resolutely i 'll see the worst of it she say with pinch lip she turn herself about and about before the glass let the cruel light gloat over she shoulder let the sickly shadow grow purple on she face then she put she elbow on the table and she chin into she hand and so for a motionless half-hour study the unrounded uncolored unlightened face that stare back at she she eye darken at its eye she hair touch its hair she breath dim the outline of its repulsive mouth by and by she drop she head into she hand the poor mistaken face she feel as if she would like to blot it out of the world as she tear use to blot out the wrong sum upon she slate it have be so happy but he be sorry for it and all that why do a good god make such face she slip upon she knee bewilder he _ can not _ mean any harm nohow she say speak fast and knelt there and say it over till she feel sure of it then she think of del once more -- of she color and sinuous spring and little cry and chatter after a time she find that she be grow faint and so steal down into the kitchen for some food she stay a minute to warm she foot the fire be red and the clock be tick it seem to she home-like and comfortable and she seem to herself very homeless and lonely so she sit down on the floor with she head in a chair and cry as hard as she ought to have do four hour ago she climb into bed about one o'clock have decide in a dull way to give dick up to-morrow but when to-morrow come he be up with a bright face and build the kitchen fire for she and bring in all the water and help she fry the potato and whistle a little about the house and worry at she paleness and so she say nothing about it i 'll wait till night she plan make ready for the mill o i can not she cry at night so other morning come and other night i be quite aware that accord to all romantic precedent this conduct be preposterous in asenath floracita in the novel never so far forget the whole duty of a heroine as to struggle waver doubt delay it be proud and proper to free the young fellow proudly and properly she free he suffer in silence -- till she marry another man and -lrb- have have a convenient opportunity to refuse the original lover -rrb- overwhelm the reflective reader with a sense of poetic justice and the eternal fitness of thing but i be not write a novel and as the biographer of this simple factory girl be offer few advantage asenath be no heroine you see such heroic element as be in she -- none could tell exactly what they be or whether there be any : she be one of those people in whom it be easy to be quite mistaken -- she life have not be one to develop she might have a certain pride of she own under give circumstance but plant grow in a cellar will turn to the sun at any cost how could she go back into she dark as for the other man to marry he be out of the question then none love with the tenacity of the unhappy no life be so lavish of itself as the deny life : to he that have not shall be give -- and asenath loved this richard cross it might be altogether the grand and suitable thing to say to he i will not be you wife it might be that she would thus regain a strong shade of lose self-respect it might be that she would make he happy and give pleasure to del it might be that the two young people would be she friend and love she in a way but all this mean that dick must go out of she life practically she must make up she mind to build the fire and pump the water and mend the window alone in dreary fact he would not listen when she sing would not say you be tired sene would never kiss away a undried tear there would be nobody to notice the crimson cape nobody to make blue neck-tie for none for whom to save the bonnes de jersey or to take sweet tired step or make dear dreamy plan to be sure there be she father but father do not count for much in a time like this on which sene have fall that del ivy be -- del ivory add intricacy to the question it be a very unpoetic but undoubted fact that asenath could in no way so insure dick 's unhappiness as to pave the way to he marriage with the woman whom he love there would be a few merry month then slow worry and disappointment pretty del accept at last not as the crown of he young life but as its silent burden and misery poor dick good dick who deserve more wealth of wifely sacrifice asenath think this crimson with pain and shame a streak of good common sense in the girl tell she -- though she half scorned herself for the conviction -- that even a cripple woman who should bear all thing and hope all thing for he sake might blot out the memory of this round del that no matter what the motive with which he marry she he would end by love he wife like other people she watch he sometimes in the evening as he turn he kind eye after she over the library book which he be read i know i could make he happy i _ know _ i could she mutter fiercely to herself November blow into December December congeal into January while she keep she silence dick in he honorable heart see that she suffer wearied himself with plan to make she eye shine bring she two pail of water instead of one never forget the fire help she home from the mill she see he meet del ivory once upon essex street with a grave and silent bow he never speak with she now he mean to pay the debt he owe she down to the uttermost farthing that grow plain do she try to speak she wretched secret he suffocate she with kindness strike she dumb with tender word she use to analyze she life in those day consider what it would be without he to be up by half past five o'clock in the chill of all the winter morning to build the fire and cook the breakfast and sweep the floor to hurry away faint and weak over the raw slippery street to climb at half past six the endless stair and stand at the endless loom and hear the endless wheel go buzz round to sicken in the oily smell and deafen at the remorseless noise and weary of the rough girl swearing at the other end of the pass to eat she cold dinner from a little cold tin pail out on the stair in the three-quarters-of-an-hour recess to come exhaust home at half past six at night and get the supper and brush up about the shoemaker 's bench and be too weak to eat to sit with ache shoulder and make the button-hole of she best dress or darn she father 's stocking till nine o'clock to hear no bound step or cheery whistle about the house to creep into bed and lie there try not to think and wish that so she might creep into she grave -- this not for one winter but for all the winter -- how should _ you _ like it you young girl with whom time run like a story the very fact that she employer deal honorably by she that she be fairly pay and promptly for she wear toil that the limit of endurance be consult in the temperature of the room and she need of rest in a occasional holiday -- perhaps after all in the mood she be in do not make this factory life more easy she would have find it rather a relief to have somebody to complain of -- wherein she be like the rest of we i fancy but at last there come a day -- it chance to be the ninth of January -- when asenath go away alone at noon and sit where merrimack sing he song to she she hide she face upon she knee and listen and think she own thought till they and the slow torment of the winter seem greater than she could bear so pass she hand

asenath -- get away from here they choose by tacit consent that favorite road of hers over the eastern bridge they step have a hollow lonely ring on the frosted wood she be glad when the softness of the snow in the road receive they she look back once at the water wrinkle into thin ice on the edge for a foot or two then open and black and still what be you do ask dick she say that she be wonder how cold it be and dick laugh at she they stroll on in silence for perhaps a mile of the desolate road well this be social say dick at length how much farther do you want to go i believe you would walk to read if nobody stop you she be take slow regular step like a automaton and look straight before she how much farther oh she stop and look about she a wide young forest spread away at they foot

dead leaf shiver a fine keen spray run along the top of the drift inky shadow lurk and dodge about the undergrowth in the broad space the snow glare the light mill a zone of fire blaze from east to

you well enough asenath he say with that motherly pity in he eye i have always like you so do not let we have any more of this so asenath say nothing more the sleek black river beckon to she across the snow as they go home a thought come to she as she pass the bridge -- it be a curious study what wicked thought will come to good people -- she find herself consider the advisability of leap the low brown parapet and if it would not be like dick to go over after she if there would be a chance for they even should he swim from the bank how soon the icy current would paralyze he how sweet it would be to chill to death there in he arm how all this wavering and pain would be over how del would look when they drag they out down below the machine-shop sene be you cold ask puzzle dick she be warmly wrap in she little squirrel fur but he feel she quiver upon he arm like one in a ague all the way home about eleven o'clock that night she father wake from a exciting dream concern the best

undergo -- how the stamp of a neighbor 's horse on a barn floor will drive every solitary wink of sleep from she eye and slumber from she eyelid the nibbling of a mouse in some un-get-at-able place in the wall prove torture the rattle of a pane of glass ticking of a clock or pattering of rain-drop as effective as a cannon a guest in the spare room with a musical love of a baby something far different from a blessing and a tolerably windy night one lengthen vigil long draw out -- the liberal public would cry forbear it become really a interesting science to learn how slight a thing will utterly deprive a unfortunate creature of the great necessity of life but this article not be a scientific treatise that must be leave to the sympathizing imagination keturah feel compel however to relate the story of two memorable night of which the only wonder be that she have live to tell the tale every incident be stamp indelibly upon she brain it be work in letter of fire while memory hold a seat in this distract globe it shall not can not be forget it be a night in June -- sultry gasp fearful keturah go to she own room as be she custom at the puritanic hour of nine sleep for a couple of hour be out of the question she throw wide she door and window and betook herself to she writing-desk a story for a magazine which it be imperative should be finish to-morrow appeal to she already partially stupefy brain she force she unwilling pen into the service whisk the table round into the draught and begin in about five minute the sibyl catch the inspiration of she god and heat and sleeplessness be alike forget this sound very poetic but it be not at all keturah regret to say that she have on a very unbecoming green wrapper and several ink-spot on she finger it be a very thrilling and original story and it come as all thrilling and original story must come to a crisis seraphina find theodore kiss the hand of celeste in the wood keturah become excited ' o theodore ' whisper the unhappy maiden to the moan tree ' o theodore my -- ' whir buzz swosh come something through the window into the lamp and down squirm into the ink-bottle keturah jump if you have half the horror of those great June beetle that she have you will know how she jump she empty the entire contents of the ink-bottle out of the window close she blind and begin again ` theodore ' say seraphina ` seraphina ' say theodore jump the second there he be -- not theodore but the beetle -- whir round the lamp and buzz down into she lap have not he be burn in the light drowned in the ink spear with the pen and crush by fall from the window yet there he be or the ghost of he flutter he inky wing into she very eye and walk leisurely across the smooth fair page that wait to be inscribe with seraphina 's woe nerve by despair keturah do a horrible thing never before or since have she be know to accomplish it she put he down on the floor and step on he she repent of the act in dust and ash before she could get across the room to close the window ten more have come to he funeral to describe the horror of the ensue hour she have no word she put they out of the window -- they come directly back she drown they in the wash-bowl -- they flutter and sputter and buzz up into the air she kill they in corner -- they come to life under she very eye she catch they in she handkerchief and tie they up tight -- they crawl out before she could get they in she shut the cover of the wash-stand down on they -- she look in awhile after and there be not one to be see all ten of the great blundering creature be knock they brain out against the ceiling after the endurance of terror that come very near turn she hair gray she have push the last one out on the balcony shut the window and be gasp away in the airless room she first momentary sense of security when there strike upon she agonized ear a fiendish buzz and three of they come whirling back through a crack about as large as a knitting-needle no _ mortal _ beetle could have come through it keturah turn pale and let they alone the clock be striking eleven when quiet be at last restore and the exhaust sufferer begin to think of sleep at this moment she hear a sound before which she heart sink like lead you must know that keturah have a very near neighbor miss humdrum by name miss humdrum be a -- well a very excellent and pious old lady who keep a one-eyed servant and three cat and the sound which keturah hear be miss humdrum 's cat keturah descend to the wood-shed armed herself with a huge oaken log and sally out into the garden with a horrible _ sang-froid _ that only long familiarity with she errand could have engender it be egyptian darkness but she practiced eye discern or think it discern a white cat upon the top of the high wooden fence keturah smile a ghastly smile and fire now she never yet in she life throw anything anywhere under any circumstance that do not go exactly in the opposite direction from what she want to have it this occasion prove no exception the cat jump and spring over and disappear the stick go exactly into the middle of the fence keturah can not suppose that the last trump will be capable of make a louder noise she stand transfix one cry alone break the hideous silence _ o _ lord in a unmistakably irish half-wakened howl from the open window of the one-eyed servant 's room only that and nothing more keturah return to she apartment a sadder if not a wiser woman marius among the ruin of carthage napoleon at st helena m ` clellan in europe have henceforth and forever she sympathy she think it be _ precisely _ five minute after she return during which the happy stillness that seem to rest upon nature without and nature within have whisper faint promise of come rest that there suddenly break upon it a hoarse deep unearthly breathing so hoarse so deep so unearthly and so directly underneath she window that for about ten seconds keturah sit paralyzed there be but one thing it could be a travel menagerie in town have lose its polish wolf that very day this be the polish wolf the horrible panting like the panting of a famished creature come nearer grow louder grow hoarser the animal have find a bone in the grass and be crunch it in he ghastly way then she could hear he sniff at the door and amram 's room be on the lower story perhaps wolf climb in at window the awful thought rouse keturah from the stupor of she terror she be no coward she would face the fearful sight she would call and warn he at any risk she falter out upon the balcony she lean over the railing she gaze breathlessly down into the darkness a cow another cow three cow keturah sit down on the window-sill in the calm of despair it be succeed by a storm she conclude that she be about five seconds on the passage from she room to the garden with hair flotant and arm disclose like the harpy of heraldic device she rush up to the invader -- and stop exactly what be to be do three great stupid browsing contented cow _ versus _ one lone lorn woman for about one minute keturah would not have wager she fortune on the woman but it be not she custom to say die and after some reflection she venture on a manful command go away go go the stentorian remark cause a result for which she be to say the least unprepared the creature coolly turn about and walk directly up to she to be sure why not be it not a part of we outrageous yankee nomenclature to teach cow to come to you when you tell they to go away how keturah country bear and breed could have even momentarily forget so clear and simple a principle of philology remain a mystery to this day a little reflection convince she of the only logical way of rid herself of she guest accordingly she walk a little way behind they and try again come here sir come good fellow wh-e-e come here three great wooden head lift themselves slowly and three pair of soft sleepy eye look at she and the beast return to they clover and stand stock-still what be to be do you could go behind and push they or you could go in front and pull they by the horn neither of these method exactly striking keturah 's fancy she take up a little chip and throw at they also a piece of coal and a handful of pebble these gigantic effort prove to be fruitless she sit down on the grass and look at they the heartless creature resist even that appeal at this crisis of she woe one of keturah 's many brilliant thought come to she relief she hasten upon the wing of the wind to she infallible resort the wood-shed and fill she arm up to the chin with pine knot thus equip she start afresh to the conflict it be record that out of twenty of those stick throw with savage and direful intent only one hit it be however record that the enemy disperse after be valiantly pursue around the house out of the front gate -lrb- where one stick and get through with the greatest difficulty -rrb- and for a quarter of a mile down the street in the course of the rout keturah trip on she dress only six time and fall flat but four one please little incident give delightful variety to the scene a particularly frisky and clover-loving white cow whose heart yearn after the apple of sodom turn about in the road without any warn whatever and show fight keturah adopt a sudden resolution to return home across lot and climb the nearest stone-wall with considerable _ empressement _ exactly half-way over she be surprise to find herself gasp among the low-hanging bough of a butternut-tree where she hang like absalom of old between heaven and earth she would like to state in this connection that she always have too much vanity to wear a waterfall so she still retain a portion of she original hair however she return victorious over the silent dew-laden field and down into the garden path where she pace for two hour back and forth among the aromatic perfume of the great yellow June lily there might have be a bit of poetry in it under other circumstance but keturah be not poetically incline on that occasion the event of the night have so rouse she soul within she that exercise unto exhaustion be she sole remain hope of sleep at about two o'clock she crawl faintly upstairs again and have just fall asleep with she head on the window-sill when a wander dog have to come directly under the window and sit there and bark for half a hour at a rake-handle keturah make no other effort to fight she destiny determine to meet it heroically she put a chair precisely into the middle of the room and sit up straight in it till she hear the bird sing somewhere about that epoch she fall into a doze with one eye open when a terrific peal of thunder start she to she foot it be patsy knock at the door to announce that she breakfast be cold in the ghastly condition of the follow day the story be finish and send off it be on this occasion that the patient and long-enduring editor venture mildly to suggest that when by a thrilling and horrible mischance seraphina 's lovely hand come between a log of wood and the full force of theodore 's hatchet the result _ might _ have be more disastrous than the loss of a finger-nail alas even he editorial omniscience do not know -- how could it -- the story of that night keturah forgive he it be perhaps worthy of mention that miss humdrum appear promptly at eight o'clock the next morning with she handkerchief at she eye my star-spangled banner have meet with she decease ketury indeed how very sad yes she have meet with she decease under _ very _ peculiar circumstance ketury oh say ketury hunting for she own handkerchief finding three in she pocket she bring they all into requisition and i feel it my duty to inquire say miss humdrum whether it may happen that _ you _ know anything about the event ketury i say keturah weep i do not know she be dead even dear miss humdrum you be indeed afflict but i feel compel to say pursued miss humdrum eye this wretched hypocrite severely that my girl jemimy _ do _ hear somebody fire a gun or a cannon or something out in you garden last night and she scar ' t out of she wit and my poor cat find cold under the hogshead this morning ketury miss humdrum say keturah i can not in justice to myself answer such insinuation further than to say that amram _ never _ allow the gun to go out of he own room the cannon we keep in the cellar oh say miss humdrum with horrible suspicion in she eye well i hope you have not it on you conscience i be sure _ good _ morning it have be the ambition of keturah 's life to see a burglar the second of the memorable night refer to crown this ambition by not only one burglar but two she it be who discover they she who frighten they away and nobody but she ever see they she confess to a natural and unconquerable pride in they it come about on this wise : -- it be one of keturah 's wide-awake night and she have be wander off into the field at the foot of the garden where it be safe and still there be by the way a peculiar awe in the utter hush of the earliest morning hour of which no one can know who have not familiarize himself with it in all its mood a solitary walk in a solitary place with the great world sleep about you and the great sky throb above you and the long unrest of the panting summer night fading into the cool of dew and pure gray dawn have in it something of what mr robertson call god 's silence once on one of these lonely ramble keturah find away in the field under the shadow of a old stone-wall a baby 's grave it have no headstone to tell its story and the weed and bramble of many year have overgrow it keturah be not of a romantic disposition especially on she midnight tramp but she sit down by the little nameless thing and look from it to the arch of eternal star that summer and winter seed-time and harvest keep steadfast watch over it and be very still it be one of the standing grievance of she life that amram while never take the trouble to go and look insist upon it that be nothing but somebody 's pet dog she know better on this particular night keturah in come up from the garden to return to the house have a dim impression that something cross the walk in front of she and disappear among the rustling tree the impression be sufficiently strong to keep she sit up for half a hour at she window under the feeling that a ounce of prevention be worth a pound of cure she have indeed be ask why she do not reconnoitre the rustling tree upon the spot she consider that would have be a exceedingly poor stroke of policy and of a impolitic thing keturah be not capable she see far and plan deep suppose she have go and be shoot through the head where would have be the fun of she burglar to yield a life-long aspiration at the very moment that it be within grasp be too much to ask even of keturah word can not describe the sensation of the moment when that half-hour be reward by the sight of two stealthy cat-like figure creep out from among the tree a tall man and a little man and both with very unbanditti-like straw-hat on now if keturah have a horror in this world it be that delicate play of the emotion commonly know as woman 's nonsense and therefore do she sit still for three mortal minute with she burglar make track for the kitchen window under she very eye in order to prove to herself and a incredulous public beyond all shadow of doubt or suspicion that they be robber and not dream actual flesh and blood not nightmare unmistakable hat and coat in a place where hat and coat ought not to be not clothes-line and pump she try hard to make amram and the paterfamilias out of they who know but they also by some unheard-of revolution in all the law of nature be on a explore expedition after truant sleep she struggle manfully after the conviction that they be innocent and unimpeachable neighbor cut the short way home across the field from some remarkably late prayer-meeting she agonize after the belief that they be two of patsy 's sweetheart come for the commendable purpose of serenade she in fact they be almost in the house before this remarkable female be prepare to trust the evidence of she own sens but when suspense gloom into certainty keturah be happy to say that she be grandly equal to the occasion she slam open she blind with a emphasis and light she lamp with a burnt match the man jump and dodge and run and hide behind the tree in the most approved manner of burglar who flee when no woman pursueth and keturah being of far too generous a disposition to enjoy the pleasure of they capture unshared lose no time in hammer at amram 's door amram no answer _ am_ram silence be - _ ram _ oh ugh who -- silence again amram wake up come out here -- quick o-o-oh yes who be there i i keturah kefurah amram be quick or we shall all have we throat cut there be some man in the garden hey _ man _ in the garden man in the _ garden _ garden keturah can bear a great deal but there come a limit even to she proverbial patience she burst open the door without ceremony and be under the impression that amram receive a shake such as even he tender youth be a stranger to it effectually wake he to consciousness as well as to the gasping and particularly senseless remark what on earth be she wring he neck for as if he might not have know she have the satisfaction of remember that he be ask in return do he expect a solitary unprotected female to keep all he murderer away from he as well as those wolf she drive off the other night however there be no time to be waste in tender word and before a woman could have wink amram make he appearance dress and arm and sarcastically incredulous keturah grasp the pistol and follow he at a respectful distance stay in the house and hold the light catch she she would take the light with she and the house too if necessary but she would be in at the death she wish mr darley be on hand to immortalize the picture they make scour the premise after those disoblige burglar -- especially keturah in the green wrapper with she hair roll all up in a huge knob on top of she head to keep it out of the way and she pistol hold out at arm 's - length point falteringly directly at the star she will inform the reader confidentially -- tell it not in gath -- of a humiliating discovery she make exactly four week afterward and which she have never before impart to a human creature -- it be not load well they peer behind every door they glare into every shadow they squeeze into every crack they dash into every corner they listen at every cranny and crevice step and turn but not a burglar of course not a regiment might have run away while amram be wake up keturah think it will hardly be credit that this hopeful person dare to suggest and dare to maintain that it be _ cat _ but she must draw the story of she affliction to a close and lest she solid reader 's eye reject the rambling recital as utterly unworthy the honor of they notice she be tempt to whittle it down to a moral before say farewell for you must know that keturah have learn several thing from she mournful experience 1 that every individual of she acquaintance male and female aged and youthful orthodox and heretical who sleep regularly nine hour out of the twenty-four have he or she own especial specimen recipe of a perfectly harmless anodyne to offer with advice throw in 2 that nothing ever yet put she to sleep but a merciful providence 3 a great respect for job 4 that the notion commonly and conscientiously receive by very excellent people that wakeful night can and should be spend in prayer religious meditation and general spiritual growth be all they know about it hour of the extremest bodily and mental exhaustion when every nerve be quiver as if lay bare and the surface of the brain burning and whirling to agony with the rein of control let loose on every rebellious and every senseless thought be not the time most likely to be choose for the purest communion with god to be sure king david remember he upon he bed and meditate upon he in the night-watches keturah do not undertake to contradict scripture but she have come to the conclusion that david be either a _ very _ good man or he do not lie awake very often but over and above all _ haec fabulum docet _ : 5 that people who can sleep when they want to should keep thanksgive every day in the year the day of my death -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the character in this narrative be fictitious the incident the author do not profess to have witness but they be give as relate by eye-witness whose testimony would command a verdict from any honest jury the author however draw no conclusion and suggest none -rrb- alison be sit on a bandbox she have generally be sit on a bandbox for three week -- or on a bushel-basket or a cupboard shelf or a pile of old newspaper or the baby 's bath-tub on one occasion it be the baby himself she mistake he for the rag-bag if ever we have to move again -- which all the beneficence of the penate forbid -- my wife should be lock into the parlor and a cargo of irishwoman turn loose about the premise to attend to thing what it be that woman find to do with themselves in this world i have never yet discover they be always attend to thing whatever that may mean i have long ago receive it as the only solution at my command of they superfluous wear and tear and worry and flurry and tear and nerve and headache a fellow may suggest jane and obtrude bridget and hire peggy and run in debt for mehetable and offer to take the baby on ` change with he but have he by a feather 's weight lighten madam 's mysterious burden my dear sir do not presume to expect it she have just as much to do as she ever have in fact she have a little more strange you do not appreciate it follow she about one day and see for yourself what i start to say however be that i think it over often -- i mean about that invoice of irishwoman -- coming home from the office at night while we be move out of artichoke street into nemo 's avenue it be not pleasant to find one 's wife always sit on a bandbox i have see she crawl to she foot when she hear I come and hold on by a chair and try she poor little best to look as if she could stand twenty-four hour longer she so dislike that i should find a used-up look house under any circumstance but i believe that be worse than the bandbox on this particular night she be too tired even to crawl i find she all in a heap in the corner two duster and a wash-cloth in one blue-veined hand and a broom in the other a old corn-colored silk handkerchief knot over she hair -- she hair be black and the effect be good -- and she little brown calico apron-string literally tie to the baby who be shriek at the end of he tether because he could just not reach the kitten and throw she into the fire on alison 's lap between a pile of shirt and two pile of magazine lay a freshly open letter i notice that she put it into she pocket before she drop she duster and stand up to lift she face for my kiss she forget about the apron-string and the baby tip up the wrong way and hang dangle in mid-air after we have take tea -- that be to say after we have draw around the ironing-board put on two chair in the front entry make the cocoa in a tin dipper stir it with a fork and cut the bread with a jack-knife -- after the baby be fairly off to bed in a champagne-basket and tip disposed of he mother only know where we coax a consumptive fire into the parlor grate and sit down before it in the carpetless pictureless curtainless blank bare soapy room thank fortune this be the last night of it i growl put my boot foot against the wall -lrb- my slipper have go over to the avenue in a water-pail that morning -rrb- and tip my chair back drearily -- my wife _ so _ object to the habit alli make no reply but sit look thoughtfully and with a slightly perplexed and displeased air into the sizzle wet wood that snap and flare and smoke and hiss and blacken and do everything but burn i really do not know what to do about it she break silence at last i be inclined to think there be nothing better to do than to look at it no not the fire o i forget -- i have not show it to you she draw from she pocket the letter which i have notice in the afternoon and lay it upon my knee with my hand in my pocket -- the room be too cold to take they out -- i read : -- dear cousin alison : -- i have be so lonely since mother die that my health never of the strongest as you know have suffer seriously my physician tell I that something be wrong with the periphrastic action if you know what that be -lrb- i suppose miss fellow mean the peristaltic action -rrb- and prophesy something dreadful -lrb- i have forget whether it be to be in the head or the heart or the stomach -rrb- if i can not have change of air and scene this winter i should dearly love to spend some time with you in you new home

whether we can heat a spare room she have not have a home though since cousin dorothy die but i be think about you you see o she can not hurt I she will not want the library i suppose nor my slipper and the small bootjack let she come my wife sigh a small sigh of relief out from the depths of she hospitable heart and the little matter be settle and dismiss as lightly as be most little matter out

and wake I my dear gertrude have _ one _ peculiarity i never think of it till this minute confound gertrude 's peculiarity i want to go to sleep well let 's have it why you see she take up with some spiritualistic notion after she mother 's death think she hold communication with she and all that aunt solomon say stuff and nonsense of course but fred dear i be inclined to think she _ must _ have make she sewing-table walk into the front entry and aunt solomon say the spirit rap out the whole of cousin dorothy 's history on the mantel-piece behind those blue china vase -- you must have notice they at the funeral -- and not a human hand within six foot alison hotchkiss i say wake thoroughly and sit up in bed to emphasize the opinion when i hear a spirit rap on _ my _ mantel-piece and see _ my _ table walk about the front entry i 'll believe that -- not before o i know it i be not a spiritualist i be sure and nothing would tempt I to be but still that sort of reasoning have a flaw in it have not it dear the king of siam you know -- i have hear of the king of siam before and i politely inform my wife that i do not care to hear of he again spiritualism be a system of refined jugglery just another phase of the same thing which bring the dove out of mr hermann 's empty hat it might be entertaining if it have not become such a abominable imposition there would always be nervous woman and hypochondriac man enough for its dupe i thank heaven that i be neither and go to sleep we new house be light and dry the flue work well and the spare chamber heated admirably the baby exchange the champagne-basket for he dainty pink-curtained crib tip begin to recover from the perpetual cold with which three week ' sit in draught and tumble into water-pail and play in the sink have sweeten he temper alli forsake she bandbox for the crimson easy-chair -lrb- very become that chair -rrb- or trip about on she own rested foot we return to table-cloths civilized life and a fork apiece in short nothing at all worth mention happen till that one night -- i think it be we first Sunday -- when alli wake I at twelve o'clock with the announcement that some one be knock at the door suppose it to be bridget with the baby -- croup probably or a fit -- i unlock and unlatch it promptly no one be there however and tell my wife in no very gentle tone if i remember correctly that it would be a convenience on such cold night if she could keep she dream to herself i shut the door distinctly and return to my own in the morning i observe a little white circle about each of alli 's blue eye and after some urge she confess to I that she sleep have be much break by a singular disturbance in the room i might laugh at she if i choose and she have not mean to tell I but somebody have rap in that room all night long on the door on the door on the mantel on the foot of the bed on the head-board -- fred right on the head-board i listen till i grow cold listening but it rap and it rap and by and by it be morning and it stop rat say i then rat have knuckle say she mouse say i wind broken plaster cricket imagination dream fancy blind headache nonsense next time wake I up and fire pillow at I

one mercy -- quiver and shrink when she be address suddenly as if she feel herself to be a sort of foot-ball that the world be kick about at pleasure -- you gentlest smile might prove a blow she seldom speak unless she be speak to and fall into long reverie with she eye on the window or the coal she wear a horrible sort of ruff -- illusion i think allis call it -- which of all contrivance that she could have choose to encircle she sallow neck be exactly the most unbecoming she be always knit blue stocking -- i never discover for what or whom and she wear she lifeless hair in the shape of a small toy cartwheel on the back of she head however she brighten a little in the course of the first week help alison about the baby keep herself out of my way read she bible and the banner of light in about equal proportion and become a mild inoffensive and on the whole not unpleasant addition to the family she have be in the house about ten day i think when alison with a disturbed face

be not gertrude woman know something about one another my dear and i tell you it be not gertrude i do not assert that it be but with the bolt on gertrude 's door the cat in the kitchen and the rat-trap on the garret stair i be strongly incline to anticipate a peaceful night i will watch for a while however and you can go to sleep she go to sleep and i watch i lay till half past eleven with my eye stare at the dark wide awake and undisturbed and triumphant at half past eleven i must confess that i hear a singular sound something whistle at the keyhole it could not have be the wind by the way for there be no wind that night something else than the wind whistle in at the keyhole sigh through into the room as much like a long-drawn breath as anything and fall with a slight clink upon the floor i light my candle and get up i search the floor of the room and open the door and search the entry nothing be visible or audible and i go back to bed for about ten minute i hear no further disturbance and be conclude myself to be in some undefined manner the victim of my own imagination when there suddenly fall upon the headboard of my bed a blow so distinct and loud that i involuntarily spring at the sound of it it waken alison and i have the satisfaction of hear she sleepily inquire if i have catch that rat yet by way of reply i relight the candle and give the bed a shove which send it rolling half across the room i examine the wall i examine the floor i examine the headboard i make alison get up so that i could shake the mattress meantime the pound have

from the room unless the occupant fancy that of jump from a two-story window upon a broad flight of stone step i come thoughtfully back across the hall a invisible trip-hammer appear to hit the floor

figure upon the carpet outline in a frosty bar no hand or hammer human or superhuman be there determine to investigate matter a little more thoroughly i ask my wife to stand upon the inside of the doorway while i keep watch upon the outside we take we position and i close the door between we instantly a series of furious blow strike the door the sound be such as would be make by a stick of oaken wood the solid door quiver under it it be on you side say i no it be on yours say she you be pound yourself to fool I cry i you be pound yourself to frighten I sob she and we nearly have a quarrel the sound continue with more or less intermission till daybreak alli fall asleep but i spend the time in appropriate reflection early in the morning i remove the button from miss fellow 's door she never know anything about it i believe however that i have the fairness to exculpate she in my secret heart from any trickish connection with the disturbance of that night just keep quiet about this little affair i say to my wife we shall come across a explanation in time and may never have any more of it we keep quiet and for five day so do the spirit as miss fellow be please to

rest it will not be need again this winter she observe and have better go into the cedar closet the garment by the way be marked and number in indelible ink i hear she run over the figure in a busy housekeeper 's undertone before carry they into the closet she lock the closet door i think for i remember the click of the key if i remember accurately i step into the hall after that to light a cigar and alison flit to and fro with she clothes drop the baby 's little white stocking every step or two and anathematize they daintily -- within orthodox bound of course in about five minute she call I she voice be sharp and alarmed come quick o fred look here all those clothes that i lock into the cedar closet be out here on the bed my dear wife i blandly observe as i saunter into the room too much of gertrude fellow have make thee mad let _ I _ see the clothes she point to the bed some white clothing lay upon it fold in a ugly way to represent a corpse with cross hand be it mean for a joke alison you do it yourself i suppose fred i have not touch it with the tip of my little finger gertrude then gertrude be in the parlor write so she be i call she up she look surprised and trouble

threshold upon the bed lay some clothing fold as before in rude hideous imitation of the dead i take each article in turn and compare the name and number with the name and number in my diary they be identical throughout i take the clothes take the three key from my pocket unlock the cedar-room door unlock the closet door unlock the upper drawer and look in the drawer be empty to say that from this time i fail to own -- to myself if not to other people -- that some mysterious influence inexplicable by common or scientific cause be at work in my house would be to accuse myself of more obstinacy than even i be capable of i propounded theory after theory and give it up i arrive at conclusion upon conclusion and throw they aside finally i hold my peace cease to talk of rat keep my mind in a state of passive vacancy and narrowly and quietly watch the progress of affair from the date of that escapade with the underclothes confusion reign in we corner of nemo 's avenue that night neither my wife nor myself close a eye the house so resounded and re-echoed with the blow of unseen hammer fist log and knuckle miss fellow too be pale with she vigil look trouble and propose go home this i peremptorily veto determine if the woman have any connection honest or otherwise with the mystery to ferret it out the follow day just after dinner i be write in the library when a child 's cry of fright and pain startle I it seem to come from the little yard behind the house and i hurry thither to behold a singular sight there be one apple-tree in the yard -- a old stunt crooked thing and in that tree i find my son and heir tip tie fast with a small stout rope tie do not express it he be gag manacled twisted contorted wound about cross and recross hold without a chance of motion scarcely of breath you never tie yourself up here child i ask as i cut the knot the question certainly be unnecessary no juggler could have bind himself in such a fashion scarcely then a four-year ' child to my continued clear and gentle inquiry the boy reply persistently and consistently that nobody tie he there -- not cousin gertrude nor bridget nor the baby nor mamma nor jane nor papa nor the black kitty he be just tooken up all at once into the tree and that be all there be about it he s ` pose it must have be god or something like that do it poor tip have a hard time of it two day after that while he mother and i sit discuss the incident and the child be at play upon the floor he suddenly throw himself at full length writhe with pain and beg to have they pull out quick have _ what _ pull out exclaim he terrify mother she take the child into she lap and find that he be stick over from head to foot with large white pin we have not so many large pin in all the house she say as soon as he be relieve as she speak the word thirty or forty _ small _ pin pierce the boy where they come from no one could see how they come there no one know we look and there they be and tip be cry and writhe as before for the remainder of that winter we have scarcely a day of quiet the rumor that the hotchkiss have rent a haunt house leak out and spread abroad the frightened servant give warning and other frightened servant take they place to leave in turn my wife be she own cook and nursery-maid a quarter of the time the disturbance vary in character with every week assume as time go on a importunity which have we not quietly settle it in we own mind not to be beat by a noise would have drive we from the house night after night the mysterious finger rap at the window the door the floor the wall day after day uncomfortable trick be spring upon we by invisible agency we become use to the noise so that we sleep through they easily but many of the phenomenon be so strikingly unpleasant and so singularly unsuited to the ordinary condition of human happiness and housekeeping that we scarcely become -- as one of we excellent deacon have a cheerful habit of exhort we to become -- resign upon one occasion we have invite a small and select number of friend to dine it be to be rather a _ recherch _ affair for nemo 's avenue and my wife have spare no painstaking to suit herself with she table we have have a comparatively quiet house the night before so that we cook who have be with we three day consent to remain till we guest have be provide for the soup be good the pigeon better the bread be _ not _ sour and alli look hopeful and inclined to trust providence for the gravy and dessert it be just as i have begin to carve the beef that i observe my wife suddenly pale and a telegram from she eye turn mine in the direction of general popgun who sit at she right hand my sensation can better be imagine than describe when i see general popgun 's fork untouched by any human hand dance a jig on he plate he grasp it and lay it firmly down as soon as he release he hold it leap from the table really -- aw -- very singular phenomenon begin the general very singular i be not prepare to credit the extraordinary account of spiritual manifestation in this house but -- aw -- well i must say -- instantly it be pandemonium at that dinner-table dr jump 's knife mr m ` ready 's plate and colonel hope 's tumbler spring from they place the pigeon fly from the platter the caster rattle and roll the salt-cellar bound to and fro and the gravy move by some invisible disturber spatter all over mr elia p critique 's _ moire antique _ mortify and anger beyond endurance i for the first time address the spirit -- wrench for the moment into a profound belief that they must be spirit indeed whatever you be and wherever you be i shout bring my hand down hard upon the table go out of this room and let we alone the only reply be a furious mazourka of all the dish on the table a gentleman present who have as he afterward tell we study the subject of spiritualism somewhat very sceptically and with unsatisfactory result observe the performance keenly and suggest that i should try a gentler method of appeal whatever the agent be -- and what it be he have not yet discover -- he have notice repeatedly that the quiet mode of meet it be most effective rather amuse i speak more softly address the caster and intimate in my blandest manner that i and my guest would feel under obligation if we could have the room to ourselves till after we have dine the disturbance gradually cease and we have no more of it that day a morning or two after alison chance to leave half a dozen teaspoon upon the sideboard in the breakfast-room they be of solid silver and quite thick she be go to rub they herself i believe and go into the china-closet which open from the room for the silver-soap the breakfast-room be leave vacant and it be vacant when she return to it and she insist with a quiet conviction which it be hardly reasonable to doubt that no human being do or could have enter the room without she knowledge when she come back to the sideboard every one of those spoon lay there _ bent double _ she show they to I when i come home at noon have they be pewter toy they could not have be more completely twist out of shape than they be i take they without any remark -lrb- i begin to feel as if this mystery be assume uncomfortable proportion -rrb- put they away just as i find they into a small cupboard in the wall of the breakfast-room lock the cupboard door with the only key in the house which fit it put the key in my inner vest pocket and meditatively eat my dinner about half a hour afterward a neighbor drop in to groan over the weather and see the baby and alli chance to mention the incident of the spoon really mr hotchkiss say the lady with a slight smile and that indefinite quickly smother change of eye which signify i do not believe a word of it be you sure that there be not a mistake somewhere or a little mental hallucination the story be very entertaining but -- i beg you pardon -- i should be interested to see those spoon you curiosity shall be gratified madam i say a little testily and take the key from my pocket i lead she to the cupboard and unlock the door i find those spoon as straight smooth and fair as ever spoon have be -- not a dent not a wrinkle not a bend nor untrue line could we discover anywhere upon they _ oh _ say we visitor significantly that lady be it record then and thenceforward spare no pain to find and strengthen throughout nemo 's avenue the theory that the hotchkiss be get up all that spiritual nonsense to force they landlord into lower rent and such respectable people too it do seem a pity do not it one night i be alone in the library it be late about half-past eleven i think the brightest gas jet be light so that i could see to every portion of the small room the door be shut there be no furniture but the book-case my table and chair no slide : door or conceal corner no nook or cranny in which any human creature could lurk unseen by I and i say that i be alone i have be write to a confidential friend a somewhat minute account of the disturbance in my house which be now of about six week ' duration i have beg he to come and observe they for himself and help I out with a solution -- i myself be at a loss for a reasonable one there certainly seem to be evidence of superhuman agency but i be hardly ready yet to commit myself thoroughly to that view of the matter and -- in the middle of that sentence i lay down my pen a consciousness sudden and distinct come to I that i be not alone in that bright little silent room yet to mortal eye alone i be i push away my writing and look about the warm air be empty of outline the curtain be undisturbed the little recess under the library table hold nothing but my own foot there be no sound but the ordinary rap-rapping on the floor to which i have by this time become so accustomed that often it pass unnoticed i rise and examine the room thoroughly until quite satisfied that i be its only visible occupant then sit down again the rapping have meantime become loud and impatient i have learn that very week from miss fellow the spiritual alphabet with which she be in the habit of communicate with she dead mother i have never ask she nor have she propose to use it herself for my benefit i have mean to try all other means of investigation before resort to it now however be alone and be perplexed and annoyed by my sense of have invisible company i turn and spell out upon the table so many rap to a letter till the question be complete : -- _ what do you want of I _ instantly the answer come rap back : -- _ stretch down you hand _ i put my finger under the table and i feel as indubitably as i ever feel a touch in my life the grasp of a _ warm human hand _ i add to the broken paragraph in the letter to my friend a brief account of the occurrence and reiterate my entreaty that he would come at he earliest convenience to my house he be a episcopal clergyman by the way and i consider that he testimony would uphold my fast-sinking character for veracity among my townspeople i begin to have a impression that this dilemma in which i find myself be a pretty serious one for a man of peaceable disposition and honest intention to be in about this time i undertake to come to a little better understanding with miss fellow i take she away alone and have try my best not to frighten the life out of she by my grave face ask she seriously and kindly to tell I whether she suppose herself to have any connection with the phenomenon in my house to my surprise she answer promptly that she think she have i repress a whistle and ask for information the presence of a medium render easy what would otherwise be impossible she reply i offer to go away mr hotchkiss in the beginning i assure she that i have no desire to have she go away at present and beg she to proceed the influence in the house be strong as i have say before she continue look through I and beyond I with she vacant eye something be wrong they be never at rest i hear they i feel they i see they they go up and down the stair with I i find they in my room i see they glide about i see they stand now with they hand almost upon you shoulder i confess to a kind of chill that creep down my backbone at these word and to have turn my head and stare hard at the book-case behind I but they -- i mean something -- rap one night before you come i suggest yes and they might rap after i be go the simple noise be not uncommon in place where there be no better mean of communication the extreme method of expression such as you have witness this winter be i doubt not practicable only when the system of a medium be accessible they write all sort of message for you you would ridicule they i do not repeat they you and cousin alison do not see hear feel as i do we be differently make there be lie spirit and true good spirit and bad sometimes the bad deceive and distress I but sometimes -- sometimes my mother come she lower she voice reverently and i be fain to hush the laugh upon my lip whatever the thing might prove to be to I it be daily comfort to the nervous unstrung lonely woman whom to suspect of trickery i begin to think be worse than stupidity from the time of my midnight experience in the library i allow myself to look a little further into the subject of communication miss fellow write they out at my request whenever they come to she writer on spiritualism have describe the process so frequently that it be unnecessary for I to dwell upon it at length the influence take she unaware in the usual manner in the usual manner she arm -- to all appearance the passive instrument of some unseen powerful agency -- jerk and glide over the paper write in curious scrawly character never in she own neat little old-fashioned hand message of which on come out from the trance state she would have-no memory of many of which at any time she could have have no comprehension these message assume every variety of character from the tragic to the ridiculous and a large portion of they have no point whatever one day benjamin west desire to give I lesson in oil-painting the next my brother joseph dead now for ten year ask forgiveness for he share in a little quarrel of ours which have embittered a portion of he last day -- of which by the way i be confident that miss fellow know nothing at one time i receive a long discourse enlighten I on the arrangement of the sphere in the disembodied state of existence at another alison 's dead grandfather pathetically remind she of a certain Sunday afternoon at meetin ' long ago when the child alli hooked he wig off in the long prayer with a bent pin and a piece of fish-line one day we be sadden by the confused wail of a lose spirit who represent he agony as greater than soul could bear and clamor for relief move to pity i inquire : -- what can we do for you unseen knuckle rap back the touching answer : -- give I a piece of squash pie i remark to miss fellow that i suppose this to be a modern and improve version of the ancient drop of water which be to cool the tongue of dive she reply that it be the work of a mischievous spirit who have nothing better to do they would not infrequently take in that way the reply from the lip of another i be not sure whether we be to have lip in the spiritual world but i think that be she expression through all the nonsense and confusion of these daily message however one restless indefinite purpose run a struggle for expression that we could not grasp a sense of something unperformed which be torment somebody one week we have be so much more than usually annoy by the dancing of table shake of door and breaking of crockery that i lose all patience and at length vehemently dare we unseen tormentor to show themselves who and what be you i cry destroy the peace of my family in this unendurable fashion if you be mortal man i will meet you as mortal man whatever you be in the name of all fairness let I see you if you see I it will be death to you tap the invisible then let it be death to I come on when shall i have the pleasure of a interview to-morrow night at six o'clock to-morrow at six then be it and to-morrow at six it be allis have a headache and be lie down upstairs miss fellow and i be with she busy with cologne and tea and one thing and another i have in fact forget all about my superhuman appointment when just as the clock strike six a low cry from miss fellow arrest my attention i see it she say see what a tall man wrap in a sheet you eye be the only one so favor it happen i say with a superior smile but while i speak alli start from the pillow with a look of fear _ i _ see it fred she exclaim under she breath woman 's imagination for i see nothing i see nothing for a moment then i must depose and say that i _ do _ see a tall figure cover from head to foot with a sheet standing still in the middle of the room i spring upon it with raise arm my wife state that i be within a foot of it when the sheet drop it drop at my foot -- nothing but a sheet i pick it up and shake it only a sheet it be one of those old linen one of grandmother 's say alli examine it there be only six marked in pink with the boar 's - head in the corner it come from the blue chest up garret they have not be take out for year i take the sheet back to the blue chest myself -- have first observe the number as i have do before with the underclothes and lock it in i come back to my room and sit down by alli in about three minute we see the figure standing still as before in the middle of the room as before i spring at it and as before the drapery drop and there be nothing there i pick up the sheet and turn to the number corner it be the same that i have lock into the blue chest miss fellow be incline to fear that i have really endanger my life by this ghostly rendezvous i can testify however that it be by no means death to I nor do i experience any ill effect from the event my friend the clergyman make I the desire visit in January for a week after he arrival as if my tormentor be bent on convince my almost only friend that i be a fool or a juggler we have no disturbance at all beyond the ordinary rapping these the reverend gentleman confess be of a singular nature but express a polite desire to see some of the extraordinary manifestation of which i have write he but one day he have rise with some formality to usher a formal caller to the-door when to he slight amazement and my secret delight he chair -- a easy-chair of good proportion -- deliberately jump up and hop after he across the room from this period the mystery manifest itself to he heart 's content not only do the rocking-chair and the cane-seat chair and the round-backed chair and tip 's little chair and the affghan chase he about and the heavy _ tte--tte _ in the corner evince symptom of agitation at he approach but the piano trundle a solemn minuet at he the heavy walnut centre-table rise half-way to the ceiling under he eye the marble-topped stand on which he sit to keep it still lift itself and he a foot from the ground he coffee-cup spill over when he try to drink shake by a unseen elbow he dressing-case disappear from he bureau and hide themselves none know how or when in he closet and under he bed mysterious uncanny figure dress in he best clothes and stuff with straw stand in he room when he come to it at night he candlestick walk untouched by hand from the mantel into space key and chain fall from the air at he foot and raw turnip drop from the solid ceiling into he soup-plate well garth say i one day confidentially how be thing begin to have a ` realize sense ' of it eh let I think awhile he answer i leave he to he reflection and devoted my attention for a day or two to gertrude fellow she seem to have be of late receive less ridiculous less indefinite and more important message from she spiritual acquaintance the burden of they be direct at I they be sometimes confuse but never contradictory and the sum of they as i cast it up be this : -- a former occupant of the house one mr timothy jabber have be in early life connect in the dry-goods business with my wife 's father and have unknown to any but himself defraud he partner of a considerable sum for a young swindler -- some five hundred dollar i think this fact keep in the knowledge only of god and the guilty man have be he agony since he death in the parlance of spiritualism he could never purify he soul and rise to a higher sphere till he have make restitution -- though to that part of the communication i pay little attention this money my wife as she father 's sole living heir be entitle to and this money i be desire to claim for she from mr jabber 's estate then in the hand of some wealthy nephew i make some inquiry which lead to the discovery that there have be a mr timothy jabber once the occupant of we house that he have at one period be in business with my wife 's father that he be now many year dead and that he nephew in new york be he heir we never attempt to bring any claim upon they for three reason : in the first place because we know we should not get the money in the second because such a procedure would give so palpable a object in people 's eye for the disturbance at the house that we should in all probability lose the entire confidence of the entire non-spiritualistic community thirdly because i think it problematical whether any constable of ordinary size and courage could be find who would undertake to summon the witness to testify in the county court at atkinsville i mention the matter only because on the theory of spiritualism it appear to give some point and occasion to the phenomenon and they infesting that particular house whether poor mr timothy jabber feel relieve by have unburden himself of he confession i can not state but after he find that i pay some attention to he message he gradually cease to express himself through turnip and cold key the rapping grow less violent and frequent and finally cease altogether shortly after that miss fellow go home garth and i talk matter over the day after she leave he have bring he think to a close whittle he opinion to a point and be quite ready to stick they into they place for my benefit and leave they there as george garth leave all he opinion immovable as the everlasting hill how much have she to do with it now -- the fellow precisely what she say she have no more she be a medium but not a juggler no trickery about the affair then no trickery could have send that turnip into my soup-plate or that candlestick walk into the air there _ be _ a great deal of trickery mix with such phenomenon the next case you come across may be a regular cheat but you will find it out -- you 'll find it out you have have three month to find this out and you could not whatever may be the explanation of the mystery the man who can witness what you and i have witness and pronounce it the trick of that incapable washed-out woman be either a liar or a fool you understand yourself and you wife and you have test you servant faithfully so we be somewhat narrow in we conclusion well then what be the matter i be i confess a little startled by the vehemence with which my friend bring he clerical fist down upon the table and exclaim : -- the devil dear I garth do not swear you in search of a pulpit just at this time too i tell you i never speak more solemnly i can not in the face of fact ascribe all these phenomenon to human agency something that come we know not whence and go we know not whither be at work there in the dark i be drive to grant to it a extra-human power yet when that flabby miss fellow in the trance state undertake to bring I message from my dead wife and when she attempt to recall the most tender memory of we life together i can not -- he pause and turn he face a little away -- it would be pleasant to think i have a word from mary but i can not think she be there i do not believe good spirit concern themselves with this thing it have in its fair development too much nonsense and too much positive sin read a few number of the ` banner ' or attend a convention or two if you want to be convince of that if they be not good spirit they be bad one that be all i have dip into the subject in various way since i have be here consult the medium talk with the prophet i be convinced that there be no dependence to be place on the thing you never learn anything from it that it be worth while to learn above all you never can trust its _ prophecy _ it be evil -- _ evil _ at the root and except by physician and scientific man it have better be let alone they may yet throw light on it you and i can not i propose for myself to drop it henceforth in fact it look too much toward put one 's self on term of intimacy with the prince of the power of the air to please I you be rather positive consider the difficulty of the subject i say the truth be and it may be about time to own to it that the three month ' siege against the mystery which i have hold so pertinaciously that winter have drive I to broad term of capitulation i assent to most of my friend 's conclusion but where he stop i begin a race for further light i understand then for the first time the peculiar charm which i have often see work so fatally with dabbler in spiritualism the fascination of the thing be upon I i ransack the papers for advertisement of medium i go from city to city at they mysterious call i hold _ sances _ in my parlor and frightened my wife with message -- some of they ghastly enough -- from she dead relative i run the usual gauntlet of strange seer in strange place who tell I my name the name of all my friend dead or alive my secret aspiration and peculiar characteristic my past history and future prospects for a long time they never make a failure absolute stranger tell I fact about myself which not even my own wife know : whether they speak with the tongue of devil or whether by some unknown law of magnetism they simply _ read my thought _ i be not even now prepare to say i think if they have make a miss i should have be spare some suffer they communication have sometimes a ridiculous aimlessness and occasionally a subtle deviltry coated about with religion like a pill with sugar but often a significant and fearful accuracy once i remember they foretell a indefinite calamity to be bring upon I before sunset on the follow Saturday before sunset on that Saturday i lose a thousand dollar in mining stock which have stand in all eastern eye as solid as its own gold at another time i be warn by a medium in philadelphium that my wife then visit in boston be take suddenly ill i have leave she in perfect health but feeling nevertheless uneasy i take the night train and go directly to she i find she in the agony of a severe attack of pleurisy just prepare to send a telegram to I they prophecy be unreliable notwithstanding coincidence write george garth let they alone fred i beg of you you will regret it if you do not once let I be fairly take in and cheat to my face i make reply and i may compress my view to you platform until then i must gang my own gait i now come to the remarkable portion of my story -- at least it seem to I the remarkable portion under my present condition of vision in August of the summer follow miss fellow 's visit and the manifestation in my house at atkinsville i be startle one pleasant morning while sit in the office of a medium in washington street in boston by a singularly unpleasant communication the second day of next may write the medium -- she write with the forefinger of one hand upon the palm of the other -- the second of may at one o'clock in the afternoon you will be summon into a spiritual state of existence i suppose in good english that mean i be go to die i reply carelessly would you be so good as to write it with a pen and ink that there may be no mistake she write it distinctly : the second of may at one o'clock in the afternoon i pocket the slip of paper for further use and sit reflect how do you know it _ i _ do not know it i be tell who tell you jerusha babcock and george washington jerusha babcock be the name of my maternal grandmother what could the woman know of my maternal grandmother it do not occur to I i believe to wonder what occasion george washington could find to concern himself about my die or my living there stand the uncanny jerusha as pledge that my informant know what she be talk about i leave the office with a uneasy sinking at the heart there be a coffin-store near by and i remember the peculiar interest with which i study the quilting of the satin lining and the peculiar crawl sensation which creep to my finger ' end determine not to be unnecessarily alarmed i spend the next three week in test the communication i visit one more medium in boston two in new york one in new haven one in philadelphium and one in a little out-of-the-way connecticut village where i spend a night and do not know a soul none of these people i be confident have ever see my face or hear my name before it be a circumstance calculate at least to arrest attention that these seven people each unknown to the other and without concert with the other repeat the ugly message which have seek I out through the happy summer morning in washington street there be no hesitation no doubt no contradiction i could not trip they or cross-question they out of it unerring assure and consistent the fiat go forth : -- on the second of may at one o'clock in the afternoon you will pass out of the body i would not have believe they if i could have help myself i sigh for the calm day when i have laugh at medium and prophet and sneer at ghost and rap i take lodgings in philadelphium lock my door and pace my room all day and half the night tortured by my thought and consult book of medicine to discover what evidence i could by any possibility give of unsuspected disease i be at that time absolutely well and strong absolutely well and strong i be force to confess myself after have wade through latin adjective and anatomical illustration enough to make a ghost of hercule i devoted two day to research in genealogical pathology and be reward for my pain by discover myself to be the possessor of one great-aunt who have die of heart disease at the advanced age of two month heart disease then i settle upon the alternative be accident which will it be i ask in vain upon this point my friend the medium hold a delicate reserve the influence be confusing and they be not prepare to state with exactness why _ do not _ you come home my wife write in distress and perplexity you promise to come ten day ago and they need you at the office and i need you more than anybody i need you more than anybody when the little clinging need of three week grow into the great want of a lifetime -- o how could i tell _ she _ what be come i do not tell she when i have hurry home when she come bound through the hall to meet I when she hold up she face half laughing half cry and flush and pale to mine -- the poor little face that by and by would never watch and glow at my come -- i could not tell she when the child be in bed and we be alone after tea she climb gravely up into my lap from the little cricket on which she have be sit and put she hand upon my shoulder you be sober fred and pale something ail you you know and you be go to tell I all about it she pretty mischievous face swam suddenly before my eye i kiss it put she gently down as i would a child and go away alone till i feel more like myself the winter set in gloomily enough it may have be the snow-storm of which we have a average of one every other day or it may have be the storm in my own heart which i be weather alone whether to believe those people or whether to laugh at they prediction whether to tell my wife or whether to continue silent -- these question torment I through many wakeful night and dreary day my fear be in nowise allay by a letter which ' i receive one day in January from gertrude fellow why do not you read it aloud what be the news ask alison but at one glance over the opening page i fold the sheet and do not read it till i could lock myself into the library alone the letter run : -- i have be much disturbed lately on you behalf my mother and you brother joseph appear to I nearly every day and charge I with some message to you which i can not distinctly grasp it seem to be clear however as far as this : that some calamity be to befall you in the spring -- in may i should say it seem to I to be of the nature of death i do not learn that you can avoid it but that they desire you to be prepare for it after receive this last warning certain uncomfortable word file through my brain for day together : -- set thine house in order for thou shalt surely die never know you read you bible so much in all you life say alison with a pretty pout you 'll grow so good that i can not begin to keep up with you when i try to read my polyglot the baby come and bite the corner and squeal till i put it away and take he up as the winter wear away i arrive at this conclusion : if i be in fact destine to death in the spring my wife could not help herself or I by the knowledge of it if event prove that i be delude in the dread and i have share it with she she would have have all she pain and anxiety to no purpose in either case i would insure she happiness for these few month they might be she last happy month at any rate happiness be a good thing and she could not have too much of it to say that i myself feel no uneasiness as to the event would be affectation the old sword of damocle hang over I the hair might hold but it be a hair as the winter pass -- it seem to I as if winter have never pass so rapidly before -- i find it natural to watch my health with the most careful scrutiny to avoid improper food and undue excitement to refrain from long and perilous journey to consider whether each new cook who enter the family might have occasion to poison I it be a anomaly which i do not observe at the time that while in my heart of heart i expect to breathe my last upon the second of may i yet cherish a distinct plan of fight cheating persuade or overmatch death i close a large speculation on which i have be incline in the summer to fly alison could never manage petroleum venture i wind up my business in a safe and systematic manner hotchkiss must mean to retire people say i revise my will and hold one long and necessary conversation with my wife about she future should anything happen to I she listen and plan without tear or exclamation but after we have finish the talk she creep up to I with a quiet puzzle sadness that i could not bear you be grow so blue lately fred why what can ` happen ' to you i do not believe god can mean to leave I here after you be go i do not believe he _ can _ mean to all through the sweet spring day we be much together i go late to the office i come home early i spend the beautiful twilight at home i follow she about the house i make she read to I sing to I sit by I touch I with she little soft hand i watch she face till the sight choke I how soon before she would know how soon i feel as if we would just be marry over again she say one day pinch my cheek with a low laugh you be so good i would no idea you care so much about I by and by when you get over this lazy fit and go about as you use to i shall feel so desert -- you have no idea i believe i will order a little widow 's cap and put it on and wear it about -- now what do you mean by get up and stalk off to look out of the window fine prospect you must have with the curtain down it be to say the least a uncomfortable state of affair when you find yourself draw within a fortnight of the day on which seven people have assure you that you be go to shuffle off this mortal coil it be not agreeable to have no more idea than the dead -lrb- probably not as much -rrb- of the manner in which you demise be to be effect it be not in all respects a cheerful mode of existence to dress yourself in the morning with the reflection that you be never to half wear out you new mottled coat and that this striped neck-tie will be lay away by and by in a little box and cry over by you wife to hear you immediate acquaintance all wonder why you _ do not _ get yourself some new boot to know that you partner have be hear to say that you be grow dull at trade to find the child complain that you have engage no room yet at the beach to look into they upturned eye and wonder how long it be go to take for they to forget you to go out after breakfast and wonder how many more time you will shut that front door to come home in the perfumed dusk and see the face press against the window to watch for you and feel warm arm about you neck and wonder how soon they will shrink from the chill of you to feel the glow of the budding world and think how blossom and fruit will crimson and drop without you and wonder how the blossom and fruit of life can slip from you in the time of violet smell and oriole April spatter with shower and drip upon a little with ineffectual sun slide restlessly away from I and i lock my office door one night reflect that it be the night of the first of may and that to-morrow be the second i spend the evening alone with my wife i have spend more agreeable evening she come and nestle at my foot and the firelight paint she cheek and hair and she eye follow I and she hand be in mine but i have spend more agreeable evening the morning of the second break without a cloud blue jay flash past my window a bed of royal pansy open to the sun and the smell of the fresh moist earth come up where tip be digging in he little garden not feel exactly like work to-day as i tell my wife i do not go to the office i ask she to come into the library and sit with I i remember that she have a pudding to bake and refuse at first then yield laughing and say that i must go without my dessert i think it highly probable that i _ should _ go without my dessert i remember precisely how pretty she be that morning she wear a bright dress -- blue i think -- and a white crocus in she hair she have a dainty white apron tie on to cook in she say and she pink nail be powdered with flour she eye laugh and twinkle at I i remember think how young she look and how unready for suffer i remember that she bring the baby in after a while and that tip come all muddy from the garden drag he tiny hoe over the carpet that the window be open and that while we all sit there together a little brown bird bring some twine and build a nest on a apple-bough just in sight i find it difficult to explain the anxiety which i feel as the morning wear on that dinner should be punctually upon the table at half past twelve but i now understand perfectly as i do not once the old philosophy : let we eat and drink for to-morrow we die it be ironing-day and we dinner be apt to be late upon ironing-days i conclude that if the soup be punctual and not too hot i could leave myself ten or perhaps fifteen unoccupied minute before one o'clock it strike I as curious now the gravity with which this think underran the fever and pain and dread of the morning i fall to read my hymn-book about twelve o'clock and when alison call I to dinner i do not remember to consult my watch the soup be good though hot a grim epicurean stolidity creep over I as i sit down before it a man have better make the most of he last chance at mock-turtle fifteen minute be enough to die in i be confident that i eat more rapidly than be consistent with consummate elegance i remember that tip imitate I and that alli open she eye at I i recall distinctly the fact that i have pass my plate a second time i have pass my plate a second time i say and have just raise the spoon to my lip when it fall from my palsied hand for the little bronze clock upon the mantel strike one i sit with draw breath and glare at it at the relentless silver hand at the fierce and as it seem to I _ live _ face of the time on its top who stoop and swing he scythe at I i would like a very _ big _ white potato say tip break the solemn silence you may or may not believe I but it be a fact that that be all which happen \* \* \* \* \* i slowly turn my head i resume my spoon the kitchen clock be nearly half a hour too slow observe alison i tell jane that you would have it fix this week i finish my soup in silence it may interest the reader to learn that up to the date of this article i still live little tommy tucker there be but three person in the car a merchant deep in the income

shift by and out of sight we have live and love together play tommy in a little plaintive wail we have live and love -- confound the boy harmon push up he hat with a jerk and look out of the window the night be come on a dull sunset lay low on the water burning like a bale-fire through the snaky trail of smoke that go writhe past the car window against lonely signal-house and little desert beach the water be plash drearily and play monotonous basis to tommy 's wail : -- through many change year many change year it be a nuisance this music in the car why do not somebody stop it what do the child mean by play that they have leave the city far behind now he wonder how far he push up the window fiercely vent the passion of the music on the first thing that come in he way and thrust he head out to look back through the undulating smoke out in the pale glimmer from the sky he could see a low red tongue of land cover with the twinkle of light home somewhere there in among the quiver warmth be one -- what be that boy about now not home sweet home but that be what tommy be about they be light the lamp now in the car harmon look at the conductor 's face as the sickly yellow flare strike on it with a curious sensation he wonder if he have a wife and five child if he ever think of run away from they what he would think of a man who do what most people would think what she would think she -- ah she have it all to find out yet there be no place like home say tommy 's little fiddle o no place like home now this fiddle of tommy 's may have have a crack or so in it and i can not assert

monotonous sob of the wind break at the corner of the house in the silence between the two it be distinctly hear martha ryck 's face pale a little i wish -- she try to laugh amo it cry just like a baby nonsense she husband rise impatiently and walk to the window he be not give to fancy all he life be rule and square up to a creed yet i doubt if he like the sound of that wind much better than

moreover he be a deacon in the church he own life stern in its purity could brook no tenderness toward offender he own child be as shut out from he forgiveness as he deem she to be from the forgiveness of he god yet you would have see in one look at the man that this blow with which he be smitten have cleft he heart to its core this be she birthday -- hers whose name have not pass he lip for year do you think he have once forget it since its morning do not the memory it bring crowd into every moment do they not fill the very prayer in which he beseech a sin-hating god to avenge he of all he enemy so many time the child have sit there at he foot on this day play with some birthday toy -- he always manage to find she something a doll or a picture-book she use to come up to thank he

child she give he he name in a frolic one day he be always she playfellow many a time they have come in and find she asleep with muff 's black shaggy side for a pillow and she little pink arm around he neck she face warm and bright with some happy dream mr ryck have often think he would sell the creature but he never have if he have be a woman he would have say he could not be a man he argue that muff be a good watch-dog and worth keep always in the way muff he mutter look at the patient black head rub against he knee he be angry with the dog at that moment the next he have repent the brute

to bear without that but it be best not to talk of what can not be help -- you see yes do not think anything more about the day it be not -- it be not really good for you you must cheer up little woman yes amo perhaps he unusual tenderness give she courage she stand up put both arm around he neck if you would only try to love she a little after all my husband he would know it he might save she for it amo ryck choke cough and say it be time for prayer he take down the old bible in which he child 's baby-finger use to trace they first lesson after he own and read not of she who love much and be forgive but one of the imprecatory psalm when mr ryck be sure that she husband be asleep that night she rise softly from she bed unlock with noiseless key one of she bureau drawer take something from it and then feel she way down the dark stair into the kitchen she draw a chair up to the fire wrap she shawl closely about she and untied with tremble finger the knot of a soft silken handkerchief in which she treasure be fold some baby dress of purest white a child 's little pink apron a pair of tiny shoe wear through by patter foot and a toy or two all break as some impatient little finger have leave they she be such a careless baby yet they never could scold she she always affect such pretty surprise and wide blue-eyed penitence : a bit of a queen she be at the farm be it not most kindly order by the infinite tenderness which pitieth its sorrowing one that into she still hour she child should come so often only as a child speak pure thing only touch she mother so like a restful hand and steal into a prayer for where be ever grief like this one beside this sorrow death be but a joy if she might have close she child 's baby-eye and see the lip which have not utter they first mother still and lay she away under the daisy she would have sit there alone that night and thank he who have give and take away but _ this _ -- a wanderer upon the face of the earth -- a mark deeper seared than the mark of cain upon the face which she have fondle and kiss within she arm the soul to which she have give life accurse of god and man -- to measure this there be no speech nor language martha ryck rise at last take off the cover of the stove and make a fresh blaze which brighten all the room and shoot its glow far into the street she go to the window to push the curtain carefully aside stand a moment look out into the night steal softly to the door unlock it then go upstairs to bed the wind rise suddenly that night strike sharply through the city it have be cold enough before but the threaten storm forebode that it would be worse yet before morning the people crowd in a warm and brilliant church cast wander glance from the preacher to the paint window beyond which the night lay darkly think of the ride home in close cushion carriage and shiver so do a woman outside stop just by the door and look in at the hushed and sacred shelter such a temperature be not the best medicine for that cough of hers she have just crawl out of the garret where she have lie sick very sick for week pass the door of the temple which rear its massive front and glittering window out of the darkness of the street she ear be catch by the faint muffle sound of some anthem the choir be sing she draw the hood of she cloak over she face turn into the shadow of the step and stand so listen why she hardly know perhaps it be the mere entreaty of the music for she dull ear have never grow deaf to it or perhaps a memory flitting as a shadow of other place and other time in which the hymn of god 's church have not be strange to she she catch the word at last brokenly they be of some one who be wound wound she hold she breath listen curiously the wind shriek past drown the rest only the swell of the organ murmur above it she steal up the granite step just within the entrance no one be there to see she and she go on tiptoe to the muffle door put she ear to it she hair fall over she face it be some plaintive minor air they be hymn as sad as a die wail and as sweet as a mother 's lullaby but he be wound he be wound for we transgression he be bruise for we iniquity then grow slower and more faint a single voice take up the strain mournfully but clearly with a hush in it as if one sing on calvary yet we hide as it be we face from he he be despise and we esteem he not well he only know what it speak to the woman who listen with she guilty face hide in she hair how it draw she like a call to join the throng that worship he i would like to hear the rest she mutter to herself i wonder what it be about a child come down from the gallery just then a ragged boy who like herself have wander in from the street hilloa meg he say laugh _ you _ go to meeting that be a good joke if she have hear he she would have turn away but she hand be on the latch the door have swing upon its noiseless hinge the peal organ drown he voice she go in and sit down in a empty slip close by the door look about she for the moment in a sort of childish wonder the church be a blaze of light and color one perceive a mist of gayly dress people a soft flutter of fan and faint sweet perfume below the velvet-cushioned pulpit and pale scholarly outline of the preacher 's face above the warmth of rainbow-tinted glass the wreathe and massive carve of oaken cornice the glitter of gas-light from a thousand prism and the silence of the dome beyond the brightness strike sharply against the woman sit there alone she face seem to grow grayer and harder in it the very hush of that princely sanctuary seem break by she polluted presence true she keep afar off she do not so much as lift up she eye to heaven she have but steal in to hear the chant word that be mean for the acceptance and the comfort of the pure bright worshipper -- sinner to be sure in they way but then christ die for _ they _ this tabernacle to which they have bring they purple and gold and scarlet for he praise be not mean for such as meg you know but she have come into it nevertheless if he have call she there she do not know it she only sit and listen to the chant forget what she be forget to wonder if there be one of all that reverent throng who would be willing to sit and worship beside she the singing end at last and the pale preacher begin he sermon but meg do not care for that she could not understand it she crouch down in the corner of the pew she hood draw far over she face repeat to herself now and then mechanically as it seem the word of the chant wound -- for we transgression and bruise -- mutter after a while -- yet we hide we face bruise and wound the sound of the word attract she she say they over and over she know who he be many year ago she have hear of he it be a great while since then she have almost forget it be it true and be he perhaps -- be there a little chance it mean he be bruise for she -- for _ she _ she begin to wonder dimly still mutter the sorrowful word down in she corner where no one could hear she i wonder if he hear they do you think he do for when the sermon be end and the choir sing again -- still of he and how he call the heavy-laden and how he keep he own rest for they she say -- for be she not very weary and heavy-laden with she sin -- still crouch down in she corner that be I i guess it be i 'll find out she fix she eye upon the preacher thinking in she stunt childish way that he know so much so many thing she do not understand that surely he could tell she -- she should like to have it to think about she would ask he she rise instinctively with the audience to receive he blessing then wait in she hooded cloak like some dark and evil thing among the brilliant crowd the door opening as they begin to pass out by she sweep in such a chill of air as bring back a spasm of cough she stand quiver under it she face livid with the pain the crowd begin to look at she curiously to nod and whisper among themselves the sexton step up nervously he know who she be meg you would better go what be you stand here for she fling he a look out of she hard defiant eye she make no answer a child cling to she mother 's hand look up as she go by pity and fear in she great wonder eye mother see that poor woman she be hungry or cold the little one put she hand over the slip pull at meg 's cloak what be the matter with you why do not you go home bertha child be you crazy she mother catch she quickly away do not touch that woman meg hear it stand a moment after just at the edge of the aisle a lady clothe in velvet brush against she then gather she costly garment with a hand ringed and dazzling with diamond shrink as if she have touch some accursed thing and sweeping by meg 's eye freeze at that this be the sanctuary these the worshipper of he who be bruise he message could not be for she it would be of no use to find out about he of no use to tell he how she loathe herself and she life that she want to know about that rest and about that heavy-laden one he follower would not brook the very flutter of she dress against they pure garment they be like he he could have nothing to say to such as she she turn to go out through the open door she see the night and the storm within be the silent dome and the organ-hymn still swell up to it it be still of the wound that they sing meg listen linger touch the preacher on the arm as he come by i want to ask you a question he start at the sight of she or more perhaps at the sharpness in she voice why why who be you i be meg you do not know I i be not fit for you fine christian people to touch they will not let they little child speak to I well he say nervously for she pause well you be a preacher i want to know about he they have be singing of i come in to hear the singing i like it i -- i do not quite understand you begin the minister you surely have hear of jesus christ yes she eye soften somebody use to tell I it be mother we live in the country i be not what i be now i want to know if he can put I back again what if i should tell he i be go to be different would he hear I do you suppose somehow the preacher 's scholarly self-possession fail he he feel ill at ease standing there with the woman 's fixed black eye upon he why yes he always forgive a repentant sinner repentant sinner she repeat the word musingly i do not understand all these thing i have forget most all about it i want to know could not i come in some way with the child and be learn 'em i would not make any trouble there be something almost like a child in she voice just then almost as earnest and as pure the preacher take out he handkerchief and wipe he face then he change he hat awkwardly from hand to hand why why really we have no provision in we sabbath school for case like this : we have be mean to establish a institution of a missionary character but the fund can not be raise just yet i be sorry i do not know but -- it be no matter meg turn sharply away she hand drop lifelessly she move toward the door they be alone now in the church they two the minister 's pale cheek flush he step after she young woman she stop she face turn from he i will send you to some of the city missionary or i will go with you to the penitent ' retreat i should like to help you i -- he would have exhort she to reform as kindly as he know how he feel uncomfortable at let she go so he remember just then who wash the foot of he master with she tear but she would not listen she turn from he and out into the storm some cry on she lip -- it might have be : -- there be not nobody to help I i _ be _ go to be better she sink down on the snow outside exhaust by the rack cough which the air have again bring on the sexton find she there in the shadow when he lock the church door meg you here what ail you _ die _ i suppose the sight of she touch the man she lie there alone in the snow he linger hesitated thought of he own warm home look at she again if a friendly hand should save the creature -- he have hear of such thing well but how could he take she into he respectable home what would people say -- the sexton of the temple he have a little wife there too pure as the snow upon the ground to-night could he bring they under the same roof meg he say speaking in he nervous way though kindly you _ will _ die here i 'll call the police and let they take you where it be warmer but she crawl to she foot again no you will not she walk away as fast as she be able till she find a still place down by the water where no one could see she there she stand a moment irresolute look up through the storm as if search for the sky then sink upon she knee down in the silent shade of some timber perhaps she be half-frightened at the act for she kneel so a moment without speak there she begin to mutter : maybe he will not drive I off if they do maybe he will not i should just like to tell he anyway so she fold she hand as she have fold they once at she mother 's knee o lord i be tired of be _ meg _ i should like to be something else then she rise cross the bridge and on past the thin house walk feebly through the snow that drift against she foot she do not know why she be there or where she be go she repeat softly to herself now and then the word utter down in the shade of the timber she brain dull by the cold faint float dream steal into they meg tire of be meg she be not always that it be another name a pretty name she think with a childish smile -- maggie they always call she that she use to play about among the clover-blossom and buttercup then the pure little child use to kiss she nobody hoot after she in the street or drive she out of church or leave she all alone out in the snow -- _ maggie _ perhaps too some vague thought come to she of the mournful unconscious prophecy of the name as the touch of the sacred water upon she baby-brow have seal it -- magdalene she stop a moment weaken by she toiling against the wind throw off she hood the better to catch she labor breath and standing so look back at the city its light glimmer white and pale through the fall snow she face be a piteous sight just then do you think the haughtiest of the pure fair woman in yonder treasured home could have loathe she as she loathe herself at that moment yet it might have be a face as fair and pure as theirs kiss of mother and husband might have warm those draw and hueless lip they might have pray they happy prayer every night and morning to god it _ might have be _ you would almost have think he have mean it should be so if you have look into she eye sometimes -- perhaps when she be on she knee by the timber or when she listen to the chant crouch out of sight in the church well it be only that it might have be life could hold no possible bless change for she you know society have no place for it though she seek it carefully with tear who of all god 's happy child that he have keep from sin would have go to she and say my sister he love hold room for you and I have touch she with she woman 's hand hold out to she she woman 's help and bless she with she woman 's prayer and tear do you not think meg know the answer have she not learn it well in seven wander year have she not read it in every blast of this bitter night out into which she have come to find a helper when all the happy world pass by she on the other side she stand there look at the glittering of the city then off into the gloom where the path lay through the snow some struggle be in she face home home and mother she do not want I -- nobody want I i would better go back the storm be beat upon she but look from the city to the drift path and back from the lonely path to the light city she do not stir i should like to see it just to look in the window a little -- it would not hurt 'em any nobody would know she turn walk slowly where the snow lay pure and untrodden on out of sight of the town where the field be still think only as she go that nobody would know -- nobody would know she would see the old home out in the dark she could even say good-by to it quite aloud and they would not hear she or come and drive she away and then -- she look around where the great shadow lay upon the field feel the weakening of she limb she fail breath and smile not meg 's smile a very quiet smile with a little quiver in it she would find a still place under the tree somewhere the snow would cover she quite out of sight before morning -- the pure white snow she would be only maggie then the road like some familiar dream wound at last into the village down the street where she childish foot have patter in they playing by the old town pump where come home from school she use to drink the cool clear water on summer noon she pass -- a silent shadow she might have be the ghost of some dead life so moveless be she face she stop at last look about she where i most forget turn out from the road she find a brook half hide under the branch of a drip tree -- frozen now only a black glare of ice where she push away the snow with she foot it might have be a still green place in summer with bank of moss and bird singing overhead some faint color flush all she face she do not hear the icicle drop from the lonely tree yes -- she begin to talk softly to herself -- this be it the first time i ever see he he stand over there under the tree let I see be not i cross the brook yes i be cross the brook on the stone i have a pink dress i look in the glass when i go home brushing she soft hair out of she eye do i look pretty i can not remember it be a great while ago she come back into the street after that languidly for the snow lay deeper the wind too have chill she more than she know the sleet be freeze upon she mute white face she try to draw she cloak more closely about she but she hand refuse to hold it she look at they curiously numb how much farther i wonder it be not long before she come to it the house stand up silently in the night a single light glimmer far out upon the garden she eye catch it eagerly she follow it down across the orchard and the little plat where the flower use to be so bright all summer long she have not forget they she use to go out in the morning and pick they for she mother -- a whole apronful purple and pink and white with dewdrop on they she be fit to touch they then she mother use to smile when she bring they in she mother nobody ever smile so since do she know it do she ever wonder what have become of she -- the little girl who use to kiss she do she ever want to see she sometimes when she pray up in the old bedroom do she remember she daughter who have sin or guess that she be tire of it all and how no one in all the wide world would help she she be sleep there now and the father she be afraid to see he he would send she away if he know she have come out in the snow to look at the old home she wonder if she mother would she open the gate and go in the house be very still so be the yard and the gleam of light that lay golden on the snow the numbness of she body begin to steal over she brain she think at moment as she crawl up the path upon she hand and knee -- for she could no longer walk -- that she be dream some pleasant dream that the door would open and she mother come out to meet she attract like a child by the broad belt of light she follow it over and through a pile drift it lead she to the window where the curtain be push aside she manage to reach the blind and so stand up a moment cling to it look in the glow from the fire sharp on she face then she sink down upon the snow by the door lie so she face turn up against it she stiffened lip kiss the very dumb unanswering wood a thought come to she she remember the day for seven long year she have not think of it a spasm cross she face she hand fall clinch who be it of whom it be write that better be it for that man if he have never be bear of magdalene more vile than juda what should be say yet it be hard i think to fall so upon the very threshold -- so near the quiet peaceful room with the warmth and light and rest to stay all night in the storm with eye turn to that dead pitiless sky without one look into she mother 's face without one kiss or gentle touch or blessing and die so look up no one to hold she hand and look into she eye and hear she say she be sorry -- sorry for it all that they should find she there in the morning when she poor dead face could not see if she be forgive i should like to go in sob with the first tear of many year upon she cheek -- weak pitiful tear like a child 's -- just in out of the cold some sudden strength fall on she after that she reach up fumble for the latch it open at she first touch the door swing wide into the silent house she crawl in then into the kitchen where the fire be and the rocking-chair the plant in the window and the fade cricket upon the hearth the dog too rouse from he nap behind the stove he begin to growl at she he eye on fire muff she smile weakly stretch out she hand he do not know she -- he be fierce with stranger muff do not you know I i be maggie there there muff good fellow she creep up to he fearlessly put both she arm about he neck in a way she have of soothing he when she be he playfellow the creature 's low growl die away he submit to she touch doubtfully at first then he crouch on the floor beside she wag he tail wet she face with he huge tongue muff _ you _ know I you old fellow i be sorry muff i be -- i wish we could go out and play together again i be very tired muff she lay she head upon the dog just as she use to long ago creep up near the fire a smile break all over she face at muff 's short happy bark _ he _ do not turn I off he do not know he think i be nobody but maggie how long she lay so she do not know it might have be minute it might have be hour she eye wander all about the room grow brighter too and clearer they would know now that she have come back that she want to see they that she have crawl into the old room to die that muff have not forget she perhaps _ perhaps _ they would look at she not unkindly and cry over she just a little for the sake of the child they use to love martha ryck come in at last find she with she long hair fall over she face she arm still about the dog lie there in the firelight the woman 's eyelid flutter for a instant she lip move dryly but she make no sound she come up knelt upon the floor push muff gently away and take she child 's head upon she lap maggie she open she eye and look up mother 's glad to see you maggie the girl try to smile she face all quiver mother i -- i want you i think i be not fit she mother stoop and kiss she lip -- the polluted purple lip that tremble so i think you would come back to I my daughter i have watch for you a great while she smile at that push away she fall hair mother i be so sorry yes maggie and oh she throw out she arm o i be so tired i be so tired she mother raise she lay she head upon she shoulder mother 'll rest you maggie soothing she as if she sing again she first lullaby when she come to she the little pure baby -- she only one mother once more the door be unlock it have be unlock every night for seven year my child she close she eye after that some stupor creep over she she feature in the firelight softening and melting with the old child-look come into they look up at last she see another face bend over she a face in which grief have worn stern line there be tear in the eye and some recent struggle quiver out of it father i do not mean to come in -- i do not really but i be so cold do not send I off father i could not walk so far -- i shall be out of you way in a little while -- the cough -- _ i _ send you away maggie i -- i might have do it once god forgive I he send you back my daughter -- i thank he a darkness sweep over both face then she do not even hear muff 's whining cry at she ear mother at last the light of the room come back there be somebody who be wound i guess i be go to find he will he forget it all all maggie for what do he tell the sin-laden woman who come to he once and dare not look into he face be ever soul so foul and crimson-stained that he could not make it pure and white do he not linger till he lock be wet with the dew of night to listen for the first faint call of any wanderer cry to he in the dark so he come to maggie so he call she by she name -- magdalene most precious to he whom he have buy with a great price for whom with groaning that can not be utter he have plead with he father : magdalene choose from all eternity to be grave in the hollow of he hand to stand near to he before the throne to look with fearless eye into he face to touch he with she happy tear among he sinless one forever and think you that _ then _ any should scorn the woman whom the high and lofty one beholding do thus love who could lay anything to the charge of he elect perhaps he tell she all this in the pause of the storm for something in she face transfigure it mother it be all over now i think i shall be you little girl again and so with a smile she go to he the light flash broader and brighter about the room and on the dead face there -- never meg 's again a strong man bow over it be weep muff moan out he brute sorrow where the still hand touch he but martha ryck kneel down beside she only child give thanks to god what be the matter i could not have be more than seven or eight year old when it happen but it might have be yesterday among all other childish memory it stand alone to this very day it bring with it the old utter sinking of the heart and the old dull sense of mystery to read what i have to say you should have know my mother to understand it you should understand she but that be quite impossible now for there be a quiet spot over the hill and past the church and beside the little brook where the crimsoned moss grow thick and wet and cool from which i can not call she it be all i have leave of she now but after all it be not of she that you will chiefly care to hear my object be simply to acquaint you with a few fact which though interwoven with the event of she life be quite independent of it as object of interest it be i know only my own heart that make these page a memorial -- but you see i can not help it yet i confess no glamour of any earthly love have ever entirely dazzle I -- not even hers of imperfection of mistake of sin i know she be guilty i know it now even with the sanctity of those crimsoned moss and the hush of the rest beneath so close to my heart i can not forget they yet somehow -- i do not know how -- the imperfection the mistake the very sin bring she nearer to I as the year slip by and make she dearer my mother be what we call a aristocrat i do not like the term as the term be use i be sure she do not now but i have no other word she be a royal-looking woman and she have the blood of prince in she vein generation back -- how we child use to reckon the thing over -- she be cradle in a throne a miserable race to be sure they be -- the stuart and the most devout genealogist might deem it dubious honor to own they for great-grand-father by innumerable degree remove so she use to tell we over and over as a damper on we childish vanity look such a very queen as she speak in every play of feature and every motion of she hand that it be the old story of preacher who do not practice the very baby be proud of she the beauty of a face and the elegant repose of a manner be influence by no means more unfelt at three year than at thirty as insanity will hide itself away and lie sleep and die out -- while old man be gather to they father scathless and young man follow in they footstep safe and free -- and start into life and claim its own when child 's child have forget it as a single trait of a single scholar in a race of clod will bury itself in day-laborer and criminal unto the third and fourth generation and spring then like a creation from a chaos into statesman and poet and sculptor -- so i have sometimes fancy the better and truer nature of voluptuary and tyrant be sift down through the year and purify in we little new england home and the essential autocracy of monarchical blood refine and ennoble in my mother into royalty a broad and liberal culture have mould she she know its worth in every fiber of she heart scholarly parent have bless she with they legacy of scholarly mind and name with the soul of a artist she quiver under every grace and every defect and the blessing of a beauty as rare as rich have be give to she with every instinct of she nature recoil from the very shadow of crime the world wink at the family record have be stainless for a generation god have indeed bless she but the very blessing be a temptation i know before she leave I what she might have be but for the merciful and tender watch of he who be despise and reject of man i know for she tell I one still night when we be alone together how she sometimes shudder at herself and what those daily and hourly struggle between she nature and she christianity _ mean _ i think we be as near to one another as mother and daughter can be but yet as different since i have be talk in such lordly style of those miserable jamese and charlese i will take the opportunity to confess that i have inherit my father 's thorough-going democracy -- double measure press down and run over she not only pardon it but i think she love it in I for he sake it be about a year and a half i think after he die that she send for aunt alice to come to creston you aunt love I she say when she tell we in she quiet way and i be so lonely now they have be the only child and they love each other -- how much i afterwards know and how much they love each other _ now _ i like to think -- quite freely and fully and without shadow or doubt between they i dare to hope a picture of aunt alice always hang in mother 's room it be take down year ago i never ask she where she put it i remember it though quite well for mother 's sake i be glad i do for it be a pleasant face to look upon and a young pure happy face -- beautiful too though with none of the regal beauty crown by my mother 's massive hair and pencil brow it be a timid girlish face with reverent eye and ripe tremulous lip -- weak lip as i remember they from babyhood i feel a want in the face i have of course no capacity to define it it be represent to I only by the fact that it differ from my mother 's she be teach school out west when mother send for she i see the letter it be just like my mother : alice i need you you and i ought to have but one home now will you come i see too a bit of postscript to the answer : i be not fit that you should love I so marie and how mother laugh at it when it be all settle and the wait week become at last a single day i hardly know my mother she be so full of fitful mood and little fantastic joke such a flush on she cheek too as she run to the window every five minute like a child i remember how we go all over the house together she and i to see that everything look neat and bright and welcome and how we linger in the guest-room to put the little finishing touch to its stillness and coolness and coseyness the best spread be on the bed and the white fold smooth as only mother 's finger could smooth they the curtain freshly wash and loop with its crimson cord the blind draw cool and green the late afternoon sunlight slant through in fleck upon the floor there be flower too upon the table i remember they be all white -- lily of the valley i think and the vase of parian marble itself a solitary lily unfold stainless leaf over the mantle she have hang the finest picture in the house -- a ecce homo and a exquisite engrave it use to hang in grandmother 's room in the old house we child wonder a little that she take it upstairs i want you aunt to feel at home and see some thing she say i wish i could think of something more to make it pleasant in here just as we leave the room she turn and look into it pleasant be not it i be so glad sarah she eye dim a little she be a very dear sister to I she step in again to raise a stem of the lily that have fall from the vase and lay like wax upon the table then she shut the door and come away that door be shut just so for year the lonely bar of sunlight fleck the solitude of the room and the lily fade on the table we child pass it with hushed footfall and shrink from it at twilight as from a room that hold the dead but into it we never go mother be tire out that afternoon for she have be on she foot all day busy in she loving care to make we simple home as pleasant and as welcome as home could be but yet she stop to dress we in we Sunday clothes -- and it be no sinecure to dress three persistently undressable child winthrop be a host in himself auntie must see we look we prettiest she say she be a sight for a artist when she come down she have take off she widow 's cap and coil she heavy hair low in she neck and she always look like a queen in that lustreless black silk i do not know why these little thing should have make such a impression on I then they be priceless to I now i remember how she look frame there in the doorway while we be watch for the coach -- the late light ebb in golden tide over the grass at she foot and touch she face now and then through the branch of tree she head bent a little with eager part lip and the girlish color on she cheek she hand shade she eye as they strain for a sight of the lumbering coach she must have be a magnificent woman when she be young -- not unlike i have hear it say to that far-off ancestress whose name she bear and whose sorrowful story have make she sorrowful beauty immortal somewhere abroad there be a recline statue of queen mary to which when my mother stand beside it she resemblance be so strong that the by-stander cluster about she whispering curiously ah mon dieu say a little frenchman aloud c'est une rsurrection we must have try she that afternoon clara and winthrop and i for the spirit of she own excitement have make we completely wild winthrop 's scream of delight when station on the gate-post he catch the first sight of the old yellow coach might have be hear a quarter of a mile come say mother nervously and step out to the gate full in the sunlight that crown she like royal gold the coach lumber on and rattle up and pass why she have not come all the eager color die out of she face i be so disappointed -- speak like a troubled child and turn slowly into the house then after a while she draw I aside from the other -- i be the oldest and she be use to make a sort of confidence between we instinctively as it seem and often quite forget how very few my year be sarah i do not understand you think she might have lose the train but alice be so punctual alice never lose a train and she say she would come and then a while after i _ do not _ understand it be not like my mother to worry the next day the coach lumber up and rattle past and do not stop -- and the next and the next we shall have a letter mother say she eye sadden every afternoon but we have no letter and another day go by and another she be sick we say and mother write to she and watch for the lumbering coach and grow silent day by day but to the letter there be no answer ten day pass mother come to I one afternoon to ask for she pen which i have borrow something in she face trouble I vaguely what be you go to do mother write to you aunt 's boarding-place i can not bear this any longer she speak sharply she have already grow unlike herself she write and ask for a answer by return of mail it be on a Wednesday i remember that we look for it i come home early from school mother be sew at the parlor window she eye wander from she work up the road it be a ugly day it have rain drearily from eight o'clock till two and close in suffocating mist creep and dense and chill it give I a childish fancy of long-closed tomb and low-land graveyard as i walk home in it i try to keep the younger child quiet when we go in mother be so nervous as the early uncanny twilight fall we group around she timidly a dull sense of awe and mystery cling to the night and clung to she watch face and clung even then to that close room upstairs where the lily be fading mother sit lean she head upon she hand the outline of she face dim in the dusk against the fall curtain she be sit so when we hear the first rumble of the distant coach-wheel at the sound she fold she hand in she lap and stir a little rise slowly from she chair and sit down again sarah i creep up to she at the near sight of she face i be so frightened i could have cry sarah you may go out and get the letter i -- i can not i go slowly out at the door and down the walk at the gate i look back the outline of she face be there against the window-pane white in the gathering gloom it seem to I that my older and less sensitive year have never know such a night the world be stifle in a deluge of gray cold mist unstirred by a breath of air a robin with feather all ruffle and head hidden sit on the gate-post and chirp a little mournful chirp like a creature die in a vacuum the very daisy that nod and droop in the grass at my foot seem to be gasp for breath the neighbor 's house not forty pace across the street be invisible i remember the sensation it give I as i struggle to find its outline of a world wash out like the figure i wash out on my slate as i trudged half frighten into the road and the fog close about I it seem to my childish superstition like a horde of long-imprisoned ghost let loose and angry the distant sound of the coach which i could not see add to the fancy the coach turn the corner presently on a clear day i could see the brass button on the driver 's coat at that distance there be nothing visible now of the whole dark structure but the two lamp in front like the eye of some evil thing glaring and defiant bear with swift motion down upon I by a power utterly unseen -- it have a curious effect even at this time i confess i do not like to see a light carriage drive through a fog i summon all my little courage and pipe out the driver 's name standing there in the road he rein up he horse with a shout -- he have nearly drive over I after some search he discover the small object cower down in the mist hand I a letter with a muttered oath at be intercept on such a night and lumber on and out of sight in three rod i go slowly into the house mother have light a lamp and stand at the parlor door she do not come into the hall to meet I she take the letter and go to the light hold it with the seal unbroken she might have stand so two minute why do not you read mamma speak up winthrop i hush he she open it then read it lay it down upon the table and go out of the room without a word i have not see she face we hear she go upstairs and shut the door she have leave the letter open there before we after a little awed silence clara break out into sob i go up and read the few and simple line _ aunt alice have leave for creston on the appoint day _ mother spend that night in the closed room where the lily have droop and die clara and i hear she pacing the floor till we cry ourselves to sleep when we wake in the morning she be pacing it still week wear into month and the month become many year more than that we never know some inquiry reveal the fact after a while that a slight accident have occur upon the erie railroad to the train which she should have take there be some disable but no death the conductor have suppose the car have fall into the water she might not have be miss when the half-drowned passenger be all draw out so mother add a little crape to she widow 's weed the key of the closed room lay henceforth in she drawer and all thing go on as before to she child my mother be never gloomy -- it be not she way no shadow of household affliction be place like a skeleton confront we uncomprehending joy of what those week and month and year be to she -- a widow and quite uncomforted in they dark place by any human love -- she give no sign we think she a shade paler perhaps we find she often alone with she little bible sometimes on the sabbath we miss she and know that she have go into that close room but she be just as tender with we in we little fault and sorrow as merry with we in we play as eager in we gayest plan as she have always be as she have always be -- we mother and so the year slip from she and from we winthrop go into business in boston he never take to he book and mother be too wise to _ push _ he through college but i think she be disappoint he be she only boy and she would have choose for he the profession of he father and grandfather clara and i graduate in we white dress and blue ribbon like other girl and come home to mother crochet-work and tennyson just about here be the proper place to begin my story i mean that about here we old and long-tried cook bathsheba who have be a heirloom in the family suddenly fall in love with the older sexton who have ring the passing-bell for every soul who die in the village for forty year and take it into she head to marry he and desert we kitchen for he little brown house under the hill so it come about that we hunt the township for a handmaiden and it also come about that we inquire step lead we to the poor-house a stout not over-brilliant-looking girl about twelve year of age be to be have for she board and clothes and such schooling as we could give she -- in country fashion to be bind out till she should be eighteen the economy of the arrangement decide in she favor for in spite of we grand descent and grander notion we be poor enough after father die and the education of three child have make no small gap in we little principal and she come she name be a singular one -- selphar it always savor too nearly of brimstone to please I i use to call she sel for short she be a good sensible uninteresting-looking girl with broad face large feature and limp tow-colored curl they use to hang straight down about she eye and be never otherwise than perfectly smooth she prove to be of good temper which be worth quite as much as brain in a servant as honest as the daylight dull enough at she book but a good plodding worker if you mark out every step of the way for she beforehand i do not think she would ever have discover the law of gravitation but she might have jump off a precipice to prove they if she have be bid until she be seventeen she be precisely like any other rather stupid girl never give to novel-reading or fancy never frighten by the dark or ghost-story prove herself warmly attach to we after a while and rousing in we in return the kindly interest naturally feel for a faithful servant but she be not in any respect _ un_common -- quite far from it -- except in the circumstance that she never tell a false-hood at seventeen she have a violent attack of diphtheria and she life hang by a thread mother be as tender and unweary in she care of she as the girl 's own mother might have be from that time i believe sel be immovable in she faith in she mistress 's divinity under such nursing as she have she slowly recover but she old stolid strength never come back to she severe headache become of frequent occurrence she stout muscular arm grow weak as week go on it become evident in many way that though the diphtheria itself be quite out of she system it have leave she thoroughly diseased strange fit of silence come over she she volubility have be the greatest objection we have to she hitherto she face begin to wear a troubled look she be often find in place where she have steal away to be alone one morning she sleep late in she little garret-chamber and we do not call she the girl have go upstairs the night before cry with the pain in she temple and mother who be always thoughtful of she servant say it be a pity to wake she and as there be only three of we we might get we own breakfast for once while we be at work together in the kitchen clara hear she kitten mew out in the snow and go to the door to let she in the creature possess by some sudden frolic dart away behind the well-curb clara be always a bit of a romp and with never a thought of she daintily slippered foot she fling she trail dress over one arm and be off over the three-inch snow the cat lead she a brisk chase and she come in flush and panting and pretty she little foot drench and the tip of a maltese tail just visible above a great bundle she have make of she apron why say mother you have lose you ear-ring clara drop the kitten with unceremonious haste on the floor feel of she little pink ear shake she apron and the corner of she mouth go down into she dimpled chin they be the one winthrop send of all thing in the world you would better put on you rubber and have a hunt out-door say mother we hunt out-door -- on the step on the well-board in the wood-shed in the snow clara look down the well till she nose and finger be blue but the ear-ring be not to be find we hunt in-door under the stove and the chair and the table in every possible and impossible nook cranny and crevice but give up the search in despair it be a pretty trinket -- a leaf of delicately work gold with a pearl dew-drop on it -- very become to clara and the first present winthrop have send she from he earnings if she have be a little younger she would have cry she come very near it as it be i suspect for when she go after the plate she stay in the cupboard long enough to set two table when we be half through breakfast selphar come down blushing and frightened half out of she wit she apology tumble over each other with such skill as to render each one unintelligible and evidently undecided in she own mind whether she be to be hung or burnt at the stake it be no matter at all say mother kindly i know you feel sick last night i should have call you if i have need you have set the girl at she ease as only she could do she go on with she breakfast and we forget all about she she stay however in the room to wait on the table it be afterwards remember that she have not be out of we sight since she come down the garret-stair also that she room look out upon the opposite side of the house from that on which the well-curb stand why look at sel say clara suddenly she have she eye shut the girl be just pass the toast mother speak to she selphar what be the matter i do not know why do not you open you eye i can not hand the salt to miss sarah she take it up and bring it round the table to I with perfect precision sel how you act say clara petulantly of course you see yes be i saw say the girl in a puzzle way but my eye be shut miss clara tight tight whatever this freak mean we think best to take no notice of it my mother tell she somewhat gravely that she might sit down until she be want and we return to we conversation about the ear-ring why say sel with a little jump i see you ear-ring miss clara -- the one with a white drop on the leaf it be out by the well the girl be sit with she back to the window she eye to all appearance tightly close it be on the right-hand side under the snow between the well and the wood-pile why do not you see clara begin to look frightened mother displeased selphar she say this be nonsense it be impossible for you to see through the wall of two room and a wood-shed may i go and get it say the girl quietly sel say clara on you word and honor be you eye shut _ perfectly _ tight if they be not miss clara then they never be sel never tell a lie we look at each other and let she go i follow she out and keep my eye on she closed lid she do not once raise they nor do they tremble as lid will tremble if only partially close she walk without the slightest hesitation directly to the well-curb to the spot which she have mention stoop down and brush away the three-inch fall of snow the ear-ring lay there where it have sink in fall she pick it up carry it in and give it to clara that clara have the thing on when she start after she kitten there could be no doubt she and i both remember it that sel asleep on the opposite side of the house could not have see it drop be also settle that she with she eye close and she back to the window have see through three wall and through three inch of snow at a distance of fifty foot be a inference i do not believe it say my mother it be some nonsensical mistake clara look a little pale and i laugh we watch she carefully through the day she eye remain tightly close she understand all that be say to she answer correctly but do not seem inclined to talk she go about she work as usual and perform it without a mistake it could not be see that she grope at all with she hand to feel she way as be the case with the blind on the contrary she touch everything with she usual decision it be impossible to believe without see they that she eye be close we tie a handkerchief tightly over they see through it or below it she could not if she have try we then send she into the parlor with order to bring from the book-case two bible which have be give as prize to clara and I at school when we be child the book be of precisely the same size color and texture we name in gilt letter be print upon the binding we follow she in and watch she narrowly she go directly to the book-case lay she hand upon the book at once and bring they to my mother mother change they from hand to hand several time and turn they with the gilt letter downward upon she lap now selphar which be miss sarah 's the girl quietly take mine up the experiment be repeat and vary again and again in every case the result be the same she make no mistake it be no guess-work all this be do with the bandage tightly draw about she eye _ she do not see those letter with they _ that evening we be sit quietly in the dining-room selphar sit a little apart with she sew she eye still close we keep she with we and keep she in sight the parlor which be a long room be between we and the front of the house the distance be so great that we have often think if prowler be to come around at night how impossible it would be to hear they the curtain and shutter be closely draw sel be sit by the fire suddenly she turn pale drop she sewing and spring from she chair robber robber she cry do not you see they be get in the east parlor window there be three of 'em and a lantern they have just open the window -- hurry hurry i believe the girl be insane say mother decidedly nevertheless she put out the light open the parlor door noiselessly and go in the east window be open there be a quick vision of three man and a dark lantern then clara scream and it disappear we go to the window and see the man run down the street the snow the next morning be find trodden down under the window and they footprint be trace out to the road when we go back to the other room selphar be stand in the middle of it a puzzle frightened look on she face she eye wide open selphar say my mother a little suspiciously how do you know the robber be there robber say the girl aghast she know nothing of the robber she know nothing of the ear-ring she remember nothing that have happen since she go up the garret-stair to bed the night before and as i say the girl be as honest as the sunlight when we tell she what have happen she burst into terrify tear for some time after this there be no return of the tantrum as selphar have call the condition whatever it be i begin to get up vague theory of a trance state but mother say nonsense and clara be too much frightened to reason at all about the matter one Sunday morning sel complain of a headache there be service that evening and we all go to church mother let sel take the empty seat in the carryall beside she it be very dark when we start to come home but creston be a safe old orthodox town the road be fill with return church-goer like ourselves and mother drive like a man a darker night i think i have never see literally we could not see a hand before we eye we meet a carriage on a narrow road and the horse ' head touch before either driver have see the other selphar have be quite silent during the drive i lean forward look closely into she face and could dimly see through the darkness that she eye be close why she say at last see those glove where down in the ditch we pass they before i speak i see they on a blackberry-bush they have get little brass button on the wrist three rod past now and we could not see we horse 's head selphar say my mother quickly what _ be _ the matter with you if you please ma'am i do not know reply the girl hang she head may i get out and bring 'em to you prince be rein up and sel get out she go so far back that though we strain we eye to do it we could not see she in about two minute she come up a pair of gentleman 's glove in she hand they be roll together be of cloth so black that on a bright night it would never have be see and have small brass button at the wrist mother take they without a word the story leak out somehow and spread all over town it raise a great hue and cry four or five antediluvian lady declare at once that we be nothing more nor less than a family of they spirituous medium and seriously propose to expel mother from the prayer-meeting masculine creston do worse it smile a pity smile and pronounce the whole thing the fancy of scared women-folk i could endure with calmness any slander upon earth but that i bear it a number of week till at last drive by despair i send for winthrop and state the case to he in a condition of suppress fury he very politely bit back a incredulous smile and say he should be _ very _ happy to see she perform the answer be somewhat dubious i accept it in silent suspicion he come on a Saturday noon that afternoon we attend _ en masse _ one of those refine inquisition commonly know as picnic and winthrop lose he pocket-knife selphar of course keep house at home when we return winthrop make some careless reference to he loss in she presence and think no more of it about half a hour after we observe that she be wash the dish with she eye shut the condition have not be upon she five minute before she drop the spoon suddenly into the water and ask permission to go out to walk she see mr winthrop 's knife somewhere under a stone and want to get it it be fully two mile to the picnic grounds and nearly dark winthrop follow the girl unknown to she and keep she in sight she go rapidly and without the slightest hesitation or search to a out-of-the-way gully down by the pond where winthrop afterwards remember have go to cut some willow-twig for the girl part a thick cluster of bush lift a large loose stone under which the knife have roll and pick it up she return it to winthrop quietly and hurry away about she work to avoid be thank i observe that after this incident masculine creston become more respectful of several peculiarity in this development of the girl i make at the time careful memorandum and the exactness of these can be rely upon 1 she herself so far from attempt to bring on these trance state or take any pride therein be intensely trouble and mortify by they -- would run out of the room if she feel they come on in the presence of visitor 2 they be apt to be precede by severe headache but come often without any warn 3 she never in any instance recall anything that happen during the trance after it be pass 4 she be powerfully and unpleasantly affect by electricity from a battery or act in milder form she be also unable at any time to put she hand and arm into hot water the effect be to paralyze they at once 5 space prove to be no impediment to she vision she have be know to follow the act word and expression of countenance of member of the family hundred of mile away with accuracy as be afterwards prove by compare note as to time 6 the girl 's eye after she trance become habitual assume and always retain the most singular expression i ever see on any face they be oblong and narrow and set back in she head like the eye of a snake they be not -- smile if you will o practical and incredulous reader but they be not -- eye the eye of elsie venner be the only eye i can think of as at all like they the most horrible circumstance about they -- a circumstance that always make I shudder familiar as i be with it -- be that though turn fully on you _ they never look at you _ something behind they or out of they do the see not they 7 she not only see substance but soul she have repeatedly tell I my thought when they be upon subject to which she could not by any possibility have have the slightest clew 8 we be never able to detect a shadow of deceit about she 9 the clairvoyance never fail in any instance to be correct so far as we be able to trace it as will be readily imagine the girl become a useful member of the family the lose valuable restore and the warning against mischance give by she quite balanced she incapacity for peculiar kind of work this incapacity however rather increase than diminish and together with she fickle health which also grow more unsettled cause we a great deal of care the creston physician -- who be a keen man in he way for a country doctor -- pronounce the case altogether undreamt of before in horatio 's philosophy and keep constant note of it some of these have i believe find they way into the medical journal after a while there come like a thief in the night that which i suppose be poor selphar 's one unconscious golden mission in this world it come on a quiet summer night that end a long trance of a week 's continuance mother have go out into the kitchen to give a order for breakfast i hear a few eager word in selphar 's voice and then the door shut quickly and it be a hour before it be open then my mother come to I without a particle of color in lip or cheek and draw I away alone and tell the secret to I selphar have see aunt alice we sit down and look at one another there be a singular pinched look about my mother 's mouth sarah yes she say -- and then she tell I what she say she have see alice stuart in a western town seven hundred mile away among the living she desire to be count of the dead and that be all my mother pace the room three time back and forth she hand lock sarah there be a chill in she voice -- it have be such a gentle voice -- that freeze I sarah the girl be a impostor mother she pace the room once more three time back and forth at any rate she be a poor self-deluded creature how _ can _ she see seven hundred mile away a dead woman who have be a angel all these year think a _ angel _ sarah so much better than i and i -- i loved -- before or since i never hear my mother speak like that she break off sharply and freeze back into she chilling voice we will say nothing about this if you please i do not believe a word of it we say nothing about it but selphar do the delusion if delusion it be cling to she haunt she pursued she week after week to rid she of it or to silence she be impossible she add no new fact to she first statement but insist that the long-lost dead be yet alive with a quiet pertinacity that it be simply impossible to ridicule frighten threaten or cross-question out of she clara be so thoroughly alarm that she would not have sleep alone for any mortal -- perhaps not for any immortal -- consideration winthrop and i talk the matter over often and gravely when we be alone and in quiet place mother 's lip be seal from the day when sel make the first disclosure she be never hear once to refer to the matter a perceptible haughtiness creep into she manner towards the girl she even talk of dismiss she but repent it and melt into momentary gentleness i could have cry over she that night i be begin to understand what a pitiful struggle she life have become and how alone she must be in it she _ would _ not believe -- she know not what she could not doubt the girl and with the conflict even she child could not intermeddle to understand the crisis into which she be bring the reader must bear in mind we long habit of belief not only in selphar 's personal honesty but in the infallibility of she mysterious power indeed it have almost cease to be mysterious to we from daily familiarity we have come to regard it as the curious working of physical disease have take its result as a matter of course and have cease in common with converted creston to doubt the girl 's capacity for see anything that she choose to at any place thus a year worry on my mother grow sleepless and pallid she laugh often in a nervous shallow way as unlike she as a butterfly be unlike a sunset and she face settle into a habitual sharpness and hardness unutterably painful to I once only i venture to break into the silence of the haunting think that she know and we know be never escape by either mother it would do no harm for winthrop to go out west and -- she interrupt I sternly : sarah i have not think you capable of such childish superstition i wish that girl and she nonsense have never come into this house -- turn sharply away and out of the room but year and struggle end they end at last as i have pray every night and morning of it that they should end mother come into my room one night lock the door behind she and walk over to the window stand with she face turn from I and softly speak my name but that be all for a little while then -- sick and in suffer sarah the girl -- she may be right god almighty know _ sick and in suffer _ you see i be go -- i think then she voice break creston put on its spectacles and look wise on learn the next day that mr dugald have take the earliest morning train for the west on sudden and important business it be precisely what creston expect and just like the dugald for all the world -- go to hunt up material for that genealogical book or map or tree or something that they think nobody know they be go to publish o yes creston understand it perfectly space forbid I to relate in detail the clew which selphar have give as to the whereabouts of the wanderer she trance just at this time be somewhat scarce and fragmentary and the information she have profess to give have come in snatch and very imperfectly -- the trance be apt to end suddenly at the moment when some important question be pend and then of course all memory of what she have say or be about to say be go the name and appearance of person and place necessary to the search have however be give with sufficient distinctness to serve as a guide in my mother 's rather chimerical undertaking i suppose ninety-nine person out of a hundred would have think she a candidate for the state lunatic asylum exactly what she herself expect hope or fear i think it doubtful if she know i confess to a condition of simple bewilderment when she be fairly go and clara and i be leave alone with selphar 's ghostly eye forever on we one night i have to lock the poor thing into she garret-room before i could sleep just three week from the day on which mother start for the west the coach rattle up to the door and two woman arm in arm come slowly up the walk the one erect royal with she great steadfast eye alight the other bent and worn gray-haired and shallow and dumb crawl feebly through the golden afternoon sunshine as the ghost of a glorious life might crawl back to its grave mother throw open the door and stand there like a queen child you aunt have come home she be too tired to talk just now by and by she will be glad to see you we take she gently upstairs into the room where the lily be moulder to dust and lay she down upon the bed she close she eye wearily turn she face over to the wall and say no word what be the story of those tired eye i never ask and i never know once as i pass the room i saw -- and have always be glad that i saw -- through the open door the two woman lie with they arm about each other 's neck as they use to do when they be child together and above they still and watchful the wound face that have wait there so many year for this she linger weakly there within the restful room for seven day and then one morning we find she with she eye upon the thorn-crowned face she own quite still and smile a little funeral train wound away one night behind the church and leave she down among those red-cup moss that open in so few month again to cradle the sister who have love she she name only by mother 's order mark the headstone \* \* \* \* \* i have give you fact explain they as you will i do not attempt it for the simple reason that i can not a word must be say as to the fate of poor sel which be mournful enough she trance grow gradually more frequent and erratic till she become so thoroughly diseased in mind and body as to be entirely unfitted for household work and in short nothing but a encumbrance we keep she however for the sake of charity and should have do so till she poor tormented life wear itself out but after the advent of a new servant and my mother 's death she conceive the idea that she be a burden cry over it a few week and at last one bitter winter 's night she disappear we do not give up all search for she for year but nothing be ever hear from she he i hope who permit life to be such a terrible mystery to she have care for she somehow and kindly and well in the gray goth if the wick of the big oil lamp have be cut straight i do not believe it would ever have happen where be the poker johnny can not you push back that for ` ard log a little dear dear well it do not make much difference do it something always seem to all you massachusett fire you hickory be green and you maple be gnarly and the worm eat out you oak like a sponge i have not see anything like what i call a fire -- not since mary ann be marry and i come here to stay as long as you live father she say and in that very letter she tell I i should always have a open fire and how she would not let jacob put in the air-tight in the sitting-room but have the fireplace keep on purpose mary ann be a good girl always if i remember straight and i be sure i do not complain be not that a pine-knot at the bottom of the basket there that be better let I see i begin to tell you something do not i o yes about that winter of '41 i remember now i declare i can not get over it to think you never hear about it and you twenty-four year old come christmas you do not know much more either about maine folk and maine fashion than you do about china -- though it be small wonder for the matter of that you be such a little shaver when uncle jed take you there be a great many of we it seem to I that year i ` most forget how many -- we bury the twin next summer do not we -- then there be mary ann and little nancy and -- well coffee be dearer than ever i would see it i know about that time and butter selling for nothing we just throw we milk away and there be not any market for egg besides doctor 's bill and isaac to be send to school so it seem to be the best thing though you mother take on pretty badly about it at first jedediah have be good to you i be sure and bring you up religious -- though you have cost he a sight spending three hundred and fifty dollar a year at amherst college but as i be go to say when i start to talk about ' 41 -- to tell the truth johnny i be always a long while come to it i believe i be get to be a old man -- a little of a coward maybe and sometimes when i sit alone here night and think it over it be just like the toothache johnny as i be say if she have cut that wick straight i do believe it would not have happen -- though it be not that i mean to lay the blame on she _ now _ i would be out at work all day about the place slick thing up for to-morrow there be a gap in the barn-yard fence to mend -- i leave that till the last thing i remember -- i remember everything some way or other that happen that day -- and there be a new roof to put on the pig-pen and the grape-vine need a extra layer of straw and the latch be loose on the south barn-door then i have to go round and take a last look at the sheep and toss down a extra forkful for the cow and go into the stall to have a talk with ben and unbutton the coop-door to see if the hen look warm -- just to tuck 'em up as you might say i always feel sort of homesick -- though i would not have own up to it not even to nancy -- say good-by to the creetur the night before i go in there now it beat all to think you do not know what i be talk about and you a lumberman 's son go in be go up into the wood you know to cut and haul for the winter -- up sometimes a hundred mile deep -- in in the fall and out in the spring whole gang of we shut up there sometimes for six month then down with the freshet on the log and all summer to work the farm -- a merry sort of life when you get use to it johnny but it be a great while ago and it seem to I as if it must have be very cold -- be not there a little draft come in at the pantry door so when i would say good-by to the creetur -- i remember just as plain how ben put he great neck on my shoulder and whinny like a baby -- that horse know when the season come round and i be go in just as well as i do -- i tinker up the barn-yard fence and lock the door and go in to supper i give my finger a knock with the hammer which may have have something to do with it for a man do not feel very good-natured when he be be green enough to do a thing like that and he do not like to say it ache either but if there be anything i can not bear it be lamp-smoke it always do put I out and i expect it always will nancy know what a fuss i make about it and she be always very careful not to hector I with it i ought to have remember that but i do not she have light the company lamp on purpose too because it be my last night i like it better than the tallow candle so i come in stamp off the snow and they be all in there about the fire -- the twin and mary ann and the rest baby be sick and nancy be walk back and forth with he with little nancy pull at she gown you be the baby then i believe johnny but there always be a baby and i do not rightly remember the room be so black with smoke that they all look as if they be swim round and round in it i guess come in from the cold and the pain in my finger and all it make I a bit sick at any rate i throw open the window and blow out the light as mad as a hornet nancy say i this room would strangle a dog and you might have know it if you would have two eye to see what you be about there now i have tip the lamp over and you just get a cloth and wipe up the oil dear I say she light a candle and she speak up very soft too please aaron do not let the cold in on baby i be sorry it be smoking but i never know a thing about it he be be fret and take on so the last hour i do not notice anyway that be just what you ought to have do say i madder than ever you know how i hate the stuff and you ought to have care more about I than to choke I up with it this way the last night before go in nancy be a patient gentle-spoken sort of woman and would bear a good deal from a fellow but she use to fire up sometimes and that be more than she could stand you do not deserve to be care about for speak like that say she with she cheek as red as peat-coal that be right before the child mary ann 's eye be as big as saucer and little nancy be cry at the top of she lung with the baby tuning in so we know it be time to stop but stop be not end and folk can look thing that they do not say we sit down to supper as glum as pump-handle there be some fritter -- i never know anybody beat you mother at fritter -- smoking hot off the stove and some maple molasses in one of the best chiny tea-cup i know well enough it be just on purpose for my last night but i never have a word to say and nancy crumb up the child 's bread with a jerk she cheek do not grow any whiter it seem as if they would blaze right up -- i could not help look at they for all i pretend not to for she look just like a picture some woman always be pretty when they be put out -- and then again some be not it appear to I there be a great difference in woman very much as there be in hen now there be you aunt deborah -- but there i will not get on that track now only so far as to say that when she be fluster up she use to go red all over something like a piny which do not seem to have just the same effect that supper be a very dreary sort of supper with the baby cry and nancy get up between the mouthful to walk up and down the room with he he be a heavy little chap for a ten-month-old and i think she must have be tucker out with he all day i do not think about it then a man do not notice such thing when he be angry -- it be not in he i can not say but _ she _ would if i would be in she place i just eat up the fritter and the maple molasses -- seem to I i tell she she ought not to use the best chiny cup but i be not just sure -- and then i take my pipe and sit down in the corner i watch she put the child to bed they make she a great deal of bother squirm off of she lap and run round barefoot sometimes i use to hold they and talk to they and help she a bit when i feel good-natured but i just sit and smoke and let they alone i be all work up about that lamp-wick and i think you see if she have not have any feeling for I there be no need of my have any for she -- if she have cut the wick i would have take the baby she have not cut the wick and i would not take the baby she might see it if she want to and think what she please i have be badly treat and i mean to show it it be strange johnny it really do seem to I very strange how easy it be in this world to be always take care of we _ rights _ i have think a great deal about it since i have be grow old and there seem to I a good many thing we would better look after fust but you see i have not find that out in '41 and so i sit in the corner and feel very much abused i can not say but what nancy have pretty much the same idea for when the young one be all in bed at last she take she knitting and sit down the other side of the fire sort of turn she head round and look up at the ceiling as if she be try she best to forget i be there that be a way she have when i be court and we go along to husking together with the moon shine round well i keep on smoking and she keep on look at the ceiling and nobody say a word for a while till by and by the fire burn down and she get up and put on a fresh log you be dreadful wasteful with the wood nancy say i bind to say something cross and that be all i could think of take care of you own fire then say she throw the log down and stand up as straight as she could stand i think it be a pity if you have not anything better to do the last night before go in than to pick everything i do to piece this way and i tire enough to drop carry that great cry child in my arm all day you ought to be ashamed of yourself aaron hollis now if she have cry a little very like i should have give up and that would have be the end of it for i never could bear to see a woman cry it go against the grain but you mother be not one of the cry sort and she do not feel like it that night she just stand up there by the fireplace as proud as queen victory -- i do not blame she johnny -- o no i do not blame she she have the right of it there i _ ought _ to have be ashamed of myself but a man never like to hear that from other folk and i put my pipe down on the chimney-shelf so hard i hear it snap like ice and i stand up too and say -- but no matter what i say i guess a man 's quarrel with he wife always make I think of what the scripture say about other folk not intermeddle they be thing in my opinion that do not concern anybody else as a general thing and i could not tell what i say without tell what she say and i would rather not do that you mother be as good and patient-tempered a woman as ever live johnny and she do not mean it and it be i that set she on besides my word be worst of the two well well i 'll hurry along just here for it be not a time i like to think about but we have it back and forth there for half a hour till we have anger each other up so i could not stand it and i lift up my hand -- i would have strike she if she have not be a woman well say i nancy hollis i be sorry for the day i marry you and that be the truth if ever i speak a true word in my life i would not have tell you that now if you could understand the rest without i would give the world johnny -- i would give the world and all those coupon bond jedediah invest for I if i could anyway forget it but i say it and i can not well i have see you mother look ` most all sort of way in the course of she life but i never see she before and i never see she since look as she look that minute all the blaze go out in she cheek as if somebody have throw cold water on it and she stand there stock still so white i think she would drop aaron -- she begin and stop to catch she breath -- aaron -- but she could not get any further she just catch hold of a little shawl she have on with both she hand as if she think she could hold herself up by it and walk right out of the room i know she have go to bed for i hear she go up and shut the door i stand there a few minute with my hand in my pocket whistle yankee doodle you mother use to say man be queer folk johnny they always whistle up the gayest when they feel the wust then i go to the closet and get another pipe and i do not go upstairs till it be smoke out when i be a young man johnny i use to be that sort of fellow that could not bear to give up beat i would act like a brute and i know it but i be too spunky to say so so i say to myself if she will not make up first i will not and that be the end o not very likely she say the same thing for you mother be a spirited sort of woman when she temper _ be _ up so there we be more like enemy swear against each other than man and wife who have love each other true for fifteen year -- a whole winter and danger and death perhaps come between we too it may seem very queer to you johnny -- it do to I when i be you age and do not know any more than you do -- how folk can work themselves up into great quarrel out of such little thing but they do and into worse if it be a man who like he own way and a woman that know how to talk it be my opinion two third of all the divorce case in the law-books just grow up out of thing no bigger than that lamp-wick but how people that ever love each other could come to hard word like that you do not see well ha ha johnny that amuse I that really do amuse I for i never see a young man nor a young woman either -- and young man and young woman in general be very much like fresh-hatched chicken to my mind and know just about as much of the world johnny -- well i never see one yet who do not say that very thing and what be more i never see one who could get it into he head that old folk know better but i say i have love you mother true johnny and she have love I true for more than fifteen year and i love she more the fifteenth year than i do the first and we could not have get along without each other any more than you could get along if somebody cut you heart right out we have laugh together and cry together we have be sick and we would be well together we would have we hard time and we pleasant time right along side by side we have baptize the baby and we would bury be hold on to each other 's hand we have grow along year after year through up and downs and downs and up just like one person and there be not any more divide of we but for all that we would be put out and we would have we two way and we have speak we sharp word like any other two folk and this be not we first quarrel by any means i tell you johnny young folk they start in life with very pretty idea -- very pretty but take it as a general thing they do not know any more what they be talk about than they do about each other and they do not know any more about each other than they do about the man in the moon they begin very nice with they new carpet and teaspoon and a little mending to do and come home early evening to talk but by and by the shine wear off then come the baby and worry and wear and temper about that time they begin to be a little acquaint and to find out that there be two will and two set of habit to be fit somehow it take they anywhere along from one year to three to get jostle down together as for smooth off there be more or less of that to be do always well i do not sleep very well that night drop into nap and wake up the baby be worry over he tooth every half-hour and nancy get up to walk he off to sleep in she arm -- it be the only way you _ would _ be hush up and you would lie and yell till somebody do it now it be not many time since we would be marry that i have let she do that thing all night long i use to have a way of get up to take my turn and send she off to sleep it be not a man 's business some folk say i do not know anything about that maybe if i would be broil my brain in book learn all day till come night and i be hard put to it to get my sleep anyhow like the parson there it would not but all i know be what if i have be break my back in the potato-patch since morning so she would break she 's over the oven and what if i do need nine hour ' sound sleep i could chop and see without it next day just as well as she could do the iron to say nothing of my be a great stout fellow -- there be not a chap for ten mile round with my muscle -- and she with those blue vein on she forehead howsomever that may be i be not use to let she do it by herself and so i lay with my eye shut and pretend that i be asleep for i do not feel like give in and speak up gentle not about that nor anything else i could see she though between my eyelash and i lay there every time i wake up and watch she walking back and forth back and forth up and down with the heavy little fellow in she arm all night long sometimes johnny when i be go to bed now of a winter night i think i see she in she white nightgown with she red-plaid shawl pin over she shoulder and over the baby walk up and down and up and down i shut my eye but there she be and i open they again but i see she all the same i be off very early in the morning i do not think it could have be much after three o'clock when i wake up nancy have my breakfast all lay out overnight except the coffee and we have fix it that i be to make up the fire and get off without wake she if the baby be very bad at least that be the way i want it but she stick to it she should be up -- that be before there would be any word between we the room be very gray and still -- i remember just how it look with nancy 's clothes on a chair and the baby 's shoe lie round she have get he off to sleep in he cradle and have drop into a nap poor thing with she face as white as the sheet from watch i stop when i be dress half-way out of the room and look round at it -- it be so white johnny it would be a long time before i should see it again -- five month be a long time then there be the risk come down in the freshet and the word i would say last night i think you see if i should kiss it once -- i need not wake she up -- maybe i should go off feeling better so i stand there look : she be lie so still i could not see any more stir to she than if she have she breath hold in i wish i have do it johnny -- i can not get over wish i would do it yet but i be just too proud and i turn round and go out and shut the door we be go to meet down at the post-office the whole gang of we and i have quite a spell to walk i be go in on bob stoke 's team i remember how fast i walk with my hand in my pocket look along up at the star -- the sun be put they out pretty fast -- and try not to think of nancy but i do not think of anything else it be so early that there be not many folk about to see we off but bob stoke 's wife -- she live nigh the office just across the road -- she be there to say good-by kissing of he and cry on he shoulder i do not know what difference that should make with bob stoke but i snap he up well when he come along and say good morning there be twenty-one of we just on that gang in on contract for dive and beadle dive and beadle do about the heaviest thing on woodland of anybody about that time good steady man we be most of we -- none of you blundering irish that would not know a maple from a hickory with they gin-bottle in they pocket -- but we solid down-east yankee head own they farm all along the river with schooling enough to know what they be about ` lection day you do not catch any of _ we _ vote you new-fangled ticket when he have mean to go up on whig for want of know the difference nor visa vussy to say nothing of bob stoke and holt and I and another fellow -- i forget he name -- be member in good and reg ` lar standing and pay in we five dollar to the parson every quarter charitable yes though i say it that should not say it we be as fine a look gang as any in the county start off that morning in we red uniform -- nancy take a sight of pain with my shirt sew it up stout for fear it should bother I rip and i with nobody to take a stitch for I all winter the boy go off in good spirit singing till they be out of sight of town and wave they cap at they wife and baby stand in the window along on the way i do not sing i think the wind blow too hard -- seem to I that be the reason -- i be sure there must have be a reason for i have a voice of my own in those day and have lead the choir perpetual for five year we be not go in very deep dive and beadle 's lot lay about thirty mile from the nearest house and a straggle lonely sort of place that be too five mile out of the village with nobody but a dog and a deaf old woman in it sometimes as i be tell you we have be in a hundred mile from any human creature but ourselves it take we two day to get there though with the ox and the team be load down well with so many axis and the pork-barrel -- i do not know anything like pork for heft down more than you expect it to reasonable it be one of you ugly gray day grow dark at four o'clock with snow in the air when we haul up in the lonely place the tree be blaze pretty thick i remember especially the pine dive and beadle always have that do up prompt in October it be pretty work go in blaze while the sun be warm and the wood like a great bonfire with the maple i use to like it but you mother would not hear of it when she could help herself it keep I away so long it be queer johnny how we do remember thing that be not of no account but i remember as plainly as if it be yesterday morning just how everything look that night when the team come up one by one and we go to work spry to get to rights before the sun go down there be three shanty -- they do not often have more than two or three in one place -- they be empty and the snow have drift in bob stoke 's ox be fag out with they head hang down and the horse be whinny for they supper holt have one of he great brush-fire go -- there be nobody like holt for make fire -- and the boy be hurry round in they red shirt shout at the ox and singing a little some of they low under they breath to keep they spirit up there be snow as far as you could see -- down the cart-path and all around and away into the wood and there be snow in the sky now set in for a regular nor'easter the tree stand up straight all around without any leaf and under the bush it be as black as pitch five month say i to myself -- five month what in time 's the matter with you holli say bob stoke with a great slap on my arm you be give that ` ere ox molasses on he hay sure enough i be and he say i act like a dazed creatur and very likely i do but i could not have tell bob the reason you see i know nancy be just draw up she little rocking-chair -- the one with the red cushion -- close by the fire sit there with the child to wait for the tea to boil and i know -- i could not help know if i would try hard for it -- how she be cry away softly in the dark so that none of they could see she to think of the word we would say and i go in without ever make of they up i be sorry for they then o johnny i be sorry and she be thirty mile away i would get to be sorry five month thirty mile away and could not let she know the boy say i be poor company that first week and i should not wonder if i be i could not seem to get over it any way to think i could not let she know if i could have send she a scrap of a letter or a message or something i should have feel better but there be not any chance of that this long time unless we get out of pork or fodder and have to send down -- which we do not expect to for we would lay in more than usual we have two pretty rough week ' work to begin with for the worst storm of the season set in and keep in and i never see they like before or since it seem as if there would never be a end to they storm after storm blow after blow freeze after freeze half a day 's sunshine and then at it again we be well tired of it before they stop it make the boy homesick however we keep at work pretty brisk -- lumber-man be not the fellow to be put out for a snow-storm -- cut and haul and saw out in the sleet and wind bob stoke freeze he left foot that second week and i be frost-bitten pretty badly myself cullen -- he be the boss -- he be well out of sort i tell you before the sun come out and cross enough to bite a tenpenny nail in two but when the sun _ be _ out it be not so bad a kind of life after all at work all day with a good hot dinner in the middle then back to the shanty at dark to as rouse a fire and tiptop swagan as anybody could ask for holt be cook that season and holt could not be beat on he swagan now you do not mean to say you do not know what swagan be well well to think of it all i have to say be you do not know what be good then bean and pork and bread and molasses -- that be swagan -- all stir up in a great kettle and boil together and i do not know anything -- not even you mother 's fritter -- i would give more for a taste of now we just about live on that there be nothing you can cut and haul all day on like swagan besides that we use to have doughnut -- you do not know what doughnut be here in massachusett as big as a dinner-plate those doughnut be and -- well a little hard perhaps they use to have it about in bangor that we use they for clock pendulum but i do not know about that i use to think a great deal about nancy night when we be sit up by the fire -- we have we fire right in the middle of the hut you know with a hole in the roof to let the smoke out when supper be eat the boy all sit up around it and tell story and sing and crack they joke then they have they backgammon and card we get sleepy early along about nine or ten o'clock and turn in under the roof with we blanket the roof slope down you know to the ground so we lay with we head in under the little eaves and we foot to the fire -- ten or twelve of we to a shanty all round in a row they build the hut up like a baby 's cob-house with the log fit in together i use to think a great deal about you mother as i be say sometimes i would lie awake when the rest be off as sound as a top and think about she maybe it be foolish and i be sure i would not have tell anybody of it but i could not get rid of the notion that something might happen to she or to I before five month be out and i with those word unforgiven then perhaps when i go to sleep i would dream about she walking back and forth up and down in she nightgown and little red shawl with the great heavy baby in she arm so it go along till come the last of January when one day i see the boy all standing round in a heap and talk what be the matter say i pork 's give out say bob with a whistle beadle get that last lot from jenkin there he son-in-law and it be sp ` ilt i could have tell he that beforehand never know jenkin to do the fair thing by anybody yet who be go down say i stop short i feel the blood run all over my face like a woman 's cullen have not make up he mind yet say bob walk off now you see there be not a man on the ground who would not jump at the chance to go it break up the winter for they and sometimes they could run in home for half a hour drive by so there be not much of a hope for I but i go straight to mr cullen too late just promise jim jacob say he speak up quick it be just business to he you know i turn off and i do not say a word i would not have believe it i never would have believe it that i could have feel so cut up about such a little thing cullen look round at I sharp hilloa holli say he what be to pay nothing thank you sir say i and walk off whistle i have a little talk with jim alone he say he would take good care of anything i would give he and carry it straight so when night come i go and borrow mr cullen 's pencil and holt tear I off a bit of clean brown paper he find in the flour-barrel and i go off among the tree with it alone i build a little fire for myself out of a huckleberry-bush and sit down there on the snow to write i could not do it in the shanty with the noise and singing the little brown paper would not hold much but these be the word i write -- i remember every one of they -- it be curious now i should and that more than twenty year ago : -- dear nancy -- that be it -- dear nancy i can not get over it and i take they all back and if anything happen come down on the log -- i could not finish that anyhow so i just write aaron down in the corner and fold the brown paper up it do not look any more like aaron than it do like abimelech though for i do not see a single letter i write -- not one after that i go to bed and wish i be jim jacob next morning somebody wake I up with a push and there be the boss why mr cullen say i with a jump hurry up man and eat you breakfast say he jacob be down sick with he cold _ oh _ say i you and the pork must be back here day after to-morrow -- so be spry say he i rather think i be johnny it be just eight o'clock when i start it take some time to get breakfast and feed the nag and get order i stand there slapping the snow with my whip crazy to be off hear the last of what mr cullen have to say they give I the two horse -- we have not but two -- ox be tougher for go in as a general thing -- and the lightest team on the ground it be considerably lighter than bob stoke 's if it have not be for the snow i might have put the thing through in two day but the snow be up to the creature ' knee in the shady place all along off from the road in among the gully you could stick a four-foot measure down anywhere so they do not look for I back before Wednesday night i must have that pork Wednesday night sure say cullen well sir say i you shall have it Wednesday noon providence permit and you shall have it Wednesday night anyway you will have a storm to do it in i be afraid say he look at the cloud just as i be whipping up you be all right on the road i suppose all right say i and i be sure i ought to have be for the time i would be over it bess and beauty -- they be the horse and of all the ugly nag that ever i see beauty be the ugliest -- start off on a round trot slewing along down the hill they know they be go home just as well as i do i look back as we turn the corner to see the boy stand round in they red shirt with the snow behind they and the fire and the shanty i feel a mite lonely when i could not see they any more the snow be so dead still and there be thirty mile of it to cross before i could see human face again the cloud have a ugly look -- a few flake have fall already -- and the snow be purple deep in as far as you could see under the tree something make I think of ben gurnell as i drive on look along down the road to keep it straight you never hear about it poor ben poor ben it be in '37 that be he have be out hunting up blaze tree they say and wander away somehow into the gray goth and go over -- it be two hundred foot they do not find he not till spring -- just a little heap of bone he wife have they take home and bury and by and by they have to take she away to a hospital in portland -- she talk so horribly and think she see bone round everywhere there be no place like the wood for bring a storm down on you quick the tree be so thick you do not mind the first few flake till first you know there be a whirl of 'em and the wind be up i be mind less about it than usual for i be think of nannie -- that be what i use to call she johnny when she be a girl but it seem a long time ago that do i be think how surprised she would be and pleased i know she would be pleased i do not think so poorly of she as to suppose she be not just as sorry now as i be for what have happen i know well enough how she would jump and throw down she sew with a little scream and run and put she arm about my neck and cry and could not help herself so i do not mind about the snow for plan it all out till all at once i look up and something slash into my eye and sting I -- it be sleet oho say i to myself with a whistle -- it be a very long whistle johnny i know well enough then it be no play-work i have before I till the sun go down nor till morning either that be about noon -- it could not have be half a hour since i would eat my dinner i eat it drive for i could not bear to waste time the road be not break there a inch and the tree be thin there would be a clearing there year ago and wide white level place wind off among the tree one look as much like a road as another for the matter of that i pull my visor down over my eye to keep the sleet out -- after they be sting too much they be good for nothing to see with and i _ must _ see if i mean to keep that road it begin to be cold you do not know what it be to be cold you do not johnny in the warm gentleman 's life you have live i be use to maine forest and i be use to January but that be what i call cold the wind blow from the ocean straight as a arrow the sleet blow every way -- into you eye down you neck in like a knife into you cheek i could feel the snow crunching in under the runner crisp turn to ice in a minute i reach out to give bess a cut on the neck and the sleeve of my coat be stiff as pasteboard before i bent my elbow up again if you look up at the sky you eye be shut with a snap as if somebody would shoot they if you look in under the tree you could see the icicle a minute and the purple shadow if you look straight ahead you could not see a thing by and by i think i have drop the rein i look at my hand and there i be hold they tight i know then that it be time to get out and walk i do not try much after that to look ahead it be of no use for the sleet be fine like needle twenty of 'em in you eye at a wink then it be grow dark bess and beauty know the road as well as i do so i have to trust to they i think i must be come near the clearing where i would count on put up overnight in case i could not reach the deaf old woman 's there be a man just out of bangor the winter before walk just so beside he team and he keep on walk some folk say after the breath be go and they find he freeze up against the

monday and tuesday and wednesday like yours or mine sharley be so exactly like other people how can it be help that nothing remarkable happen to she but you would like the story it be about time for the four-o'clock train then sharley at the cost of half a sugar-bowl -lrb- never mind syntax you know i mean the sugar not the glass -rrb- have entice moppet to betake himself out of sight and out of mind till somebody should signify a desire for he engaging presence have steer clear of nate and methuselah and be stand now alone on the back doorstep opposite the chaise-house one could see a variety of thing from those doorstep -- the chaise-house for instance with the old solid square-built wagon roll into it -lrb- sharley pass many a long mending morning stow in among the cushion of that old wagon -rrb- the great sweet-kept barn where the sun steal in warm at the chink and filter through the hay the well-curb fold in by a shadow the wood-pile and the chicken and the kitchen-garden a little slope too with a maple on it and shades of brown and gold upon the grass brown and golden tint across the hill and a sky of blue and gold to dazzle one then there be a flock of robin dip southward there be also the railroad sharley may have have she dim consciousness of the cosey barn and chicken 's chirp of brown and gold and blue and dazzle and glory but you do not suppose _ that _ be what she have outgenerall moppet and steal the march upon nate and methuselah for the truth be that the child have need of none of these thing -- neither sky nor dazzle nor glory -- that golden autumn afternoon have the railroad bound the universe just then she would have be content for sharley be only a girl -- a very young not very happy little girl -- and halcombe dike be come home to spend the Sunday halcombe dike -- she old friend halcombe dike she say the word over apologize a bit to herself for be there to watch that railroad hal use to be good to she when she be bother with

one be glad when one 's old friend come back mrs guest peer through the pantry window observe -- and observe with some motherly displeasure which she would have express have it not be too much trouble to open the window -- that sharley have put on she barbe -- that black barbe with the pink water ribbon run through it so extravagant in sharley sharley would fain have be so extravagant as to put on she pink muslin too this afternoon she have be more than half inclined to cry because she could not but as it be not orthodox in green valley to wear one 's best clothes on week-day except at picnic or prayer-meeting she have submit sigh to she sprigged calico it would have be worth while though to have see she half a hour ago up in she room under the eaves consider the question she stand there with the sleeve of she dressing-sack fall away from she pink bare arm and the hair clinging loose and moist to she bare white neck to see she smooth the shimmering fold -- there be rose-bud on that muslin -- and look and long hang it up and turn away why could there not be a little more rose-bud and shimmer in people 's life seem to I it be all calico cry sharley then to see she overturn she ribbon-box nobody but a girl know how girl dream over they ribbon he be come whisper sharley to the little bright barbe and to the little bright face that flush and flutter at she in the glass -- he be come sharley look well wait there in the calico and lace upon the doorstep it be not everybody who would look well in calico and lace yet if you be to ask I i could not tell you how pretty sharley be or if she be pretty at all i have a memory of soft hair -- brown i think -- and wistful eye and that i never see she without a desire to stroke she and make she pur as i would a kitten how stiff and stark and black the railroad lay on its yellow ridge sharley draw she breath when the sudden four-o'clock whistle smite the air and a faint far trail of smoke puff through the wood and wound over the barren outline she mother see she steal away through the kitchen-garden and down the slope call after she : -- charlotte go to walk i wish you would let the baby go too well she do not hear i will not assert that sharley do not hear to be frank she be rather tire of that baby there be a foot-path through the brown and golden grass and sharley run over it under the maple which be drop yellow leaf and down to the knot of tree which line the farther wall there be a nook here -- she know just where -- into which one might creep tangled in with the low-hanging green of apple and spruce and wind about with grape-vine stoop down careful not to catch that barbe upon the bramble and careful not to soil so much as a sprig of the clean light calico sharley hide herself in the shadow she could see unseen now the great puff of purple smoke the burning line of sandy bank the station and the uphill road to the village oddly enough some old scripture word -- sharley be not much in the habit of quote scripture -- come into she thought just as she have curl herself comfortably up beside the wall she watching face against the grape-leaf : but what go ye out for to see what go ye out for to see she go on dreamily finish a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet and stop scarlet what have prophet to do with she old friend halcombe dike ah but he be come he be come to sharley 's eye the labor crazy locomotive which puff he asthmatically up to the little depot be a benevolent dragon -- if there be such thing as benevolent dragon -- very horrible and she be very much afraid of it but very gracious and she should like to go out and pat it on the shoulder the train slacken jarred and stop a old woman with thirteen bundle climb out laboriously two small boy turn somersault from the platform sharley strain she wistful eye till they ache there be nobody else sharley be very young and very much disappointed and she cry the glory have die from the sky the world have go out she be sit there all in a heap she face in she hand and she heart in she foolish eye when a step sound near and a voice hum a old army song she know it he have teach it to she himself she know the step for she have long ago train she slippered foot to keep pace with it he have step from the wrong side of the car perhaps or she eager eye have miss he at any rate here he be -- a young man with honest eye and mouth a little grave a very plainly dress young man -- he coat be not as new as sharley 's calico -- but a young man with a good step of he own -- strong elastic -- and a nervous hand he pass hum he army song and never know how the world light up again within a foot of he he pass so near that sharley by stretch out she hand could have touch he -- so near that she could hear the breath he draw he be think to himself perhaps that no one have come from home to meet he and he have be long away but then it be not he mother 's fashion of welcome and quicken he pace at the thought of she he leave the tangle of green behind and the little wet face crushed breathless up against the grape-leaf and be out of sight and know nothing sharley spring up and bound home she mother open she languid eye wide when the child come in dear I charlotte how you do go chirp and hop round and I with this great baby and my sick-headache _ i _ can not chirp and hop you look as if somebody would set you on fire what be the matter with you child what be the matter indeed sharley in a little spasm of penitence -- one can afford to be penitent when one be happy -- take the baby and go away to think about it surely he would come to see she to-night he do not often come home without see sharley and he have be long away at any rate he be here in this very green valley where the day have drag so drearily without he he eye see the same sky that hers see he breath drink the same sweet evening wind he foot tread the road that she have trodden yesterday and would tread again to-morrow but i will not tell they any more of this -- shall i sharley she throw she head back and look up as she walk to and fro through the yard with the heavy baby fret on she shoulder the sky be aflame now for the sun be drop slowly he be here they say a belated robin take up the word : he be here the yellow maple glitter all over with it : sharley he be here the butter be here call she mother relevantly from the house the butter be here now and it be time to see about supper charlotte more calico say impatient sharley and she give the baby a jerk whether he come or whether he do not come there be no more time for sharley to dream that night in fact there seldom be any time to dream in mr guest 's household mr guest believe in keep people busy she be busy enough herself when she head do not ache when it do it be the least she could do to see that other people be busy so sharley have the table to set and the biscuit to bake and the tea to make and the pear to pick over she must run upstairs to bring she mother a handkerchief she must hurry for she father 's clothes-brush when he come in tired and not so good-humored as he might be from he store she must stop to rebuild the baby 's block-house that moppet have kick over and snap moppet 's dirty dimpled finger for kick it over and endure the shriek that moppet set up therefor she must suggest to methuselah that he could find perhaps a more suitable book-mark for robinson crusoe than he piece of bread and molasses and intimate doubt as to the propriety of nate 's standing on the table-cloth and sit on the toast-rack and then moppet be at that baby again drop very cold penny down he neck they must be make presentable for supper too moppet and nate and methuselah -- methuselah nate and moppet brush and wash and dust and coax and scold and bear with there be no end to it would there ever be any end to it sharley sometimes ask of she weary thought sharley 's life like the life of most girl at she age be one great unanswered question it grow tiresome occasionally as monologue be apt to do i be go to holler to-night announce moppet at supper pause in the midst of he berry-cake by way of diversion to lift the cat up by she tail i be go to holler awful and make you sit up and tell I about that little boy that eat the giant and cinderellum -- how she live in the stove-pipe -- and that man that build he house out of a bungle of straw : and -- well there be some more but i do not remember 'em just now you know o moppet i be glare moppet over he mug you make I put on a clean collar you see if i do not holler a ' holler a '

naman -- till to-morrow night i be not a -- bit -- sleepy but -- and nobody hear anything more from moppet the coast be clear now and happy sharley with bright cheek take she little fall hat that she be trim and sit down on the front doorstep sit there to wait and watch and hope and dream and flutter and sit in vain twilight creep up the path up to she foot fold she in the warm color of she plaided ribbon fade away under she eye and drop from she listless finger with they have fade she bit of a hope for that night hal always come before dark who care say sharley with a toss of she soft brown head somebody do care nevertheless somebody wink hard as she go upstairs however she could light a lamp and finish she hat that be one comfort it always _ be _ a comfort to finish one 's hat girl have forget graver trouble than sharley 's in the excitement of hurry saturday-night millinery a bonnet be a picture in its way and grow up under one 's finger with a pretty sense of artistic triumph besides there be always the question : will it be become so sharley put she lamp on a cricket and herself on the floor and begin to sing over she work a pretty sight it be -- the low dark room with the heavy shadow in its corner all the light and color draw to a focus in the middle of it sharley with she head bent -- bit of silk like broken rainbow toss about she -- and that little muse smile consider gravely should the white square of the plaid turn outward and where should she put the coral and would it be become after all a pretty girlish sight and you may laugh at it if you choose but there be a prettier woman 's tenderness underlie it just as a strain of fine coy sadness will wind through a mazourka or a waltz for who would see the poor little hat to-morrow at church and would he like it and when he come to-morrow night -- for of course he would come to-morrow night -- would he tell she so when everybody else be in bed and the house still sharley lock she door furtively steal to the bureau-glass shyly tie on that hat and more shyly peep in a flutter of October color and two great brown eye look back at she encouragingly i should like to be pretty say sharley and ask the next minute to be forgive for the vanity at any rate by way of modification i should like to be pretty to-morrow she pray for halcombe dike when she kneel with she face hide in she white bed to say we father i believe she have pray for he now every night for a year not that there be any need of it she reason for be he not a great deal better than she could ever be far above she oh as far above she as the shine of the star be above the shine of the maple-tree but perhaps if she pray very hard they would give one extra beautiful angel charge over he then be it not quite right to pray for one 's old friend besides -- besides they have a pleasant sound those two word : _ we _ father i will be good to-morrow say sharley drop into sleep mother 's head will ache and i can go to church i will listen to the minister and i will not plan out my winter dress in prayer-time i will not be cross to moppet nor shake methuselah i will be good hal will help I to be good i shall see he

young architect -- and whether there be a place for he remain to be prove he be willing to work hard and to hope long but he grow a little tired of it sometimes and so -- he check himself suddenly as

forget to put the baby 's gingham apron in the wash sharley light she kerosene lamp without reply it be the little kerosene with the crack in the handle some vague notion that everything in the world have crack come to she as she creep upstairs she put she lamp out as soon as she be in she room and lock she door hard she sit down on the side of the bed and cross she hand and wait for she father and mother to come upstairs they come up by and by and go to bed the light that shine in through the chink under the door go out the house be still she go over to the window then throw it wide open and sit down crouch upon the broad sill she do not sob now nor wail out she do not feel like sob or wail she only want to think she must think she have need to think that this neglect of halcombe dike 's mean something she do not try to conceal from she bitter thought he have not neglect she in all he life before it be not the habit either of this grave young man with the earnest eye to do or not to do without a meaning he would put silence and the winter between they that be what he mean sharley look out upon the windy dark with straight-lidded eye know that beneath and beyond the silence of the winter lay the silence of a life the silence of a life the wind hush into a moment 's calm while the word turn over in she heart the branch of a cherry-tree close under she sight drop lifelessly a homesick bird give a little still mournful chirp in the dark sharley gasp it be all because i shake moppet that be it because i shake moppet this morning he use to like I -- yes he do he do not know how cross and ugly i be no wonder he think such a cross and ugly thing could never be -- could never be -- she break off crimson he wife she would have say the word without blush or hesitation a week ago halcombe dike have speak no word of love to she but she have believe purely and gravely in the deep of she maiden think that she be dear to he gravely and purely too she have dream that this October Sunday would bring some sign to she of they future he have be toiling at that business in the city now a long while sharley know nothing about business but she have fancy that even though he prospects be not good he must be ready now to think of a home of he own -- at least that he would give she some hope of it to keep through the dreary white winter but he have give she nothing to keep through the winter or through any winter of a wintry life nothing the beautiful Sunday be over he have come and he have go she must brush away the pretty fancy she must break the timid dream so that grave sweet word have die in shame upon she lip she should not be he wife she should never be anybody 's wife the Sunday night express shriek up the valley and thunder by and away in the dark sharley lean far out into the wind to listen to the die sound and wonder what it would seem like to-morrow morning when it carry he away with its pause one of those sudden hush fall again upon the wind the homesick bird flutter about a little hunting for its nest never to be he wife moan sharley what do it mean never to be he wife she press she hand up hard against she two temple and consider : -- moppet and the baby and she mother 's headache milk the cow and knead the bread and darn the stocking go to church in old hat -- for what difference be it go to make to anybody now whether she trim they with scotch plaid or sarcenet cambric -- come home to talk over revival with deacon snow or sit down in a proper way like other old people in the house with a lamp and read somebody 's life and letter never any more moonlight and watch and stroll never any more hope or wish or expect for sharley she jump a little off she window-sill then sit down again that be it moppet and the baby and she mother and kneading and milking and darning for thirty for forty for -- the dear lord who pity she only know how many year but sharley do not incline to think much about the lord just then she be very miserable and very much alone and unhelp so miserable so alone and unhelp that it never occur to she to drop down right there with she despairing little face on the window-sill and tell he all about it o sharley do you not think he would understand she have make up she mind -- decidedly make up she mind -- not to go to sleep that night the unhappy girl in the novel always sit up you know besides she be too wretched to sleep then the morning train go early at half past five and she should stay here till it come this be very good reasoning and sharley certainly be very unhappy -- as unhappy as a little girl of eighteen can well be and i suppose it would sound a great deal better to say that the cold morning look in upon she sleepless pain or that aurora smile upon she unrested eye or that she keep she bitter watch until the star grow pale -lrb- and a fine chance that would be to describe a sunrise too -rrb- but truth compel I to state that she do what some very unhappy people have do before she -- find the window-sill uncomfortable cramped neuralgic and cold -- so undressed and go to bed and to sleep very much as she would have do if there have be no halcombe dike in the world sharley be not use to lie awake and nature would not be cheat out of she rights in such a round young healthful little body but that do not make she much the happier when she wake in the cold gray of the dawn to listen for the early train it be very cold and very gray not time for the train yet but she could not bear to lie still and hear the shrill gay concert of the bird to watch the day begin and think how many day must have beginning -- so she creep faintly up and out into the chill she wander about for a time in the raw brighten air the frost lay crisp upon the short grass the elder-bush be festoon with tiny white tassel the maple-leaf hang fret with silver the tangle of apple-tree and spruce be powdered and pearled she steal into it as she have steal into it in the happy sunset-time so long ago -- why be it only day before yesterday -- steal in and lay she cheek up against the shine wet vine which melt warm beneath she touch and shut she eye she think how she would like to shut and hide herself away in a place where she could never see the frescoed frost or brighten day nor hear the sound of chirp bird nor any happy thing by and by she hear the train come and footstep he come spring by in he strong man 's way as he have come before as before he pass near -- how very near -- to the quiver white face crush up against the vine-leaf and go he way and know nothing the train pant and race away shriek a little in a doleful breathless fashion grow small grow less grow dim die from sight in pallid smoke the track stand up on its mound of frozen bank blank and mute like a corpse from which the soul have flee sharley come into the kitchen at six o'clock the fire be burn hotly under the boiler the soil clothes lay scatter about she mother stand over the tub red-faced and worried complain that sharley have not come to help she she turn when the girl open the door to scold she a little the best of mother be apt to scold on Monday morning sharley stand still a moment and look around she must begin it with a washing-day then this other life that have come to she she heart might break but the baby 's apron must be boil -- to-day next week another week the year stretch out into one wearisome endless washing-day o the dreadful year she grow a little blind and dizzy sit down on a heap of table-cloth and hold up she arm mother do not be cross to I this morning -- _ do not _ o mother mother mother i wish there be anybody to help I \* \* \* \* \* the battle-field of life lie in ambush we trip along on we smile way and they give no sign we turn sharp corner where they hide in shadow no drum-beat sound alarum it be the music and the dress-parade to-night the groan and the blood to-morrow sharley have be little more than a child in she unreasoning young joy when she knot the barbe at she throat on Saturday night i be a old woman now she say to herself on Monday morning not that she say so proved anything -- except indeed that it be she first trouble and that she be very young to have a trouble yet since she have the notion she might as well to all intent and purpose have shrivel into the cap and spectacles of a centenarian imaginary grief _ be _ real she take indeed a grim sort of pleasure in think that she youth have flee away and forever in thirty-six hour however that might be that October morning usher sharley upon battle-ground nor be the struggle the less severe that she be so young and so unused to struggle i have to tell of nothing new or tragic in the child 's day only of the old slow foolish pain that gnaw at the root of thing something be the matter with the sunset and the dawn moonrise be a agony the brown and golden grass have turn dull and dead she would go away up garret and sit with she finger in she ear that she might not hear the frog chant in the swamp at twilight one night she run away from she father and mother it chance to be a anniversary of they wedding-day they have kiss each other after tea and talk of old time and blush a little they married eye occupy and content with one another she feel with a sudden dreary bitterness that she should not be miss and so run out into the field and sit down there on she stone in the dark she rather hope that they would wonder where she be before bedtime it would be a bit of comfort she be so cold and comfortless but nobody thought of she and when she come weakly up the yard at ten o'clock the door be lock for a week she go about she work like a sleepwalker she future be settle life be over why make ado the sun would set and the moon would rise : let they there would always be sun to set and moon to rise there be dinner to get and stocking to mend there would always be dinner to get and stocking to mend she be put into the world for the sake of dinner and stocking apparently very well she be grow use to it one could grow use to it she put away the barbe and the pink muslin lock she ribbon-box into the lower drawer give up crimp she hair and wear the chocolate calico all day she go to the thursday-evening conference discuss the revival with deacon snow and lock herself into she room one night to put the lamp on the bureau before the glass and shake she soft hair down about she colorless inexpectant face to see if it be not turn gray she be disappoint to find it as brown and bright as ever but sharley be very young and the sweet persistent hope of youth be strong in she they wake up presently with a sting like the sting of a frost-bite o to think of be a old maid in a little black silk apron and have halcombe dike 's wedding-card lay upon a shelf she be hold the baby when this come all over she and she let he drop into the coal-hod and sit down to cry what have she do that life should shut down before she in such cruel bareness be she not young very young to be unhappy she begin to fight a little with herself and providence in savage mood favor the crimped hair and scotch plaid again try a nutting-party and a sewing-circle as well as a little flirtation with jim snow this last for another week at the end of that time she go and sit down alone one noon on a pile of kindling in the wood-house and think it over why i can not she eye widen with slow terror happiness _ will not _ come i _ can not _ make it i can not ever make it and o i be just at the beginning of everything somebody call she just then to peel the potato for dinner she think -- she think often in those day -- of that fancy of hers about calico-living be not that all that be leave for she little dreary figure all just alike like the chocolate morning-dress o the rose-bud and shimmer that might have be wait somewhere and o the rose-bud and shimmer that be forever go the frosted gold of autumn melt into a clear sharp silvered winter carry sharley with they round on she old routine it never grow any the easier or softer the girl 's little rebellious foot tread it bitterly she hate the darning and the sweeping and the bake and the dust she hate the sound of the baby 's worried cry she be tire of she mother 's illness tire of moppet 's mischief tire of methuselah 's solemnity she use to come in sometimes from she walk to the office on a cold moonlight evening and stand look in at they all through the keeping-room window -- she father prosing over the state of the flour-market she mother on the lounge the child wait for she to put they to bed methuselah poring over he arithmetic in he little-old-mannish way moppet tie the baby and the kitten together -- stand look till the hot shame blood shot to she forehead for thought of how she be wearied of the sight i can not think what be get into sharley complain she mother she have be as cross as a bear this good while if she be eight year old instead of eighteen i should give she a good whipping and send she to bed poor sharley nurse she trouble and she crossness together in she aggrieved girlish way till the light go out of she wistful eye and little sharp bone begin to show at she wrist she use to turn they about and pity they they be once so round and winsome now it be probably a fact that as for the matter of hard work sharley 's life be a sinecure compare to what it would be as the wife of halcombe dike double you toil into itself and triple it by the measure of responsibility and there you have you married life young girl -- beautiful dim eden that you have make of it but there be never a eden without its serpent i fancy besides sharley like the rest of they have not think as far as that then -- ah then what toil would not be play-day for the sake of halcombe dike what weariness and wear could be too great what pain too keen if they could bear it together o you mother do you not see that this make a ' the difference you have strength that you daughter know not of there be hand to help you over the thorn -lrb- if not there ought to be -rrb- she grope and cut she way alone be very patient with she in she little mood and selfishness no matter if she might help you more about the baby : be patient she position in you home be at best a anomalous one -- a grown woman with much of the dependence of a child she must have all the jar and task and fret of family life without the relief of housewifely invention and authority god and she own heart will teach she in time what she owe to you never fear for that but bear long with she do not exact too much the life you give she do not come at she ask consider this well and do not press the debt beyond its due i do not see that there be ever go to be any end to anything gasp sharley at night between moppet 's button this set she to think what if one make a end she go out one cold gray afternoon in the thick of a snow-storm and wander up and down the railroad it be easy walking upon the sleeper the place be lonely and she have come out to be alone she like the beat of the storm in she face for a while the sharp turn of the wind and the soft touch of the snow that be drift in little heap about she foot then she remember of how small use it be to like anything in the world now and she face grow as wild as the storm fancy yourself hem in with you direst grief by a drift sleet in such a voiceless viewless place as that corpse-like track -- the endless painless track stretch away in the white mystery at peace like all dead thing what sharley should have do be to go home as straight as she could go put on dry stocking and get she supper what she do be to linger as all people linger in the luxury of they first wretchedness -- till the uncanny twilight fall and shroud she in then a think strike she a freight-train be just come in slowly but heavily sharley as she step aside to let it pass fix she eye upon it for a moment then with a little hesitation stop to pick up a bit of iron that lay at she foot -- a round firm rod-end -- and place it diagonally upon the rail the car rumble by and over it sharley bent to see it be crush to a shapeless twist she face whiten she sit down and shiver a little but she do not go home the evening accommodation be due now in about ten minute girl if you think i be tell a bit of sensational fiction i wish you would let I know it would be quick and easy thought sharley the man of whom she have read in the journal last night -- they say he must have find it all over in a instant a instant be a very short time and forty year -- and the little black silk apron -- and the card lay up on a shelf o to go out of life -- anywhere anyhow out of life no the sixth commandment have nothing to do with end one 's self a unearthly echo shriek break through the noise of the storm -- nothing be more unearthly than a locomotive in a storm sharley stand up -- sit down again a red glare strike the white mist broaden brighten grow sharley lay she head down with she small neck upon the rail and -- i be compel to say that she take it up again faster than she lay it down take it up writhe off the track tumble down the banking hide she face in a drift and crouch there with the cold drop on she face till the hideous tempting thing shoot by i guess con-sumption would be -- a -- little better she decide crawl to she foot but the poor little foot could scarcely carry she she struggle to the street catch at the fence for a while then drop somebody stumble over she it be cousin sue -- halcombe dike 's cousin sue deary I she say and be five foot seven with strong yankee arm of she own she take sharley up in they and carry she to the house as if she have be a baby sharley do not commit the atrocity of fainting but find herself thoroughly chill and weak cousin sue bustle about with brandy and blanket and sharley watch she through she half-closed eye speculate a little have _ she _ anybody 's wedding-card lay up on a shelf she have the little black apron at any rate poor cousin sue should she be like that poor cousin charlotte people would say cousin sue have go to see about supper when sharley open she eye and sit strongly up a gentle-faced woman sit between she and the light in a chair cushion upon one side for a useless arm halcombe have make that chair mr dike have be a busy cheery woman and sharley have always feel sorry for she since the sudden day when paralysis cripple she good right hand three year ago that be now but she be not one of those people to whom it come natural to say that one be sorry for they and she be halcombe 's mother and so sharley have never say it it strike she freshly now that this woman have see much ill-fortune in she widow year and that she have keep a certain brave contented look in she eye through it all it strike she only as a pass thought which might never have come back have not mrs dike push she chair up beside she and give she a long quiet look straight in the eye it be late for you to be out in the storm my dear and alone i would be out a good while i have be on -- the track say sharley with a slight shiver i think i could not have be exactly well i would not go again i must go home now but oh -- she voice sinking -- i wish nobody have find I i wish nobody have find I the snow would have cover I up you see she start up flushing hot and frightened what have she be say to halcombe 's mother but halcombe 's mother put she healthy soft hand down on the girl 's shut finger woman understand each other in flash my dear she say without prelude or apology i have a thing to say to you god do not give we we trouble to think about that be all i have live more year than you i know that he never give we we trouble to think about i do not know who be go to think about they if we do not say sharley half aggrieved suppose nobody think of they where 's the harm do mark my word child : he send they to drive we out of ourselves -- to _ drive _ we out he have much rather we would go of we own accord but if we will not go we must be send for go we must that be just about what we be put into this world for and we be not fit to go out of it till we have find this out now the morality of conversation be apt to glide off from sharley like rain-drop from gutta-percha and i can not assert that these word would have make profound impression upon she have not halcombe dike 's mother happen to say they be that as it may she certainly take they home with she and ponder they in she heart ponder till late in she feverish sleepless night till she pillow grow wet and she heart grow still about midnight she jump out into the cold and kneel with she face hide in the bed o i have be a naughty girl she say just as she might have say it ten year ago she feel so small and ignorant and weak that night out of such smallness and ignorance and weakness great knowledge and strength may have beautiful growth they come in time to sharley but it be a long slow time moppet be just as unendurable the baby just as fretful life just as joyless as if she have take no new outlook upon it make no new tearful plan about it calico calico she cry out a dozen time a day nothing _ but _ calico but by and by it dawn in she thought that this be a very little matter to cry out about what if god mean that some life should be all just alike and like nothing fresh or bonnie and that hers should be one that be he affair hers be to use the dull gray gift he give -- _ whatever _ gift he give -- as loyally and as cheerily as she would use treasure of gold and rose-tint he know what he be do what he do be never forgetful or unkind she feel -- after a long time and in a quiet way -- that she could be sure of that no matter about halcombe dike and what be go no matter about the little black apron and what be come he understand all about that he would take care of it meantime why could she not as well wash moppet 's face with a pleasant word as with a cross one darn the stocking with a smile as well as a frown stay and hear she mother discuss she headache as well as run away and think of herself why not give happiness since she could not have it be of use since nobody be of much use to she easier say than do to be sure sharley find but she keep the idea in mind as the winter wear away she be think about it one April afternoon when she have steal out of the house for a walk in the bud wood she have need enough of a walk it be four week now since she have feel the wide wind upon she face four week pleasantly occupy in engineering four boy through the measles and if ever a sick child have the capacity for make of himself a seraph upon earth it be moppet it be a thin little face which stand out against the green mist of the unfurl leave as sharley wander in and out with sweet aimlessness among the elm and hickory very thin with its wistful eye grow hollow a shadow of the old sharley who flutter among the plaid ribbon one October morning it be a saddened face -- it might always be a saddened face -- but a certain pleasant rest look have work its way about she mouth not unlike the rich mellowness of a rainy sunset not that sharley know much about sunset yet but she think she do which as i say before amount to about the same thing she be think with a wee glow of pleasure how the baby 's arm cling around she neck that morning and how surprised she mother look when methuselah cry at she take this walk as you be warn in the begin nothing remarkable ever happen to sharley since she have begin in practice to approve mr dike 's theory that no harm be do if we never think of we trouble she have neither become the village idol nor in any remarkable degree she mother 's pride but she have nevertheless cut for herself a small niche in the heart of she home -- a much larger niche perhaps than the excellent mr guest be well aware of i do not care how small it be cry sharley as long as i have room to put my two foot on and look up and for that old pain ah well god know about that and sharley -- nobody else whatever the winter have teach she she have bind and label in she precise little way for future use at least she have learn -- and it be not everybody who learn it at eighteen -- to wear she life bravely -- a rose with a golden thorn i really think that this be the place to end my story so properly polish off with a moral so many sharley too will never read beyond but be bind in honor to tell the whole moral or no moral i must add that while sharley walk and think among she hickory there come up a thunder-storm it fall upon she without any warn the sky have be clear when she look at it last it gape at she now out of the throat of purple-black cloud thunder crash over and about she all the forest darken and reel sharley be enough like other girl to be afraid of a thunder-storm she start with a cry to break she way through the matted undergrowth see or feel that she see the glare of a golden arrow overhead throw out she hand and fall crushed face downward at the foot of a scorched tree when she open she eye she be sit under a wood-pile or to speak more accurately she be sit in mr halcombe dike 's lap and mr halcombe dike be under the wood-pile it be a low triangular wood-pile roof with pine board through which the water be drip it stand in the center of a large clearing expose to the rain but safe oh say sharley that be right say he i know you be only stunned i have be rub you hand and foot it be better to come here than to run the blockade of that patch of wood to a house do not try to talk i be not say sharley with a faint little laugh it be you that be talk and end with a weak pause she head fall back where she have find it upon he arm i _ would not _ talk repeat the young man relevantly after a profound silence of five minute i be come ` across lot ' from the station you fall -- sharley you fall right at my foot he speak carelessly but sharley look up saw that he face be white i believe i will get down she observe after some consideration lift she head i do not see how you can you know he suggest helplessly it pour as straight as a deluge out there there be not room in this place for two people to sit so they accept the situation the cloud break presently and rift of yellow light dart in through the fragrant wet pine board sharley 's hair have fall from she net and cover she face she feel too weak to push it away after some think halcombe dike push it away for she reverently with he strong warm hand the little white tremble face shine out he turn and look at it -- the poor little face -- look at it gravely and long but sharley at the look sit up straight she heart leap out into the yellow light all she dreary winter dance and dwindle away through the crack in the pine board a long procession of may-day come filing in the scatter rain-drop flame before she all the world and all the water blush and bloom she be so very young i could not speak he tell she quietly when i be at home before i could never speak till now last October i think -- he voice sink hoarsely -- i think sharley it could never be i could barely eke out my daily bread i have no right to ask you -- to bind you you be very young i think perhaps sharley you might forget somebody else might make you happier i would not stand in the way of you happiness i ask god to bless you that morning when i go away in the car sharley sharley something in she face he could not understand all that be mean by the upturned face perhaps he will never understand she hide it in she bright brown hair put she hand up softly upon he cheek and cry if you would like to hear anything about the business part of it -- suggest the young man clear he throat but sharley hate business she would not hear not about the crumpet building well i carry that affair through -- that be all they come out under the wide sky and walk home hand in hand all the world be hang with crystal the faint shadow of a rainbow quiver across a silver cloud the first thing that sharley do when she come home be to find moppet and squeeze he o moppet we can be good girl all the same if we be happy can not we no sir say injured moppet you do not catch I but o moppet see the round drop hang and burn on the blind and how the little mud-puddle shine moppet out of she pain and she patience god have bring she beautiful answer it be well for sharley but if such answer have not come that also would have be well kentucky 's ghost true every syllable that be a very fair yarn of yours tom brown very fair for a landsman but i 'll bet you a doughnut i can beat it and all on the square too as i say -- which be more if i do not mistake than you could take oath to not to say that i never stretch my yarn a little on the fo ` castle in my younger day like the rest of 'em but what with live under roof so long past and a call from the parson regular in strawberry time and have to do the flog consequent on the inakkeracy of statement follering on the grow up of six boy a man learn to trim he word a little tom and no mistake it be very much as it be with the talk of the sea grow strange to you from hear nothing but lubber who do not know a mizzen-mast from a church-steeple it be somewhere about twenty year ago last October if i recollect fair that we be lay in for that particular trip to madagascar i have do that little voyage to madagascar when the sea be like so much burning oil and the sky like so much burning brass and the fo ` castle as nigh a hell as ever fo ` castle be in a calm i have do it when we come sneak into port with nigh about every spar go and pump go night and day and i have do it with a drunken captain on starvation ration -- duff that a dog on land would not have touch and two teaspoonful of water to the day -- but someway or other of all the time we head for the east shore i do not seem to remember any quite as distinct as this we clear from long wharf in the ship madonna -- which they tell I mean my lady and a pretty name it be it be apt to give I that gentle kind of feeling when i speak it which be surprising when you consider what a dull old hull she be never log over ten knot and uncertain at that it may have be because of moll 's come down once in a while in the day that we lay at dock bring the boy with she and sit up on deck in a little white apron knit she be a very good-looking woman be my wife in those day and i feel proud of she -- natural with the lad look on molly i use to say sometimes -- molly madonna nonsense say she give a clack to she needle -- pleased enough though i warrant you and turn a very pretty pink about the cheek for a four-year ' wife see as how she be always a lady to I and a true one and a gentle though she be not much at manners or book-learning and though i never give she a silk gown in she life she be quite content you see and so be i i use to speak my think about the name sometimes when the lad be not particularly noisy but they laugh at I mostly i be rough enough and bad enough in those day as rough as the rest and as bad as the rest i suppose but yet i seem to have my notion a little different from the other jake 's poetry they call 'em we be load for the east shore trade as i say do not i there be not much of the genuine old-fashioned trade leave in these day except the whiskey branch which will be brisk i take it till the malagasy carry the prohibitory law by a large majority in both house we have a little whiskey in the hold i remember that trip with a good stock of knife red flannel handsaw nail and cotton we be hope to be at home again within the year we be well provisioned and dodd -- he be the cook -- dodd make about as fair coffee as you be likely to find in the galley of a trader as for we officer when i say the less say of they the better it be not so much that i mean to be disrespectful as that i mean to put it tenderly officer in the merchant service especially if it happen to be the african service be brutal man quite as often as they be not -lrb- at least that be my experience and when some of you great ship-owner argue the case with I -- as i be free to say they have do before now -- i say that be _ my _ experience sir which be all i have get to say -rrb- -- brutal man and about as fit for they position as if they would be import for the purpose a little indirect from davy jone 's locker though they do say that the flogging be pretty much do away with in these day which make a difference sometimes on a sunshiny afternoon when the muddy water show a little muddier than usual on account of the cloud be the color of silver and all the air the color of gold when the oily barrel be knock about on the wharf and the smell be strong from the fish-house and the man shout and the mate swear and we baby run about deck a-play with everybody -lrb- he be a cunning little chap with red stocking and bare knee and the lad take quite a shine to he -rrb- jake he mother would say with a little sigh -- low so that the captain never hear -- think if it be _ he _ go away for a year in company the like of that then she would drop she shine needle and call the little fellow back sharp and catch he up into she arm go into the keeping-room there tom and ask she all about it bless you she remember those day at dock better than i do she could tell you to this hour the color of my shirt and how long my hair be and what i eat and how i look and what i say i do not generally swear so thick when she be about well we weigh along the last of the month in pretty good spirit the madonna be as stanch and seaworthy as any eight-hundred-tonner in the harbor if she be clumsy we turn in some sixteen of we or thereabout into the fo ` castle -- a jolly set mostly old messmate and well content with one another and the breeze be stiff from the west with a fair sky the night before we be off molly and i take a walk upon the wharf after supper i carry the baby a boy sit on some box pull my sleeve as we go by and ask I point to the madonna if i would tell he the name of the ship find out for yourself say i not over-pleased to be interrupt do not be cross to he say molly the baby throw a kiss at the boy and molly smile at he through the dark i do not suppose i should ever have remember the lubber from that day to this except that i like the look of molly smile at he through the dark my wife and i say good-by the next morning in a little sheltered place among the lumber on the wharf she be one of you woman who never like to do they cry before folk she climb on the pile of lumber and sit down a little flushed and quivery to watch we off i remember see she there with the baby till we be well down the channel i remember notice the bay as it grow cleaner and think that i would break off swearing and i remember cursing bob smart like a pirate within a hour the breeze hold steadier than we would look for and we would make a good offing and discharge the pilot by nightfall mr whitmarsh -- he be the mate -- be aft with the captain the boy be sing a little the smell of the coffee be come up hot and home-like from the galley i be up in the maintop i forget what for when all at once there come a cry and a shout and when i touch deck i see a crowd around the fore-hatch what be all this noise for say mr whitmarsh come up and scowl a stow-away sir a boy stow away say bob catch the officer 's tone quick enough bob always test the wind well when a storm be brew he jerk the poor fellow out of the hold and push he along to the mate 's foot i say poor fellow and you would never wonder why if you would see as much of stow away as i have i would as lief see a son of mine in a carolina slave-gang as to see he lead the life of a stow-away what with the officer from feel that they have be take in and the man who catch they cue from they superior and the spite of the lawful boy who hire in the proper way he do not have what you may call a tender time this chap be a little fellow slight for he year which might have be fifteen i take it he be palish with a jerk of thin hair on he forehead he be hungry and homesick and frightened he look about on all we face and then he cower a little and lay still just as bob have throw he we -- ell say whitmarsh very slow if you do not repent you bargain before you go ashore my fine fellow -- I if i be mate of the madonna and take that for you pain upon that he kick the poor little lubber from quarter-deck to bowsprit or nearly and go down to he supper the man laugh a little then they whistle a little then they finish they song quite gay and well acquaint with the coffee steam away in the galley nobody have a word for the boy -- bless you no i 'll venture he would not have have a mouthful that night if it have not be for I and i can not say as i should have bother myself about he if it have not come across I sudden while he sit there rub he eye quite violent with he face to the west ` ard -lrb- the sun be set reddish -rrb- that i have see the lad before then i remember walk on the wharf and he on the box and molly say softly that i be cross to he see that my wife have smile at he and my baby throw a kiss at he it go against I you see not to look after the little rascal a bit that night but you have get no business here you know say i nobody want you i wish i be ashore say he -- i wish i be ashore with that he begin to rub he eye so very violent that i stop there be good stuff in he too for he choke and wink at I and do it all up about the sun on the water and a cold in the head as well as i could myself just about i do not know whether it be on account of be take a little notice of that night but the lad always kind of hung about I afterwards chase I round with he eye in a way he have and do odd job for I without the ask one night before the first week be out he haul alongside of I on the windlass i be try a new pipe -lrb- and a very good one too -rrb- so i do not give he much notice for a while you do this job up shrewd kent say i by and by how do you steer in -- for it do not often happen that the madonna get fairly out of port with a boy unbeknown in she hold watch be drunk i crawl down ahind the whiskey it be hot you bet and dark i lay and think how hungry i be say he friend at home say i upon that he give I a nod very short and get up and walk off whistle the first Sunday out that chap do not know any more what to do with himself than a lobster just put on to boil Sunday 's cleaning day at sea you know the lad wash up and sit round little knot of they mend they trousers bob get out he card I and a few mate take it comfortable under the to ` gallant fo ` castle -lrb- i be on watch below -rrb- reel off the stiffest yarn we have in tow kent look on at euchre awhile then listen to we awhile then walk about uneasy by and by say bob look over there -- spry and there be kent sit curl away in a heap under the stern of the long-boat he have a book bob crawl behind and snatch it up unbeknown out of he hand then he fall to laugh as if he would strangle and give the book a toss to I it be a bit of testament black and old there be write on the yellow leaf this way : -- kentucky hodge from he affecshunate mother who pray for you evry day amen the boy turn first red then white and straighten up quite sudden but he never say a word only sit down again and let we laugh it out i have lose my reckoning if he ever hear the last of it he tell I one day how he come by the name but i forget exactly something about a old fellow -- uncle i believe -- as die in kentucky and the name be moniment-like you see he use to seem cut up a bit about it at first for the lad take to it famously but he get use to it in a week or two and see as they mean he no unkindness take it quite cheery one other thing i notice be that he never have the book about after that he fall into we way next Sunday more easy they do not take the bible just the way you would tom -- as a general thing sailor do not though i will say that i never see the man at sea who do not give it the credit of be a uncommon good yarn but i tell you tom brown i feel sorry for that boy it be punishment bad enough for a little scamp like he leave the honest shore and folk to home that be a bit tender of he maybe to rough it on a trader learn how to slush down a back-stay or tie reef-point with frozen finger in a snow-squall but that be not the worst of it by no means if ever there be a cold-blooded cruel man with a wicked eye and a fist like a mallet it be job whitmarsh take at he best and i believe of all the trip i have take he be mate of the madonna kentucky find he at he worst bradley -- that be the second mate -- be none too gentle in he way you may be sure but he never hold a candle to mr whitmarsh he take a spite to the boy from the first and he keep it on a steady strain to the last right along just about so i have see he beat that boy till the blood run down in little pool on deck then send he up all wet and red to clear the to ` sail halliard and when what with the pain and faintness he dizzy a little and clung to the ratlin half blind he would have he down and flog he till the cap'n interfere -- which would happen occasionally on a fair day when he have take just enough to be good-natured he use to rack he brain for the word he sling at the boy work quiet enough beside he it be odd now the talk he would get off bob smart could not any more come up to it than i could : we use to try sometimes but we have to give in always if curse have be a marketable article whitmarsh would have take out he patent and make he fortune by invent of they new and ingenious then he use to kick the lad down the fo ` castle ladder he use to work he sick or well as he would not have work a dray-horse he use to chase he all about deck at the rope 's end he use to mast-head he for hour on the stretch he use to starve he out in the hold it do not come in my line to be over-tender but i turn sick at heart tom more time than one look on helpless and I a great stout fellow i remember now -- do not know as i have think of it for twenty year -- a thing mccallum say one night mccallum be scotch -- a old fellow with gray hair tell the best yarn on the fo ` castle always mark my word shipmate say he when job whitmarsh 's time come to go as straight to hell as juda that boy will bring he summons dead or alive that boy will bring he summons one day i recollect especial that the lad be sick with fever on he and take to he hammock whitmarsh drive he on deck and order he aloft i be stand near by trim the spanker kentucky stagger for ` ard a little and sit down there be a rope 's - end there knot three time the mate strike he i be very weak sir say he he strike he again he strike he twice more the boy fall over a little and lay where he fall i do not know what ail I but all of a sudden i seem to be lie off long wharf with the cloud the color of silver and the air the color of gold and molly in a white apron with she shine needle and the baby a-play in he red stocking about the deck think if it be he say she or she seem to say -- think if it be _ he _ and the next i know i would let slip my tongue in a jiffy and give it to the mate that furious and onrespectful as i 'll wager whitmarsh never get before and the next i know after that they have the iron on I sorry about that eh say he the day before they take 'em off _ no _ sir say i and i never be kentucky never forget that i have help he occasional in the beginning -- learn he how to veer and haul a brace let go or belay a sheet -- but let he alone generally speak and go about my own business that week in iron i really believe the lad never forget one time -- it be on a Saturday night and the mate have be oncommon furious that week -- kentucky turn on he very pale and slow -lrb- i be up in the mizzen-top and hear he quite distinct -rrb- mr whitmarsh say he -- mr whitmarsh -- he draw he breath in -- mr whitmarsh -- three time -- you have get the power and you know it and so do the gentleman who put you here and i be only a stow-away boy and thing be all in a tangle but _ you 'll be sorry yet for every time you have lay you hand on I _ he have not a pleasant look about the eye either when he say it fact be that first month on the madonna have do the lad no good he have a surly sullen way with he some'at like what i have see about a chained dog at the first he talk have be clean as my baby 's and he would blush like any girl at bob smart 's story but he get use to bob and pretty good in time at small swearing i do not think i should have notice it so much if it have not be for seem to see molly and the sun and the knitting-needle and the child upon the deck and hearing of it over think if it be _ he _ sometimes on a Sunday night i use to think it be a pity not that i be any better than the rest except so far as the married man be always steadier go through any crew the sea over and it be the lad who have home of they own and little child in 'em as keep the straightest sometimes too i use to take a fancy that i could have listen to a word from a parson or a good brisk psalm-tune and take it in very good part a year be a long pull for twenty-five man to be becalm with each other and the devil i do not set up to be pious myself but i be not a fool and i know that if we would have so much as one officer aboard who fear god and keep he commandment we should have be the better man for it it be very much with religion as it be with cayenne pepper -- if it be there you know it if you have you ship on the sea by the dozen you would bethink you of that bless you tom if you be in rome you would do as the roman do you would have you ledger and you child and you church and Sunday school and free nigger and ` lection and what not and never stop to think whether the lad that sail you ship across the world have soul or not -- and be a good sort of man too that be the way of the world take it easy tom -- take it easy well thing go along just about so with we till we near the cape it be not a pretty place the cape on a winter 's voyage i can not say as i ever be what you may call scar ' t after the first time round it but it be not a pretty place i do not seem to remember much about kent along there till there come a Friday at the first of December it be a still day with a little haze like white sand sift across a sunbeam on a kitchen table the lad be quiet-like all day chase I about with he eye sick say i no say he whitmarsh drunk say i no say he a little after dark i be lie on a coil of rope nap it the boy be have the bay of biscay quite lively and i wake up on the jump in the chorus kent come up while they be tell how she lay on that day in the _ bay _ of biscay o he be not singing he sit down beside I and first i think i would not trouble myself about he and then i think i would so i open one eye at he encourage he crawl up a little closer to I it be rather dark where we sit with a great greenish shadow drop from the mainsail the wind be up a little and the light at helm look flickery and red jake say he all at once where 's you mother in -- heaven say i all take aback and if ever i come nigh what you might call a little disrespect to you mother it be on that occasion from be take so aback oh say he get any women-folk to home that miss you ask he by and by say i should not wonder after that he sit still a little with he elbow on he knee then he speer at I sidewise awhile then say he i s ` pose _ i _ have get a mother to home i run away from she this mind you be the first time he have ever speak about he folk since he come aboard she be asleep down in the south chamber say he i get out the window there be one white shirt she have make for meetin ' and such i have never wear it out here i have not the heart it have a collar and some cuff you know she have a headache making of it she be be foller I round all day a sewing on that shirt when i come in she would look up bright-like and smile father 's dead there be not anybody but I all day long she be be foller of I round so then he get up and join the lad and try to sing a little but he come back very still and sit down we could see the flickery light upon the boy ' face and on the rigging and on the cap'n who be damn the bo ` sen a little aft jake say he quite low look here i have be think do you reckon there be a chap here -- just one perhaps -- who be say he prayer since he come aboard _ no _ say i quite short : for i would have bet my head on it i can remember as if it be this morning just how the question sound and the answer i can not seem to put it into word how it come all over I the wind be turn brisk and we would just ease she with a few reef bob smart out furl the fly jib get soak I and the boy sit silent be spatter i remember watch the curve of the great swell mahogany color with the tip of white and think how like it be to a big creature hiss and foam at the mouth and think all at once something about he hold of the sea in a balance and not a word bespoke to beg he favor respectful since we weigh we anchor and the cap'n yonder call on he just that minute to send the madonna to the bottom if the bo ` sen have not disobey he order about the square of the after-yard from he affecshunate mother who pray for you evry day aman whisper kentucky presently very soft the book 's tear up mr whitmarsh wad he old gun with it but i remember then say he : it be ` most bedtime to home she be set in a little rocking-chair -- a green one there be a fire and the dog she set all by herself then he begin again : she have to bring in she own wood now there be a gray ribbon on she cap when she go to meetin ' she wear a gray bunnet she be draw the curtain and the door be lock but she think i 'll be come home sorry some day -- i be sure she think i 'll be come home sorry just then there come the order port watch ahoy tumble up there lively so i turn out and the lad turn in and the night settle down a little black and my hand and head be full next day it blow a clean all but a bank of gray very thin and still -- about the size of that cloud you see through the side window tom -- which lay just abeam of we the sea i think look like a great purple pincushion with a mast or two stick in on the horizon for the pin jake 's poetry the boy say that be by noon that little gray bank have grow up thick like a wall by sundown the cap'n let he liquor alone and keep the deck by night we be in chop-sea with a very ugly wind steer small there cry whitmarsh grow hot about the face -- for we make a terribly crooked wake with a broad sheer and the old hull strain heavily -- steer small there i tell you mind you eye now mccallum with you foresail furl the royal send down the royal cheerily man where 's that lubber kent up with you lively now kentucky spring for ` ard at the order then stop short anybody as know a royal from a anchor would not have blame the lad i 'll take oath to ' t it be no play for a old tar stout and full in size send down the royal in a gale like that let alone a boy of fifteen year on he first voyage but the mate take to swearing -lrb- it would have turn a parson faint to hear he -rrb- and kent shoot away up -- the great mast swing like a pendulum to and fro and the reef-point snap and the block creak and the sail flap to that extent as you would not consider possible unless you would be before the mast yourself it remind I of evil bird i have read of that stun a man with they wing strike _ you _ to the bottom tom before you could say jack robinson kent stick bravely as far as the cross-tree there he slip and struggle and cling in the dark and noise awhile then come slide down the back-stay i be not afraid sir say he but i can not do it for answer whitmarsh take to the rope 's - end so kentucky be up again and slip and struggle and cling again and then lay down again at this the man begin to grumble a little low will you kill the lad say i i get a blow for my pain that send I off my foot none too easy and when i rub the star out of my eye the boy be up again and the mate behind he with the rope whitmarsh stop when he would go far enough the lad climb on once he look back he never open he lip he just look back if i have see he once since in my think i have see he twenty time -- up in the shadow of the great gray wing a look back after that there be only a cry and a splash and the madonna racing along with the gale twelve knot if it have be the whole crew overboard she could never have stop for they that night well say the cap'n you have do it now whitmarsh turn he back by and by when the wind fall and the hurry be over and i have the time to think a steady thought be in the morning watch i seem to see the old lady in the gray bunnet setting by the fire and the dog and the green rocking-chair and the front door with the boy walking in on a sunny afternoon to take she by surprise then i remember lean over to look down and wonder if the lad be think of it too and what have happen to he now these two hour back and just about where he be and how he like he new quarter and many other strange and curious thing and while i sit there think the sunday-morning star cut through the cloud and the solemn sunday-morning light begin to break upon the sea we have a quiet run of it after that into port where we lay about a couple of month or so trade off for a fair stock of palm-oil ivory and hide the day be hot and purple and still we have not what you might call a blow if i recollect accurate till we round the cape again head for home we be round that cape again head for home when that happen which you may believe I or not as you take the notion tom though why a man who can swallow daniel and the lion 's den or take down t ` other chap who live three day comfortable into the inside of a whale should make face at what i have get to tell i can not see it be just about the spot that we lose the boy that we fall upon the worst gale of the trip it strike we quite sudden whitmarsh be a little high he be not apt to be drunk in a gale if it give he warn sufficient well you see there must be somebody to furl the main-royal again and he pitch onto mccallum mccallum have not he beat for fight out the royal in a blow so he pile away lively up to the to ' - sail yard there all of a sudden he stop next we know he be down like heat-lightning he face have go very white what be to pay with _ you _ roar whitmarsh say mccallum _ there be somebody up there sir _ scream whitmarsh you be go a idiot say mccallum very quiet and distinct : there be somebody up there sir i see he quite plain he see I i call up he call down say he _ ` do not you come up _ ' and hang I if i 'll stir a step for you or any other man to-night i never see the face of any man alive go the turn that mate 's face go if he would not have relish knock the scotchman dead before he eye i have lose my guess can not say what he would have do to the old fellow if there would be any time to lose he would the sense leave to see there be not overmuch so he order out bob smart direct bob go up steady with a quid in he cheek and a cool eye half-way amid to ' - sail and to ' - gallant he stop and down he come spin be drown if there be not say he he be sit square upon the yard i never see the boy kentucky if he be not sit on that yard ' _ do not you come up _ ' he cry out -- ' _ do not you come up _ ' bob 's drunk and mccallum 's a fool say jim welch standing by so welch wolunteer up and take jaloffe with he they be a couple of the coolest hand aboard -- welch and jaloffe so up they go and down they come like the rest by the back-stay by the run he beckon of I back say welch he holler not to come up not to come up after that there be not a man of we would stir aloft not for love nor money well whitmarsh he stamp and he swear and he knock we about furious but we sit and look at one another 's eye and never stir something cold like a frost-bite seem to crawl along from man to man look into one another 's eye i 'll shame ye all then for a set of cowardly lubber cry the mate and what with the anger and the drink he be as good as he word and up the ratlin in a twinkle in a flash we be after he -- he be we officer you see and we feel ashamed -- I at the head and the lad follow after i get to the futtock shroud and there i stop for i see he myself -- a palish boy with a jerk of thin hair on he forehead i would have know he anywhere in this world or t ` other i see he just as distinct as i see you tom brown sit on that yard quite steady with the royal flap like to flap he off i reckon i have have as much experience fore and aft in the course of fifteen year aboard as any man that ever tie a reef-point in a nor'easter but i never see a sight like that not before nor since i will not say that i do not wish myself well on deck but i will say that i stick to the shroud and look on steady whitmarsh swearing that that royal should be furl go on and go up it be after that i hear the voice it come straight from the figure of the boy upon the upper yard but this time it say _ come up come up _ and then a little louder _ come up come up come up _ so he go up and next i know there be a cry -- and next a splash -- and then i see the royal flap from the empty yard and the mate be go and the boy job whitmarsh be never see again alow or aloft that night or ever after i be tell the tale to we parson this summer -- he be a fair-minded chap the parson in spite of a little natural lean to strawberry which i always take in very good part -- and he turn it about in he mind some time if it be the boy say he -- and i can not say as i see any reason especial why it should not have be -- i have be wonder what he spiritooal condition be a soul in hell -- the parson believe in hell i take it because he can not help himself but he have that solemn tender way of preach it as make you feel he would not have so much as a chicken get there if he could help it -- a lose soul say the parson -lrb- i do not know as i get the word exact -rrb- -- a soul that have go and be and get there of its own free will and choose would be as like as not to haul another soul alongside if he could then again if the mate 's time have come you see and he chance be over why that be the will of the lord and it be hell for he whichever side of death he be and nobody 's fault but hisn and the boy might be in the good place and do the errand all the same that be just about it brown say he a man go he own gait and if he will not go to heaven he _ will not _ and the good god himself can not help it he throw the shine gate all open wide and he never shut they on any poor fellow as would have enter in and he never never will which i thought be sensible of the parson and very prettily put there be molly frying flapjack now and flapjack will not wait for no man you know no more than time and tide else i should have talk till midnight very like to tell the time we make on that trip home and how green the harbor look a sailing up and of molly and the baby come down to meet I in a little boat that dance about -lrb- for we cast a little down the channel -rrb- and how she climb up a laughing and a cry all to once about my neck and how the boy have grow and how when he run about the deck -lrb- the little shaver have he first pair of boot on that very afternoon -rrb- i bethought I of the other time and of molly 's word and of the lad we have leave behind we in the purple day just as we be haul up i say to my wife : who be that old lady set there upon the lumber with a gray bunnet and a gray ribbon on she cap for there be a old lady there and i see the sun all about she and all on the blaze yellow board and i grow a little dazed and dazzle i do not know say molly catch onto I a little close she come there every day they say she sit and watch for she lad as run away so then i seem to know as well as ever i know afterwards who it be and i think of the dog and the green rocking-chair and the book that whitmarsh wad he old gun with and the front-door with the boy a walking in so we three go up the wharf -- molly and the baby and I -- and sit down beside she on the yellow board i can not remember rightly what i say but i remember she sit silent in the sunshine till i have tell she all there be to tell _ do not _ cry say molly when i get through -- which it be the more surprising of molly consider as she be do the cry all to herself the old lady never cry you see she sit with she eye wide open under she gray bunnet and she lip a moving after a while i make it out what it be she say : the only son -- of he mother -- and she -- by and by she get up and go she way and molly and i walk home together with we little boy between we the end end of project gutenberg 's
