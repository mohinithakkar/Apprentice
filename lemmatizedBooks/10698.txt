silver cup what if they do it be by a hair 's breadth mr smarty and they monoplane be prove to be faster than the big biplane you build puss carberry oh be it do not you be too sure of that larry do not it land on the summit of old thunder top ahead of you and sandy in the race that afternoon tell I that and larry geohegan bristle up to the recognize bully of bloomsbury while a dozen fellow cluster around on the deck of the big power boat listen eagerly to this war of word they be on they way home from a very exciting game of baseball that have be play at cranford across the lake and after ten inning of hot work the nine from bloomsbury have win but not until they have change pitcher upon tie the score in the ninth after come up from behind puss and larry both wear the uniform of the home player and there be other on the boat who also belong to the team in fact the staunch vessel have be place at the disposal of the baseball club for this day by commodore elliott the rich owner larry have never be one of the adherent whom puss could call upon to back he up when he try conclusion with a hostile faction in fact larry have always be a admirer of frank bird who be recognize as the most persistent rival the bully have ever encounter in he whole career since come to bloomsbury puss allow a contemptuous expression to take possession of he face and even shrug he broad shoulder after a nasty fashion he have that often anger the one he be argue with more than word could have do aw rat he say in a disagreeable rasping voice everybody know that i would win that same race only for trouble with my engine frank be lucky just like he generally be when he go in for anything look at he today be call in to pitch in the tenth we have 'em badly rattle and they be on the toboggan sure yet frank the great hero get credit for win that game do not the bloomsbury crowd cheer he to the echo though and want to ride he on they shoulder wow it make I sick to see such toadyism what be all this big noise about fellow do not i hear my name mention ask a tall lad with a frank face and clear brown eye as he push forward it be frank bird himself who have be talk with he cousin andy and several other fellow in the bow of the launch and by accident hear the voice that be raise in dispute percy carberry know among he comrade simply as puss do not flinch when he find himself face to face with the boy he detest so thoroughly they have never as yet actually come to blow but puss believe that he muscular power be far superior to those of he more slender rival and just now he be in a particularly bitter frame of mind oh so you be there be you he sneer i be just tell you good friend larry here that i consider you a greatly overrated substitute pitcher and that luck have as much to do with we win that game today as anything you do frank bird laugh in he face sure he declare cheerily i be a mighty small factor in the victory for i only play in one short inning if i would face those hard hitter of cranford nine time i reckon it would be hard to tell what they would have do to my poor inshoot and curve but you hold they in that inning frank you know you do cry larry mere accident my boy happen to be the weak end of they batting list observe frank as if determine to agree with he enemy and thus spike he gun be that so demand elephant small who do not happen to be on the nine because of he customary slow way perhaps you 'll be say that dandy two-bagger you whang out that bring in the win run be also a accident well i must have just shut my eye and strike i seem to remember hear a sound like a shot and then they all yell to I to run so i do go on to second in time to see peterkin gallop home and frank look as sober as a judge as he say this the other see the joke however and lead by larry burst out into a laugh that make puss and he loyal backer scowl if that bingle be a accident do not we wish we have a few more player who could shut they eye and meet frazer 's terrible speed ball and curve in the same way one fellow exclaim so say we all of we another cry puss realize that the majority on board the _ siren _ be against he but he be not give to take water even he enemy and he have many in bloomsbury could hardly say that puss be lack in a certain kind of grit while stubbornness he possess in abundance so he just shut he white tooth hard together and look scowlingly around the bunch of fellow and many of they feel a little chill when those cold gray eye rest upon they for they know of old what happen when puss carberry make up he mind to mark a boy for future attention frank still stand there by the side of the boat smile perhaps he very apparent unconcern serve to make the other still more angry there have be bad blood between these two lad for a long time and more than once it threaten a eruption which somehow or other have up to now be stay although some week have pass since the much-talked-of race between the rival aeroplane pilot by these two boy in which frank take he little craft up to the lofty summit of old thunder top ahead of puss in he biplane as narrated in the first volume of this series entitle the bird boy or the young sky pilot 's first air voyage the latter have never cease to feel ugly over he defeat as usual he have what he consider a good excuse for he arrive second but few person ever know how puss and he helper sandy have try to injure frank 's airship when it be directly beneath they by deliberately drop a sand bag take along singularly enough as ballast but with this very idea in view seem to I you have get the big head ever since you happen to drop on that rocky plateau on top of the mountain just three little seconds ahead of I frank bird he say with a steely glitter in he eye that those who know he best understand to mean coming trouble oh i hope not puss reply the other with a smile i give you my word my hat fit I just as comfortably as ever it be a close race and the one who get there first have not much to crow about for a fact we happen to be lucky not to have any trouble with we new little kinkaid engine that be all huh grunt he cousin andy shake he head and scowl at puss in turn but we have plenty of other sort of trouble all the same sand bag full of it in fact they just rain down on we but then frank know how to check up he engine suddenly and the storm pass by without any hurt some of the fellow who happen to know what this sly reference on the part of the hotheaded andy mean begin to chuckle of course such a thing would only serve to make puss more angry he choose to believe that they be all only try to bait he frank in particular come in for he dark look and larry who have once run in the same company as puss so that he know he whim better than many other take occasion to give frank bird a sly nudge in the side as he whisper : look out for he frank he be get near the danger point sure but frank do not have to be warn he have grow tired of ward off this ever threatening danger of a broil with puss carberry like he cousin andy the other have no father and he wealthy mother have long since give up in despair the idea of control the headstrong lad so that puss have he way whenever he want to do anything out of the ordinary because mr carberry be one of he father 's patient and dr bird esteem she very highly frank have postpone the reckoning just as long as he could endure the insult of the bully but he believe the last ditch have be reach and be determine to no longer raise a hand to avert the threatening storm puss have turn when andy speak to flash a look in he direction but it have no effect upon the other who could be as reckless at time as the next one indeed frank often have to curb the impatience and daring of he chum oh that be what stick in you craw do it andy bird demand puss just because sandy happen to drop that ballast thinking we might make better time if we lighten ship you choose to make all sort of nasty insinuation about we want to knock you out show where you mind be another fellow would not ever let such a fool notion get a grip on he and you would better put a reef in that tongue of yours my boy unless you want to have it get you into trouble andy flare up at once and would have reply but frank calmly step in between the two as though he claim first right neither of we have charge you with intentionally try to disable we aeroplane by drop that sand bag puss he remark quietly all we say be that it be a queer coincidence you want to get rid of you ballast just when we be walk up on you hand over fist and about to pass under you to take the lead that be all again there be a low laugh from among the boy who stand around listen to they it be a rich treat to see the recognize bully of bloomsbury bait to he very face in this characteristic way and they be enjoy it hugely well let I tell you it be not all not by a jugful exclaimed puss he face take on a purple hue as it always do when he become enraged both of you fellow have get to stop speak about that sand bag drop or there be go to be a lick in store for you see and he thrust he face close to that of frank as he say this larry geohegan fairly hold he breath now it be come do not i know the sign he whisper to the boy next he frank continue to stand there close to the side of the speeding launch they be about half way across the deep lake at the time evening be come on for the sun have just reach the distant rugged horizon in the west do you refer to I when you say that puss he ask with that same queer little smile on he face -- a look that mystify the other who could not understand what it mean yes both you and that loud-mouthed cousin of yours just because luck favor you and you win that bloom race by a head you think i can not manage a aeroplane as well as you huh perhaps you do not know that i be go to take my machine with I when i go down to the cocoa plantation we own along the amazon and use it explore where a white man have seldom be see you can just stay here and grow up with the country while i be do great stunt but as long as i stay here i be go to stop this talk about trickery and low-down dodge you be responsible for most of it frank bird i warn you what be come to you perhaps say frank pleasantly you would be kind enough to tell I also when this awful punishment be go to fall on my poor devoted neck any time hang you right now if you say another word roar puss double up he fist and make ready for one of he well know and fear bull rush that have bring he a speedy victory many a time so that be comforting and with all these good fellow around to see how you wipe up the deck with I suppose you begin the swab act puss and frank pretended to throw himself in a position of defense the other give utterance to a hoarse cry of rage and lower he head after the manner of a bull jump forward but the agile frank simply step aside and unable to check himself in time puss carberry shot over the side of the power boat disappear in the clear water of sunrise lake with a great splash oh shout he crony sandy hollingshead standing there as if petrified and puss can not swim a single stroke either chapter ii frank 's way my goodness what a splash serve he right that be what he be go under fellow dive just like a big frog stop the boat he 'll drown half a dozen be shout in unison as the boy crowd to the side over which the bully have pitch when frank avoid he forward rush but frank hear only that startled exclamation from sandy hollingshead : puss can not swim a single stroke either with frank bird to think be to act the two thing be almost synonymous in he mind forget be the fact that the imperil lad have be endeavor to strike he in the face at the time of he submersion in the water of sunrise lake not a single word do he utter but throw off he coat he make a leap over the side of the boat already slow up as the power be cut off frank 's go back after he cry one and he 'll get he too another hasten to say for they understand that when the leader of the team know as the bird boy attempt anything he usually get there as some of they say with both foot meanwhile frank be swim with all he might toward the spot in the foamy wake of the boat where he know the unfortunate puss must be battle for he life it seem strange that occasionally a boy may be find who have never take the trouble to learn how to swim in the country this be a rare occurrence which would make the neglect of such a athletic fellow as puss seem more remarkable he be thresh about in the deep water like a cat that have fall overboard and manage to keep partly afloat after a fashion though it would have be all over with he long ere the power boat could be turn around and arrive at the spot where he struggle gasp for breath and sucking in much water frank be wise enough to understand that it be always desirable to approach a drown person from the rear so that a grip may be take before the would-be rescuer 's presence be discover once let those frenzied finger clutch hold of he and the chance of a double tragedy would be good so frank be keenly on the watch as he swim toward the splashing and gurgle that announce puss carberry 's fight for he life he could see he by now and never would frank be apt to forget the look of absolute terror he discover upon the agonize face of the bully puss have detect the presence of some one near by and be try to shout as well as stretch he appealing hand out though not with much success he actually go under while frank look and the heart of the would-be rescuer almost stand still with a terrible fear that that be the end but he keep on and in another moment a head once more bob up with puss thresh the water frantically once he have go down accord to what most people say he would possibly vanish twice more and after that never rise again if anything be to be do there be no time for delay frank be within ten foot of the struggle figure when it come up he immediately dive and manage to rise to the surface behind puss then just as the other be flounder beneath the surface of the agitate water again frank catch hold of he sweater close to he neck and hold on with might and main he have a serious job of it for the half-drowned lad make a desperate attempt to turn around doubtless with the intention of throw he arm around he rescuer this be just what frank be desirous of avoid he simply want to keep the head of puss above water until the boat could come and willing hand be stretch down to relieve he of he burden so he keep tread water and fight puss off as best he be able it be no easy task since he still have he baseball shoe on and swimming in one 's clothes be always a difficult proposition but frank know no such word as fail and continue to strive keep one eye on puss and the other on the approach power boat steady now puss he keep say again and again try to instill some sense in the head of the frantic boy who still believe he must be go down again keep you breath in you lung and you 'll float do not kick so i be go to hold you up till the boy come it be all right puss you be safe all the same frank be mighty well pleased when the launch do swing close alongside and half a dozen hand reach out to clutch hold of they both puss first fellow he say with a half laugh i can crawl in myself i guess but they would not hear of it so willing hand lift he up as soon as the other drip figure have be deposit in the bottom of the boat frank make light of the adventure after he usual style oh come let up on that he remark when some of the fellow be pat he on the back and call he a hero and all such thing that be particularly disagreeable to frank it be just a cinch to I you know i be half a water spaniel anyway besides if it have not be for the way i rile he puss would not have fall overboard drop it please by the time the boat reach the landing near the dock where the lake steamer touch puss seem to have discharge he cargo of water swallow unintentionally he make he appearance with several crony cluster about he frank be not the one to hold a grudge besides he have come out of the affair with fly color and have nothing to regret so he stride up to puss at once hold out he hand every boy on board crowd around eager to see how the bully would behave for they know he natural disposition and wonder whether any sort of miracle have be work in he disposition because of he recent submersion i hope you be feel all right now puss frank say pleasantly i want to ask you pardon for treat you so roughly but know you could not swim i be afraid that if you close with I we would both go down but you strike I once right in the face you coward exclaim the other as he put he still tremble hand up to where a bruise of some sort could be see yes i admit it return frank quickly and that be what i want to apologize for you grab I and it be the only way i could break you hold i have be tell by life saver that often they have to strike a man and knock he senseless to save themselves from be drag down you must understand that it be no time to be particular i have to save myself in order to help you the other stare hard at he evidently puss have not yet entirely recover after he close call at any rate it be positive that he could not understand how he actually owe he very life to the speedy action of this boy whom he hate so bitterly they see he shake he head much as a dog might that be worry a rat well you only undo you own dirty work you push I in and then you get cold foot for fear that i would drown and you would be hang you jump in to do you usual grandstand act of hero do not i hear these softie call you that right now no i do not want to touch you hand keep you friendship for those who can appreciate it there be a long account between we that be go to be settle some fine day and with these ungrateful word puss carberry stride off the boat surround by he crony who be doubtless pleased with the course of thing well do you ever hear of such base ingratitude in all you bear day exclaim larry geohegan make a gesture of supreme disgust and to think of the skunk say frank push he in echo elephant when he actually risk he life to save the cur be not i glad now i do not carry out my first impulse and jump after puss even before frank go why maybe he would have even say i try to drown he the idea of that proverbial slow coach of a elephant ever do anything on the spur of the moment be really too much for the rest of the boy and a general roar go up do not bother you head about I fellow remark frank quietly when the laughter have cease again that be just about the kind of treatment i should have expect to get from puss carberry still i be not sorry i do it life would seem very tame without that schemer around to try and liven thing up for I but i hardly expect he to accuse I of push he in when all i do be to step aside and avoid a blow at he hand forget it please he walk off with he cousin andy who have be boil over at the time the rescue puss make he astonishing accusation would not that jar you some now remark andy after he customary fashion i suppose you be refer to the way puss turn on I after i go and get my baseball suit wet just to give he a help hand laugh frank good naturedly oh i do not bear any malice perhaps he be still a little stunned by that knock i give he but i think he be go to get he arm around my neck you see and then it would be all up with we both it work too for he be as limp as a dishrag from that time on remember it andy in case you ever jump over after puss I after that snake why hang it i would see he in guinea before i would ever lift a hand to save he i tell you i would -- i would -- stammer the indignant andy i do not believe it of you declare he cousin quickly you may think you would stand by and see he drown but that be all gammon i know you too well to believe you be half as vindictive as you try to make out but do you hear what he say about go down there to south america visit a plantation he mother partly own and take he biplane along with he andy be all excitement now sure i do he say and ten to one he learn somehow that we think of go down in that region for another purpose it would be just like puss and that sneak of a sandy hollingshead to try and beat we out that fellow would not mind a trip to the other end of the world if he think he could get you goat frank he hate you like poison pity you do not feel a cramp just when you be swim to he -- not enough to endanger you own life you see but sort of make you stop short shame on you andy remark frank i hope i 'll always carry myself so that i will not be afraid to look at myself in a glass but what do you know about that place -- do not he call it a cocoa plantation or something of the kind yes reply the other moodily i be tell that he mother own two-third of some such place along the amazon or somewhere down there but let they go it be a tremendous big country and there be not the least danger that we 'll ever butt into they if we _ should _ decide to take a run down still observe the taller lad thoughtfully you never can know i have hear traveler say that sometimes the world seem to be very small when you meet you next door neighbor on the top of some swiss mountain puss may know nothing about you plan and this be perhaps only a coincidence as they say since he have have such poor luck get to the top of we mountain around here he want to try he hand on those poor south american ande andy 's father have be a professor in one of the college who have take up aeronautics have make many balloon voyage in quest of scientific information so that he name have become quite famous then about a year before he have be lose when attempt to solve the air current on the panama isthmus where the government have thirty thousand laborer digging the big ditch nothing have ever be hear of the professor from the day he start from the atlantic side of the isthmus intend to cross the mountain and land on the pacific beach and it be become a positive mania in the mind of andy who live with he guardian colonel josiah whymper to some day go down there and follow in the track of he lose father in the hope of discover he sad fate it be with this idea in mind that he have unite he force with frank 's inventive genius and help build the monoplane with which they have win the race to the top of the neighbor mountain during old home week at bloomsbury and every day he be think more and more of what strange thing the future might have in store for he if he ever start on that explore venture chapter iii something about the bird boy how about come over tonight ask frank as the boy halt at the gate of dr bird 's place where andy have go to get he wheel since he live some little distance away i would like to first rate frank because there be some thing i want to talk over with you but i promise colonel josiah to get at he book tonight and straighten they out it 'll take I all evening i reckon oh well remark frank see you in the morning anyway this breeze will have worn itself out by then perhaps and if we feel like it we can take a little trip somewhere in the ` bug ' as you like to call we dandy little aeroplane i hope so reply andy eagerly it be be some day now since we be up and i be more than curious to find out if that new arrangement of yours be go to help we any in get a quick start do the colonel still persist in have old shea sleep outside the shed ask the other as andy push in to get he wheel out from under a side porch where he have thrust it before start off to the baseball game sure come the reply when colonel josiah once start on a thing it would take a earthquake to stop he i try to tell he that there be no danger of we monoplane be injure now that those two man who rob the jewelry store be lock up at police headquarters wait for some formality to start they on the road to a ten-year sentence but he only shake he head and say shea have nothing else to do and might as well be earn he salt the incident to which andy refer be relate at length in the precede volume of this series the bird boy or the young sky pilot ' first air voyage and have create a ten day ' sensation in the quiet little lake town of bloomsbury two rogue have rob the extensive jewelry establishment of mr leffingwell and carry off the loot in a couple of suit case take from the store unable to get clear away on account of a quick chase they have hide in the vicinity of the town one of they name jule have be a aviator at some time in he near past over in france and learn that the bird boy have build a monoplane which be even then ready for a flight they have attempt to steal the same with the intention of give they pursuer who be hunting the wood for they the laugh but they well lay plan be spoil through the vigilance of the bird boy and the quick wit of frank in particular the consequence be that both man be eventually capture by chief waller and he officer and still languish in the town lock-up await the day of trial oh well laugh frank as he cousin wheel he bike out to the front gate where he could mount better it make mighty little difference because from what i have see of shea i imagine he sleep on he post i be glad we do not let he inside because like all irishman he be fond of he pipe and might have set fire to the shed it be dangerous smoking where there be a lot of gasoline about of course we have get that puss carberry and he mean crony sandy hollingshead to consider they try to injure we machine once and might again especially after what happen today say andy throw one leg over he saddle and standing there a minute oh i guess not andy they understand that we be keep tab of that hangar with its precious contents besides they have get they hand full of other matter if what puss say about that big trip to the amazon country be true the other sigh i only wish i be as sure of go down there as puss seem to be he observe i do not know how it be but something queer seem to be draw I that way day and night i have picture rise in my mind i have read every scrap concern the isthmus and northern coast of south america until i guess i be as well post on such thing as one who have be there yes say frank softly and i be afraid you let you mind dwell too much on that subject old chum it be more than a year now since you father disappear and the chance of you ever find what become of he be like search for a lose diamond in the sand of the seashore it be affect you mind andy you look all fag out i wish you could cheer up and be something like you old self but the other only shake he head sadly i do not believe i ever can frank until i have have my chance to go down there and make a good try to find all that be leave of my poor father just as you say it seem almost silly to think that i could ever succeed but no matter i have get it arrange in my mind and the colonel be come around slowly well frank hasten to declare you know if it ever do get to the point that you do go down to make that search i be with you my father would never throw any obstacle in the way i be dead sure and andy of course we would take we aeroplane along think how many trip we could make in she over country that no one could ever penetrate on foot andy be too full for further word he simply turn and squeeze the hand of he cousin but the look of affection which he give frank tell what be in he mind just then frank watch he go spin along the road and then with a sigh turn into the house the day have be replete with excitement for he first there be the keenly contest game with they rival across the lake and a tie in the ninth inning which give the bloomsbury boy a chance to win out in the tenth he pitching have hold the enemy safe and in they half of the inning frank have make the hit that bring the game to a conclusion as a rule the home club take the last chance at the bat but the cranford manager have choose differently on this occasion for some reason of he own and with disastrous result then on the way home have come that little diversion aboard the launch when he old enemy puss carberry in attempt to strike he have miscalculate and go plunge into the lake himself be unable to swim frank have nothing to regret in connection with he leap after the struggle lad and he subsequent saving of puss true the latter choose to crush down the natural spirit of gratitude that should have make he accept the hand frank offer later but frank feel that he could afford to smile at such a exhibition of a small nature at the supper table he father and janet he sister just home from board school a couple of week back ply he with question concern the game of course the girl have be present and have see she brother carry off the honor on the diamond but there be lot of thing she want explain and before frank know it he be ask point blank what have happen on the way across the lake for janet have be aboard another boat it seem marjorie lee tell I she hear that you jump overboard to save some one she do not just know who be what janet say and the good doctor prick up he ear as he look inquiringly toward the boy of whom he be so proud frank turn red and then laugh oh pshaw he say i have hope that would be keep quiet but some of the fellow like to talk too much who be it you jump over after they say you hold he up until the boat get around -- that he could not swim a stroke and must surely have drown only for you prompt action it could not have be cousin andy because he can swim nearly as well as you tell we frank janet persist so frank find himself compel to relate the whole circumstance in he usual generous manner he try to gloss over the conduct of puss and speak as though the other have tumble overboard during a little boyish roughhouse business but janet know of the enmity between the pair and she could read between the line frank spend a couple of hour after supper in pore over a book andy have loan he and it might easily be assume that it have to do with the bird animal fauna and inhabitant of that great country lie north of the equator down in central and south america it be about nine o'clock when he father call to he the doctor have just come in from a few last visit and look anxious frank i be in a peck of trouble he say with a whimsical smile and i wish you could help I out though i dislike put you to so much trouble oh do not mind that dad one little bit you know i be only too glad to be of any assistance to you what be go wrong now machine lay off again and garage close but you will not need it till nine tomorrow will you there be a world of affection in the very way frank use that word dad it might seem disrespectful come from the lip of many boy but to the ear of the good doctor it be as sweetest music that be the trouble frank i do need some means of get around tonight the worst kind fact be the car break down just as i get it in the yard same old trouble and will take a hour to fix it up and all at once it dawn on I that i have forget to take the medicine out to farmer lovejoy which i surely promise tonight it lie under the seat of the machine slip my mind entirely when i be out and frank there may be a serious turn to that child 's sickness unless that medicine get there within the next hour or so do not say another word dad declare frank jump up and get he cap my wheel be in fine shape and with a good lantern i can make the run in a jiffy only too glad to be able to help out the packet be under the seat in the car and you leave that in the side yard all right i be off chapter iv a startling discovery it do not take frank many minute to get start on he little trip as he have say he wheel be in good shape with neither tire need any pump up and even he acetylene headlight have only to be attach which task take but a short time i declare he exclaim as he rest he wheel against the gate and turn back that would have be a rough joke on I if i would go spin off and only remember after i would almost get there that i forget to take the package of medicine out of dad 's little runabout so much for have my brain full of that wonderful scheme of andy 's he find the medicine and as the packet turn out to be small enough to be stow away in one of he coat pocket frank so disposed of it then wheeling he machine out into the road he take a last look at the lantern to see that the water might not be drip on the carbide too rapidly to combine the greatest efficiency after that he swing into the saddle start off with the perfect freedom that proclaim the rider a master of he wheel once he pass out of town frank make good progress he have a ride of several mile before he ere he could expect to reach the farmhouse of jason lovejoy one of he father 's oldest customer and friend there be no help from the moon because the sky have cloud up and screen the young queen of the sky but frank need no other light than the brilliant glow that spread out along the road ahead of he come from he lamp it happen that he pass the home of colonel josiah whymper the retired and lame traveler in whose care andy have be leave by the will which he father have make before start on what have prove he last air voyage guess andy 's go to bed he muse as he see the house wrap in darkness for it be now after half past nine frank cast a glance back toward the big field where the shed stand in which the great little monoplane in which they have win they victory during old home week be store but he could just barely make it out owe to the distance and the faint light of the moon come through the cloud naturally the heart of both lad go out toward the gallant aircraft which have answer every call make upon it for speed and endurance it be equip with a engine of the latest make weigh only a third as much as the average aeroplane motor and a triumph of modern scientific discovery since the bird boy have construct that monoplane themselves after pattern obtain elsewhere surely they have reason to be proud of they work and the gallant victory which have come to they frank pedal on think nothing of the trip he be accustom to be abroad at night with he wheel and indeed have take many a twenty-mile run by the light of he lamp alone what be there to fear bloomsbury be a peaceful community rarely do anything occur to indicate that a spirit of lawlessness be abroad occasionally the police have some trouble with wander tramp but chief waller 's strong point seem to lie in that direction and as a rule hobo give bloomsbury a wide berth the word have go out that they make straggler _ work _ when catch there and nothing could be more horrible in the eye of these wander willie after pass andy 's home it be not more than twelve minute before frank find himself approach the quiet farmhouse where he be to leave the medicine the doctor have tell he to ask a number of question with regard to the little sufferer and frank be well enough up in medicine to know what to say when he learn how matter be go a big watchdog boom he hoarse bark upon the night air as frank drop off he wheel at the gate where the mail box be fasten hello kaiser good dog do not you know I old fellow come here and be friend kaiser it be all right i be come in frank know how to use a wheedling voice that a dog instantly recognize as belong to a friend besides instinct doubtless tell kaiser that any one who have evil intention would come sneak around and not in this bold fashion at any rate the big mastiff begin to wag he tail and

toward home after all this six or seven-mile run be only a good touch of exercise and he would sleep all the sounder on account of it besides frank loved nothing better than to do something for the parent who all he life have be so indulgent to he as he pedal along keep he eye well ahead so as to glimpse any vehicle that might loom up in he path he be think of what andy have in mind while the project be as yet rather uncertain frank seem to feel that he cousin could never be wholly satisfied that he have do he duty by he father until he have spend some time down on the isthmus try to get some trace of the lose aeronaut i reckon i ought to know something of andy 's persistence he say to himself with a chuckle and now that he be get this bee in he bonnet there 'll be no peace until he try the scheme out sure i be with he from the word go it make I shiver all over with expectation just to think of what glorious time we two chum might have -- hello there be something ahead and i would better slow up it prove to be a farm wagon pull by two tired nag and head for home after a day in the town market the driver be asleep on the seat leave to the sagacity of he animal the successful navigation of the road perhaps some movement of the horse or else the bright light of the acetylene headlight fall on he face arouse the man for he sit up as frank be about pass hello be that you frank bird he ask lean forward to look closer at the rider of the bicycle sure just be up to you neighbor 's lovejoy 's with some medicine for he sue return the boy recognize the farmer how be the gal gettin ' on call the other over the canvas top of he seat fine no danger dad say answer frank that be good he hear the sympathetic neighbor remark as he move on five minute later and frank once more find himself approach the whymper place as before the house be in complete darkness as if the inmate be long since abed frank know that the old man keep early hour seldom sit up for he read much during the day have nothing else to look after then as be only natural the eye of the bicycle boy turn once again with more or less affection toward the quarter where he could just dimly make out the long squat shed out in the field in which the precious monoplane be store as he do so frank utter a exclamation of surprise why there be a light over by the hangar he burst out now what under the sun do you suppose that old fool of a shea can be do oh my look at the flame jump up why as sure as you live i believe the shed 's afire and i can see the figure of a man move about this be no accident but something worse and it look as if the little ` bug ' might be go up in smoke in a jiffy unless i can sprawl over the fence here and get on the spot mighty quick chapter v a warm five minute fire fire so frank shout even as he jump over the fence and make a bee line for the center of the big field where the shed lay in which the precious monoplane be store he have hastily lean he bicycle against the fence as he make the plunge nor do he cease to let out constant yell while run across the open as fast as he agile leg could carry he twice he trip over some object and nearly fall only to recover himself and speed on as he run he keep he eye upon the low building beyond in this manner he plainly see the stoop figure of a man or boy make off in a roundabout way so as to avoid he frank 's heart be burn with indignation because of this dastardly attempt to ruin the gallant little airship that have so nobly stand all test and prove itself a splendid piece of workmanship oh the contemptible coward i would just like to chase after he and get my hand on he once be the thought that pass through he brain but he know he could not the scoundrel no matter who it be must be allow to escape in order that he turn he attention to the burning shed and try to save the airship from destruction once the fire get inside there be enough of the dangerous gasoline about to insure the speedy burning of the whole flimsy fabric all but the motor itself so frank keep head straight for the hangar try to shut out the sight of that crouch flee figure he continue to lift he sturdy young voice in repeat shout : fire fire those in the house must hear yes and the neighbor too he might not be able to master the flame alone and single handed and would need help besides it be only right that andy be part owner in the monoplane should be make aware of its sudden peril as he thus draw near the low building he see that the fire have already gain considerable headway just as if the incendiary might have use kerosene or some other inflammable fluid to hasten matter frank 's heart grow cold as ice as he contemplate the rapidity with which those hungry flame be crawl up the dry board that constitute the side of the shed but he do not lose he head in this sudden crisis it be characteristic of frank bird that no matter what the emergency he be always cool enough to think out the proper thing to be do or else jump at it through instinct and frank have foresee just some such possible need as this he even keep several bucket of moist sand handy where it could be snatch up at a second 's warning know that most fire can be smother when quench they with water be out of the question the bucket he gasp as he arrive close to the building one part of which be now fairly cover with the creep tongue of ruddy fire i must use they on it he have to turn the corner of the shed to get to where they stand and as he do so he run plump into a figure that be come toward he just in time do frank dodge a big fist that shoot out and in that second he recognize in the other shea the irishman who have be hire to keep watch of the shed hold on shea shout frank it be I frank bird somebody have set fire to the shed grab up a bucket of sand and carry it around here we can put it out yet if we be busy shea have evidently only be arouse from a sound sleep by the approach cry of the boy and be still in a daze he have discover the fire and hearing frank run toward he suppose that this must be the one who have do the evil deed but he have sense enough to do as he be tell now snatch up one of the sand bucket and follow the boy frank immediately commence fight the flame with a vim he slap the wet sand at the creep fire and wherever it strike there seem to come a quick abatement of the conflagration but it be by this time so extend that as fast as he succeed in knock it out in one place it crop up afresh somewhere else he ammunition would not last if this keep up get busy shea he cry find something and slap at the fire for all you be worth fight it man fight it as frank happen to turn he head to learn what the other be do he see something that make very little impression on he mind just then but which have considerable bearing on the matter later a light be speed along the road head away from town and frank realize that the firebug have seize upon he convenient wheel and be make he escape later on he might figure out the meaning of this movement just then he really have no time to give it a think no matter if a dozen wheel be concern the fire demand every atom of he attention shea do get busy once he become stir up and he prove a valuable helper he go for the flame tooth and nail smother they with he coat regardless of consequence after he have slip that article of wear apparel off kick and tear and fight until it become evident that between they they be certainly make a decide impression on the threatening conflagration all this while it seem to frank that he heart be in he throat not so much because he fear that they would fail to gain the mastery over the fire as that some spark might find ingress to the shed and happen to alight upon a can of the dangerous gasoline if such a thing occur he know that it would be all over the hangar must be completely destroy and of course they little darling airship would share in its fate so even though he see the end of the conflagration in sight frank know he have no reason to breathe easily until every spark have be trample under foot by now he be conscious of loud shout come from point near at hand and realize that doubtless andy as well as other have be awaken by the racket and be come on the run to assist have the safety of the airship depend on they reach the shed in time though its chance would have be next to nothing frank be just stamp on what seem to be the very last vestige of the fire when andy come gallop to he side w-what 's all this mean frank where in the wide world do you come from and who set we hangar afire he gasp almost wind from he exertion for he have dress in about a minute despite he tremble finger and be barefoot even then do not know who do it but he run off on my wheel a few minute ago i be on the way home -- carry medicine to susie lovejoy see flame and give alarm get here on the jump and we manage to get the better of it but it be a close shave all right i tell you andy frank himself have no breath to spare nor could it be wonder at consider the recent valiant fight which he have make against big odds so the ornery skunks _ do _ try to burn we out after all burst forth the other part owner of the monoplane bitterly say where be shea all this time what use be he as a watchman he help I good and hard at any rate only for shea i would never have get the better of it i be afraid say frank always ready to cover up any little fail on the part of another though never hesitate to denounce he own shortcoming but just to think of the meanness of it all continue andy shake he head in the aggressive way he have that puss carberry ought to be shut up behind bar that be my opinion straight from the shoulder and if i could only find out for sure that he be in this i would get colonel josiah to prosecute he to the limit but we have no proof that it be puss remark frank the fellow who steal my wheel go off along the road _ away _ from town and he go licketty split too as if he have business over in shelby or newtown perhaps it be only a hobo he may have start the fire by accident and be try to put it out when i see he first then when i shout of course he have to scoot what be this demand andy kick some object and then seize hold of he foot for he have forget that he have no shoe on frank utter a cry and pick it up look here do not you recognize this he ask as he hold a can up it be andy 's turn to give vent to a low exclamation why it be we kerosene can frank he say that be what i think and it be keep on a bench just outside the kitchen door be not it demand the other quickly that be a fact and neither of we ever bring it here shea do you ever see this oil can before and andy dangle it before the eye of the watchman who have sleep on he post i niver do the same sor reply the man as he survey the can then that settle it frank the mean skunk grab that can and fetch it over here to spray the wall of the shed with oil and make the fire jump true as you live say the other do you know i think i smell burn kerosene and that be why the flame keep crawl up everywhere so fast well it be a good job that we save the place and be not i glad i do not wait just five minute longer at lovejoy 's place nothing could have help then and we would just have to build another airship but here come the colonel stump along andy chapter vi in search of a clue heigho what be all this fuss and feather about demand the old retired traveler as he come limp along with he crutch and cane several neighbor accompany he have be arouse by the clamor same old story sir remark the disgusted andy still clutch he bruised toe tenderly they have be try to beat we one way if they could not another frank give he a nudge be careful what you say andy he remark there be no proof as yet that any one we know have a hand in this business you may get in trouble if you mention name offhand go slow now we 'll find out the truth later on perhaps so andy take heed manage to tell what have happen without directly accuse any one nevertheless it be not difficult for those who listen to guess where he suspicion lay and perhaps they think after all that have occur in the past with the hand of puss carberry move the piece on the chessboard that andy be justify in believe as he do after a while the excitement die away the boy have open the shed and make sure that no linger spark remain to threaten they beloved little aeroplane with destruction but it be all right and they feast they eye on it as if they never before realize how precious it have become get to be a regular thing seem to I these night alarm boy remark one of the neighbor for not long before they have be arouse in the middle of the night when the two jewelry thief try to steal the aeroplane and be baffle in they design by the two boy sleep at the time in the shed so as to guard they fly machine if one watchman be not enough i 'll get three -- half a dozen if necessary declare colonel josiah as he glare at the offend shea and pound on the turf with he heavy cane but these lad be go to be protect if it take my last dollar i 'll get a gatle gun and train it here so we can blow the rascal to smithereens if they try such a dastardly job again but everybody know that the genial old colonel do considerable talking and bluster but be harmless withal shea promise to remain awake the balance of the night he even go to the house and armed himself with a big horse pistol that the colonel own and which have many a story connect with its keep company with the traveler in foreign land huh i have get half a notion to camp right here again like we do that other time frank say andy before they lock the wide door of the shed here 's my cot and blanket you see just as i leave 'em no need of that andy return he chum smile after all this rumpus you could not hire that fellow to come back here tonight he may be ten mile away by now wonder if that be the last i 'll see of my wheel now continue andy if you be address that to I i would like to prophesy that you 'll find the bike somewhere off the road a mile or two away where the fellow pitch it when he conclude to make a sneak _ back _ to town there you go bark up that same tree again i never see such a positive fellow as you be declare the other smile you name ought to be thoma for you seem to doubt everything that you can not just understand well if not puss who then demand andy aggressively i confess that i do not know at this minute admit frank but i hope to discover the truth in some way remember how that other time when some one try to injure we by sneak in here and cut the canvas wing of we monoplane all to flinder i pick up a playing card and we afterwards trace it to the owner yes cry the other instantly and be not that party puss carberry all right it sure be laugh frank but forget this thing for now perhaps tomorrow we may be able to find some clue that will tell which way the wind blow -- it might be the print of a shoe in the earth or something like that lot of way to pick up information if only you keep you wit at work yes return andy and if it be frank bird who be do the thinking but perhaps it would be silly in I sleep out here tonight i would better be traipse back to bed right now because you see i be only half dress and it be chilly good i 'll see you to the house because i have get to walk home now that my wheel have go up the flume remark frank what be the matter with you use mine demand the other that plug you put in hold dandy and there be nothing the matter with it right now same old place under the side porch here guess the lamp be on the bum but you hardly need that if a cop hold you up explain what happen all right i guess i might as well ride as walk but i hope i get my wheel back it be nearly new you know and cost a heap frank remark as he dive under the stoop to presently appear drag the other bicycle apply to puss and company for further information call andy hold the door open a crack to shoot the word out and then close it frank laughing at the obstinate way of he chum push the machine out to the road and be soon move along evidently he lack the same confidence in andy 's wheel that he feel in he own for he make no attempt to speed as he go toward town and home fortunately he meet no policeman who might ask impertinent question as to just why he be ride after dark without a light and reach home he find he father sit up in he office wait to hear he report dr bird be quite satisfied with what frank have to say in regard to the condition of the sick girl he know that the boy be well up in medicine even though he have never try to push he in the least frank give evidence of be what be know as a natural bear doctor keenly alive to everything pertain to surgery more than once he have set broken limb for dog and cat and do it in a manner that arouse the warmest praise from he father who deep down in he heart know the boy have it in he to become a famous surgeon if he keep along in this path when he come to take up he life pursuit frank believe he ought to tell about the dastardly attempt to destroy the monoplane and of course the good doctor who always think the best of people be horrify to hear he story he shake he head sadly after frank have finish i do not know what people be come to nowadays he remark no matter who do that mean act it be wicked man or boy he ought to be severely punish for it the rights of property seem to be get less respect every year it puzzle I to lay the blame for this spirit at the right door but thing be not so in my young day frank we live in fast time my boy fast time frank think so himself as he go off to he room imagine he father some forty year ago ever dream of build a air-ship and speeding through the upper current perhaps thousand of foot above the earth at the rate of a mile a minute and yet that be what he and andy have be do think nothing of the feat as they become accustomed to its performance fast time indeed frank do not allow the startling incident of the night to keep he awake he know just how to get a grip on himself and put all these thing out of he mind once he head touch the pillow time enough in the morning to begin worry about that lose wheel and try to figure out who the firebug could have be at breakfast frank have to go over the whole story again for the benefit of janet who have hear enough about it from the doctor before she brother come down to whet she appetite for more frank could see that she share the suspicion entertain by andy janet know puss carberry of old and despise he most heartily at one time he have take a great liking to frank 's pretty sister but when she learn what he nature be janet have cut he dead on the street and from that day on she have believe puss capable of almost anything even after you save he life yesterday too she exclaim indignantly hold on there sis cry frank laughing you be as bad as andy who be ready to condemn on general principle we have not get a scrap of evidence to prove puss guilty just as like as not he would show a _ alibi _ if we accuse he of it and prove that he be at home all evening so please do not mention he name to anybody or i may get in a scrape but you be go to find out be not you demand janet i surely hope to and recover my poor bike in the bargain luckily i have get my name and address scratch on the underpart of the frame if the finder only take the trouble to look and now i be off downtown to speak to chief waller about it ten minute later frank drop off in front of police headquarters and no sooner have he alight than the lad discover that there be a buzz of excitement about the place for several man be confer and the chief himself seem disturbed he look eagerly at frank as the boy come forward and start to relate what have occur on the precede night out near the residence of colonel josiah whymper immediately the face of the chief begin to light up and a eager glow shine in he eye it seem as though what frank be tell must have give he a connect link that he have find himself badly in need of now we know where he go he exclaim call to one of he man go out to colonel josiah whymper ' green and see what trace you can get of he then once more turn to the astonished boy he go on : you see we have a jail delivery here last night a desperate scoundrel manage to slip away undetected and we only find it out this morning and the man who get out be you old friend jule garrone the french aviator who be catch by the help of the bird boy and they bully little aeroplane get that frank chapter vii andy receive a shock then it be jule who set fire to we shed exclaim the boy astounded none other you may be sure reply chief waller nod he head and make off on my wheel continue frank begin to grasp the truth that be just what he do go on the official find he could not steal you aeroplane and be bind to lay he hand on something belong to the bird that would carry he out of danger glad you come frank i 'll just call up all the surround town and ask if a bicyclist have be see there i hope you can describe the wheel so they might know it yes i even know the number besides i have get my address scratch on the under-part of the frame but whatever do you suppose jule want to set we hangar on fire for frank ask huh reply the chief do not know unless it be a spirit of revenge some of these french rascal have the same nature as the corsican or the sicilian and hug the idea of revenge to they heart revenge frank cried but when do we ever injure they oh yes i forget we chase they off at the time they try to steal we aeroplane and they even neglect to take those two suit case of jewelry with they so the steal property be recover yes the chief go on and that be not all either remember that it be you bird boy who discover that they be hide in the old shack deep in the forest you see they near there when you be sail over that region in you airship and report to I and so we surround the cabin and nab we game it may be they learn who give they away and jule on find himself at large make up he mind to get even before run off turn to the phone on he desk the chief now start to call up several of the neighbor town some be only six or eight mile away while other might be double that and more frank know where the road run that pass the whymper place and when finally the police head get shelby he prick up he ear immediately he see chief waller show sign of sudden interest a smile creep over he face as though he be hear news that pleased he then he engage in a hurry conversation with the police official at the other end of the wire after which he turn to frank i think i have located you wheel frank he observe over at shelby you mean query the other the chief nod in the affirmative yes over at shelby he say it seem that early this morning a wagon belong to a countryman come in to market be stop by something lie on the road get down the farmer find that it be a man badly injure as if he have take a header from a wheel and indeed a bicycle be find close by with some part of it damage as if it have be run at full speed against a rock send the rider ten foot away where he land on he head and be knock out be it my wheel ask frank he describe it for the farmer bring both man and wheel to police headquarters and there can be no doubt but that it be yours and the unfortunate rider answer to jule now i be go to get a automobile at the garage and go over if you want to go along i would be glad to have you frank i certainly would reply the boy quickly i hope the poor fellow do not go so far as to break he neck but let I go after a machine for you chief i have get a errand at the garage anyhow as my dad want a mechanic send up to potter at he little runabout out of commission as usual he be order a better car you know and be only wait for it to be deliver shall i go yes tuttle will know which machine i generally use when on official business for you see the town pay the bill be back as soon as you can frank yes sir reply the other hasten away the mystery be now solve and after all puss have be prove innocent on this last count frank laugh to think how amaze andy would likely be when he hear the news i only hope he do not happen to run across puss before i get a chance to open he eye he be say to himself as he head for the nearby garage because i really believe andy be mad enough to challenge we old enemy and throw the accusation in he tooth then there would be a high old mix-up with puss in the right for once it do not take he long to deliver both message he see a mechanic start off to tackle the disabled runabout for the doctor so he could carry out he round of morning visit by ten o'clock and then a chauffeur run a car out of the garage into which he invite frank to jump when they arrive at police headquarters the chief be await they evidently he be not at all averse to this delightful spin across country on a fine July morning and with nothing to pay official business might sometimes prove worth cultivate presently they be off frank of course know every rod of the way he have more than a few time make the trip over to shelby on he wheel in company with andy and since they have take to the air they have look down upon that road for mile as they whirl along hundred of foot up discover feature about the landscape that they have never dream of before they have this bird 's - eye view as andy delighted to call it play upon they own name in due time they reach shelby and draw up in front of the building where the police hold forth the first one to meet they eye as they enter be a familiar figure seat in a chair and attend by a doctor and a couple of officer it be jule sure enough say frank as despite the many bandage about the head of the man he recognize the dapper little french aviator with whom he have have more or less trouble in the past and jule grin as he see they he spirit be not crush even though it begin to look as though he might be the football of fate it ee ze fortune of war messier he say wince at the pain speech cause he and after all it be ze machine of ze young inventor zat down I i be von lucky man not to haf be five thousand foot up in ze air when it occur have eet be ze monoplane zat kick I pouf poor jule he would haf be as flat as ze pancake as eet be after i haf serve my time i be yet alive frank find he bicycle badly damage in fact the front wheel be smash beyond recovery for it have be drive against some stone at a tremendous pace strange to say the lamp have go through it all without any apparent damage a few dollar will fix it up all right he say cheerfully and i guess i ought to be thankful ever to see it again so he place the wheel in the back of the big touring car the doctor announce that jule might be move without danger if they be careful and this chief waller promise he would be you be give we a heap of bother jule he say after the capture rascal have be safety stow away in the tonneau of the car with the chief beside he and frank mount to the front with the chauffeur but this wind you up i understand you trial come off tomorrow and you 'll soon be snug in the pen zat be ze knowledge zat urge I to break out remark the prisoner blandly well remark the other with a tightening of he lip we 'll make sure you do not get another opportunity that be all frank watch as they draw near the place of colonel josiah he anticipate that the prisoner would be eager to look across the field to where the shed stand nor be frank surprised to hear he give a low cry eet be wonderful ze luck zey haf jule remark as he discover that the hangar have not burn to the ground as he expect and after that he relapse into gloomy silence frank have catch sight of andy pass along the street ahead and enter the bloomsbury postoffice so as soon as he could get he broken wheel into the bicycle store where he leave order for its be fix at once he hurry off in hope of intercept he cousin and break the great news he be just in time to see andy come out of the building and stare hard at something he hold in he hand frank could see that it be a letter and he also notice that he chum be unusually pale now i wonder what he be get ask frank talk to himself as many boy often do at time look like a letter too once in a while the colonel ask he to go down when the mail come in and see if there be a important one for he which he can not wait for the carrier to bring out and andy have get one this time sure a moment later and he come upon andy who at sight of he chum show sign of relief i be awful glad you come along frank he say seize the other by the sleeve i be at you house and they tell I you have go downtown somewhere then as the mail be in i remember colonel josiah be expect one of he letter from london and so i drop over but there be nothing for he mr guthrie hand I out this and say he guess it be for I oh look where it be from frank do you think -- can it be possible that it mean some news after all this time from my father frank see it be rather a bulky letter and that the postmark show a station in south america remember all that have pass between they in connection with this country he understand the cause of andy 's great emotion i be almost afraid to open it frank say the other brokenly well do it now remark frank and andy tear the end off hurriedly he appear to read hungrily for a minute and then give a cry of amazement oh he say take in a big breath how strange how wonderful chapter viii the message frank bird could restrain he curiosity no longer what be it andy he ask as he lay a affectionate arm across the shoulder of he cousin the other turn he eye upon frank and there be something in they depths that stir the other tremendously be it about you father andy he demand eagerness plainly show in he whole manner for he understand what a hold the subject have on he chum andy nod and as soon as he could command he quiver voice say : yes nothing more than a letter from the grave i fear see frank write in he own dear hand oh to think of it that at least three month ago he be alive even though a prisoner the sport of fate a prisoner echo frank astonished whatever can you mean do he fall into the hand of some of those strange indian we have be read about who have they home around the headwater of the orinoco river in venezuelum this time andy shake he head in the negative it be stranger than that -- almost beyond belief he reply my poor father have for month be imprison in a great valley surround by impassable cliff do not you remember something of the sort occur in one of captain mayne reid 's book where the young plant hunter find themselves prisoner in that way but here frank look for yourself where do the letter come from in the begin ask the other quietly wish to advance by slow degree so that he could understand everything a town in columbium call barranquilum reply andy readily enough i be not sure but i think it lie at the mouth of the big magdalena river and be upon the coast you know i have just devour the map of that region for month and every name be familiar to I besides this queer communication which you say be from you father frank go on there seem to be another letter that be from seor jos almirez read it frank and you will begin to understand the letter be in a crabbed hand apparently unused to write in english though grammatically correct and this be what frank saw : to seor andrew bird : i receive the enclose from a correspondent and customer one carlo mendoza located in the vicinity of manangue a town about one hundred and fifty mile up-river he be a grower of cocoa in the rich valley i do not enclose he letter because it be write in spanish but it simply say that he find the write communication close to he plantation house one morning in April of this year at first he could not understand how it come there then upon have the write translate he notice that the missive be attach to what seem to be a little parachute or balloon make up of a fragment of silk belong to a balloon know that i have spend several year in washington in the service of my country he finally conclude to send the same to I i have the honor to transmit it to the address give in the communication with respect and express a willingness to help you all i may seor andrew bird believe I to be most sincerely yours jos costilena almirez frank read this amazing communication and then turn to stare at he cousin no do not stop yet exclaim the tremble andy read the other the missive that carlo mendoza pick up on he cocoa plantation in the valley of the magdalena river and so frank again turn he attention to the enclosure that have be send on by the friendly merchant of columbium it seem to be a sheet of thin but pliable bark from a tree and in some respects remind frank of birch bark which he have often use in lieu of paper when in the wood the juice of some berry have afford ink and doubtless the college professor have easily make a pen from a bird 's quill and this be what frank read a small portion of the communication be miss as though it have receive rough usage somewhere en route : whoever find this i pray that it be forward to andrew bird in the town of bloomsbury state of new york u s a in my balloon i be carry away by a sudden storm while cross the isthmus of panama as near as i can calculate i be sweep some three hundred mile more or less in a south-easterly direction much of the time above the cloud then something happen and i feel myself fall give myself up for lose i awake from a swoon to find myself in the branch of a tree with the wreck of the balloon near I a merciful providence have save my life but i fear only to prolong my agony of soul for month now i have be a prisoner in a remarkable valley a sink-pit enclose by inaccessible cliff many time have i struggle to climb to they top but only to meet defeat all this time i have sustain life by means of fruit that grow in abundance in this tropical valley in the hope that i may manage to communicate my horrible condition to the outside world i have make score of small parachute and when the breeze at the top of the cliff appear favorable send they up by means of hot air each carry a message to my son god in he infinite wisdom only know if one of these will ever reach he i shall continue to have hope and sustain life as long as my mind remain -- professor philip b -- when he have finish this astonishing document frank turn to he chum oh what a remarkable thing i never hear its equal in all my life to think that you father have be alive all these month though a prisoner in that cliff-bordered valley but andy do not you see that now nothing be go to keep we from go down there and find he here be the clue you want only instead of discover he sad fate you be go to rescue he and bring he home again they reach out and grip hand there be something in that act to stamp the more than brotherly feeling exist between they do you think we could do it frank exclaimed andy more than ever willing that he clear-eyed chum should take the lead in this most eventful moment of he whole young life sure i do answer the comforter readily do not we conquer one battery of cliff that be say to be insurmountable when we sail in we dandy little monoplane up to the crown of old thunder top and snatch that silver cup for a prize make up you mind my boy that that be just mean to get we in practice for better thing the time 's come for we to show what we be make of and instead of a silver cup the prize this time will be -- my father 's life murmur andy tear in he eye as he again squeeze that faithful hand which hold he so firmly that be right frank continue we can go straight to this fine spanish gentleman seor almirez and get all the point he know from there we 'll get up-river to this valley town and visit carlo mendozo on he cocoa plantation depend on it he 'll be able to set we on the track somehow or other oh it seem like a strange dream say andy as he raise the piece of bark to he young lip and passionately kiss it regardless of the fact that some one pass the post office might notice he well you want to wake up right away then remark frank smile because we have just get to get a hustle on we if we be go to start on this wonderful trip here 's where we aeroplane be go to help we out just imagine how we can pass over region where it would be next to impossible for we to navigate on foot -- mountainous country tropical valley where wild beast roam and poisonous snake abound and jungle where the native have to cut a passage foot by foot i understand with they _ machete _ and to think that we can sail freely over it all look for that spot where that bark letter come from come let 's go home exclaim andy i be sure colonel josiah will be tremendously interested in what we have learn he 'll be the most disappointed man in the whole we just because he be so cripple that he can not go along for many year he be travel in every country under the sun perhaps he might tell we more about the interior of colombium than we know right now accordingly they hurry away frank come near forget the news he have be bear at the time he meet he cousin but then that be hardly to be wonder at the capture of the escape robber be of minor importance when compare with this wonderful business connect with professor bird and just as andy have say colonel josiah _ be _ tremendously interested when he hear about it and with he own eye look upon the letter that have come from a living tomb somebody pinch I he say look at the boy almost helplessly i surely must be asleep and dream this it seem too strange to be true philip alive all these month and in that terrible situation while we be enjoy the good thing of the world up here it be monstrous you must go down there with as little delay as possible andrew who know but what it may be you bless good fortune to rescue you dear father and bring he back with you money -- all you need and the prayer of a old man go with you but think say andy uneasily this be write three month ago what may not have happen in all that time there must be beast in that sunken valley and doubtless many poisonous reptile perhaps -- hold on cry frank interrupt he do not you go to imagine all sort of terrible thing he have be there at least nine month already nothing have happen to injure he he do not even hint at such a thing but say he mean to sustain he life as long as he retain he proper mind you father be not in the least like you andy he possess a wonderfully well-poised mind and lay out he plan with deliberation believe I the chance be ten to one he be still there and wait we be go to find he do not allow any other idea to take possession of you head find he do you hear of course that sort of talk have its effect on andy and he brace up they begin to make preparation and plan without delay the monoplane be take apart and carefully crate then frank run down to the city and return with several duplicate part secure at a aeroplane agency he know of and which would come in handy in case of a accident in that strange country where they must depend entirely on themselves for two day there be a tremendous lot of bustle around both home dr bird have no longer any valid excuse for refuse frank permission to go since it be a mission of mercy that beckon the boy on to that south american mountainous region besides he have always be very fond of he elder brother who have do so much to make the name of bird famous in college and out even though the professor have think best to make he old friend colonel josiah he boy 's guardian instead of the physician the aeroplane have be ship to new york to be put upon a steamer sailing for maracaibo in venezuelum and which they expect to take also from this port they would have to make they way to the mouth of the magdalena river by means of some smaller craft but with virtually unlimited means to back they the boy do not fear but that they could overcome any difficulty that might arise in they path indeed frank have a disposition that would never allow anything to balk he plan if it be at all within the power of human nature to accomplish result the last thing they hear just before leave bloomsbury be that puss carberry and he crony sandy hollingshead have go away take they biplane along and it be say that they expect to do wonderful stunt with they airship somewhere in the south but we two boy be too deeply interested in they own fortune to give more than a pass thought to the flitting of they rival besides it would not seem that there could be one chance in a thousand that they would ever run across puss and sandy in all that great country lie south of the caribbean sea and north of the mighty amazon and one morning frank and andy say goodbye to those whose best wish be waft after they take train to new york city so as to go aboard the steamer that be schedule to sail that pm chapter ix under troubled sky oh how glad i be to think we have arrive at last andy utter these word as he stand at the rail of a small but staunch steam yacht of rather ancient vintage that he and frank have lease when arrive at maracaibo the city on the bay of the same name from whence so much of venezuelum 's coffee be ship to the state it have belong to some englishman who become strand at this south american port while on a globe circle trip be force to let it go and the agent gladly secure a crew for the adventurous young american who be bind up the magdalena river for some unknown purpose yes observe frank who lean on the same rail close beside he there be the town of barranquilum all right we have navigate the five hundred mile in this little steam craft with only a few break-downs of the machinery and just two day ' delay and the second step on we journey come to a close the third ought to take we to that valley town up the river be not i right ask the anxious andy sure as near as i can make it magangue must be not over two hundred mile upstream with good luck we can cover that in a couple of day return frank but why do you say good luck demand he cousin suspiciously oh well we be now in the land of tomorrow you remember laugh frank you mean where they put off everything they can say ` no hurry plenty of time seors all the world be not make in a day ' be that it andy go on partly i be also think of another thing admit frank yes and i bet i can give a mighty good guess what it be old fellow perhaps you can frank say a little gravely suppose you spout it out you have be ponder on what old quito be tell we in he broken english about this little revolution that have be slumber around the region of the magdalena river of late you have a hunch that we may just be unlucky enough to run across some of those ragged chap who want to upset the present government of colombium and seat some old ex-president fossil in the chair again anyhow you be a fine guesser andy admit frank then that be what be on you mind ask the other i have notice you frown a whole lot lately which be unusual for my cheery pard frank oh well observe frank calmly i acknowledge the corn i be wonder whether we might be trouble by any of those fellow while we be navigate this river i hope they 'll just let we severely alone but you know andy just as colonel josiah warn we these colombian do not have any too much love for yankee ever since that panama rebellion when as they believe we government openly assist the people of the isthmus throw off the colombian yoke because we just have to control that strip of territory for the canal but why should the revolutionist want to stop we insist he cousin we be here only on a private quest we seek no gold mine or cocoa plantation we only object be a mission of mercy and besides if these man be in open rebellion they ought to be glad to see anybody that they government detest yankee or not well pursued frank with a cautious glance around i be think that some of the people in maracaibo take altogether too much interest in we little monoplane a lot of dark-faced man hover around and ask many question they have hear and read much about the wonderful thing be do today in aeronautics but have see little or nothing frank that be so exclaimed andy quickly please go on you be grip my attention a heap i admit tell I do you suspect that some of those same chap may have be colombian i be dead sure of it and more than that old quito give I to understand he believe they be connect with the junta that be push this new revolution in colombium yes andy say in a way that plainly invite further explanation stop and think frank continued suppose now they conceive the idea that it would further they forlorn cause a heap if they only have such a airship and could threaten to drop all sort of bomb into the camp of the government troops good gracious i suppose that be so i never think of that frank you know how nervous and excitable these people be do not you think they would give the government the worst scare it ever have and could not they make almost any sort of term of settlement frank demand yes that be true then you imagine those fellow may have plan to somehow steal we aeroplane and that they have send word ahead to they friend along the magdalena to look out for we be andy 's startling question partly that but do not you see andy the little monoplane would be utterly useless to they unless they have some one who know how to run it the other give utterance to a low whistle just to indicate how he feeling have be stir you mean they might try to capture _ we _ in the bargain and force we to operate the aeroplane but suppose we do what would hinder we just sail away once we get up in the cloud tell I that frank oh well i be not look that far ahead smile the other possibly they might only let one of we go up keep the other as a hostage or perhaps there might be a fearless revolutionist officer aboard with that one swear to shoot at the first sign of treachery but do not let we cross a bridge until we come to it that be right we do not want to fall into the hand of any ragtag revolutionist and we will not we have get we work lay out for we and nothing must stop we all the same i be go to keep a eye on that precious case in which we aeroplane be box as well as the engine and frank i be carry the little shooting-iron colonel josiah give I as a parting present ditto myself reply the other in a low tone as one of the crew happen to draw near while get ready to make a landing at the wharf he tell we that down in this country it pay to be ready for trouble though i keep hope we be not go to have anything of the sort it be toward noon when they steam up to the town that nestle near the mouth of the great magdalena river of course it be hot for the season of the year make that a foregone conclusion but both boy be dress in suitable attire and also wear pith helmet calculate to allow a current of air fan the head andy be shiver in a mixture between hope and fear in this city they would meet the writer of that pleasant letter seor jos almirez what if he have receive further intelligence from the correspondent up-river since the time he have mail that letter what if some terrible news await the come of the daring young yankee who have venture to this faraway country bent on solve the mystery connect with the long absence of professor bird but as usual it be frank who buoy he spirit up there never be a chum more devoted to the interest of he friend andy would long since have succumb to he fear but for the cheery word of the other it be say to be the rainy season in this country that lay in the tropics up on the high mountain peak lay snow the year around but in the low land and along the valley and side of the uplift they could grow coffee cocoa banana pineapple orange and all manner of similar product a small crowd gather at the wharf to see the little steam yacht come in perhaps the former english wander owner have be here before and some of they even recognize the vessel scowl greet she passenger when it be discover that they be not english but american frank and andy pay little heed to these frown they do not mean to leave the boat if so be it be possible to have seor almirez come aboard and for that purpose they have write to he ahead of time tell he how they expect to reach barranquilum about a certain date several breakdown of the engine have delay they so that they be even now two day behind time on this account as well as through prudence they mean to stop here as briefly as possible immediately they purser go ashore to make inquiry and purchase a lot of fruit that could be take on the river voyage though for that matter they might expect to get anything they want at various village along the route frank be look the crowd over closely i think i see he andy he remark presently you mean seor jos ask he cousin eagerly i have be watch that middle-aged gentleman who seem to be press close in on the flank of the crowd there see he be speak to manuel we purser now ask he some question he look up here at we yes and wave he hand with a smile that must be seor jos all right frank i be go down to meet he to fetch he aboard declare frank after both boy have answer the signal of the dark-faced gentleman in the white linen suit and who be also wear a panama straw hat three minute later and frank reappeared have the other in tow just as both of they have suspect it be seor jos receive they communication from maracaibo he have be on the watch and he tell I andy that there have be no new development since he write so that fear of yours must be set at rest just depend on it we be in this game to win out and you dear father be go to be find frank go on presently they be deep in conversation the boy find seor jos a very intelligent gentleman indeed he have spend some year in washington in connection with the embassy of he government so that he not only speak and write english well but have a high opinion of american something that the vast majority of he fellow-countryman fail to acquire be possibly feed on story that may have have they inception in german or english trade source from he frank extract all the information he could concern the wonderful country lie between magangue and the isthmus of panama cover possibly some three hundred mile it be little enough most of it he declare be a _ terra incognita _ be utterly unknown land but continue the oblige seor you will certainly be able to learn more concern this when you see my fellow-countryman seor mendoza for all he life have he live there at magangue and surely he must know something of that country to the south we shall leave here with as little delay as possible observe frank i have send we purser manuel to comply with the custom duty and secure we a few supplies when he come aboard again we expect to start it be just as well remark the other significantly and seem to be relieve because there be a uneasy feeling in barranquilum just at present agent of the revolutionary junta have be here they be very active and from secret source i happen to know that they be aware of the strange cargo you be bring with you you must mean we aeroplane seor remark frank quickly si seor bird the other continued nod he head it have become know that the two young americano be of the new and wonderful aeronaut with whom nothing be impossible and if you remain here any length of time i fear lest even my government might seek to find some excuse for appropriate you little airship the talk be all in that direction now colombia be ripe to take a forward step and have a aviation corps well say frank under the circumstance we would seriously object to have we monoplane confiscate now because upon it we depend wholly in we search but i think you be perhaps about to warn we to look out for these revolutionist while pass up the river it would be wise seor observe the amiable colombian ex-diplomat they have agent here and i happen to know that one be even now on the wharf observe possibly he seek to communicate with some spy who chance to be a member of you crew so you see it must pay you to be always on you guard and prepared chapter x nip in the bud there come manuel remark andy after they have be nearly a hour talk on the deck of the little power boat yes remark he cousin who be also on the watch and trail behind he i can see several native cart contain fruit and new supplies manuel surely mean that we shall not go hungry while on the river then i shall be go my friend say seor jos i have tell you all i know i have warn you to beware of the revolutionist along the river bank i have even give you a hint that to delay longer in barranquilum might endanger you enterprise since the government be just now very anxious to acquire such wonderful modern agent of warfare as you aeroplane it only remain to shake you hand both _ amigo _ and wish you every good fortune you valor deserve they squeeze the hand of the fine old colombian gentleman with vigor never would andy forget how he have speak concern he interest in the sacred duty that have bring the son of the miss aeronaut to he country frank have give strict order that none of the crew should go ashore and also that no stranger be permit to board the craft while they lay there at the old wooden wharf but say andy when they be speak about this matter as preparation begin to leave the port that have not prevent the crew from hold a animated confab with those ashore there have be a constant jabbering and laughing between we fellow and those other yes admit frank and i have see several of the crew talk mysteriously with some of those chap i wish now the seor have think to indicate which be the secret agent of the revolutionist he see on the dock but all the same i have mark the two fellow i suspect and i be go to keep a close eye on enrique and the little fellow with the quick motion we call ` cospita ' because he be forever ejaculate like that and if you find out that they be meddle with the box ask andy h be i guess it 'll be a bad day for enrique and the jumping-jack that be all laugh he cousin but there go the cable and it look like we might be off at last i be not sorry for many thing declare andy with a sigh of positive relief the good seor get I scare by what he say about he government want just such thing as we little ` bug ' and that the official might have order to find some sort of ridiculous excuse for grab it same here admit frank in fact that bother I a whole lot more than the chance of trouble along the river from the boy who want to get they man seat in the president 's chair where he could hand out the loaf and the fish we can resist they and be back by authority but if the government officer once take we in we would have to give up we job and that would break you heart andy yes say the other draw a long breath i be afraid it would listen there go the whistle i tell the pilot not to make more fuss than he could help when we draw out which be quite right i be watch that little chap cospita see he wave he hand to some one ashore yes and that surely look like a signal the fellow return we be go to have trouble with that boy yet andy well that will be bad for cospita be all the other remark for he be eagerly watch the grow space between the boat and the shore look frank he remark after a little time have elapse as sure as you live there be a officer in uniform just arrive on the dock and back by a squad of soldier he seem to be surprise at discover that we have go now he beckon and wave he hat listen to he shout something in spanish through he hand i guess we do not get away from barranquila five minute too soon it look like it say frank grimly but we have comply with the law of the land and nothing short of a cannon could make we turn back now all the same i be go to the pilot house and keep a eye on felipe i think he be trustworthy but a ounce of prevention be better than a pound of cure always good for you andy shoot after he depart chum though he himself remain there by the rail watch what take place ashore frank quickly enter the pilot house here a dark-faced middle-aged man handle the wheel frank immediately notice that he be listen to what the gold braided officer ashore be shout angrily he also look a bit trouble what do he say felipe demand the young aviator he command we to return seor reply the other well pay no attention to he felipe we have comply with all the regulation and red tape necessary the american consul will back we up it be you business to simply steer this boat up the river until we arrive at magangue si seor but when i return they will surely make the trouble for I reply the pilot shrug he narrow shoulder not at all felipe declare frank you can swear that we make you do as we wish that you dare not turn back since you life be in danger we stand ready to shoulder all the blame there be the dusky face of the old river pilot whom they have fortunately run across in maracaibo become wreathe in a smile perhaps the young seor would not mind show the capitan he suggest frank grasped he meaning and pretend to scowl darkly he draw out the revolver which colonel josiah have make he promise to carry while down in this explosive country now felipe he say as he clap the weapon deliberately against the head of the pilot you gay capitan can easily see what i be do and will understand what it mean you keep right on up-river and if you dare disobey it will be bad for you felipe the shrewd old pilot try to smother a expansive grin as he reply : si seor i be in you hand do with I what you will i dare not refuse longer see i have make one effort to turn about but you threaten and i give it up he no longer call he know old felipe be powerless it be well frank stand by he until the wharf be dim by distance then he hasten to rejoin he cousin and chum who be mightily pleased to hear all about it do you think they will chase after we query andy still worried oh i guess not it be not so serious as all that they know they can get we when we come down the river no doubt reply frank carelessly then i 'll care precious little what become of the bug observe andy with a sigh of relief i suppose you mean that by that time you 'll either have find you father or else give up the search as hopeless be that it old fellow frank ask yes one or the other and now we have get time to remember the other warn good old seor jos give we about the revolutionist try to stop we on the way and get we cargo yes frank go on that must be on we mind constantly i be go to talk with old felipe about it soon i have a hunch that he can be depend on to back we up for he be get a grudge against the man these fellow want to send back into the presidential chair seor jos tell I felipe lose all he family through the persecution of that man and he party a bully good thing to know assented andy for we can be dead sure of felipe all the time and through he get pointer about the rest of the crew there be a few goat among the sheep and when we make sure of it i be just go to pay they off and chuck they ashore in any old place now that be what i call a clever scheme frank declare they would have no kick come because you see no spanish american could ever complain of get he wages without have to do any work i guess not andy remark grin assent upon further conference it be decide to divide the day and night into watch so that one of they could be on deck and alert all of the time while the other secure some sleep treachery they know would be likely to crop out during the night time those on board may have find some means of tell they confederate ashore about what time the boat would reach a give point and by means of some native method of telegraph such as by means of wigwag flag or smoke the news could be hurry up the river much in advance of the vessel that be but against the strong current of the swollen magdalena then frank go forward to have a long talk with the trusty pilot he take felipe into he confidence tell he for the first time all about they sacred mission to this region of colombium and in this way as well as by promise to double he regular wages frank quite win the old fellow 's heart in return felipe be able to give he employer considerable valuable information connect with the crew frank mention no name and hence he be satisfy that he have make no mistake in he calculation when among the list of suspect give by the pilot both enrique and little cospita be include we must get rid of they both as soon as possible he announce so just before night set in draw the boat to shore near some village or town then i shall pay both man off get they signature to the fact and insist on they go ashore meanwhile as you find opportunity post a few of the faithful one to the fact that we suspect they of be insurrecto felipe declare that the idea be superb he be grow more and more fond of these venturesome young americano who be so generous so brave and who have come all this great distance actuate by such a noble purpose so many a man may easily feel when he salary have be unexpectedly double during the balance of that afternoon the two young aviator continue to alternately sit upon the deck and wander about the boat watch thing frank have the precious aeroplane lock up in the spacious lazerette which be also use as a storeroom for extra supplies that the circumstance need not be look upon as singular i be determine that no ill may happen to that machine if i can help it he say to he chum when speaking of what he have have do and andy of course fully endorse he course so the sun begin to draw closer to the western horizon represent by the distant mountain where the chief inland town of the province sabanalarga lay felipe have speak of a place on the eastern bank of the river where they could draw in and put the two suspect ashore and frank tell andy to back he up in what he be about to do there be the town ahead only a little place but it answer we purpose for they can never say we desert they in the howling wilderness and frank who have be count out some money start to make he way down to the waist of the vessel where most of the crew have gather wonder what the object of the landing might be enrique and cospita be surely very much astonished and alarmed when tell that they service be need no longer -- that it be ascertain they be carry too many man and also that they be to receive full pay for the time they have engage of course they start to make objection and the air be fill with various excited exclamation but frank prove as firm as adamant and show the automatic revolver sticking from he pocket all the while a fact that keep the two man from venture to do more than shout clutch they money they be push ashore by member of the crew who doubtless could give a pretty good guess as to what the whole thing mean since they have talk with felipe a good riddance of bad rubbish declare andy as the boat again start up the river leave a pair of yell native behind make all sort of furious gesture with both arm yes pursue frank reflectively and if we want any more evidence that we nip a conspiracy to seize the vessel in the bud there it be in they anger at be pay for not work nothing like that be ever know before down in this country as felipe say and now andy i feel that we be another step nearer the carry out of you great task oh i hope so say the other he face mark by a eagerness that tell of the one sole wish of he youthful heart chapter xi out of the frying pan into the fire frank take the first watch it be to begin about ten o'clock that night for both of they have remain on deck talk up to that hour the night be so comfortable after the hot day that they dislike go into the sleep quarter these happen to face the deck however so that the vessel be admirably suit to cruise in tropical region every thing seem to be go on decently right now remark andy yawn as he prepare to have a few hour ' sleep that be so return he chum but while we have get some of the faithful one on duty we must not forget that there may be other snake aboard enrique and the little shouter may not have be all the sympathizer with the revolutionist and not for a minute will we relax we vigilance that be frank 's way and just now andy fully approve of it he heart be so set upon have a chance to use the monoplane in the endeavor to discover that strange cliff-enclosed valley where he father be imprison that he do not mean to take any chance of lose out through over confidence so he pack off to he berth while frank prepared for three hour of lonely vigil he expect to make the round just about once in so often and have a few word with the man at the wheel felipe have declare that it be he intention to keep busy himself through the night since he dare not trust the wheel in the hand of a inexperienced pilot while darkness last in the morning he could give direction and allow a assistant to do the work while he secure some rest there be no moon after early in the evening when the young queen of the night disappear in the west leave the bright star to control the sky the boat continue to make good headway against the current though at this season of the year the magdalena be bank full with the summer rain which fall almost every afternoon in a deluge a searchlight send a dazzling shaft of light far ahead on the troubled surface of the booming flood this be a absolute necessity for otherwise it would have be too dangerous buck against that tide laden as the river be with float tree trunk of gigantic size that have be sweep from they resting-place in the lowland above once frank have see a wild animal crouch on one of these great log the boat pass so very close to the float refuge of the beast that ere darkness claim the strange craft with its stranger cargo frank have be able to see the tawny hide of the crouch beast and note the quick jerky motion of its long tail upon hurry to the pilot house and make inquiry of felipe he learn that just as he suspect the animal be a jaguar the most fear inhabitant of the tropical forest away off at the headwater of the magdalena and orinoco river there be a spice of peril hover over the progress of the little boat during every hour of that night it might come in the sudden leap of a wild animal that judge any port would be better than a float log then there be a chance of they run afoul of a monster derelict in the shape of a drift snag that might punch a hole in they bow and bring about trouble on top of all be this unseen peril from the revolutionist who be make the magdalena country the center of they renew activity for some reason or other and have they mind set on secure the first aeroplane ever know to be in colombium the time pass away when three hour have really go and all seem well frank awake he chum generous to a fault he might have hold out much longer for he do not feel exhaust but andy who know he like a book have make he promise faithfully on he word of honor that he would arouse he at exactly the time agree upon everything lovely and the goose hang high frank say as the other join he presently on deck that be good reply andy and as it be now one o'clock with no trouble do look good to I that we 'll pull through the night without a mess you never can tell observe the careful frank and the only way to do be to act just as if you feel positive something be bind to crop up i know it come the reply as andy start to walk up and down a bit so as to get the last remnant of drowsiness out of he system for a hour he find little trouble in keep awake he make frequent trip to where felipe stand at he wheel he keen eye keep constant vigil ahead in order that he might steer clear of such snag as threaten to stove a hole in the hull of the steam yacht now and then andy could see one of the crew move about but as some of they must have duty to perform even in the night he do not look upon this as a suspicious circumstance only he make sure that no one wander in the near vicinity of the lock lazerette where the precious monoplane lay securely crate in some place the river prove much narrower than in other and of course it be here they have they greatest trouble the current be increase for one thing then the float object sweep forward with more speed so that it require additional dexterity in order to avoid they but old felipe know he business well andy believe they have make no mistake in leave matter fully in he hand it be about the end of he second hour that the pilot volunteer some information that give andy more or less uneasiness just ahead young seor he say when for the fifth time the boy enter he deck pilot house we come to the narrowest place in the whole river at this section and there if anywhere i expect that they will be wait for we do you mean the revolutionist exclaim andy interested instantly no other seor if we manage to get past there all will be well but they may be encamp on both shore and demand that we draw in under penalty of be fire on felipe go on without remove he snap black eye for even a single second from the ever-moving panorama of shift water and float debris that the searchlight disclose ahead of the labor boat but nothing must tempt we to obey no matter if they send volley aboard the distance be too far for they to do much damage and i hear they be as a rule pretty punk shooter felipe may hardly have know what that word mean but he could give a guess but sometimes young seor they even have cannon he remark you do not say ejaculate andy in new alarm but he quickly catch himself and go on let 'em try it then we 'll just shut off the searchlight and take we chance for a while with the old floater on the river then perhaps they will not see anything to bang away at anyhow just make up you mind felipe we do not haul in not while the bless old tub keep above water it be good to hear such brave talk say the old pilot chuckle I i will keep go straight ahead no matter what come until i have the order from you to turn the boat yes let they shoot seor after all i do not believe they could hit the side of a palace in this dark all the same andy think he ought to arouse he cousin and make frank aware of the new threatening peril on hear the fact frank agree with all the one on guard say even to be ready to extinguish the useful searchlight when the critical moment arrive we 'll just have to take chance that be all he declare even if we come swat up against one of those floater that be no reason we would be snag and sink they make these boat pretty strong over there across the big pond and i guess we hull could stand a hard punch yes remark andy feeling easier now that frank be on deck ready to take matter in he able hand and after all it be a choice between two bad thing in which we pick out the lesser hang the old insurrecto i say why can not they just pay attention to they own business and let we two peaceful bird boy alone well laugh he chum you know how it be yourself when you want something pretty hard and they have get the notion in they stubborn head that if they only have a modern up-to-date aeroplane they could just make the miserly old government come to term instanter do not blame they too much andy maybe you and i would do the same thing -- if we be colombian and on the out look to I like there be something like a fire ahead frank declare andy right at that juncture i say you be on the spot every time old fellow observe the other as he shaded he eye to look there be a sharp turn ahead where felipe say we enter the narrow place and i honestly believe they have get a bonfire burning on the right-hand bank then after all shut off we bully little searchlight will not do we much good complain andy regretfully do not you believe it frank hasten to remark a fire be not go to reach all the way across the river which be pretty wide even at its narrowest part and depend on it we clever old wheelsman will keep just as snug up against the left hand shore as he dare go all the same despite these assurance from he cheerful chum andy confess to a secret feeling of apprehension as they draw closer to the point of land beyond which the danger possibly lay in wait it seem to he that every conceivable species of peril threaten the sacred enterprise upon which he have so eagerly embark from various source do harm hover over they head and even though they pass safely through all these there must be many more to come after they have launch they little airship and start to explore the strange region of this tropical land it be a fire all right frank he say as they negotiate the bend and open up a new vista ahead yes that be so for a fact return he chum and notice will you andy how old felipe have manage to keep over well toward the port shore he size up the situation all right and know how to act yes felipe tell I he use to serve in the army many a battle he have be through not only in colombium but in other country as well he be once something of a soldier of fortune but where be you go frank as he comrade start to leave he i must warn the crew to keep out of sight or they may be hit if there happen to be any shooting go on call the other over he shoulder he find that every member of the crew seem to be awake as if they have talk the situation over and also guess where the trouble would lie in wait for the venturesome young americano seors so frank give he warning and see that they obey while they be in he employ he feel a certain degree of interest in these ragged fellow and do not wish to be hold responsible for any damage they might receive if incline to be reckless at time when he once more reach andy 's side the latter be look through a pair of marine glass they have fetch along think they would prove especially valuable in scrutinize the country over which they might be pass in the aeroplane they be we friend the revolutionist i reckon he announce i can see several who carry big sword that dangle around they heel and the common soldier while they have little if any uniform and some of they no shoe seem to all have gun in they hand here look and tell I what that be on the little rise i be afraid we worst fear be go to come true well you be right andy reply the other after he have clap the binoculars to he eye that be a cannon all the same and they be get ready to shoot oh my it make a fellow 's flesh just creep to think of be bang away at with a great big cannon declare andy this one be not so very big i think and now we be nearly opposite where the fire burn they be go to make a move to show they hand drop down flat on the deck andy -- quick with you and frank as he speak set the example himself hardly have the two boy thus throw themselves down than there be a heavy boom accompany by a brilliant flash of fire from the shore the revolutionist have fire upon the little steam yacht chapter xii a great surprise wow now what do you think of that exclaimed andy raise he head just as one of the big turtle native to these warm water might thrust he out of he shell why that be only a warn to bring we up short and pay attention declare frank because as you see the ball splash the water ahead of we bow but frank we do not mean to head across cry andy get up on he knee the better to see to be sure we do not that be all settle long ago and you notice that we good felipe be still keep she nose head straight upstream now out go the searchlight just as we arrange wonder what they 'll think that mean perhaps they 'll believe they knock it overboard with that shot suggest andy who could joke even when face trouble as thick as a sea fog listen frank exclaimed there be a chap with a pair of leather lung shout a lot of gibberish i suppose he be demand we surrender and threaten to blow we to smithereens if we decline to believe he one good thing be that each minute take we further up the river and every foot count in this game of runaway already we be past where the gun stand and those fellow be work like fun to get she turn around so as to point after we while they load we be do more stunt yes and frank we be leave 'em in the lurch i do believe sure thing return frank composedly only both of we want to duck when it look time for the blame old gun to bang again they mean business from the word go now and will shoot to hit by some accident it might run afoul of the boat and splinter fly there get ready to drop andy it be come it certainly be for immediately another flash spring up accompany by the same deep bellow as the fieldpiece be discharge no doubt while it may have be rather out of date in pattern the cannon be good enough to have do savage execution handle by expert german or french gunner but there do not seem to be any such among the rag-and-bobtail army of the new aspirant for the presidency of colombium at any rate the missile whiz and whine past the retreat boat miss she by yard bully shout andy jump up and cut a few pigeon wing on the deck to illustrate just how pleased he be by the time they be ready to let she off again we 'll be nearly out of range and from the look of the bank i feel pretty sure they never can catch up with we tote they old gun along three minute later there come the third report and they hear the ball pass high overhead prove that the marksman have entirely lose all trace of the boat and simply fire at random that settle it say frank decisively do you think so ask he chum joyously no question about it andy like the government official on the wharf at barranquilum they realize that the game do not work and if they want to get we they 'll have to lay some new plan when we come back again but we be not bother we head about that you know never even cut a chip off we boat declare andy well i be go back and get the rest of my nap wake I up at four remember i want the last watch and frank dive within he stateroom with as much seeming indifference as though this thing of be fire upon with fieldpiece might be a everyday occurrence in he experience morning dawn upon the magdalena frank be on duty at the time and drink in the lovely picture bird fly overhead crane arise from along the shallows in near the shore where they have be fish for they breakfast and there be many strange feathered creature to be see such as the boy have never up to now set eye upon some of the crew be trail fish line astern and every now and then a prize would be haul aboard which later on might afford a meal for passenger and worker andy soon make he appearance the rise sun have send a few slant ray into he sleep quarter and arouse he by fall on he face this be something like eh frank he remark as he draw in a big breath of the brace morning air i should remark yes be the other 's reply we have apparently leave all we danger behind andy venture that be i mean there be little likelihood of we be rob of we precious machine now with both government official and envious revolutionist leave in the lurch i be just ask felipe and he say we shall have another day and night of buck up against this nasty current you see andy it be on a unusually big bender right now which make it doubly hard to fight it oh well what can not be cure must be endure i guess so i 'll try to take it as easy as i may and be thankful it be no worse andy reply the morning pass without any event worth mention and all the while they keep steadily at the business of eat up some of the two hundred mile that felipe assure they lay between magangue and the city at the mouth of the big river another thing be worry andy however he finally broach the subject to he comrade know that in this way he would get relief that bless old engine have be do bully for a long time now frank but judge from past experience she be due for another sulky fit soon whatever would we do if she let down all of a sudden while we be right in the worst kind of a swift current my we would be carry mile downstream before we could do anything oh no we would not remark the other smile then you have be think it all over and make ready to offset a balk i bet anything declare andy with vehemence do you see that anchor forward ask frank point from where they stand on the raise deck aft well that be get a good long stout chain attach and be place where a kick will send it over notice old quita squat close by think he be take a snooze he seem so quiet but all the time the old chap 's on the alert and he have he order too to upset the anchor over the bow you mean asked andy just that come frank 's reply if anything happen to the machinery you 'll hear a series of quick whistle from felipe the boat will not even have a chance to lose headway before over plump the big mudhook and we 'll just take a rest out in the river until repair can be make again by engineer mcclintock and he assistant andy look at he chum admiringly bless if you do not just think of everything he say and get ready long before it happen however do you do it frank oh it be easy once you make up you mind laugh the other i take to it long before this new boy scout movement start you know they have get as they lead motto the word : ` be prepare ' and there never be a better slogan ever give to boy think how many thing might be avoid if we be always prepared yes i have give the subject much thought grumble andy but somehow i seem to slip up when it come to the critical time i stay awake eleven hour and just when i doze off in the twelfth watch the blame thing happen it be always that way seem to I how can a fellow stay awake all the time tell I that oh rat there be no need of that just fix thing so you 'll be arouse when it come along and be ready to turn the table so they talk away into the afternoon the engine seem to be on its best behavior mcclintock the scotch engineer who be the only foreigner aboard besides the boy report that he be begin to have more faith in the machinery the work of the last twenty odd hour have certainly be a pretty heavy tax on it and everything seem to be go like clockwork i only hope it 'll keep up then say andy one more night be all i ask then felipe promise to have we at we journey 's end when i can see and talk to the very man who pick up that wonderful little parachute with its message from the unknown valley among the cliff i wish the time be here right now felipe by the way be take he rest now say frank after a little time for he expect another night on duty we still meet many tree trunk sweep down on the current the man at the wheel have to keep on guard constantly look at that tremendous one will you andy and just notice how dense the forest be ashore around here how any one can get around at all beat I i should think they would have to keep they machete busy all the time cut the matted vine away i understand they do the other go on and i rather guess that there be hardly a country under the sun where a aeroplane would be of more real benefit than right here in the tropics think of avoid all that tangle -- of float along a mile a minute if you want far above the tree top and away from all such a muss you be right agree frank fervently and it be the only way any one could ever hope to discover this strange prison of you father from a distance of a thousand foot we can have a big range of vision with we good glass it will not be hard to discover the cliff if only we figure out in which direction we can have the best chance and i think i have get a scheme ready to manage that i depend on you to do it say andy alone by myself i would simply despair of ever learn anything worth while but while you be along i just feel that we be go to succeed i ought to thank you for say that but i will not frank declare because it make I tremble for my reputation as a prophet but you have see nothing to make you less confident i hope cry the other to be sure i have not reply frank readily enough on the other hand i ought to feel better satisfied than ever because we have manage to outwit every cause for trouble that have crop up this far we 'll get through this come night without accident because we be ready for anything then when another day dawn we 'll haul in at magangua to hunt jos mendoza up and hear what he can tell we about the parachute that fall among he cocoa tree hark what ail the man forward exclaim andy just then they spring to they foot and rush to where they could see what be go on perhaps a mutiny exclaim frank who could not tell what queer thing be ever go to happen down in this land the people of which be so different from all whom he have ever know before andy utter a low cry of alarm and begin to fumble for the revolver colonel josiah have make he promise to always carry on he person once they reach the country of revolution the first sight they obtain tell they that something unusual have indeed happen a number of the native crew be in range of they vision but every man have fall flat on he face and seem to be cower there as if afraid what in the dickens be it gasp andy i do not know they be a scared lot that be sure perhaps they see a sea serpent alongside it could not be that a jaguar have board we no look at old quito how he lift he head and take a terrify look why he seem to be observe something up above in the heaven as sure as you live as frank shoot out these word he too bent he head back to scan the brazen sky above a cry break from he lip why what under the sun do it mean exclaimed andy who have also turn he eye heavenward to discover a strange thing speed over the top of the tree one two thousand foot high and at the same time there come to he ear a familiar throbbing that could have but one mean a aeroplane he burst forth in thrilling tone and the silly down there think it be just a frightfully big bird about to carry they off hey frank perhaps the government have get one of the new contraption after all go slow say frank suppose you look a bit closer my boy be not there something familiar about that same craft up yonder it be -- it be a biplane frank gurgled andy yes and one you have set eye on before too old fellow it belong to -- puss carberry burst from andy 's quiver lip as he continue to stare as if almost unable to believe he own eye chapter xiii the devil-bird yes puss carberry and he crony sandy hollingshead declare frank positively but it seem impossible all these hundred and hundred of mile away from old bloomsbury and puss carberry float over we sure i must be dream frank stammer the other still gaping up at the rapidly pass aircraft no you be just as wideawake as ever you be in all you sweet life say frank take a better look andy do not you see now that it be the same biplane we race with the day sandy drop that bag of sand hope to break we win streak in the dash for old thunder top anyhow it be a ringer for it i give you my word mutter the stunned boy frank with a exclamation of impatience spring forward and snatch something up that have just catch he attention this prove to be the fine field glass that have be bring along on the adventure these he clap to he eye and as they be already fit and adapt to he sight he lose not a second in cover the pass aeroplane look for yourself my boy he cry hand the binoculars over to andy who hastily raise they well i declare that settle it ejaculate that individual immediately you recognize they then ask frank it be puss as sure as thunder i can see he plain the other be just out of line but there be something about he figure that make I ready to say it be we old friend sandy andy reply amazement still grip he tightly well frank observe after all the only queer thing about it be we glimpse they so soon we know they be head down this way somewhere but they make quicker time than we best and just to think that they be the first to fly a aeroplane along the region of the magdalena huh they beat we up in the air that other time yet when it come to a showdown we leave 'em at the stake andy be begin to recover he breath and with it come renew confidence do you see anything in the action of puss that would indicate he have recognize we aboard this boat ask frank for the other still keep the glass glue to he eye no i do not reply andy presently you see they be awful high right now and without glass they could never make we out down here i guess you be right be frank 's decision perhaps it be just as well for there be never any tell what mean trick those fellow have get up they sleeve andy suddenly remove the glass and a sudden pallor seem to cross he face oh frank he cry you do not believe they would ever be so wicked as to try and stop we from search for my father do you bad as puss carberry be i can not just believe he would ever do that well i hope not return the other but there be a trifling vein of doubt in he voice for he have long ago cease try to figure to what depth of depravity those two schemer might descend but where do you suppose they come from right now frank that would be hard to tell frank reply the first you see of they they be sail up over yonder then the chance be they have quarter themselves at some town perhaps on the river and that this be just they first flight -- a sort of look over the country yes say andy they be circle right now as though they mean to head back again well you can not blame they much frank ventured watch the action of the aviator above with keenest interest night be not so very far away and i should think a fellow would hardly feel like be catch out after dark down here in a airship well hardly andy smile curfew must ring for we every time fancy drop plump in the middle of such a jumble of forest as that be yonder and i bet you it be just cram full of snake jaguar and everything else that would want to snuggle up to a poor birdboy drop out of the cloud I for daylight when i go sail down in this bless region look the man be begin to recover from they fright remark frank in low tone there be old quito sit up now and commence he everlasting jabber with the other see he point to the biplane and then to we andy say the sharp old coon be get a pointer on we he be tell he chum right now that the thing we have get store away in the lazerette be just such a big bird as that go away over yonder be i right frank you never say a truer thing but they be certainly a badly rattle crowd for a time and we can hardly blame the poor fellow for what could they think but that it be a tremendous bird of prey look they over with a eye to grub frank laugh a little as though the recollection of the fright of the crew would always seem more or less ludicrous they sit there and watch until the mysterious biplane have completely disappear in the hazy distance that mark the come of evening you do not think then ask andy when it have vanish from view that puss and he biplane could have fall into the hand of the colombium authority and that they be use it for scout to learn the movement of these ragged revolutionist no i do not be frank 's quick response you say you could positively make out puss at the wheel and i be almost sure it be sandy with he they must have slip into the country without give they secret away trust sly puss for know how to do that sort of thing he never go around with a brass band tell what big thing he have on tap that be right why just think not a soul know about he old biplane until he have it about do we be work in the open almost tell much of we plan but puss pretend to be mighty envious and ask question when all the time he be mean to beat we out of course he could get into colombium without give he secret away you do not need to tell I frank you be surprise at that no more i be but there go the sun how quick it seem to drop out of sight down here frank remark sure laugh he cousin but all the same i fail to hear any bang you remember the irish immigrant who hear the sunset gun at a military post in america for the first time and on be tell that it denote sunset innocently exclaim ` sure the sun niver go down in ould ireland wid a bang like thot but already the dusk be creep out of the dense wood on to the river and i be get hungry it must be near supper time i wonder what the folk up home be do right now just what we be likely -- wait to hear a welcome sound that will call they in to feed and there come little pepito to blow the conch shell that he use for a dinner bell come andy get a move on you another night and then we be go to do business at the old stand it will be just fine to soar above this strange country and see for mile and mile -- mountain valley river tropical forest and everything that we have never look down on before the two young aviator go into the cabin for supper they fare very well insofar as food be concern of course both of they miss the home cookery the native who attend to this part of the program do he level best to please and he certainly have plenty to work with but he spanish style of serve even the most ordinary dish of tinned meat with a dash of garlic be begin to pall upon the taste of the american lad frank have even start to show he other way of cooking and they have hope of convert the cook by slow degree the night be in one sense a repetition of the precede one true they would not have to consider be halt by a gathering army of the revolutionist and that be a comfort all around at the same time frank deem it necessary that he and he cousin keep watch and andy be perfectly willing to sacrifice some of he personal comfort for the sake of insure the safety of the precious aeroplane it prove just as well that they have so determine during frank 's second term on guard and somewhere around four o'clock while darkness cover the land he think he catch a glimpse of a shadow cross the deck head in the direction of the lazerette he have be lazily recline on a soft cushion make of several blanket and look up at the silvery star but immediately he become fully arouse this might mean danger in some shape toward the aeroplane and no matter it behoove he to investigate so he softly arise to he knee and creep after the shadowy figure cautiously he approach the place where the door belong to the storeroom be to be find as he advance thus he could occasionally catch a peculiar click sound which he believe must be make by some one try to pick the lock the engine of the boat keep up considerable of a racket as it steadily work along without the dreaded hitch besides there be always more or less splashing of water against the side as they push against the swift current of the magdalena all these thing combine to muffle the click sound frequently yet during little lull frank could catch it again the tumult also serve to deaden any shuffling he may have make while creep toward the lazerette door and for this frank be thankful it be very gloomy here a hang lantern some distance away only serve to accentuate the gloom apparently still by strain he eye frank believe he could just manage to make out a stoop figure at the door yes he be certain that it have just move and now the peculiar clicking be much plainer when it stop he remain perfectly motionless nor do he again commence he creep forward progress until it start once more frank no longer have the slightest doubt concern the cause of that suspicious click one of the crew be endeavor to force a entrance into the lock lazerette doubtless with the intention of destroy the valuable aeroplane he might be in league with the revolutionist and in this way hope to prevent the government from eventually secure possession of the machine which would put the insurrecto out of the run but frank have conceive another idea he now believe that he fellow might have be send by the crew to destroy the devil-bird as they undoubtedly consider a contraption that could soar through space as fast as the fleetest condor no matter it be he business to put a sudden stop to the action and while do so he must not be too rough in he deal with the fellow lest the entire crew rise in revolt when he have reach a point that allow of a leap frank suddenly spring forward he do not know just what he might be up against and have even take from he pocket the splendid new pistol which colonel josiah himself a world traveler have insist upon give each of he boy before they start on they trip south surrender cry frank believe that the very sound of he voice would do much toward frightening the would-be traitor but he hardly expect such a tremendous upheaval as follow the man believe that possibly the devil-bird have break out of its cage and be about to carry he off in its gigantic beak give a shrill scream of terror and bounce up break the slender hold frank have secure upon he person not to be outdo frank recover chase after he he believe it he duty to at least learn the identity of the rogue so that he might understand just how deeply the conspiracy have take root in the crew between himself and the hang lantern he could make out the flee figure of the fellow and hot in pursuit he follow as fast as he foot would let he the man undoubtedly hear he come for if anything he fright increase out upon the open deck they fly frank just a few foot in the rear he have even stretch out he arm and touch the garment of the runner when with a screech the fellow make a furious plunge straight over the side of the boat he evidently choose to take chance in the swift current of the magdalena rather than trust himself in the power of the unknown pursuer which doubtless he believe to be the dreaded devil-bird that have be confine in the box cage chapter xiv the airship launch at last frank come near follow after the unknown member of the crew when the other make that fly leap over the side of the boat not that he want to take a bath just then but he forward progress have be rapid and he only save himself by bang up against the taffrail which be unusually high for so small a vessel and hold on sturdily he have hear the splash as the fellow reach the water doubtless he be a good swimmer as about all these native seem to be and bar he fall a prey to some loitering alligator or other reptile he would be able to gain the neighbor shore further down at any rate it be folly to think of look for he what be all the row cry andy as he come plunge forth from he stateroom some of the crew be even then look over the side and frank imagine they could give a pretty good guess as to what it mean but he hear not a word from even old quito and while the absence of a man must be notice in the morning there would probably be no complaint when andy hear about the attempt to injure the monoplane he be in a tremble do you ever he exclaim why it seem as though everything just want to knock we when we give the government official the merry ha ha and even slip past the revolutionary army after be bombard by they old cannon here even we own man want to smash we precious aeroplane under the belief that it be a evil bird come to bring bad luck to the people better go back to you bunk and forget it remark frank who be tenderly rub he elbow where it have come in contact with the hard taffrail at the time he stop so suddenly balk at a bath I not on you life frank declare andy with much emphasis i be go to take a blanket and just lie down in front of that bless door nobody can get in then without walk over my body and if i catch a fellow try it on believe I i 'll give he something he will not forget in a hurry it 'll be touch and go with he i bet you which he actually do much to frank 's secret amusement camp out there on the floor as close to the lock door as he could get and brace he back up against the same but then fortunately morning be not so far away and andy would have only a couple of hour more or less of he self-imposed labor they know that if the pilot of the river expedition say truly they must even now be draw near the town of magangue possibly it would break upon they vision with the come of dawn frank himself have no more intention of retire to he bed than have andy but continue to keep watch and ward until he see the first peep of daylight over the port side of the vessel then he communicate the glad intelligence to he chum and together they stand there watch the slow unfold of dawn from a ashen gray the sky begin to be mark with brighter hue pink flush travel along in line that center in the spot where the sun would presently appear and the gloom of night retreat once more back to its hide place among the mountain pass there be the dinky old town cry andy point with tremble finger it be and no mistake reply frank himself experience a sensation of considerable relief for at time it have seem more than doubtful whether the little expedition could ever overcome the many difficulty that beset its passage up the swollen river and so they come to land just as the glorious sun show he smile face andy declare that this be a harbinger of good luck and he cousin choose to readily agree with all he say for it please he to see andy look more like he old self than he have be for many a day remember only one of we ashore at a time until we land this cargo remark frank as they come to bring the boat to the bank where a group of native wait to see what it all mean surprise write largely on they dark face that be right respond the other traveler but i be go to have the aeroplane carry out on deck at once so it can be take ashore as soon as we find where we be at what we want first of all be to hear about we friend carlo mendoza the cocoa planter perhaps he live mile away and we 'll have to get some sort of conveyance to tote we machine out to he place yes observe frank i have be lay out plan along that line if you do not mind i 'll drop ashore while you be have the crate bring on deck and make inquiry even away down here in this wilderness money talk colonel josiah tell we it do for he in the heart of darkest africa you know and a few bolivar will hire all the help we want andy be perfectly agreeable that he companion should have take upon himself the task of engineering thing you can always discount I when it come to bargaining he say laughingly so go ahead and fix thing to suit yourself frank upon reach shore frank who have take old felipe along with he to serve as interpreter find that carlo mendoza have he home just on the border of the town though it be a little distance away he soon make arrangement for hire a native cart to be use in transport the precious aeroplane in less than half a hour they be on the way the boat have be leave in charge of mcclintock the scotch engineer who would make sure that the crew remain on board or lose the wages come to they both of the boy be so excited that they pay little attention to the strange scene which now surround they in the valley town far back in the interior of tropical colombium indeed one might even have suspect that they have always be accustom to live in a region where all manner of tropical fruit abound coffee and cocoa be raise as crop and bird of brilliant plumage fly overhead the truth of the matter be they know they would presently come face to face with the planter who have actually pick up the little messenger send out of he cliff border prison by professor bird and this fact set they nerve to tremble with eager anticipation in due time the cart on which the aeroplane have be secure together with the luggage which the young aviator wish to carry along draw up before a long low white building back of which could be see orange tree and other evidence of a real tropical home they come must have be note for a gentleman be advance from the grove at the rear seor carlo look surprised at see the caravan bring up before he door but that be as nothing in comparison with he amazement upon learn how one of the two young americano be the same andrew bird to whom he have desire he friend seor almirez to forward the strange message pick up in he cocoa grove one day several month back the boy have learn from seor jos that the owner of the plantation could understand english and even speak it fairly well thus they have no need of fetch felipe along to act as interpreter oh please first of all let I see the remains of the silk parachute that be attach to the bark letter say andy after they have converse for a short time and some of the planter 's hire servant have unloaded the boxed aeroplane which be stow away in a place of security doubtless the planter understand the reason for the boy 's solicitude he immediately take they inside the house and in another minute have thrust into andy 's eager hand a discolor piece of silk such as be use in the making of balloon nor do either frank or the colombian planter think it strange that the boy should press the token again and again to he lip while tear run down he face they could understand the feeling that fill he heart and no matter what the nationality may be the honest love of a lad for he father can not but provoke admiration and respect and now say frank presently when he cousin have in a measure recover from he first emotion will you tell we seor mendoza just how you find this strange communication i hope you remember the exact day because it be of the greatest importance to we that we learn as near as possible from just what quarter it come si seor i understand that reply the planter eagerly he dark face aglow with enthusiasm i make note of the day in my diary also the fact that it be the third day in succession when the wind blow direct from the south with just a faint turn to the west splendid cry frank turn to give he chum a reassuring nod what do i tell you andy the forethought of seor carlo have make we task much easier there can be little doubt then that the hot air balloon must have start in a region that lie almost due south of here possibly with a slant as he say toward the south by west quarter as a sailor would call it and now seor can you tell we just where a direct line that way would bring we first over the lowland and the forest then if you go far enough amigos it be the sierra san jeronimo mountain you would strike reply the planter yes i remember they on the map we have and that correspond exactly with all i have in my mind frank observe he forehead wrinkle with serious thought what sort of country be it up in those mountain ask andy the planter shrug he shoulder that i be unable to tell you amigos since i have never be there from all i have hear i believe it be one of the wildest and most inaccessible region in all we country lofty peak warn back the most daring explorer few have ever venture to attempt to go among they some never come back they say the superstitious declare those mountain be fill with evil thing nothing on earth could tempt one of my peon to accompany a expedition thither then it be lucky that we will not need any assistance in we adventure remark frank with a aeroplane one may be independent of help and now andy what shall we do it will take we the better part of the day to assemble we little flier and get thing ready for a ascent that mean another horrible night of wait before we can make a start say andy look quite forlorn but he soon understand that it could not be help both boy be presently hard at work with the deeply interested planter watch every move all the while they converse and the subject of pretty much all they talk have more or less to do with the country the peculiarity of climate what sort of weather they might expect to have and dozen of similar matter doubtless seor mendoza would like to hear of thing connect with the great outside world which he seldom see anything of but he realize that these would keep until after the brave young seors have complete they task of humanity before evening come they have everything arrange to suit the critical frank both boy be please to find that the monoplane have come through its long journey without any damage have be do that night they be uneasy about the precious airship and at they request the planter have they bed make up in the shed where the bug lay but there be no attempt make to injure it in the least then come the morning andy could hardly eat a bite of breakfast for the eagerness that possess he soul every servant on the plantation have gather to look with awe upon the wonderful bird-like machine on which it be whisper these two venturesome young americano mean to soar among the cloud finally the last word be speak the planter shake hand with each of he visitor frank turn on the power the aeroplane with the motor exhaust sound like a volley of musketry start to run along the level ground and presently to the consternation of the entire gathering begin to climb upward just like a creature of magic cry of awe arise from score of throat and to a man the peon throw themselves flat on they face hardly daring to look at the terrifying spectacle chapter xv a unpleasant surprise at last frank we be on the move yes reply the one at the wheel as the cry and cheer from below be drown by the volley motor explosion and do you see the seor kiss he hand after we while he man be flat on they face it be a queer sight andy remark and no wonder these ignorant peon call we little monoplane a ` devil-bird ' look down now just to think of two yankee boy be allow to swing over a tropical scene like that say frank both of they be deeply interested in the valley they could see the little town with the river stretch off toward the south then there be the patch of tropical vegetation the fruit tree and the cocoa plantation -- all those interesting thing which neither of they have ever set eye on before seor mendoza have tell they how the coffee be grow upon a certain part of the mountain slope since it do not do well in the valley prefer a higher altitude they follow the course of the river generally intend to cover possibly something like eighty or ninety mile before try to comb the land from side to side in the endeavor to find the strange cliff enclose valley from time to time andy would call the attention of he aeroplane chum to some striking feature of the landscape far below the little kinkaid motor be hum merrily without ever miss a stroke and frank have the utmost confidence in its steadiness now after so many trial spin could take a few seconds at a time to observe these thing when we have go something close on a hundred mile direct remark the pilot of the craft presently i think we would better make a descent if give the chance you speak of that before remark he companion anxiously what be the reason for do it frank oh nothing serious reply the other we will then be at the parting of the way you know you mean we 'll be about to leave the river that will have be we guide up to then ask andy yes frank admit and from that time forward we must simply depend on we judgment for everything in that event it might be well if we look over the entire plant to make sure everything be in apple-pie shape andy breathe freer oh i agree with you there he hasten to say and i be glad you have not any more serious reason but do you ever see such a picture in all you bear day just look at the forest border the river think of try to push through such a dense mass of over-grown jungle and i bet it be just full of snake poisonous spider lizard and all such thing not to mention such trifling citizen as jaguar ocelot tapir alligator crocodile and they kind laugh frank ugh what lucky fellow we be to be away up here where we can skim along at the rate of thirty mile a hour easily without half try and snap we finger at all those thing i tell you frank this aviation business be the greatest thing that ever come down the pike so they continue from time to time to converse as they keep push along follow the wind course of the swollen river that could be plainly see below between its bank of forest frank do not soar high at this time there seem no need and besides both of the boy be deeply interested in watch the various change that keep take place in the checkerboard landscape below several time during the first hour they pass over hamlet or village on such occasion it be ludicrous to observe the excitement that occur the bird boy would not have be true to they nature have they not enjoy the tremendous sensation which the sudden and unheralded appearance of the aeroplane cause in these river settlement loud shout float up to they that constantly grow in volume man yell woman and child scream many fall flat on they face other try to conceal themselves as though they belong to a covey of wild duck over which a hungry eagle hover pick out he contemplated dinner and the last thing andy would see as he look back would be wildly run figure gesticulate furiously and evidently next door to crazy with excitement apparently these native believe that the aeroplane must be a visitor from another world or else some monster bird of a family long understand to be extinct the second hour have nearly end and everything seem to be move along smoothly frank see not a cloud on the horizon thus far surely this augured well for the ultimate success of they strange expedition suddenly he hear andy give vent to a cry of alarm what be it he demand quickly turn she upward quick they be go to shoot at we shout the other frank instantly start to obey and while they forward progress still continue unabated the aeroplane commence to head toward a higher altitude immediately he hear the dull report of a gun from below he dare not bend he head to look since all he attention be need to take care of he machine at such a critical moment but the whine of the bullet as it pass close by be very plainly hear then come other shot many of they and the air seem full of strange hissing sound twice frank feel a slight shock that tell he some part of the aeroplane have be strike by one of the fly missile he heart seem to jump almost into he mouth as he tremble for the result but nothing happen the motor keep up its insistent hum and there be not a quiver to indicate that a vital part of the monoplane have be injure andy be you hurt he call after the volley have cease the marksman below have evidently exhaust they ammunition only a scratch come the reply hardly draw blood think a splinter from the wood where a spend bullet zip past must have hit I it be all right frank we run the gantlet just fine but all the same i guess it would be better for we to keep a little higher after this do you make they out and be they government troops do you think frank ask for though he manage to turn he head already have they make such speed that only the interminable forest could be see in they rear no return he comrade i just reckon it be another camp of these insurrecto you remember the seor say there be apt to be more than one crowd of they up the river it be the only way to get in and out of this country and everything that happen have to count on a water route i guess the magdalena be about the same to this part of colombium that the old nile be to all egypt well it be a narrow escape all right frank declare i do not just like the sound of those bullet all around when you be six or eight hundred foot up in the air andy have recover from he recent fright by now and could even laugh i should say nix he observe especially when you know that one little clip on either wing would upset we like a stone excuse I if you please i 'll never be fully happy when fly until we invent some sort of little parachute that in case of a drop will give a fellow a chance for he money another hour pass when frank declare they have now reach the point where a descent would be advisable in case they find a opening that look suitable there be the mountain over yonder on the right he say and from now on we have better begin to scour the country cover every mile just as though we have a comb and mean to explore it all the chance to drop come presently and as the opening prove everything they could desire a landing be make without the least trouble here they rest and partook of a light lunch have bring plenty of provision along together with a gun of the latest repeat type with which colonel josiah have present they frank upon look the aeroplane over a little later discover that he have be wise in decide to make a halt there be need of some attention certain part have become weaken by the strain either in the long voyage and handle on board the steamer or else in this new flight he be determine to be thorough in all he do and this consume more or less time so that when he finally pronounce the monoplane in perfect condition the afternoon be half go still they must go up and put in a hour or two search andy be too wild with impatience to hear of anything else and frank saw no reason for not comply but we must be sure to get down again before night come he remark after they have make a successful rise and be speed above the top of the thick forest if we should be catch out at night i rather guess it would be a serious piece of business and andy agree with he for quite a time they soar aloft andy use the binoculars almost constantly watch the country below and occasionally sweep the distance frank be thrill to hear he chum suddenly give utterance to a cry but it be more of amazement than delight that give birth to this ejaculation what be it now andy more insurrecto he demand ready to manipulate the plane and strike for higher region no no not this time come the quick reply but frank as sure as you live there be that plague old biplane just rise up yonder a mile away and somehow i seem to feel that it spell trouble for we chapter xvi the air chase one hasty glance tell frank that there could be no mistake only too well do he know the construction of that same biplane that have in the near past compete with they for honor in the race for old thunder top 's crown you be right andy he say earnestly and it seem to I they be head for we right now what do you make they out to be can you see who be handle the wheel be it puss carberry yes i be dead sure of that but frank there be somebody else with he sandy ask he chum no it can not be there i have a good look at he and frank he be get a beard it be a man answer andy in tense tone frank 's first action be to move a lever that would change they course and place the biplane directly behind they he next be to throw on more speed so that the faithful little motor start to hum with the old-time rapidity that remind andy of the occasion when they put it to its best effort in order to rush ahead of they rival of the air then we must guess from that puss and sandy have fall into the hand of the rebel since there be no government troops up here the seor say he observe presently be they gain on we now andy i do not think so reply the one who hold the glass though puss seem to be get a whole lot of speed out of he gnome engine right now reckon he must have overhaul it or else find some way to put she up another notch how strange to think that we old rivalry be be renew away down here in this country thousand of mile from home remark frank after a while huh seem to I there would be something do if you happen to run across puss carberry at the other side of the world declare andy the race keep up for some time neither seem to gain to any appreciable extent of course both boy be key up to a state of intense nervousness pass through the air at this fearful speed fully five hundred foot above the ground be surely enough to excite they one little accident and they would hardly know enough to give a single shout of horror before the end must rush upon they and yet frank appear as cool as though sit beside a camp fire lay out some contemplated air cruise on paper andy be full of complaint aw now whatever do you suppose those measly old insurrecto want to chase we for in this style he growl we be attend to we private business and not bother they one little bit why do not they leave a fellow alone goodness know we have just get trouble enough on we hand without this i do not know say frank reflectively but i reckon they either want we monoplane or else believe we be in the employ of the government and have be send up here to spy on they movement anyhow it seem plain that they mean to make a big effort to get we which they will not if we know it cry andy but see here frank that chap be nervy all right go up with puss and stand all this racket a tenderfoot be generally rattle even with a slow flight he seem to be hold out i have be think about that reply he chum and andy it look to I as if that fellow must know something about aviation if i could only glimpse he through the glass i would soon tell for he would show it by the way he sit there alongside puss a new beginner would be hug the upright for dear life and show all the sign of fear yes i know because i do that same answer andy once again raise the binoculars as he twist he head around how be it ask frank not much sign of fright about he as far as i can see come the ready reply then make up you mind he be be up in a aeroplane before perhaps he be some french or german who have throw he fortune in with the man who want to sit in the presidential chair at bogota and in he own country he must have see something of aviation oh well it do not make much difference to we we just have to keep they at a distance and take we chance but frank -- yes i know what you be go to say andy that night will soon be come swoop down on we that be so and i be sorry in one way for it be go to be a tough old job find a suitable place to fold we wing on in the darkness but we be up against it good and hard you see and it be what you might call hobson 's choice andy show more positive sign of anger what business have they get bother we this way he grumble say do not you suppose it would be all right for I to try a few shot at 'em with the fine marlin repeat rifle we be carry perhaps i could give 'em a scare anyhow and make 'em haul off no i would not think of it reply frank hastily you might cause trouble to we own delicately balanced little aeroplane by firing and then again what if you bring about a accident and send they down to the earth like so many stone but you know those other chap bang away at we and they do not bother they head a cent whether they upset we whole business or not object andy belligerently two wrong never make a right andy but when they open fire on we the other go on complainingly that constitute a declaration of war and so you sec we would be quite justified in give 'em back the same kind of medicine you forget that one of those two in the biplane be a former schoolmate of ours and that perhaps he be just be compel to chase we right now say frank think so do you growl andy above the rattle of the exhaust well i would like to warrant you that puss carberry be grin right now because of the fright he think he be give we no sir he be only too willing to do anything to upset we plan i know he pretty well and i would not put any meanness past that fellow frank in secret do begin to feel more than anxious the afternoon be almost over and the sun perilously near the western horizon too well do he know how rapidly darkness come after the disappearance of the king of day he bid andy pay more attention to the lay of the country ahead of they we be keep well ahead of the biplane he observe and there be little danger of they overtake we but in case they drop out of the race we must try and know something of the chance for a landing ourselves gee it look pretty punk down there admit andy after he have carefully turn the glass forward and down that be what be bother I frank say we have sure get to drop sooner or later because it would be utterly impossible for we to keep afloat all night and if there happen to be no opening in that dense forest how can we land listen as sure as you live they be try to wing we with a shot cry andy well i would not bother about that the fellow only have a revolver if i know the sound of one and he could never reach we at this distance it tell I that he be get to about the limit and that something be go to change pretty soon mark my word andy of course one of frank 's object in say this be to encourage he chum for he know that in all probability andy be get pretty close to what he himself would call a blue funk sure enough the report continue until just six have reach they ear faintly that end it observe frank complacently and he never touch we echo he cousin evidently with more or less relief now take a look back and see what they be do andy h be still come right along at top-notch speed reply the other all right there be go to be a change soon look down andy oh frank what a dandy open space if only that plague biplane be in guinea how easy we could spiral down and make a landing there yes say frank and mark I that be just what they intend do as for we we 'll have to move along further into the wilderness and hope that another chance will come to let we out before everything be blot from sight by utter darkness frank they have just sight the open spot cry andy a few seconds later all right what do i say demand he cousin they have give up the chase sure and be about to drop down to make a landing for the night be that so asked frank eagerly for they own chance be get poorer with every pass minute and secretly he be more worried than he choose to admit just what they be do right now begin to spiral down puss and he old biplane be not in it again with we dandy little bug there they go frank do not i wish we have as good a place to grab hold of the old earth well frank continue gravely turn around and look you prettiest for it then do not let even a half way decent spot go by any port in a storm the sailor say and that ought to apply to the airship tar just as well see anything yet chum andy n-no can not say that i do come the reply as the other eagerly bent he gaze on the tree top that they be begin to approach closer for frank have turn the lever of the deflect rudder in order to start the monoplane earthward and the more they drop the lower the sun seem to get until part of he glowing disc appear to touch the horizon already it be grow dusk below they and the dense foliage of the interlocked branch of the tree seem to offer a insuperable barrier to a successful landing chapter xvii the camp in the tropical jungle frank this be tough luck andy exclaim presently keep up you spirit old fellow call out the other cheerily have the biplane succeed in make a landing yet i guess so reply andy moodily can not see any sign of she back there and besides it be actually get dark down below even while we can see a bit of the sun up here that be because of the contrast i 'll drop still lower so we 'll just clear the top of the forest then you will not need the glass andy both of we must keep a clever lookout for a chance every now and then there happen to be some opening in the forest you know do not i hope we find one though declare the other oh would not it be too mean for anything frank if we smash the precious little machine just when we be at the last stage of we big undertaking if i live through it i would be break hearted sure look then say frank earnestly and you take the right while i keep a eye on the leave both of we can watch out ahead if it come at all to be of any use it be get to be find inside of the next five minute so soon as that echo the other in distressed tone oh i be afraid we be in for the very worst experience we ever meet up with ha hold on andy what be that dead ahead cry frank who suddenly decrease the speed of the little motor it be a opening of some sort though awful little ejaculated andy we can never do it i be afraid frank we have just get to no matter what chance we take hold hard now and if you can jump out in time help stop she before we wreck she against a tree even while speak the air pilot be start to drop down he have make a specialty of this part of the business know how very important it must always be to aviator the rise be nothing compare to the descent for many a gallant aircraft have be injure or even wreck by clumsy manipulation want of room or some other cause while landing after a flight andy grip hold of a upright he try to see down into that little slash in the great forest as though it might hold every hope connect with he fortune and the success or failure of he mission of mercy oh be careful frank he call as they just barely miss the top of a great tree there be no need of say this as andy ought to have know no one could possibly be more careful than frank bird and yet this be one of those time when daring have to go hand in hand with caution the space in which they mean to try for a landing be so very small that it seem necessary for the aeroplane to come down almost as lightly as a feather fortunately the youthful pilot possess a good pair of eye and the gloom have not as yet entirely blot out all feature of the landscape now that they be so close to the earth andy be hold himself in readiness he know that there would perhaps be a opportunity for he to drop to the ground and by pull back help to bring the little airship to a full stop before they bang up against a tree at the further side of the little glade never before have andy find himself compel to do such a queer stunt as he afterwards term it but he be brace to exert himself now to the best of he ability jump shout frank as they come roughly in contact with the ground and andy go he never know whether he jump purposely or lose he grip of that upright after the shock of the collision but the next thing he realize he be strain himself with might and main to hold back the monoplane already glide along with sundry violent bump on the three bicycle wheel hurrah what do i say cry frank as the aeroplane come to a complete standstill close to the other border of tree there be a frightened series of grunt close by and some big unwieldy animal go rush away through the dense undergrowth crash along as though badly frighten at this queer thing that have drop down from the sky wow whatever be that do you know frank cry the one on the ground i do not know for sure because i only have the least peep of something that look like a small elephant make off reply the other also alight andy be already reach for the repeat rifle which have be securely fasten in the frame of the monoplane but frank they do not have such thing as elephant down in south america he expostulate sure they do not laugh frank feeling particularly good over the grand success that have attend they perilous landing nor a rhinocerous nor a hippopotamus but they do have the next largest beast and that be a tapir he be something like a big pig and not very dangerous the seor say that be what we frighten off just now i reckon well here we be on land again and mighty lucky to get down without some sort of a smash frank you do not think anything be break when we strike do you of course i can not say for sure but i believe not but all the same i must give a good look in the morning before we make another start be the reply frank return and now we be just get to stay here all night remark andy who still hold the gun in he hand that be not anything we 'll soon have a cheery blaze start that will keep the prowler away i guess get busy andy and see what we can do but we 'll start it some distance away from we gasoline tank remember but will not they be apt to see a fire ask the other as he reluctantly place the rifle down and start to gather wood no easy task in the increase darkness do you mean puss and that other fellow frank ask with a laugh oh they be a mile or two off and even if they could see the biggest of fire i would defy they to get half way here if they take the whole night to cut they way through that mass of trail vine and brush do not bother you head about that crowd andy i hope we be do with they for good he reassuring word seem to have considerable effect on he cousin who up to recently have himself be a most cheery fellow well he say we have sure get a whole bunch of gratitude on tap for the lucky way we drop in here chance look twenty to one it could not be do and i would like to wager that no other air pilot could have make the ripple so well you be prejudice old fellow because i be one of the bird boy laugh frank as he strike a match and apply it to the bunch of dead grass he have gather in the spot select for they fire it be a dozen yard away from the aeroplane and about the same from the nearest line of great bushy tree immediately the flame spring up dispel the darkness to some extent shuck but that make a big improvement and no mistake say andy stoop to drop some wood on the fire i always like to see what i be do and more than ever when i be in a strange place hark what be that do you suppose frank a sound have come from the depths of the forest not unlike the wail of a babe frank could give a guess what make it but he do not immediately say so say we must have land close to some native shack and that be a baby cry andy declare hardly come from frank that be only one of we cat friend give tongue perhaps call to he mate to come and see the funny object that drop from the sky wow reckon now you must mean a yellow boy a jaguar i bet you frank there be a heap of 'em around we right now how do we know but what every tree hide one of the critter watch everything we do i can tell you right now that i do not wander far from this jolly little blaze tonight and besides one of we have just get to keep a grip on this gun all the time i do not hanker after be carry away and make a meal of by a big hungry cat oh the fire will scare they away all right i believe there be not a animal that do not dread fire always keep that in mind andy when trouble come say frank earnestly i mean to reply the other as he once more start to pick up wood but it could be notice that while do so andy always keep on eye on the alert as if he really believe what he have say about the chance of they be watch by a army of jaguar there be another sort of cry frank he remark presently yes and although i could not say for sure i believe it be make by a colony of monkey travel through the wood at night the other reply after stop to listen for a minute to the odd sound monkey cry andy smile broadly well i declare i have forget that they have they all through the tropical region around the orinoco the magdalena and the amazon and so that be a menagerie travel over the treetop be it wish i could just get a look well i do not think they be far away remark he chum not for I i know when i be well off this camp look good enough without my wander around in that awful place let 'em jabber and the yellow cat snarl but andy bird stay right at he fireside tonight and i guess you be right say frank as more noise arise all around they chapter xviii when frank stand guard pretty soon thing begin to look fairly cheerful in that lonely glade situate in the heart of the tropical forest a fine fire crackle and shoot up its red flame light up the opening in which the young aviator have so luckily alight andy be bend over the fire make a pot of coffee for they have bring along with they the necessary cooking utensil include a frying pan not know how long they might be adrift in the wilderness far from the domicile of any human be how do you find it he sing out for he chum have be examine the aeroplane as well as possible under the circumstance everything seem to be hunky-dory come the reply i be go to start up the engine now to see if it work without a hitch do not i hope so be what andy say as he pause in he task to watch a minute afterward he give a little cheer as the familiar throbbing sound be hear make the sweetest music that ever greet the listen ear of a aviator that sound good to I frank he cry nothing wrong about it thank goodness come the reply of the other as he again shut off power because they could not afford to waste a drop of they valuable supply of gasoline well suppose you drop in here and sample this brand of coffee what with the cold snack we bring and which still hold out we ought to get along right decently frank i tell you right now reply the other as he come up i be hungry enough to eat anything go yes even some of we native cook 's worst garlic-scented mess and that coffee just seem to make I wild shove a cup over this way as quick as you know how brother yum yum that go straight to the spot and this cheese and cracker be not half way bad even if it be pilot biscuit well say andy be not you a pilot all right and do not they feed sailor on this hard tack generally sure we have get no kick come everything be to the mustard and if you ask I my opinion right now i would say thing be come we way listen to that chorus would you remark frank as various sound arise all through the dense timber around they they seem to be head this way sure enough at that andy reach again for the gun on which he seem to depend so much well if any of 'em take a sneak notion to look in on we why i be mean to use up a few of these flat-nosed cartridge in this six-shot magazine he remark sturdily as he glance cautiously around no fear of that now say he chum reassuringly the danger will come if it do at all later on when we have more trouble keep the fire go so after we get this supper down we shall have to gather fuel it may not be quite so nice to go after it when we see a line of yellow eye watch all around oh shuck you be just string I now frank if i really think they would be as bold as that why i would climb a tree that be what what good would that do tell I jeer the other why these cat just live in tree and can leap twenty foot if they can one perhaps if you find a hollow tree now you might feel safe but in the branch of one -- never why the monkey would come and laugh at you the ground be the best place for we after all andy more coffee in the pot if you be not afraid of stay awake suggest the cook that would just suit I for you see i be more afraid of go to sleep than anything else while on guard duty frank remark soberly by degree andy realize that this business of camping in the heart of a tropical forest be no laughing matter still they have escape so many threatening peril that he be begin to believe they must be under the protect wing of some favor god and that success lay just ahead they sit up and talk for a long time neither would admit be at all sleepy and yet frank catch he chum yawn ever so many time here you just make up you mind to turn in and get seven wink he say pretend to be give order with all the air of a commanding officer i suppose i 'll just have to come the reply as the other start to roll up close to the fire for they have no blanket with they this time do you know i be just think about puss well what of he ask frank what if they start to chase we again in the morning be we go to put up with that funny business right along i say no let 's warn 'em that we be arm and can bear a hole right through they jolly old biplane upset they any time they get close enough i be draw the line on tomorrow because somehow i feel it in here that it be go to be the greatest day of my life and andy lay he hand on he heart as he speak yes that would be we best plan admit frank we have already stand quite enough of that funny business as you call it they even fire at we depend on it andy they will not follow we very far next time and andy see the way he chum 's mouth be firmly set make up he mind that frank have reach the end of he patience contented with the prospects for the morrow he therefore lay down to get some sleep i say frank he call out presently well what now ask the one on guard who have possession of the rifle and have take up he position so that he could have a clear view of the open space all about the camp if one of the prowler try to drag I off remember i have get my leg tie to this stake i knock into the ground while he be tug you can have a bully good chance to knock he over see all right grinned frank i 'll remember but let out a whoop if you feel yourself go i might be look the other way you just bet i will mumble andy curl himself up as near the fire as he dare creep and in three minute frank know from the heavy breathing come from that quarter that he chum have find no trouble in get to sleep regardless of the various sound well up from the neighboring forest and the fear that possess he boyish soul frank sometimes sit down and again feel cramp in this position he would rise to he foot and walk back and forth but all the time he keep the gun in he possession with the hammer pull back ready for business and constantly do he maintain a close watch along the nearer border of the undergrowth that lay there so dense and fill with mystery time pass on it seem as though a thousand thing flit through the active mind of the young aviator as he thus stand guard over the camp once again he be back in good old bloomsbury where he have spend so many happy day he could see the face of he boyhood friend larry elephant and other frequently he would detect a movement here or there among the tree and at such time he could easily imagine that some animal belong to the forest be creep closer in the question be whether simple curiosity urge they to do this thing or a design upon the occupant of the camp frank have be in other situation call for considerable pluck and never fail to meet the emergency nor do he now it must have be some three hour back that andy lay down to sleep that have be the limit of time arrange upon but frank do not show any sign of intend to awaken the other let he sleep he say to himself as he walk up and down for by now he be begin to feel very drowsy himself in spite of the coffee he need it more than i do and besides i be a little dubious as to what sort of watch andy would keep anyhow i can stand it a while longer hello what be that mean he attention have be attract toward a movement in the brush at the nearest point of the forest it be not thirty foot distant could one of those long-bodied muscular jaguar cover that distance in a wild leap what if without warn he should see a tawny figure flash through the air and head straight for he frank throw the gun up to he shoulder as if to try and see how readily he could cover such a fly form as he do so he hear a low and ominous growl which undoubtedly spring from the very spot where he have just catch that suspicious movement he bent he head to look closer and as he do so a exclamation fall from he lip and that be no owl stare at I either he say to himself as he catch the singular glow of what seem like two ball of fire just under the lower growth frank know what they undoubtedly must be he have see the orb of a cat shine in this phosphorescent way in the darkness there could be no doubt but that he be be survey by one of those savage beast whose whine he and andy have hear around the camp for hour and i declare if that purr sound do not come from there too he mutter as he sink down upon one knee the better to aim he rifle what be that the old seor be tell I about these beast do not he say they jerk they tail to and fro like a pendulum and make a queer noise just before they jump if that be so then this fellow be get ready to leap over right now time i be do something if i do not want he to drop on my chum like a rubber ball well here go to take he between those yellow eye steady now my boy steady chapter xix firebrand and jaguar bang wow be they come in on we shout andy suddenly arouse by the sharp report of the repeat rifle he bound to he foot and from he manner of action it be plain to be see that he remember exactly the condition of affair at the time of he take passage for the land of dream frank have aim straight between those glowing eye at the time he fire and as he be perfectly calm at the time it stand to reason that he bullet go direct to the mark he mean it should he see a yellow object thresh about under the dense growth and realize that he have give the adventurous jaguar something that be apt to wind up he career as a terror to the monkey host of the forest but this be not all frank saw another figure have appear just ten pace farther along and he realize that a second jaguar have creep out of the copse evidently bent on charge the camp there be two more frank oh my it be a dozen i guess whoop andy who have find a better opportunity to see in other quarter grab a firebrand quick shout frank try to get a bead on the second slinking figure and yet hesitate about firing because of the great risk that must ensue should he only wind the fierce monster he see out of the corner of he eye that andy make a plunge toward the fire and be snatch a brand out in each hand wave they around you head and shout like thunder he cry at the same time start in to do this latter himself perhaps it be a comical thing in some respects andy often laugh over it afterwards but just then it seem serious enough the way both of they let loose with they strong young voice would have make a football cheer captain turn green with envy they fairly awake the echo slumber in the depths of the forest and andy wave those two torch like a good fellow back and forth in and out weave they as a expert indian club athlete might do with he heavy weight until the rush flame roar again and again because of they rapid passage through the air they be lick already frank whooped andy as he daringly begin to advance with he flaming beacon swing around and around look at the coward move back would you talk to I about you gun they be not in it with these thing when it come to scare off a pack of wild beast scat you terror or i 'll just swat you one alongside you jaw growl at I will you there take that hang you to the astonishment of frank andy who have rush straight at one of the retreat animal suddenly hurl a blaze brand straight at the jaguar in he palmy baseball day andy have never amount to a great deal as a pitcher but all the same he make a beautiful throw right then and there the whirling blaze fagot of wood strike the slink beast full in the side frank throw up he gun ready to shoot should the jaguar as he fear might be the case leap at he chum but there prove to be no need instead the brute be evidently alarm at this novel weapon something entirely beyond he ken frank hear he give a snarl that tell of mingled rage and fright then he make a spring but _ away _ from the fire and into the dense undergrowth from whence he have just issue so bravely look around frank saw that the glade be desert of four-footed foe the whirling torch have do the work bully for we shout the excited andy ready to dance in he delight over the success of he labor do not we send 'em a fly though perhaps they just dare to come snoopin ' around here again when they be not ask frank i guess you nail that critter all right dast we look and see sure we will return frank instantly pick up another bit of burn wood then let I go just ahead of you so that i can shoot if i have to they thus boldly advance toward the spot where frank have first sight the blaze yellow orb i can see something there declare andy who possess sharp eye yes it be the beast all right but i can not say for sure whether he be down on he back or crouching for a spring careful not so fast andy and frank keep cover the object with he rifle as foot by foot they keep on he be lie on he side he be a dead duck all right sing out andy wave he fire vigorously to and fro you be right he be stone dead observe the other a touch of natural pride in he voice for it be no mean feat to kill so ferocious a beast as a jaguar after see only he two eye shine in the darkness beyond the fire-light frank stooped down and catch hold of one of the dead animal 's hind leg start drag it toward the fire hold on there say andy do not tell I we be go to have a steak off that old cat i can stand for a good deal but i would go hungry a long time before i would eat any of _ he _ do not worry about that laugh frank but think what a bully old rug he hide will make some day i be go to try and take it off if i can while you be get breakfast in the morning it be worth while andy look as though he doubt the ability of he chum to accomplish the feat but then he be count without he host for when the chance come frank deftly remove the pelt and keep it for a reminder of he hazardous shot andy insist on take he turn at play guard when he find out what time it be first of all frank saw that the fire be revive with plenty of fuel handy then after give he chum a few last instruction he consent to lie down but he sleep could not have be very sound for frequently he would raise he head and take a look around see nothing suspicious he would again lie down so the night pass away frank be on deck a hour and more before the dawn come he feel too anxious concern the possibility of the coming day to sleep much so andy start to get breakfast such as it be before the night have really go he excuse himself by say that while he be not at all hungry the operation have to be go through with and the sooner he be at it the quicker they might be free to mount upward frank know what a terrific load be on he chum 's mind and how he thrill with suspense now that they be so near the realization of he highest hope or worst fear and so he too set to work to remove the jaguar skin for it would make a pretty decent rug if it could be properly preserve morning be just break as they sit down to partake of the simple meal neither of they seem to care for much it be indeed no time for feast or make merry when the day have probably dawn that be to settle they mission one way or the other one thing good remark andy hopefully there do not seem to be any strong wind blow this morning frank have be study the lay of the land in the glade i tell you we be go to have all we can do to squeeze up out of here without scrape against any tree before we can rise above they he observe presently but do not you think we can do it demand he chum anxiously watch he expressive face i think it be possible come the slow reply which after all give andy new cause for distrust since he cousin be so cautious a fellow that he seldom if ever gush over anything at the same time he never express doubt when he feel positive but cry andy there be no other way to fly we could not take the aeroplane to another place and i reckon there be not a clear field within ten mile of here no it must be do right where we be now i be go to measure the open to find out its widest dimension then we will take the monoplane as far back as we can and make all arrangement for a rapid start but to rise above those tree even the shortest of they be go to call for considerable management and some great good luck in the bargain but frank you have do it before declare andy you know you make lot of short start that beat all the record that be you best hold and frank we have just get to get out of here everything depend on it sure respond frank cheerily enough and we 'll manage somehow never fear now to foot off the space count to yourself and we 'll compare note when i get to the other side this look the widest range accord to my eye so they both start off frank place one foot close in front of the other and andy keep alongside in order to do he own counting in this way they pass from one side of the glade to the other and frank be secretly pleased to find that the distance be considerably more than he have judge possible besides the tree happen to be much lower on this side which fact would be of considerable benefit to they when they start to make the run and rise frank be still mutter the number of foot to himself and have arrive within something like five yard of the nearest tree when without the slightest warning he hear andy let out a screech that could have but one mean he have surely sight something that spell peril to one or both of the bird boy frank have wisely keep the rifle in he hand and instinct cause he to throw this up to he shoulder though as yet he have not the slightest suspicion as to what the nature of the danger might be nor the quarter in which it lay chapter xx the aeroplane boy once more afloat frank oh frank more than a few time have it fall to frank bird to drag he cousin and chum andy back from some impending danger now the shoe seem to be on the other foot even as he look hastily up startle by these sudden cry frank feel he arm seize in a frenzied clutch and himself jerk backward what be it andy here hold on let my arm free and tell I he exclaim look there and you be go to walk right up against it oh frank what a horrible monster andy reply in tremble tone as he strive to point toward something that he have see just in the nick of time whew i should say you be right be not he a dandy though and if i see he at all i think it be a great big vine hang from that tree ugh look at he stretch he mouth would you andy thanks to you sharp eye i be here instead of in he slimy fold i guess he could crush a ox they say nothing can stand the pressure once they get a couple of fold around be it a python gasp andy he horrified eye glue on the spectacle of the slightly sway ten foot of snake that hang from the limb of a great tree in part as thick as frank 's thigh about the same thing reply frank down here they call they anaconda and in other part of the world they be boa-constrictor i guess the whole bunch belong to the same family of squeezer but that fellow be in we way well yes if you be still determine to run the aeroplane across lot toward this side of the opening andy remark with a shudder why perhaps that old chap might get gay and grab hold just when we expect to go sailing off that would be a calamity not only for he but the bird boy in the bargain all right then he be get to get he frank observe what be you go to do demand the other nervously take a crack at he head come the reply once let a flat-nosed bullet from this little marlin hard shooter smack he on the coco and there 'll be a funeral in the anaconda family but for goodness ' sake make sure work of it frank what if you just wound the monster he would come whirling along at we like a hurricane and i be sure he must be thirty foot long if he be a dozen look at the thickness of he neck would you be mighty careful for he head 's swing a bit you notice that be what make I get sight of he say frank well hurry up he may take a notion to move off and i would lose my chance andy how would it do for I to get some fire and shoo he away suggest he cousin do not know how it would work reply frank smile a little however at the faith andy seem to have in a blaze brand now that he could look back to he late experience with the jaguar never hear that snake be afraid of fire and besides there be no need now keep quiet and watch you 'll see something worth while but be ready to jump clear he have already drop down on one knee the marlin stock rest against he cheek and he eye sight along the barrel andy fairly hold he breath he startled eye glue on that sway head of the monster then come the sharp report as frank pull the trigger he instantly jump back and by a rapid motion of he hand send another cartridge into the chamber the clever mechanism of the gun prove that it be build so as never to fail in a emergency andy have accompany he chum in that backward movement but never for a instant do he remove he eye from the strange spectacle that be take place there in front of they both undoubtedly the well aim bullet have crash through the fearful head of the suspend anaconda instantly it release its many coil above and a tremendous length of writhe snake could be see whipping over the ground nothing in the way of small vegetation could stand in the path of those powerful springy coil as they shoot this way and that oh my gasp the astounded andy as he move farther back so as to avoid any chance contact with the fly destructive force that be level everything in the glade for twenty foot around do you ever see anything to equal that talk to I about you harvesting machine here be one that be get 'em all beat to a frazzle be not he ever go to give up the ghost frank guess these anaconda must have the nine life of a cat well remark frank you must have forget that among boy it be say that a snake will not die till sundown i have see one 's tail wiggle hour after we think the thing be stone dead there he be move off into the forest and a good riddance while i would like to measure the serpent just from curiosity we have get no time to waste wait for he to kick the bucket that be right assent andy and as for go anywhere near such a whirlwind you would have to excuse I they watch the die anaconda gradually vanish in the depth of the forest and both boy be glad that it have turn out that way since they be anxious to depart from the place do not i wish i would have my little camera along so i could have snap a shot at that dandy chap the fellow would believe I then when i tell about what happen to we here and anyway frank i do not think we 'll forget this camp do you well hardly reply he chum smile broadly because we have sure have enough happen to we here to make we remember but i be glad to find there be go to be more space for the run than i think at first we 'll need every inch of it declare andy as he look dubiously at the top of the lower tree about the place where the snake have hold forth do not i wish we have bring a few stick of dynamite along though for goodness ' sake what would we want with dynamite think you could have blow up that snake do you ask frank as they start to cross the glade toward the wait monoplane oh shuck no i be think how we could plant 'em under a bunch of those tree and enlarge the gap declare andy at that frank burst out into a hearty laugh what a fellow you be for wild notion think of we blow up the forest to make a aviation field i reckon however see that you have not get the dynamite andy we 'll have to do the best we can take hold here and we 'll push the machine just as far back as it will go perhaps we can gain a few yard at this end that will count in the long run frank be particularly careful about every little detail he know just what he have to depend on in the past he have make it a pet hobby to rise in as short a space as possible and now this faculty seem destine to prove a valuable asset in they speedy climb up all ready he ask grimly andy take one last look at the face of he chum he see that frank 's mouth be compress in that firm way that stand for so much and somehow andy be waver confidence return in full measure when frank bird look like that thing always have go accord to he will and they must now yes i be fit frank he say quietly let she go when you be ready in the many time that the two boy have make ascent andy could never remember that he pulse throb with one-half the suspense they do now not even on that never to be forget initial performance when for the first time they feel the strange sensation of leave the solid ground in a fly machine have he be so excite so nervous so fill with alternate hope and fear frank have take every possible precaution he have thoroughly study the ground and make sure that no obstacle would be apt to cause the run gear of the aeroplane to swerve and thus throw they off they course all he could do be to start the machinery get a rise at the quickest possible second and be ready to shut off power if he realize that the feat they be about to attempt be impossible so as to avoid smash the plane against a tree then here go he say calmly andy hold he breath as he hear the engine start off at a tremendous speed he feel as though a giant hand have pluck they from the spot where the aeroplane have be plant for the start across the glade they go speed he heart almost jump into he mouth he believe as he feel the little craft start to leave the ground as frank manipulate the plane and elevate they so as to catch the air under the broad blade they be rise rapidly now would they manage to clear those terrible treetop that stand like a grim barrier in they path higher yet do frank throw the plane so that they actually seem to be climb straight upward accord to the vivid imagination of andy who clutch the upright at he side wait for what be go to happen it be too late now to retreat they have go too far to stop and try again no matter whether for good or ill they kite have be toss to the wind of heaven and they must abide by the consequence andy give one little squeal for it could not be term anything else under the sun this be when they shoot past the most prominent branch of the tree that happen to stand directly in the way of the rise aeroplane andy believe that the wheel below must have actually brush through the foliage for he always declare that he hear a fierce swish as they pass have they catch even one little bit something dreadful might have happen and the precious aeroplane on which everything depend meet its sad fate not to speak of the nasty fall the bird boy would have suffer but fortune be once more kind to the young adventurer they pass safely through the peril and be speedily fully launch upon the wide open expanse of space hurrah shout the exultant andy but it might be notice that he voice be a bit husky even as he face seem chalky white a close shave remark frank who himself have be rigid while they be thus take such desperate chance but we make it thank goodness i hope that will be a lucky token of what the day have in store for we amen echo he chum and there be no levity in he tone either the sun be just rise below they lay the dense foliage of the almost impenetrable forest from which they have just make this almost miraculous escape and both young aviator as if by common consent start to sweep the horizon around with they eye see anything of it ask andy eagerly i think i do away over yonder toward the mountain but i guess it must be a big bird hover high up a condor perhaps frank reply well there be not any sign of the biplane that be sure andy go on in a relieved voice perhaps they do not have as good luck in landing as we do and have a nasty spill do not i hope they bust some of the plane or part of the little old gnome engine so we will not have to be bother with 'em again frank make no remark while as a rule he refuse to let anything like bitterness dwell in he heart still this be a case where everything be at stake and if the bothersome revolutionist keep chase they in the biplane they be apt to give a great deal of trouble and secretly he could echo andy 's wish that the biplane might be temporarily cripple so as to be unfit for fly now what be the program ask andy when they have cover several mile we have just get to head for the mountain yonder reply he chum you know he declare it be a valley that lay among the mountain and it must be to be surround by high cliff once we get among the hill we 'll sail back and forth comb the whole region and hope sooner or later to discover he queer prison andy lapse into a state of silence but he keep watch ahead as they draw gradually nearer the uplift doubtless but one thought hold dominion in he mind and this be that somewhere amidst those same mountain the father whom he love so dearly be wait and hope for a answer to he appeal for aid chapter xxi the last little hot air balloon do you ever see a wilder region ask frank about the middle of the morning when they have alight on a broad level plateau so as to allow he to look over some little matter connect with the engine that he believe need attention andy have be use the binoculars pretty much all the time they be aloft but without any success many time be begin to think he have sight something that look like cliff rise up and a wild hope have seize upon he devoted heart but upon frank bring the airship in that quarter in answer to he frantic appeal it have prove to be a false clue cliff they see in plenty but as yet none enclose a valley so as to imprison a unfortunate aeronaut whose runaway balloon have drop with he into its depths still the day be not nearly half over and the monoplane behave splendidly so that they could hope to continue the search as long as they supply of gasolene hold out i 'll never give up hunting andy declare as he stand there watch he chum potter with the engine and examine thing in general no not as long as this fine little machine stand by we we can get more gasoline if necessary for we bring a good supply aboard the boat when we have go as far as we dare down this way we 'll make another start further on i be with you chum andy and you do not need to be tell that observe frank quietly while he work on as if i do not know that and count on you through thick and thin declare the other with a look of sincere affection well now we be ready to go up again remark frank and there be no use ask if you feel like it so pile in and we 'll make a fly start from the top of this rocky plateau what a difference from we last start observe andy with satisfaction for they be on a elevation with a valley far below and the air be decidedly brace for the tropics i should say it be laugh frank do you know what it put I in mind of i bet you be just think of when we win that race to the summit of old thunder top where nobody have ever be able to climb before and how we have to make we start for home from that little plateau plunge off into space just what i be declare frank but here we have a longer swing and it be go to be a snap of a launch compare with some we remember ugh grunt andy will i ever forget the one this morning but let loose my boy i have just sight a likely look place away over yonder at the time you say we ought to take advantage of this fine landing stage to look thing over just head she that way when we get go will you sure anything to oblige assent the other the launch be just as easy as they have anticipate indeed frank seem to have get this part of the program down to a fine point and could accomplish it apparently as well as a wright or a curtiss ten minute later and the monoplane be soar toward the region which andy have denominate as a likely spot look at that big bird watch we from that pinnacle yonder exclaim andy as he lower the glass for a moment i see he reply he comrade and there be no doubt now but what that be a condor of the ande he think we must be some sort of bird which we be of course and be wonder whether he ought to flap he wing and go up higher or hide behind that church steeple of rock i only hope he do not take a measly notion to fight we that be all remark the other as he glance anxiously toward where the marlin be secure to the framework of the airship no danger of that frank continue a condor be like we vulture or buzzard a scavenger and he lack the bravery of the bald-headed eagle that attack we when we come near he nest on the tip of old thunder top look there he be off andy and at a good lively clip too good-bye old chap and good luck andy have lose all interest in the great bird of the western ande he be focus he attention upon the place that he have mark as a likely spot frank he say presently in a husky voice could you drop a little lower and slow down some that be easy reply he chum readily enough what have strike you now andy it look more and more promising to I come the slow reply as andy keep the glass up to he eye then you can glimpse something like cliff ask frank yes and there be no doubt about that part i be wait now to see if the wide valley be wholly enclosed and if it be you think -- it must be the place oh frank what if we be near the spot would he still be alive or have he give up the fight that condor perch up on the pinnacle -- be he only wait for the time to come when he could fly down perhaps -- oh what be that move yonder look frank frank something be come up above the top of the mountain can you see it if you could only take the glass and tell I for my hand be shake so i can not hold they brace up andy i can see what you mean without the glass there now it have rise above the line of rock -- something that bob to and fro like no bird ever fly -- something that float now this way and now that just as the wind blow andy upon my word i believe it be it must be -- oh say it for I please because i just can not find word cry the other it be a wonder that in they tremendous excitement something disastrous do not happen to the aeroplane but frank have wisely cut off some of the power so that they be just make fair headway at the time it be a little parachute balloon just like the one that carry that message into the cocoa grove of carlo mendoza ejaculate frank then it mean that we have find the valley prison gasp andy sure that be a fact the cliff yonder be on one side of it frank cried and frank do not you see the fact that another of those little messenger of hope have just come up out of the valley _ show that he be alive _ you just bet he be andy and we be go to be with he in three shake of a lamb 's tail declare the other andy could not utter another word he be too full of emotion so he just sit there and stare and wait he heart doubtless thump against he rib as it have never do before of course when frank give utterance to that boast he do not really mean it and only have the encouragement of he chum in view he know that it be apt to prove a difficult task landing in that enclosed valley where the vegetation must be of a tropical order first of all they must circle around over the wide expanse to take in its feature and discover the prisoner then frank could lay he plan accordingly gradually they begin to see more and more of those marvelous cliff they seem to stretch in a unbroken cordon completely around the valley if they be as near like adamant as they look it would take a man year to cut step to the lofty top even though he be give proper tool for the work and presently they clear the near side so that the monoplane float directly above the valley itself careful now andy warn the cautious frank hold yourself tight while we circle around drop lower all the time suppose you shout though i should think he would have hear the noise of we exhaust before now he have hardly utter these last word when there come a cry from below look look frank there he be oh what a bless sight that be my father and alive after all see how he run and wave he hand what will he say when he know that it be he boy in this airship come to save he call out and tell he say frank hardly able to control he own feeling though he know he must or they might meet with a accident in this supreme moment of victory so andy do shout call upon he father wildly and wave he cap to he the prisoner of the enclosed valley seem daze at first perhaps he have be deceive so many time by he dream of be save that he fear this might prove only another delusion they could see he stand there and put he hand to he head as he stare it be so very wonderful this come of a modern aeroplane to snatch he from he living grave and then that voice how like the one he have never expect to hear again but by degree as the little bleriot monoplane sink lower and the form could be more plainly see he begin to grasp the truth again he show the most intense excitement wave he arm and run to keep up with they wait say frank presently as he see that andy be so excited he could not carry on a intelligent conversation i be go to speak with he and find out if there be any clear spot where we can land uncle philip he shout presently when andy have subside this be frank you nephew and andy you own son be there any clear place where we can land the aeronaut understand because all this be right in line with the profession which he have be follow at the time of he vanish from mortal sight he indicate the quarter where a landing might be risk and upon investigate by hover over the same frank decide that it promise success so the aeroplane drop down and touch ground it bump along for a little distance and then andy leap out manage to bring its progress to a halt they be in the enchanted valley from whence those wonderful message have float one of which by a strange freak of fate have eventually reach the boy thousand of mile away for whose eye it have be intend and immediately andy be clasp in the arm of he father he know he despite the long gray beard which have grow during he many month of confinement with hope daily choke by despair he clothing be almost in tatters and he seem thin and peaked but the look upon he draw face now be of supreme happiness then after they have in some measure recover from all this intense excitement the boy sit down to tell what a miracle have be work bring the message to the home in far away bloomsbury with a arm still encircle the form of he boy professor bird listen and ask many eager question and to think he say finally that little messenger you see go up just now be construct of the very last fragment of the old balloon silk i make a fire with flint and steel fill it with hot air and send it up with prayer believe that it be my forlorn chance and then i hear the exhaust of you motor i fear my mind be give way under the terrible strain when i look up and see a aeroplane sail into view i fall down on my face believe i have go mad but it be a bless reality thank god plan be soon under discussion look to leave the valley as soon as possible about this time andy happen to think of something and begin to fumble at he pocket oh how i hope and pray when i buy that father that i might have the happiness of see you smoke some of it he say as he draw out a little packet of tobacco on which the late prisoner pounce with all the delight of a inveterate user of the weed who have long be deprive of a pleasure i have be use dry leaf of a wild grape and some other thing he admit but after all they be only vile substitute it be thoughtful of you my boy to remember my weakness and andy snuggle up close to he as he commence to puff at he pipe use a match for the first time in many moon and smile whimsically when he strike the same as memory play queer prank within meanwhile frank wandered around to survey the scene of the professor 's imprisonment and figure how they be ever go to get out with the aeroplane chapter xxii rescue what be the hurry ask andy when once they begin to talk over they plan for leave the valley for once frank agree with he chum they have plenty to eat along with they and it might be just as well to wait for another day by that time all of they would have recover to a great extent from the excitement that have tell upon they particularly the professor none too strong so it be finally conclude to stay right where they be until another morning when one at a time frank would endeavor to convey they out of the valley not daring to risk two passenger at once with such a poor field for the start the time pass quickly enough for there be a thousand thing to tell on both side the aeronaut describe he accident and related how he have live through all the dreary month that have go fortunately there do not happen to be any fierce wild beast in the cliff border valley and while he have have adventure with venomous serpent fortune have stand by he he show numerous little contrivance by means of which he have secure game enough to supply he need there be nut in abundance and some wild fruit which as a scholar he know the value of water could be have in plenty as a lovely stream flow through the valley diving down at one end and vanish in the rock to find a outlet such as the human prisoner pray for daily in vain why it be evening almost before andy realize it so quickly have the hour speed along how proudly have he father ask all about the monoplane which he examine with the most intense interest know it to have be mostly make by the two enterprising bird boy prom the way in which he smile and nod he head after this survey it be evident that he be very well pleased with what they have do and he also make they tell all about that famous race through the air to the hitherto unsealed crown of old thunder top which he remember very well and now let 's think of have a jolly little meal say frank as the shadow begin to lengthen down below the lofty cliff which be a pretty good indication that night could not be far away count I in say andy jump up for it be he duty to get busy when the time come to make a fire and prepare a repast i guess we have get coffee for a few time yet and i smuggle a can of boston baked bean along when frank be not look know that father use to be right fond of 'em coffee bean why you fairly take my breath away exclaim the one who for so many month have be deprive of all the comfort of civilization and force to sustain he life in the most primitive manner when supper be cook the professor make some excuse to wander off frank know though what ail he it be the aroma of that bless coffee that be what he say to andy who have look a little troubled at this action on the part of he father it be be so long since he be smell it that it just make he wild i know because i have a little experience that way myself once only it be two week i have to go without when we be camping and not many month when supper 's ready he 'll come with a rush mark I andy and he prove to be a true prophet for no sooner have andy lift up he voice to call that the meal be ready than the professor break through the bush and hasten to take he place frank lose not a second in fill a tin cup of the amber liquid and hand it to the late prisoner of the valley he taste and then nod he head nectar for the god my boy he declare one never know how little thing like this go to make up a portion of one 's life until a cruel fate have deprive he of they all and to think i have a boy so thoughtful as to fetch along a packet of smoking tobacco and a can of the real boston baked bean thank you frank that be a heaping pannikin you have give I but i suspect i be equal to the job they make a happy trio as they eat and chat and laugh perhaps that be the first hearty laugh professor bird have give utterance to since the day he start in he ill-fated balloon from colon on the caribbean coast to cross the isthmus of panama before they go to sleep that night all preparation have be conclude look to get out of the trap in the morning frank have make he estimation and know to a nicety just what he engine could do once free from the valley he believe they could head direct for the distant magdalena carry two passenger and make short flight it be true that as yet he have never take up any second passenger and it entail a additional tax upon the motor but he have great faith in the little kinkaid engine and feel that it would respond nobly to any additional demand make upon it but it would be advisable that he carry the professor out of the valley and land he on that plateau where they have make they last halt ere go back for andy then from that elevated place they could start on the return trip with everything favorable for a successful flight the night pass at length though it must have seem interminable to andy frank know that often he chum would rise up on he elbow and put out a hand gently just to touch the form of he sleep father close to he and frank do not wonder at it for there be time when even he find it difficult to realize that they remarkable mission have actually prove successful at length the day come they be early astir for much remain to be do and there would need be deft manipulation of the gallant little monoplane by its clever pilot if two separate flight out of the enclosed valley be to be undertake finally all be ready the professor have really next to nothing he wish to bring away the valley have grow hateful to he because of he enforced stay and he never want to see it again he take he place in the seat usually occupy by andy he face be grave for he know what risk they be run but surely the lad who have pilot the frail craft through so many peril would not fail now good-bye both of you say andy beam upon they as he prepare to assist in the launch please do not forget I down here and let I root hog or die for month bird of a feather flock together you know so come back again frank then come the start it be anything but a easy job to get go in the small space allow by the character of the valley but frank have figure it all out measure the ground remove such obstruction as promise to give trouble and have perfect confidence in he ability to make it and he do after that other ascent in the heart of the tropical forest he declare he do not mean to let anything appal he henceforth once they start circle the valley low down and just miss the top of the tree grow there andy send vigorous whoop after they and he father answer by wave he hand for hat he have none so guide by the master hand of frank bird the aeroplane rise above the line of those hateful and cruel cliff and for the first time since he captivity the man of science see the bless outside world again there be no trouble landing he on the accommodate plateau after which the aeroplane start back for its second passenger frank abate he vigilance not a particle he know that constant watchfulness must be the price of safety when one be venture to imitate the bird and soar through the upper current of the air down into the valley he drop the monoplane behave beautifully and presently he be shake the hand of he chum again once more be a start make frank breathe easier after it have prove a success for there be narrow escape from a collision with some obstacle and he know only too well what that stand for now we be all right i guess sing out andy as they come out of the depths and frank turn the airship in the direction of the distant plateau naturally andy be as happy as a lark singing and call as they glide along and find score of cause for attract the attention of he chum finally frank have to caution he to slow down and not try to make he look so much the trip be make in perfect safety indeed andy be now so confident of the capacity of the monoplane as well as the skill of its pilot that he express himself as ready to go anywhere in such a craft with such a driver it require some planning to arrange matter so that both andy and he father could be carry at the same time but frank have be figure on this and fix it in he mind even after the start he feel more apprehensive than he allow the other to see for this be after all a experiment aviator have go up with two passenger and in monoplane too but the limit of they stay aloft have never exceed two hour for the strain be very great so frank hope to find place where they might drop down to rest thus make the journey in easy stage he believe they have plenty of gasoline to see they through for a additional supply have be carry when start from the neighborhood of the boat but once they be afloat he realize that he have be borrow needless trouble for the gallant little aircraft just act beautifully and seem to be able to speed merrily along with two passenger almost as well as with but one of course there be many chance for trouble there always be when travel in a aeroplane since the least thing that go wrong mean a descent or a fall frank try no lofty flight he keep close above the tree top content to make steady progress in the direction where he little compass tell he they would find the river once away from the mountainous country and they be able to descend to still lower level where the chilly air change to hot and there be sign of life among the tree below -- bird monkey and other native of the wild show themselves at time it must have be a glorious sensation to the old aeronaut to be thus speed along in a modern up-to-date airship after he enforced idleness for so long again and again do he express himself in that way as he gaze over the expanse of country and then allow he eye to rest fondly on the form of he boy more dear to he heart than ever after what have happen i think i see a open place beyond remark frank after they have be move something like two hour after leave the high plateau and it might be wise while we have the chance to go down and look thing over then we will feel fit for another spell of work accordingly the aeroplane be head downward they circle the opening once or twice in order that the pilot of the aircraft might get he bearing perfectly and then he head for the ground even as they be just approach the earth frank hear andy give one of he customary exclamation such as announce a important discovery frank there be the biplane in the opening be what he cry yes frank himself have sight it now but the discovery come too late to have any effect upon they movement since they be bind to land not have room to rise again even do they wish to do so and frank as he feel the wheel under the aeroplane touch the earth also hear a loud cry and some lusty spanish expletive as a pistol be discharge chapter xxiii homeward bind -- conclusion as be he usual habit andy jump before the monoplane have stop frank on he part have no sooner see that everything be go well than he snatch the marlin rifle from its fastening he realize that they be up against trouble of some sort for those spanish exclamation tell he there must be one revolutionist at least close by ready to do battle frank look out he be get a pistol cry a voice which he recognize as belong to puss carberry just then he catch sight of a figure rush forward it be the same man no doubt whom they have see with puss in the biplane they have evidently break some important part in landing and ever since must have be busy try to mend the same stop when the advance revolutionist hear this sharp command and see that he be be cover by a rifle in the hand of the determine look pilot of the monoplane he size up the situation and then raise he hand in a way that mean he surrender drop that gun then order frank and as he do so puss seize upon it with a snarl of joy now we 'll see how two can play at that game you skunk grit the other as he snap the pistol straight at the head of the man here none of that puss you leave he to we he be we prisoner not yours order frank horrified at the rage which the other have show so puss find that he do not have any authority in the matter and that if he want to get assistance from he old-time rival in order to finish mend he airship and get away from so dangerous a locality he must do what they say he tell about how he and sandy have be out for a trial spin two day before that be when frank and he chum have sight they from the river but that very night some of the revolutionist have make a descent on the home of he uncle who have a cocoa plantation not many mile away from that of mendoza seize he and carry he away as they also do the little airship threaten with dire thing if he refuse to obey he have be compel to go up in company with the man who be now they prisoner a spaniard who have once sail in a balloon and know something about that type of aviation though have much to learn in connection with modern aeroplane sight we two bird boy of course puss have know who they be but the man be positive that they must be spy send out by the government to learn what the revolutionist might be do up the magdalena and he have threaten all sort of thing puss declare unless a hot pursuit be carry on secretly frank be of the opinion that it would require very little urge to make puss carberry do he level best to overtake any aerial craft pilot by one frank bird toward whom he have always feel the most bitter animosity after about a hour 's hard work frank manage to get the biplane in decent trim for a flight he be also able to spare the other some gasoline have he be allow to have he own way puss would have leave the spaniard in the forest where he might have die be unable to make he way to civilization but frank would not hear of it he obtain a solemn promise from the man that he would not make any further effort to obtain control of the biplane and then puss be make to take he aboard of course frank have make sure that the man carry no weapon and that he revolver be throw away they leave the glade in the forest soon after the biplane have start puss manage to keep close to the other while they head off toward the northeast he do not wholly trust the passenger he be carry and want to remain within call of the three who rely upon the monoplane to carry they to safety they could even shout out to each other as they sail along thus puss warn they when they be approach a camp of the revolutionist as they draw near the region of the river and they be able to change they course not wish to again run the perilous gantlet of gun-fire when another descent be deem necessary it be close to the magdalena though many mile south of the town where the cocoa planter live there be no reason why puss should also descend save that he wish to be rid of he unwelcome passenger the revolutionist might now make he way to camp and electrify he fellow with a stir account of he various adventure and one could easily guess that they would lose none of they zest in the tell puss do not expect to halt again when the monoplane be bring down he could make one flight of it now and reach the home of he uncle where doubtless sandy be mourn he as lose just as frank have expect puss on say good-bye try to appear as though something along the order of gratitude might be strive to gain a foothold in he crooked nature say frank i be sorry now i ever try to do you dirt he observe as he hold out he hand let 's forget the past and start all over again sure reply frank as he readily take the offer hand but it lay like a cold toad in he grasp as andy afterward express it for puss insist on also bid he good-bye ere he make a start in he biplane well now what d'ye think of that say andy as they stand and watch the other mount upward and catch the wave of he hand ere he start down river be fully five hundred foot high do he mean it frank would you really want to go so far as to trust that snake if the chance ever come again for he to do you a bad turn frank shrug he shoulder say ask I something easy will not you he remark because you know how hard it be for a leopard to change its spot perhaps puss _ have _ see a light but excuse I if i doubt it naturally he feel kind of cheap because we get he out of a bad hole and place he under obligation but that will wear off in a short time right it will declare andy i give you my word frank that the next time we see he he 'll have a fine story all fix about how he be just go to jump on that spanish revolutionary fellow and twist he gun out of he hand shoot he down and then fly away oh do not i know puss in boot though he 'll hate we both worse than ever just because he be beholden to we rat he reform not much by the middle of the afternoon they have advance far enough to know that another lap ought to carry they to town and of course all of they be anxious to have the journey complete if it could only be write up and swear to say andy enthusiastically i reckon it would go down in the annals of aeroplaning as the most wonderful stunt carry out up to date but people will not take we word for it we have get the evidence of it though in the person of you good dad and people may believe what professor bird say over he own honor signature however much they might doubt the yarn of a couple of boy frank remark as he take a last look to see that both he passenger be snugly settle ere start the motor we be on the home stretch now declare andy after they have again mount up into the realm of space and find they course northward yes observe frank we be homing pigeon now if any kind of bird at any rate laugh the professor we be bird of passage and one of they be mighty glad of the opportunity to get back into the old world again in due time they sight the town and as before the greatest excitement follow as they head across the place look to land where the journey have begin -- in the yard of the cocoa planter 's place of course seor carlo be delighted with the success of the mission for two day the bird boy be the center of a enthusiastic demonstration frank be a little nervous lest they be visit by some of the revolutionist but such do not turn out to be the case and on the third morning the little steam yacht once more head down the turbulent magdalena with a heavy rain promise more water to add to the flood as wet weather have seemingly set in again they meet with no difficulty on the way down apparently the camp of the revolutionist have be move from its former position at the narrow of the river it might be those in charge have take the alarm and fear lest a government force must be on the way to capture they after be inform about the camp by the spy they have send up the river and barranquilum be finally reach where they halt only long enough to chat a short time with seor jos who meet they as before on the quay and want to shake hand with the professor know just how anxious the government be to get possession of airship just then frank do not want to give they any further chance to confiscate he neat little craft under some pretense or other so they leave the city at the mouth of the magdalena and steam away bind once more for maracaibo where they mean to take steamer for new york new orlean or any port in the state the last glimpse they have of the river be the flood that be pour out between the jaw of land mark one of the mouth of the magdalena and make a distinct yellow area in the salty water of the tropical ocean the beloved little aeroplane have be safely box again and be make the homeward voyage in they company what strange and wonderful thing it have be through andy declare that they almost pass belief and he express he doubt as to they ever have a opportunity to pilot that same aircraft through atmospheric sea as tempestuous as those they have experience in the tropics while rescue the prisoner of the cliff border valley but then andy be not gifted with second sight and he could not foresee what the wonderful future might have in store for the bird boy they have by this time experience enough of the fascinating new method of cruise in cloudland to want to continue and it stand to reason that other adventure would be lie in wait for lad so constitute for the present it must be enough to say they arrive safely at good old bloomsbury in due time and that the entire population be on hand to greet the party when they step from the train also the wonderful little monoplane the same that have be equal to the test in the race for old thunder top have to be place on public exhibition for several day in the town hall where every man woman and child in all the country around could examine and comment on the construction of the airship that have bring fame and happiness to frank and andy bird in due time puss and sandy turn up minus they biplane which the government of colombium have seize on some plausible pretext though pay liberally for the same but they be soon at work construct another which they claim would far exceed the one that have be lose professor bird by slow degree recover he health that have be sadly shatter by he experience down in that country but he declare that he day be over so far as aviation go and that in the future he must be content to take a back seat and see the honor of the family carry off by the younger generation -- the bird boy the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of the
