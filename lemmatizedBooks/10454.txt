in which she be to travel be to consist of a individual who be well acquaint with the road and have frequently act as a the italian frontier mazzuolo as this man be call be a italian by birth and gladly undertake a commission which promise he a rich harvest of booty he bargain with the treacherous de monge be that if he make away with the life of madame louison while on the journey and before she could communicate with she husband he be to be at liberty to carry off all she baggage which contain valuable article to a large amount the italian stipulate that he wife dress in male attire and a lad on whom he could depend should accompany he everything be settle the morning of departure arrive adelaide have not see she travel companion till they with the carriage into which she be hand by mazzuolo with all the deference that she beauty and elegant attire might naturally command she wear a black velvet bonnet and chantilly veil a crimson silk pelisse trim with rich fur a boa of russian sable and over all a loose pelisse line with fur mazzuolo and he wife think that this augured well for the contents of she trunk the length of the journey the danger of the road and the goodness or badness of the inn they should have to rest at form the subject of conversation for the first hour or two the stage be very long and it be eleven o'clock before they reach they first relay of horse by which time the young traveller have decide that she have great reason to be satisfy with she companion the italian be polite and entertaining he have travel a great deal and be full of anecdote and be naturally lively and garrulous the design he entertain of take away the life of he charge do not prevent he make himself agreeable to she in the meantime with he well-seared conscience he neither feel nervous nor saturnine at the prospect of what be before he -- why should he indeed -- for the only part of the prospect he fix he eye upon be the gain the little operation by means of which it be to be acquire he do not think very seriously of besides he do not intend to perform it himself when they stop to change horse a lad of about seventeen year of age name karl nephew of mazzuolo 's wife come to the carriage door : he seem to have be wait for they mazzuolo speak to he aside for some minute and when they start again the youth mount in front of the carriage the italian say he be a lad they have engage to look after the luggage and be useful on the journey he be in fact one who be hire to do any piece of work good or bad he possess no moral strength could be easily lead by the will of he employer in short be a very useful ally he have a broad fair stolid german face and from the glimpse she have of he adelaide think she have seldom see a more unprepossessing-looking person he home have be a rude and unhappy one he manners be coarse and unpolished and he dress shabby the first day 's journey pass agreeably enough when they arrive at they night 's station mazzuolo have hand out the lady bid they go up stair and order supper whilst he and karl look to the putting-up of the carriage agostina or tina as she husband commonly call she insist very much on have a room for adelaide adjoining she own allege as she reason that they be answerable for she safety the bride thank she for she caution but add laughingly that she do not think she have much to fear it be some time before the two man join they and then they sit down to supper the lad karl act as waiter as he stand beside he aunt 's chair and exactly opposite adelaide he appear much affect by she beauty but of this of course the lady take no notice when supper be over be fatigue she retire to she room and then the party that remain close the door and bidding karl sit down and eat he supper they hold a council on she fate mazzuolo open the conference by mention that he have already give the lad a hint of what be expect of he and tina ask he if he think he be equal to the undertaking karl say he do not know whereupon they encourage he with promise of a handsome share of the booty tell he also that they would stand by he and help he if necessary but the question be how be the thing to be do and where whether on the road by day or in the night where they stop in either case there be difficulty many part of the road they have to pass be extremely lonely and fit for the purpose but then how be they to get rid of the postilion and as they have a fresh one at every stage there be no time to win he to they purpose then at the inn the obstacle be also considerable especially as the house be generally small tina suggest that whenever the bride drop out of the party she have only to resume she female attire and the people would never miss she ` karl can take my place in the carriage ' she say ` and i madame louison 's thus we shall appear to be as many as we be and there will be no discrepancy with the passport ' the hint be approve but after a hour 's discussion they find it impossible to conclude upon any plan the execution of they project must be leave to chance and opportunity -- all they have to do be to be prepare to seize upon the first that offer during the progress of this conversation karl make no observation whatever he listen in silence not without attention but without objection even although in the different plan that be propose he hear himself always designate as the active agent in the murder when the council break up the party retire to bed -- they present station be too near dresden for they purpose next day they resume they journey and as they way lay through a gloomy forest nothing but the presence of the postilion save the young bride 's life the night be pass at a post-house where there be so few room that adelaide have to sleep in the same apartment with the daughter of the owner : so here be nothing to be do either the italian begin to grow impatient at these difficulty and mazzuolo propose a change in they tactic on the previous evening the weather be very cold madame louison have order a fire in she chamber she would doubtless do the same on the ensue night and all they have to do be to fill the stove with charcoal and she death would follow in the most natural way in the world they be to pass the night at nuremburg and as soon as they arrive karl be send out to procure the charcoal but after remain away a long time he come back say the shop be all shut and he could not get any and as the inn at nuremburg be not a fit place for any other kind of attack adelaide be respite for another four-and-twenty hour on the follow day in order to avoid such another _ contretemps _ the charcoal be secure in the morning whilst they be change horse and place in a sack under the seat of the carriage it happen on this day that the road be very hilly and as the horse slowly drag the carriage up the ascent madame louison propose walk to warm themselves they all descend but tina be stout and heavy on she foot be soon tired and get in again whilst mazzuolo with a view to he design against adelaide fall into conversation with the driver about the different station they would have to stop at he want to extract all the information he could -- so he walk beside the carriage whilst madame louison and karl who be very cold walk on as fast as they could ` you look quite chill karl ' say she ` let we see who will be at the top of the hill first -- a race will warm we ' the youth stride on without say anything but as she be the more active she get before he and when she reach the top she turn round and playfully clap she hand say ` karl i have beat you ' karl say he have have a illness lately and be not so strong as he use to be he have go into the water when he be very warm and have nearly die of the consequence this lead she to observe how thinly he be clad and when the carriage overtake they she propose that as there be plenty of room he should go inside to which the other as they do not want he to fall ill upon they hand consent with the glass up and the fur that the party be wrap in the inside of the carriage be very different to the out and karl 's nose and cheek which have before be blue resume they original hue it be late when they reach they night-station and whilst the lady go up stair to look at they room earl receive he order which be that he should fill the stove with charcoal and set fire to it whilst the other be at table the lad answer composedly that he would ` and when you have do it ' say mazzuolo ` give I a wink and i will step out and see that all be right before she go to she room ' karl obey he direction to a tittle and when all be ready he give the signal and mazzuolo make a pretext quit the table he find the arrangement quite satisfactory and have take care to see that the window be well close he return to the supper-room he be no sooner go than the boy take the charcoal from the stove and throw it into the street and when adelaide come to undress there be no fire cold as it be however she have no alternative but to go to bed without one for there be not a bell in the apartment and mazzuolo who have light she to the door have lock she in under pretence of care for she safety karl have watch this proceeding accompany he back to the supper-table where they discuss the plan for the follow day whether would it be better to start in the morning without inquire for she at all and leave the people of the house to find she dead when they be far on the road or whether make the discovery themselves karl venture to advocate the first plan but tina decide for the second it would be easy to say that the lad have put charcoal in the stove not be aware of its effect and there would be a end of the matter if they leave she behind it would be avow the murder this settle they go to bed what to do karl do not know he be naturally a stupid sort of lad and what little sense nature have give he have be nearly beat out of he by harsh treatment he have have a miserable life of it and have never find himself so comfortable as he be now with he aunt and she husband they be kind to he because they want to make use of he he do not want to offend they nor to leave they for if he do he must return home again which he dread above all thing yet there be something in he that recoil against kill the lady grossly ignorant as he be scarcely know right from wrong it be not morality or religion that deter he from the crime he have a very imperfect idea of the amount of the wickedness he would be commit in take away the life of a fellow-creature obedience be the only virtue he have be teach and what those in authority over he have order he to do he would have do without much question to kill he beauteous travel companion who have show he such kindness be however repugnant to feeling he could not explain even to himself yet he have not sufficient grasp of intellect to know how he be to elude the performance of the task the only thing he could think of in the meanwhile be to take the charcoal out of the stove and he do it after which he go to sleep and leave the result to be develop by the morning he have be desire to rise early and when he quit he room he find mazzuolo and he wife already stir they bid he go below and send up breakfast and to be careful that it be bring by the people of the house this be do and when the waiter and the host be present tina take the opportunity of knock at madame louison 's door and bidding she rise to the great amazement of the two italian she answer with alacrity that she be nearly dress and should be with they immediately they stare at each other but presently she open the door and appear as fresh as ever observe however that she have be very cold for that the fire have go out before she go to bed this account for the whole thing and karl escape all blame during the ensue day nothing remarkable occur : fresh charcoal be provide but at night it be find there be no stove in the bed-chamber and as the house on the road they be travel be poor and ill-furnished all the good inn have be dismantle by the troops the same thing happen at several successive station this delay begin to render the affair critical for they be daily drawing near augsburg where m louison be to meet he wife and mazzuolo resolve to conclude the business by a _ coup de main _ he have learn from the postilion that the little post-house which be to form they next night 's lodging be admirably fit for a deed of mischief it lay at the foot of a precipice in a gorge of the mountain : the district be lonely and the people rude not likely to be very much disturbed even if they do suspect the lady have come unfairly to she end it be not however probable that the charcoal would be of any use on this occasion the place be too poor to be well furnished with stove so karl be instruct in what he would have to do ` when she be asleep ' say mazzuolo ` you must give she a blow on the head that will be sufficient to stun she then we will complete the job and as we shall start early in the morning with tina in female attire they will never miss she ' karl as usual make no objection and when they arrive at night at the inn which fully answer the description give and be as lonely as the worst assassin could desire the two man sally forth to seek a convenient place for dispose of the body neither have they much difficulty in find what they want : there be not only a mountain torrent hard by but there be also a deep mysterious hole in a neighbouring field that look very much as if the body of the young traveller would not be the first that have find a grave there every circumstance seem to favor the enterprise and all arrangement make the two man return to the house karl think it be all over with he now he be too timid to oppose mazzuolo and he have nobody to consult tina have find a weapon apt for the purpose which she have already secure and when they sit down to supper consider the completeness of the preparation nobody would have think adelaide 's life worth six hour ' purchase however she be not destine to die that night just as they have finish they supper the sound of wheel be hear then there be a great noise and bustle below and karl be send down to inquire what be the matter be inform that a large party of traveller have arrive and as there be a scarcity of apartment it be hope the lady and gentleman would accommodate the stranger by allow they to share theirs consent be inevitable so like the sultan 's wife in the arabian tale the victim be allow to live another day ` now ' say mazzuolo ` we have only two night more before we reach augsburg so there must be no more shilly-shallying about the matter if there be a stove in the room to-night we may try that though if the house be in a pretty safe situation i should prefer more decisive measure the charcoal have fail once already ' ` that be from bad management ' say tina ` we could be secure against such a accident on another occasion at the same time if the situation be favourable i should prefer a _ coup de main ' _ when they have arrive at they night 's station the absence of a stove decide the question it be merely a post-house a place where horse be furnish the accommodation be poor and the people dispose to pay little attention to they close by run a river which obviate all difficulty as to the disposal of the body ` the thing must be do to-night ' say mazzuolo and karl say nothing to the contrary he also fear that it must for he do not see how he could avoid it he aunt say everything necessary to inspire he with courage and determination and make many promise of future benefit whilst mazzuolo neither doubt he obedience nor he resolution and speak of the thing as so entirely within the range of ordinary proceedings that the boy stupid and ignorant and accustomed from the state of the country to hear of bloodshed and murder little less atrocious commit by the soldiery and neither punish nor severely condemn feel ashamed of he own pusillanimity -- for such he instinctive pity appear to himself but as he stand opposite madame louison at supper with he eye as usual fix upon she face he heart involuntarily quail when he think that within a few hour he be to raise he hand against that beautiful head yet he still feel within himself no courage to refuse nor any fertility of expedient to elude the dilemma when supper be over tina desire karl to bring up two or three pail of warm water and several cloth ` for ' say she ` it will do we all good to bathe we foot ' whereupon adelaide request one might be carry to she room which be do by karl he be now alone with she and it be almost the first time he have be so except when they run up the hill together since the day they meet when he have set down the pail by she bedside he stand look at she with a strange expression of countenance he know that the water he have fetch up be design for the purpose of wash away the blood that he be about to spill and he long to tell she so and set she on she guard but he be afraid he look at she look at the water and look at the bed ` well karl ' she say laugh ` good-night when we part the day after to-morrow i sha not forget you service i assure you ' the lad 's eye still wander from she to the water and the bed but he say nothing nor stir till she repeat she ` good-night ' and then he quit the room in silence ` poor stupid creature ' think adelaide ` he have scarcely as much intelligence as the horse that draw we ' ` now we must have no bungling to-night karl ' say mazzuolo ` we will keep quiet till two o'clock and then when everybody be asleep we 'll to business ' ` but what be it to be do with ' inquire tina ` there be something in the carriage under the seat i bring it away the night we sleep at baireuth ' reply mazzuolo ` i 'll step and fetch it ' and he leave the room but presently return say that there be people about the carriage and he be afraid they might wonder what he be go to do with so suspicious-looking a instrument ` karl can fetch it when they be go to bed ' as it be yet only midnight tina propose that they should all lie down and take a little rest and the suggestion be agree to she and she husband stretch themselves on they bed whilst karl make the floor he couch and favor by he unexcitable temperament be soon asleep in spite of what be before he it be past two o'clock when he feel himself shake by the shoulder ` come be stir ' say mazzuolo ' we must about it without delay -- the house have be quiet for some time ' karl be a heavy sleeper and as he sit up rub he eye he could not at first remember what he be awaken for nor how he come to be upon the floor ` come ' say mazzuolo ` come she be fast asleep i have just be to she room to look at she you must step down now to the carriage and bring up the axe i leave under the seat ' karl begin to recollect himself and awkwardly rise from he hard couch shake and stretch himself like a dog he prepare to obey indifferent to everything at the moment but the annoyance of be disturb in he slumber ` if you should meet anybody ' say mazzuolo ` say that you mistress be ill and that you be go to fetch the medicine-chest ' by the time he get below the motion and the cool air have arouse the lad and with he recollection revive he repugnance to the work before he but he see no means of avoid it and with a unwilling step he proceed to the yard where the carriage stand and have find the axe he be return with it when he observe hang against the wall a large horn or trumpet now he have see such a thing at several of the post-house on the road and he remember to have hear one sound on the night they sleep in the mountain when the traveller arrive late and prevent the project assassination instinctively and without pause to reflect how he should excuse himself -- for if he have he could not have do it -- he place the instrument to he mouth and lustily blow it : and then terrify at he temerity and its probable consequence rush into the house and up the stair again to he master ` the traveller ' horn ' say mazzuolo frantically the lad be too frightened to speak but stand still pale and tremble ` wait ' continue the italian ` perhaps it may only be for horse and they may go on again i hear the people stir ' foot be indeed hear upon the stair and presently a lantern gleam beneath the window ' i hear no carriage ' observe mazzuolo and for some time they sit listen but there be no appearance of any traveller he say he would go below and see how matter stand ` nobody be yet arrive ' say the master of the post-house in answer to he inquiry ` but doubtless the signal be give by the avant-courier who have ride on to the next station and the carriage will be here presently we must be ready with the horse ' as the traveller however do not arrive but continue to be expect the postmaster and the postilion remain up to watch for they and when four o'clock come karl be bid go to bed as nothing could be attempt under such circumstance ` now ' say mazzuolo on the follow day ` we sleep to-night at meitingen which be we last station i know the place it be too busy a house for a _ coup de main _ we must try the charcoal again but this time we must be sure of we game ' karl hope there might be no stove in the bed-chamber but it be a well-furnished house and there be adelaide say how glad she should be to have a fire again she have suffer so much by the want of one and desire karl to light hers early it appear however that the servant of the house have already do it mazzuolo say : ` so much the better the stove will get well heated and when you put in the charcoal there will be no danger of its not burn ' and tina suggest that that should not be do till just before adelaide go to bed lest she should perceive the effect of the vapor whilst she be undress the young traveller have never on she journey be in such high spirit as to-night well she might it have be so prosperously perform and to-morrow she be to meet she husband she prattle and laugh during supper with a light heart express she gratitude to the italian for they escort and say that if monsieur louison could be of any use to they she know how happy he would be to acknowledge they kindness to she ` really ' she say ` travel at such a period with so many valuable and such a large sum of money as i have with I be a bold undertaking ' mazzuolo during the first part of she speech be begin to weigh the advantage of the commissary 's favor against the danger and difficulty of the assassination -- difficulty which have far exceed he expectation and danger which be of course augment by the proximity to augsburg -- but the latter part of it decide the question the money and valuable preponderate in the scale and the good opinion of the commissary kick the beam partly from the exaltation of she spirit and partly because the day 's journey have be a short one -- for the stoppage at meitingen be quite unnecessary they be within four hour of augsburg and might very well have reach it -- adelaide be less fatigued and less willing to go to bed than usual she sit late and it be past twelve when have ask for she candle karl receive the signal to go and prepare the stove mazzuolo follow he out to see that the work be well do and the charcoal ignite before she go to she room when all be ready she candle be put into she hand and mazzuolo have conduct she to the door take the precaution of turn the key which he afterwards put in he pocket she rally he on the strictness of he guardianship but he allege gravely that the house be a busy one and she might perchance be disturb if she door be not secure they listen till she be in bed and then mazzuolo say that they could not do better than go to bed too ` for ' say he ` the earlier we be off in the morning the better there will be the fewer people up and the less chance of she be miss ' when karl reach he room he sit down on the side of he bed and reflect he have observe that the last thing mazzuolo have do before leave adelaide 's chamber be to see that the window be well close ` if i could open it ' think he ` to-morrow we shall be at augsburg and then i should not be tell any more to kill she i wish i could they 'll go away in the morning before she be awake and so i should never be find out ' with this idea in he head he go down stair and let himself out he creep round to the end of the house where she window be she sleep on the first floor and the difficulty be how to reach it but this be soon overcome in the stable-yard stand some high step use for the convenience of passenger when they mount the wagon and diligence these he carry to the spot and have reach the window he be about to break some of the pane since as it fasten on the inside he could not open it when it occur to he that the noise might wake she and cause a alarm that would betray he the window however be in the lattice fashion and he see that by a little contrivance he could lift it off the hinge he do so and draw aside the curtain there lay the intended victim in a sound sleep so sound that karl think he might safely step in without disturb she there she lay in she beauty he could not tell why but as he stand and look at she he feel that he _ must _ save she at all risk the air he have let in might not be enough he would take the charcoal from the stove and throw it out of the window but what if she awake with the noise and scream he hesitate a moment but he remember that this would be a safer plan than leave the window open as that might be observe in the morning from below and he would thus be betray so as quietly as possible he empty the stove and then have sufficiently air the room he hang on the window again and retire during the whole of these operation adelaide have remain quite still and appear to be sound asleep but be she no the opening of the window have awaken she : surprise and terror have at first keep she silent -- a surprise and terror that be by no means diminish by discover who the intruder be although she have always speak kindly to karl and even endeavor by the amenity of she manner to soften he rude nature she have from the first moment dislike he exceedingly and feel he countenance most repulsive so that when she see he enter she room through the window she do not doubt that he be come for some very bad purpose probably to rob she although the booty he be likely to get be small since she trunk with all she valuable property be nightly place under mazzuolo 's care for safety still the little money she carry in she purse together with she ring and watch would be a great deal to so poor a creature and expect to see he possess himself of these she think it more prudent to lie still and feign sleep than to disturb he but when she see that all he come for be to take the fire out of the stove she be beyond measure puzzle to conceive he motive could it be a jest but what a strange jest however he do nothing else he touch neither she money nor she watch though both be lie on the table but go away as empty-handed as he come the amazement and alarm that so extraordinary a visit necessarily inspire drive sleep from she eye and it be not till the day dawn that she so far recover she composure and sense of safety as to close they in slumber then however fatigue get the better of she watchfulness and she gradually sink into a sound sleep in the meantime karl whose unexcitable temperament insure he he night 's rest even under the most agitating circumstance be in a happy state of oblivion of the whole affair when he feel himself shake by the shoulder and hear he uncle say : ` come come rise and make haste the sun be up and we must get the horse out and be off ' karl be as anxious to be off as anybody : the sooner the better for he for if adelaide should awake before they start he on the one hand dread that he might incur he uncle 's suspicion and on the other that some new plot might be form which it would be impossible for he to evade so between the exertion of one and the other the horse be out the bill pay and the carriage at the door very soon after the sun have show he broad disc above the horizon tina in female attire and a veil be hand down stair by mazzuolo the waiter stand on the step and bow for the landlord be not yet up they all three step into the carriage the postilion crack he whip and away they drive rejoice in the meantime monsieur louison have become very uneasy about he wife he have receive no intelligence since she quit dresden for although she have in fact write more than once mazzuolo have not forward the letter day after day he have wait in impatient expectation till at length unable to bear he suspense any longer he resolve to start on the road she be to come in the hope of meet she when he reach the gate call the gozzinger he carriage be stop by a berlin contain two man and a woman it be load with luggage and think that this might be the party he expect he jump down and put he head into the window of the berlin to ascertain if he wife be there she be not : so with a bow and a apology he proceed on he way at meitingen he stop to change horse and the first question that be ask he be if he have see a heavily-laden berlin contain two man and a woman on answering in the affirmative he be inform that they have go off with the property of a lady whom they have leave behind and who be then in the inn and in a moment more the young husband press he bride to he heart but eager to chase the thief they waste no time in embrace but start instantly in pursuit of they on reach the same gate where the berlin have be see the officer describe in what direction the party have drive and the police be immediately on the alert the criminal be discover and arrest just as they be on the point of start for vienna the ample confession of karl disclose the villainy of the italian and make known how narrowly the commissary have escape the loss of he fair young bride whilst as he tell he rude and simple tale without claim any merit or appear to be conscious of any adelaide learn that to this repulsive stupid clown she have three time owe she life the italian be condemn to the galley whilst monsieur louison and he wife discharge they debt of gratitude to karl by first educate he and then furnish he with the means of earn he living with respectability and comfort de monge be degrade from he situation and the universal execration that pursue he drive he ultimately to america where under a feigned name he end he day in obscurity the home-wreck a few year since i visit devonshire to make the acquaintance of some distant relation whom circumstance have prevent I from before see amongst other there be one who live in a decayed family mansion about six mile east of the pretty town of dartmouth before call on she i be prepare by report to behold a very aged and a very eccentric lady she age no one know but she seem much older than she only servant -- a hardy old dame who during the very month of my visit have complete she ninety-ninth year the mistress never allow any one to see she save a young and interesting cousin of mine she seldom go out except on sunday and then be carry to church in a old sedan-chair by a couple of labourer who do odd job of gardening about the house she have such a insuperable objection to be see by anybody whether at home or abroad that she conceal she face by a thick veil these with other particulars be narrate to I by my cousin as we ride towards coote-down hall in which the old lady reside and which with the surrounding estate be she own property on approach it sign of past grandeur and present decay present themselves the avenue lead to the house have evidently be thickly plant but now only a few stump remain to mark where noble and spread elm once have be have arrive at the house my cousin rein up at the step of the hall upon which she in a low cautious voice desire I to alight have assist she out of she saddle i be about to utter some exclamation of surprise at the extreme dilapidation of the place when she whisper I to be silent add that i must not stir until she have return from within to announce whether my visit would be accept or not during she absence i have full leisure to look around and note the desolate condition of coote-down the lawn -- thickly overspread with rank grass -- could scarcely be distinguish from the fishpond which be completely cover with water-weed the shrubbery be choke and tangle whilst a very wide rent in the wall lay open to view a enclosure which have once be a garden but be now a wilderness for a time the sorrowful effect which all this decay produce on my mind be increase by the extreme solitude which reign around this however be presently relieve by a cackle sign of life which issue from a brood-hen as it fly from the sill of a side-parlour window on cast my eye further into the landscape i also perceive a very fat cow lazily browse on the rich pasture of a paddock on turn round to view the house new token of desolation be visible its shattered casement and worm-eaten door with tuft of weed grow at each corner show that for many year the front of the mansion have not be inhabit or its door open one evidence of fall grandeur be highly characteristic -- over the porch the family-arm have be carve in stone but be now scarcely distinguishable from dilapidation : a sparrow have establish a comfortable nest in the mouth of the helmet and a griffin ` rampant ' have fall from he place beside the shield and tamely lay overgrown with weed these observation be interrupt by the light step of my cousin who come to inform I that the lady of the house after much persuasion have consent to receive I conduct I to the back of the mansion my fair guide take I through a dark passage into a sort of kitchen a high and ample ` settle ' stand as be usual in farmhouse before the hearth in one corner of this seat recline a figure bent with age she face conceal by a thick veil in the other corner

keep she seat have procure a chair for my fellow-visitor -lrb- for the old domestic take not the smallest notice of we but go on with she work as if we be not present -rrb- i establish myself beside the hostess and address to she a few common-place word of greet she reply in a voice far less feeble than i have expect to hear from so decrepit a person but what she say be no answer to my salutation she go on with surprising clearness explain to I the degree of relationship which we bear to each other and trace my pedigree till it join she own continue we mutual genealogy back to the damnonius of cornwall hint that we ancestor of that period be large mining proprietor who sell tin to the phoenician at first she speak with doubt and hesitation as if she fear to make some mistake but the moment she get to where we branch join -- to the trunk as it be of we family-tree -- she go on glibly like child repeat a well-conned lesson all this while the old attendant keep up the unceasing accompaniment of she ballad which she must have sing through several time for i hear the first line -- ' a bailie 's daughter fair be she ' -- at least thrice though i address several question to my singular relation she make no attempt to answer they it seem that what she have utter be all she be capable of and this i learn afterwards be partly true circumstance of she early life have give she a taste for family history particularly that of she own and she faculty though otherwise impaired still retain everything relate to what concern she ancestry on we way back from this singular scene my cousin remark that it have sadden I ` it would sadden you more ' she continue ` be you to know the history of the domestic wreck we have just leave behind ' ` that be precisely what i intend to inquire of you ' ` it be a deeply-affecting story but ' -- and here the young lady blush and hesitate -- ' i think it would not be right in I to reveal it i believe i be the only person exist who know the truth and the means by which i obtain my knowledge would be deem scarcely correct though not perhaps exactly dishonourable ' this avowal sharpen my curiosity and i entreated she to say at least how she become possess of the story ` to that there can be no objection ' be the reply ` in one of my ramble over the old house i espied in a small escritoire a packet of letter bind up in tape which be seal at the end the tape have however be eat by moth and the letter liberate from it female curiosity prompt I to read they and they give I a full exposition of we great-aunt 's early history ' during the rest of my stay in that part of the country i never fail to urge my cousin to narrate the event which have bring coote-down to its present melancholy plight but it be not till i call to take leave of she perhaps for ever that she comply on that occasion she place in my hand a neatly-written manuscript in she own handwriting which she say contain all the particulars i require circumstance have since occur that render it not indelicate in I to publish the narrative which i do with but little alteration in the middle of the last century the proprietor of coote-down be charle jame hardman to whom the estate lineally descend from a long line of ancestor he be from he youth a person of a easy disposition who mind very little so that he could follow he ordinary amusement and could see everybody around he contented though he habit be too indolent to improve the condition of he dependant by any effort of he own at the age of twenty-five he marry the heiress of a baronet belong to the northern side of the county she be a beauty and a belle -- a lady full of determination and spirit consequently the very opposite to himself she be moreover two year he senior as be predict by those who know the couple intimately the match be not productive of happiness and they have be marry scarcely a year and a half when they separate it appear that this unpleasant step be solely the fault of the wife and she father be so incensed at she rash conduct that he alter he will and leave the whole of he property to hardman meanwhile it be give out that the lady have bring she lord a son and it be hope that this event would prove a means of reconcile the difference which exist between they despite all entreaty however mr hardman refuse to return to she husband 's roof ten year pass and she live so completely in retirement that she deprive herself even of the society of she child for when the period of nursing be over she send he to coote-down hall where he be educate at the end of that period she father die and to she great disappointment instead of find herself uncontrolled mistress of a large fortune she discover it be so left that unless she return to she husband she would be unable to benefit by it in the smallest degree mutual friend again interfere and after some difficulty persuade she to meet hardman at she father 's funeral which she appear to have no objection to attend the happy result be that a reconciliation take place and she resume she proper station as the lady of coote-down hall it be however observe that before she return the little son be send away to continue he education in a foreign seminary privy to all these arrangement and in fact the chief mover in they be hardman 's attorney such be the squire 's indolence of disposition that to this individual he confide everything not only the management of he estate the receipt and payment of all money but the arrangement of he most secret transaction but mr dodbury bear the character of a highly just and honorable man no suspicion ever exist that he abuse the absolute unbounded trust repose in he in the slightest degree indeed put aside the native honesty of he character he position in the district be so good that it would have be very bad policy for he to jeopardise it by any abuse of the confidence repose in he be the younger son of a ancient family and a distant relation of hardman he be receive in the best society dodbury be a widower with a only daughter a amiable and elegant girl she be just bud into womanhood when it be announce that the heir of

for sleeping-room yet there be not a bed to be have in dartmouth a week before the day name in the invitation ` for love or money ' it appear that the neglect which have be show to young hardman for so many year be to be atone by the magnificence of the fête to celebrate he return dodbury 's share in manage the affair of the family have decline every day since mr hardman 's resumption of she proper position as he patron 's wife she be a woman of strong intellect and perfectly able to superintend what have be before so much neglect by she husband she have a ambitious spirit and dodbury

with lady wave handkerchief the hall of the mansion be line with servant who obsequiously bow as herbert pass they when he make he appearance in the drawing-room there be almost a struggle amongst the

they this be miss dodbury the gentleman most of whom have accompany herbert from the landing-place now join the lady and mr and mr hardman enter the room amidst the hearty congratulation of they guest the fashionable dinner hour at that period be much earlier than at present and but little time elapsed ere the important meal be announce mr hardman lead forward a tall handsome but somewhat haughty-looking girl whom she introduce to she son as the lady elizabeth plympton desire he to lead she to the dining-room she attentively watch herbert 's countenance to observe what effect the damsel 's beauty would create on he but to she disappointment she see that she son receive she with no more than the politeness of a young gentleman who have be educate in france nothing occur during the day worthy of remark the usual toast and sentiment be drunk at the dinner-table and the usual excess commit for at that time it be think a mark of low-breeding for a man to remain sober all the evening out-of-door there be bullock roasted whole barrel of cider and butt of ale set constantly flow with dancing cricket and devonshire skittle and other country game and comfort for the amusement of the peasantry about a fortnight after the rejoicing have subside mr hardman while converse with she son on he future plan and prospects startle he by inquire whether he have form any attachment during he residence in paris the young man hesitate for a short time and declare that he have not upon which mr hardman ask somewhat abruptly what he think of lady elizabeth plympton ` that ' return herbert ` she ladyship be a extremely tall handsome proud girl who would evidently glory more in break half-a-dozen heart than in win one ' ` take care she do not break yours ' rejoin mr hardman playfully ` there be little fear of that mother ' herbert be right he have see one of humble pretension but of unbounded worth for whom he begin to feel already a more than ordinary sentiment month roll past and herbert begin to find he position at home far from agreeable he father have sink into a mere nonentity through he mother 's superior energy hence in she hand rest the happiness or misery of all connect with the household it soon become evident that she grand project be to effect a marriage between lady elizabeth plympton and herbert and when she find no inducement could warm she son 's heart towards that lady she conduct alter from be kind and indulgent she be exact and imperious : a old and scarcely natural dislike of she son seem to be reawaken and which she now take little pain to conceal it be therefore to be expect that herbert should spend as little of he time at home as possible he become a frequent and welcome visitor to the happy and well-ordered house of the dodbury the sharp eye of the mother be not slow in detect the attraction which draw herbert so frequently to the lawyer 's house though grievously disappointed she be cautious nothing could be do at present for though she son be manifestly ` entangled ' yet no overt declaration have be make and there be nothing to act upon she have the worldly foresight to know that opposition be food and fuel to a secret attachment and abstain from give grounds for the belief that so much as a suspicion lurk in she mind in this way month roll on herbert become more and more captivate on the other hand miss dodbury have strive against a passion with which _ she _ also have become inspire she father discourage it though tenderly and indirectly it be a delicate matter for a man to interfere in as no open disclosure have be make from either party but this embarrassment feel equally by the proud mother of the lover and the considerate father of the girl be speedily but accidentally put a end to a equestrian party have be form to see from berry-head a large fleet which have be drive by a recent storm into tor bay mr hardman have purposely invite catherine dodbury that she might observe she son 's conduct towards that young lady and extract from it a sufficient ground for tax he openly with a preference for she over the belle she have choose it be a lovely day and the party be all life and gaiety as almost all such party be for nothing tend to raise the spirit so effectually as equestrian exercise herbert laugh and chat with the rest of the lady and seem to pay no more attention to catherine than be due to she as the belle of the party which she be universally acknowledge to be as however they pass over the drawbridge of the fort build on the terminate point of the little promontory they be oblige to dismount herbert offer catherine he arm and mr hardman narrowly watch they she son say a few word in a low tone which cause the color to mount into the young lady 's cheek the listener overhear she reply -- ` mr hardman it can it must never be ' and withdraw she arm from he enter the fort unsupported these word at once pleased and displeased the ambitious mother the girl evidently do not encourage she son 's suit -- that favor the lady elizabeth project ` but ' think mrs hardman draw herself up to she full height ' do a lawyer 's daughter reject the heir of the hardman ' the truth be hardman the night before have declare he love it be on the drawbridge that he press she to give he hope but she reply repress rather than encourage they the servant have bring the horse into the fort that mount the spectator might see over the rampart the noble scene which lay before they to greater advantage the fleet consist of a number of merchant vessel with a convoy of king 's ship which be just prepare to sail out of the bay when the man-of-war have spread they canvas and begin to move a salute be fire quite unexpectedly by the visitor from the fort catherine 's horse immediately take fright and dart across the drawbridge with the speed of lightning herbert lose not a moment but spur he own steed gallop away take a circuitous route lest the clattering of he own horse 's hoof should impel catherine 's to run the faster on she speed and as long as she remain within sight she friend tremble lest some frightful catastrophe should happen presently she dart out of view herbert meanwhile gallop to meet she and at last succeed but alas when it be too late to render any assistance on come up he find both the horse and its rider prostrate the latter motionless and insensible he lift she from the ground and take she into a neighbouring house the usual restorative be apply without effect and it be not till a surgeon appear and bleed the patient that any sign of animation return it be discover that the right arm and three of the rib on the left side be fracture it be necessary that the utmost quiet should be observe lest any further and more dangerous injury might unknown to the medical man have take place though therefore the whole party assemble near the house they be not allow to enter it herbert insist upon remain with the father despite mr hardman 's repeat stricture on the impropriety of he do so scarcely a week have elapse after the accident already record ere it become a matter of gossip notoriety that the young squire of coote-down have fall in love with the lawyer 's daughter in truth he have not stir from the vicinity of the cottage in which catherine lay that he might get the earliest information from the medical attendant concern she condition prom day to day and sometimes from hour to hour he watch with intense anxiety the symptom improve daily the anguish cause by the fracture have subside the patient be in progress of slow but to all appearance certain recovery mr hardman now have sufficient cause to grind a strong opposition to the match she son be endeavor to make she speak to she husband but he good easy man could not he say see any objection to the alliance she be of they kindred and although poor would doubtless make a excellent wife the imperious and disappointed lady next apply to dodbury she place before he the inequality in the position of herbert and he daughter and be very vehement in she argument against the marriage ` you fear madam ' say dodbury calmly ` be at least premature however passionately you son may express himself in reference to my daughter she i know feel what be due to herself as well as to mr and mr hardman she would never consent to become a member of a family in which she would not be cordially receive besides i have yet to learn that she reciprocate the attachment which you say mr herbert evince for she ' the correct light in which dodbury thus consider the matter induce mr hardman to change she policy after compliment the lawyer and catherine for they honorable forbearance she go on to say that she unhappily have but little influence over she son ` would _ you _ therefore endeavor to point out to he the folly of he persistence in follow a young lady whom he can never marry ' dodbury promise to do so and the lady depart so well pleased with the interview that she write to lady elizabeth plympton invite she to spend the ensue month at coote-down that day after hear the most favourable report of catherine 's recovery which have yet be make dodbury invite herbert to dine with he after the cloth be remove the subject of the morning 's conversation with mr hardman be introduce herbert stammer and blush : he be not prepare to talk about it just then and endeavor to change the topic more than once but dodbury keep to the point till herbert own in fervent and glowing word that catherine have completely win he heart and that he would rather die than be force into a match with another woman ` all which ' reply the matter-of-fact man of parchment ` be very spirited and romantic no doubt but let we look at the affair with calm and clear eye you profess to love my child with strong and unquenchable passion ' ` profess do you doubt I ' ' i do not doubt that you be perfectly in earnest _ now _ but my knowledge of mankind forbid my put much faith in the endurance of the sort of feeling with which you profess -- i can not give up the word you see -- to be inspire my child so say the world be beautiful -- very beautiful yours may be a mere passion for she beauty ' ` you wrong I ' reply the young man ' i have know and admire she long enough to appreciate she intrinsic worth she image be as dear to I as my own life ' dodbury bent on he young friend a long and earnest look of inquiry he be a good reader of human nature he see that as the lover speak he eye lighten with enthusiasm he lip quiver with emotion he cheek glow with blush ' i have little faith in these violent emotion ' think the wary man of the world as he lean back in he easy-chair for a moment 's reflection ` fierce flame burn out quickly this affair surround I with difficulty ' about a month after miss dodbury 's complete recovery she father open the same topic gradually and delicately to she catherine have scarcely nurture a thought which she have not confide to she father be she only parent she look up to he as the direct source of all she action he be ` the king of she narrow world ' in discuss this matter therefore though overwhelm with a maiden shame she be not reserve from what she say the sorrowing father gather that she maiden affection _ be _ twine around a man whom she own innate propriety and pride not to include other obstacle should prevent she from marry this disclosure give dodbury great pain he determine to use more vigilance caution and prudence than ever he obvious course be to bring about if possible a reconciliation to the match with mr hardman but he refrain the purity of the young lover 's sentiment have yet to be try time he determine should put that to the test meanwhile lady elizabeth have accept mr hardman 's invitation she and herbert hardman be constantly throw together and it be manifest after a time that despite the almost study neglect with which he treat she ladyship she entertain a strong feeling in he favor this mr hardman endeavor by every means in she power to induce herbert to reciprocate but in vain -- the attraction of catherine dodbury be too powerful it must be own however that he vanity _ be _ a little flattered by the haughty beauty condescend to feel a sentiment for he this state of thing be too equivocal and uncertain to last catherine strive as long and as firmly as maiden could strive against she love whilst herbert feed he by every sort of attention it be possible to evince at length dodbury feel the necessity of some strong measure he perceive that consent to the match be less likely than ever since the tender regard which lady plympton have evince he therefore after a long interview with mr hardman pen a kind note to herbert in which he with every expression of regret for the step he feel bind to take forbid he he house or any further communication with he daughter though long anticipate this be a bitter blow catherine strive not to check the master-feeling which have now take possession of she whole thought and be for she know that be impossible but in the purity of she heart she feel she could love on -- more tranquilly more calmly now that all hope be abandon than when it be nurse in suspense deprive of herbert 's presence she would love he as a imagine ever-remembered be -- a abstraction of which the embodiment be dead to she for ever with this _ new say _ consolatory sensation she determine without a tear never to encounter he real presence again she write he a note to that effect and accompany by she father go immediately to london herbert be frantic he upbraid he mother with unfilial earnestness he appeal to he father who console he by say he be sorry that as he always leave these matter to he mother 's management he could not interfere add that so far as he be a judge the lady elizabeth plympton be a uncommonly fine young woman after calm consideration herbert make up he mind as to what he should do the estate be entail that make he comparatively independent and he would endeavor as well as he impetuous passion would allow to live on in the hope that at length he mother would give she consent and that catherine would retract she determination in pursuance of this plan he apologise to he mother for he previous wrath and treat lady elizabeth during the remainder of she visit with politeness but it be a study constrain and ironical sort of courtesy which pained the unoffending but humble beauty much more than overt rudeness when the young lady be about to depart he surprise he mother by the gallant offer of accompany she and they visitor to she father 's near plymouth these favourable symptom mr hardman report to dodbury who see he daughter 's perfect resignation think it might be not imprudent to return home especially as young hardman be to remain at the earl of plympton 's for a few week he however carefully conceal the apparent attachment of lady elizabeth from he daughter accordingly they return to they home catherine appear but a slight degree sadden and change in spirit a feverish languor however of which she neglect to complain or to ask medical advice for be make inroad on she health mr hardman after stay a week at the earl 's return congratulating herself on the seeming change which be gradually creep over she son 's sentiment she allow he to remain a month unquestioned but after that time family matter require herbert 's presence at coote-down and she write desire he to come home to she surprise she letter be return unopened frank by the earl herbert

the only conjecture which could be form be that as war have just break out with america he have be kidnap by a press-gang for the sea-service this be a last hope and hardman hang upon it as upon life he write to the admiralty and start for plymouth make every inquiry likely to settle the doubt alas though press-gang have be busy at they oppressive work no such name as hardman have be return as have be one of they victim the conviction slowly steal over he that some fatal accident or rash determination have end herbert 's term of life the dislike of she son of which mr hardman have be suspect now melt completely away into the fondest affection for he memory she however do not entirely abandon the hope of see he again what however of catherine all this while alas a misfortune have

a busy manufacturing town there be some forty year ago a indian camp occupy by a small band of the wild and warlike sioux they be not more than fifty in number have visit the spot merely for the purpose of hunting and lay in a store of provision for the winter it chance however that come unexpectedly upon certain assineboin who also be outlying in the wood follow the exciting duty of the chase a quarrel ensue end in a bloody contest in which the sioux be victorious with rude tent pitch without order or method in a open glade of the forest with horse tethered around and little dusky imp fight with the lean dog that lay loll they tongue lazily about there be yet a picturesque air about the place and its extraneous feature which would have captivate the eye of one in search of nature 's sunshiny spot deeply embosome within the autumnal tinted wood a purling spring that burst from the green slope of a little mound be the feature which have attract the indian to the locality rank grass have once cover the whole surface of this forest meadow but this the cattle have closely crop leave a sward that would have rival any european lawn in its velvety beauty and that fall away before the eye become inexpressibly soft as it sink away in the distance the setting sun gilding and crowning the tree top in wreathed glory be gradually pale behind the heavy belt of forest that enclose the sioux camp the animal both plumed and four-footed that fill the wood be seek they accustomed rest the squaw be busily engage in prepare for they expect husband they evening meal just as a long line of grim and painted warrior issue from the shelter of the tree a loud cry from the urchin that squat round the purlieus of the camp with a growl of friendly recognition from the ragged dog bring the woman to the entrance of the camp the indians come in in that silent and solemn manner which they be wont more particularly to assume after the occurrence of important event to the no little surprise of the squaw a prisoner accompany the return party and all thought be efface but those in connection with the promise scene of torture and amusement it be a young man faultless in form with feature which in any land would have be remarkable for they intellectuality and engaging expression he round limb and he erect figure well display as he tread unshackled and nearly naked be the admiration even of he enemy he eye be keen and pierce he lip curl in a expression of scorn and defiance while he inflated nostril no less marked the inward struggle of he mind as he scowl fiercely on he captor in the center of the camp be a strong but rudely-erected log-house that serve the purpose of a council-chamber and in this the prisoner have be so bind as to render escape unaid a matter of impossibility be leave while the warrior disperse to they wigwam in search of refreshment and repose a large fire burn in front of the council-hall which give forth so bright a glare that any one leave or enter its precinct could scarcely avoid be see by those around several maiden too have no hungry husband require they minister hand be congregate in front conversing upon the probable fate of the assineboin and even in some measure express pity for he expect death so far have he good look and youth go to create sympathy in the heart of the fair sioux ` let we see if the warrior weep ' at length say one of the girl with a laugh ` perhaps he will ask for a petticoat and become a squaw ' curiosity induce the whole bevy to agree and next moment they be all within the wall of the council-chamber the warrior smile grimly in they wigwam at this evidence of the universal feminine fail a dim and fitful glare from the fire serve to reveal the form of the luckless indian youth seat upon a log he eye fix upon vacancy for a moment curiosity keep the whole party silent and then education and habit exert they influence the group begin to put in practice those art which might be expect to awaken in the prisoner a exhibition of feeling derogatory to he dignity ` a assineboin have no eye he be a burrow mole ' say one tauntingly ` he creep about the wood like a serpent and fall into the trap of the hunter : a beaver be wiser than he he be very cunning but he can not deceive a sioux : he be very brave but he be a prisoner and not a wound show that he struggle go it be a squaw whom my people have bring in by mistake ' a general laugh be the reward of the speaker 's wit while the indian move neither eye limb nor muscle the girl irritated open upon he with all that volubility of tongue which so strongly characterise they race it be however in vain the sun in the heaven be not more unmoved -- a marble statue would have be life behind he -- not a look or sound not a glance testify that he even hear what be pass wearied at length with they vain effort the bevy rush forth into the open air and join hand commence with loud cry and laughter a dance round the fire a deep and heavy respiration be the only sign the indian give of consciousness -- he quick and practice sens tell he he be not alone ` son of the evening light ' say a low and gentle voice address he by a name which be well know in she tribe as that of they most dreaded enemy ` the morning will come and it will find my brother thirst for blood ' ` the vein of ah-kre-nay be very full ' reply the warrior calmly ` they can all drink ' ` the son of the evening light be very brave ' say the other hurriedly and in tone which exhibit strong feeling ` but life be very sweet would he hunt again in the forest -- would he hand once more strike the grizzly bear ' suspect some deep and cunning artifice of he enemy beneath this unmistakable offer of escape on the part of the fair peritana the indian be sternly silent though the tone which truth assume be so powerful and expressive that he feel almost convince at heart she be sincere the young maiden probably understand he doubt and therefore speak no more but with quick and ready hand place a knife before he and cut the bond leave he free ` my sister be very kind ' say the young warrior warmly after give vent to the guttural ugh the jocund laugh and the romping of the dancer permit conversation -- ` and ah-kre-nay will remember she in he dream ' with this the assineboin turn towards the entrance of the wigwam the sioux girl reply not but point to the throng without and then pass she hand significantly round she head fold she arm and stand resignedly before the youth ` would the sioux maiden leave she tribe and tread the wood with a assineboin ' say the warrior curiously ` peritana will die if the assineboin warrior be find to have escape and peritana would rather live in the wood than in the happy hunting-ground ' the assineboin now feel sure that he youth he appearance or at all event he probable fate have excite the sympathy of he visitor and gratitude at once create in he a desire to know more of he fair friend ` ah-kre-nay will not depart without he sister she voice be very sweet in he ear sweeter than the cluck of the wild turkey to the hungry hunter she be very little let she hide in the corner of the wigwam ' ` peritana have a father tall and straight -- a aged hemlock -- and two brother bound like the wild deer -- ah-kre-nay will not raise he hand against they ' ` they be safe when peritana have fold she white arm round they ' this point settle the indian girl hand the youth he tomahawk and knife and then obey he command with as much alacrity as if she have be he legal squaw the warrior then resume he former position place the willow-withe which have bind he in such a manner as readily to appear by the light of the fire as if they be still hold he firm this arrangement have scarcely be make when a couple of grim warrior appear in the doorway after listen to the report of the girl peritana close she eye hold she very breath lest it should betray she presence to she people and thus render all she bold effort for he whose fame beauty and unfortunate position have win she heart of no avail the young warrior too sit motionless as a statue he keen ear listen for the sound of the girl 's breath to he admiration and infinite surprise she respiration have apparently cease the sioux at this moment enter and glare curiously at they enemy as if satisfy with the survey they have take turn away and move towards they wigwam silence now gradually take the place of the activity and bustle which have previously reign a sense of security lull the indian to rest every one of they enemy save the prisoner have perish in the fight or rather surprise by which the victor have master they unarmed foe no thought be give to treachery within the camp still the young assineboin know that each moment he might be miss he therefore listen with deep attention for the slightest sound and some quarter of a hour have pass he rise from he half-recumbent posture and stand perfectly erect in the very center of the wigwam peritana at the same instant stand at he side come from without : she have leave the wigwam with so noiseless a step that even the exquisite organ of the indian have be elude neither speak but the girl place in the warrior 's hand a short rifle a powder-horn and a shot-pouch which he clutch with a delight which a sense of the danger of he position alone prevent he from manifest openly sling they in they proper place ah-kre-nay move with caution to the door of the wigwam and next moment be stalk firmly but noiselessly along the camp follow by peritana gaze mournfully at the habitation of she tribe suddenly as they reach the outskirts of the wigwam and be pass one of the largest and most conspicuous of the whole a voice from within growl forth a hoarse demand of who be there ` peritana ' say the girl in a voice which be choke with emotion ` be not well she seek the wood to drive away the bad spirit ' during this brief colloquy the young brave have step within the deep shadow of the tent he rifle ready cock as the girl cease speak the head of a old warrior be protrude from the wigwam door ` thy sister have be asleep since the dance be over ' say the aged indian ` why be peritana awake ' the girl see she companion level he rifle -- she agitation be intense she feeling be deeply move on both side ` father ' say she and the rifle be raise instantly ` peritana go to the wood she will not tarry long she head be hot she can not sleep now ' satisfy with this explanation the old sioux retire once more within the tent leave the young warrior and he sad companion to reach the forest unmolested peritana be deeply move at parting from she parent and but that she know that death would be she portion on the discovery of she aid the escape of ah-kre-nay would gladly have return to where as she father have tell she she sister sleep soundly the die however be cast and she be now in the wood the companion of the runaway we must pass over a year of time and take up we narrative at some distance from the spot above describe it be a deep dell on the bank of the upper water of one of those stream that serve to swell the ontario perhaps a lovelier spot be never discover by man at a place where the river make a bend there rise from its bank at some distance from the water a steep but not perpendicular cliff thickly grow with bush and spot with flower while tall tree crown the crest of the eminence of a horseshoe form the two end approach the edge of the stream leave however to the east a narrow ledge by which the vale could be approach the space between the water and the bottom of the cliff be occupy by a sward of velvety smoothness while beneath the rock be a dark and gloomy natural cavern the most prominent feature of the scene however be of human formation it be a indian hut which doubtless rise in this spot for the purpose of concealment no better place could have be find within many mile as the portion of the river which flow in sight from its proximity to a fall be navigable only to the smallest canoe and be therefore never make use of by travelling-party the wigwam be of the usual dome-like shape roof with skin tastefully and elegantly adjust while a mass of creep and flower shrub that entwine themselves around it show it to be no erection of a day it be a model of cleanliness and neatness while a fireplace at some distance out-of-door within the cavern show that at least during the summer month the inconvenience of smoke be dispense with within its wall the whole be wrap in deep silence look as if utterly abandon by every trace of humanity the sun be at its fullest height proclaim midday to the tenant of the wood and field when a rustling be hear at the entrance of the little dell and a indian bound headlong within its shelter the wild gleaming of he eye the fresh wound which cover he body the convulsive thick breathing the fierce clutch of he tomahawk and rifle show that he flee for he life while the sound of many voice below the crag betoken how near he pursuer be to he shake he empty powder-horn with a look of deep grief the indian warrior throw aside he rifle now more useless than a pole of equal length and a fire of energy beam from he eye raise he tomahawk it be however but for a moment -- he wound be too severe to allow any hope of a successful struggle and next moment the brave stand unarmed lean against the entrance of he wigwam on come the pursuer with a eagerness which hatred and the desire of revenge render blind and as they leap headlong down through the narrow gap between the water and the cliff the wounded indian feel that with a firm arm and a good supply of powder and lead he might have drive back he enemy in confusion no sooner do the sioux behold they former prisoner ah-kre-nay standing with dignified calmness at the door of he own wigwam than they self-possession at once return and the whole party surround he in silence casting meanwhile envious but stealthy look round he romantic retreat a aged warrior after a due period of silence advance and address the captive ` ah-kre-nay be very nimble twelve moon ago he run like a woman from the sioux to-day he run again but he foot forsake he ' ` twelve moon ago ' reply the captive with exultation flash in he eye ` ah-kre-nay be in the midst of a nest of vulture -- fifty warrior surround he but the manitou blind all they eye and the assineboin cheat they revenge ' ` but ah-kre-nay be not alone ' say the old warrior deeply move at he own question ` the flower of the hill flee to the wood with he -- she tongue be the tongue of a lie sioux but she heart be that of a brave assineboin ' ` where be my child ' say the old warrior in vain endeavor to penetrate the mystery of the hut 's contents and drop he figurative language under the influence of excitement -- ` say son of the evening light where be my child ' the warrior gaze curiously at the old man but folding he arm make no reply the sioux warrior pause a moment and then turn to he young man order they to bind the prisoner and commence that long list of atrocious cruelty which ever precede the death of a victim among the indian the hut be scatter to the wind in a moment and its wood serve to commence the pile which be to play the principal part in the scene of torture ah-kre-nay look on in silence he lip curl scornfully until the preparation be all make he then take he place at the post with sullen composure and prepare to suffer in silence all the horror meditate by the sioux a grim warrior now stand forward with a keen and glittering tomahawk in he hand which he begin wave and flourish before the eye of he victim in the hope of make he show some sign of apprehension in vain however do the old sioux try every feint now he would aim a blow at he foot and as suddenly change to he face now he would graze he very ear and at length enrage at the stoicism of he victim he raise the gleaming hatchet as if about to strike in earnest the smart crack of a rifle be simultaneous with the attempt and the tormentor 's arm fall useless by he side with habitual fear of the fatal weapon the sioux seek cover and gaze upward saw on the summit of the cliff peritana -- a babe sling in a cradle at she back -- in the act of load she rifle ` father ' cry she somewhat wildly and point out how completely she command the pass of the dell ` in the green day when peritana walk not alone you feed and sheltered I warm be my wigwam and sweet the venison : with which my platter be ever fill peritana be very grateful but ' -- and she point to she child -- ' peritana be a mother and she see she husband the father of the little wolf in the hand of he enemy she eye grow dim and she memory depart she can not see she father but she see the enemy of she husband she forget she be ever a sioux and remember only she be now a assineboin if he enemy kill she husband peritana will use she rifle as long as she powder last and then will leap into the water and join ah-kre-nay in the happy hunting-ground of he people but a sioux warrior will not forget he have a daughter ' continued she more tenderly ` give she back the father of she child and peritana will bring a great warrior into the sioux camp ' the sioux see at once the force of she proposition certain death await many if not the whole band should they strive to ascend the pass in the face of a infuriate widow while should she prevail upon ah-kre-nay to forget for she sake he hereditary antipathy and join the sioux band a mighty advantage would accrue when free and act with perfect freedom it be probable that the young assineboin would show but little resistance to this offer in ten minute after the appearance of peritana on the cliff she husband who have be a attentive listener stand fully arm at the mouth of the pass free he be just about to commence the ascent when determine to win the admiration of the sioux at once he turn towards they once more and standing in they midst lay he arm affectionately on the shoulder of the chief and cry : ` come peritana ah-kre-nay be with he friend let not he squaw be afraid to join he ' place himself and wife thus completely in the power of the sioux without any agreement as to treatment be a tacit reliance on they honor which win upon they at once and a loud shout of applause proclaim that enmity be at a end and in a few moment more the old sioux warrior be gaze with all the pride of a grandfather upon the offspring of he favorite daughter a few hour of rest ensue during which ah-kre-nay 's wound be bind up after which the whole party go on they way rejoice and the sioux number one great warrior more within they bosom thus by the exertion of remarkable presence of mind peritana preserve herself a husband save the babe from orphanship restore a daughter to she father and add a brave soldier to the force of she tribe weep and wail would have avail she nothing undaunted courage give she the victory the fact of this tale be current still among the wander sioux who often relate to they wife and young man the famous deed of the lovely peritana lucy fennel : a tale of humble heroism in a small village near the town of honiton in devonshire there live a widow and she son the old woman have till she sight fail she not only earn a sufficient livelihood but have save a little money by make that kind of lace for the

short and sweet interview could always be snatch at that time the present one be however the reverse in a hard tone of voice and with a abrupt manner luke inquire if she be ready to have he the girl frankly answer ` of course i be luke but what should make you ask the question on such a sudden ' luke 's jealousy be a little assuaged by lucy 's open and confide manner and become more calm he tell she he plan ` it will never do luke ' she reply ' besides my father whom i must send to about it would not consent no no we must wait ' ` wait for what i should like to know to give master i suppose a chance of -- of -- ' ` of what luke ' ` why ' say luke work up into a sort of frenzy by the very think -- ' why of ask you to take poor dead-and-gone missus 's place ' the color mount to lucy fennel 's face she cast a reproachful look on she lover and seem ready to cry but woman 's pride come to she aid and she leave the dairy as if afraid to hear another of luke 's terrible word have the young man not go out immediately he might have hear ill-suppressed sob issue from the room into which the maiden have shut herself ` she be afraid to face I ' say luke to himself as he cross the courtyard `

and a clever farmer but he know very little about woman 's heart from that day he be extremely kind and considerate to lucy perceive how much happier the girl be when she return from visit mr damerel than at other time modbury diminish she labor by employ another dairymaid so that lucy might have more leisure which he have no objection should be spend with the invalid one morning while lucy be prepare the household dinner a message arrive from the cottage she presence be desire there immediately lucy lose no time and be soon in she accustomed seat at the bed-head mr damerel place a letter in she hand it be from she son with beat heart lucy open it and after time sufficient to master the emotion which the sight of luke 's handwriting cause she she proceed to read it aloud it run thus :

you and may god bless _ she _ too dear mother ' to describe lucy 's feeling while she read this simply-worded epistle would be impossible all the love and tenderness which she have feel for luke during the time she have know he seem to be concentrate within she at that moment at first she mourn the step he have take as hopeless and irreparable but cast she eye upon the lace-work she have the day before be do a sudden thought seize she by means of _ that _ something might be eventually accomplish with these thought she quietly fold the letter place it on the table beside the bed and resume the lace-work scarcely speak a word mr damerel mistook this action for indifference and in she sincere desire for the girl 's welfare urge -- not for the first time -- plan and sentiment which though well mean be utterly revolting to lucy luke have she argue no doubt behave very ill by rashly and without explanation tear himself not only from she but from every person to whom he be dear on the other hand farmer modbury 's advance be very flattering and she could hardly blame a girl who have be so cruelly treat even by she own son be she to accept the good-fortune that lay before she still lucy go on practise she lace-work she heart beating and she avert eye swim with tear at length she exclaim : ` dame you will break my heart if you ever talk in this way again to you i look for comfort and strength in loving luke which i shall never cease to do i whether innocent or not be the cause of deprive you of the comfort of he company and i be determine to restore he to we both you may think it impossible but it be not i have think and think and reckon up everything and be quite sure it can be do ' ' i can not make out what you mean ' say mrs damerel ` why that i intend as soon as i be able to do it well enough to take work from the town to leave farmer modbury and come and be with you we can live on very little and every spare shilling we will put into the savings-bank until it amount to a sufficient sum to buy luke off ' she then industriously resume she work it be some time before mr damerel could comprehend the full intent and meaning of the sacrifice the girl propose at first she think it be a mere flighty resolution that would not hold long and even when she be make to understand that it be unshaken she look at the achievement as impossible for at that time the price for lace-work be fall in consequence of the recent introduction of machinery about a week after this all she doubt vanish for on michaelmas-day when lucy 's term of service with farmer modbury expire sure enough she bring she box and declare she have come to stay with she adopt mother she have previously be to a master-manufacturer in honiton with a specimen of she lace and it be so well approve that she obtain a commission for a large quantity on the spot by this time the old dame have completely recover from she illness and be able to move about so as to attend to the little domestic concern of the cottage lucy could therefore give she undivided attention to she work she proceedings be by no means agreeable to she father or to modbury the former write enjoin she by no means to leave the farmer 's house but the letter come too late for she have already take she departure modbury however in reply to a epistle in which fennel have give he free consent to marry he daughter express a thorough conviction of the firmness of the girl 's purpose and that at present it be impossible to shake it though she have leave he roof he should continue to watch over she and hope by persevere kindness and attention eventually to win she affection under these circumstance lucy quietly establish herself in mr damerel 's cottage at first she find it a hard matter to gain sufficient money for she labor to recompense the dame for she board and lodging which she insist upon do every time she be pay by she employer still she work on although she savings be small and at the end of several month they bear a hopeless proportion to the large sum which be require but time seem a small object to she : she look forward to the end and in it she see such a world of reward and happiness that no toil would be too much to arrive at it she have answer luke 's letter with she own hand assure he of she unshaken attachment in spite of all that have happen but unfortunately he have sail for indium and it be send thither after he in obedience to the vague ` elsewhere ' which have be add to the superscription accord to he wish slow progress be not the only trouble lucy have to contend with modbury 's attention pained she as much as luke 's absence the more so because they be so full of consideration for she welfare she know she never could return he kindness and feel that she do not deserve it she often tell dame damerel that a show of hostility from the worthy farmer would not have pained she so much as he unremitting attention then when the neighbor come in to gossip they sometimes speak against luke they would tell she that a man who would suspect she on such slight grounds and act as he do could never be true to she that he would see some other whom he would prefer and some day send home word that he be marry neither be it likely that he would ever come home alive from the indy these poison arrow which be mean as comfort glance harmlessly from lucy who be invulnerably shield by trust love and hope she would answer : ` very likely ' or ` it may be ' or ` there be no know what may happen in this world of trouble ' and still rattle about she lace-peg over the pillow on which it be make with the quickness of magic amongst she visitor however there be two who invariably offer she better consolation these be larkin and he sister tom ` stick up ' as he express it for he friend luke and always put the blame of the enlistment on the wiles and art of the recruiting-sergeant who regularly entrap he into the deed many a happy winter evening be spend in that humble cottage by lucy and she friend luke be never forget in they conversation for there be the lace which be be unweariedly make for he release to remind they of he when modbury make he appearance -lrb- and this be very often -rrb- the subject be of course drop a year pass away neither lucy nor modbury have make much progress in they several aim scarcely a tithe of the requisite sum for luke 's discharge have be save neither could modbury perceive that he suit advance lucy 's conduct sorely perplex he she always seem delighted when he come in and receive he with every mark of cordiality but whenever he drop the slightest plea in he own behalf tear would come into she eye and she entreat he to desist he begin to remark also that besides the presence of the old dame which be surely a sufficient safeguard against any warmth of manner he might be betray into lucy always contrived to have susan larkin with she should she be absent lucy would be tell modbury what a good industrious excellent girl she be which indeed be the truth no letter come from luke and there be no proof that he have receive hers lucy begin gradually to despond for work become slack and at time she only get enough to employ she half the day not to lose ground however she hire herself to the neighbouring farmer ' wife to sew during she spare time leave dame damerel to the occasional care of susan larkin while she be sit at work during one of these engagement she compare she own cheerless lot with the happiness which surround she the farmer be read the newspaper he wife and daughter assist she in the work she be do as she make this comparison and thought of luke banish as it be from he home and endure perhaps severe hardship she could scarcely refrain from weep now and then the farmer read a paragraph from the paper and presently exclaim : ` ah we young squire have get safe to he regiment in indium ' at these word lucy tremble but go on rapidly with she work lest she emotion should be notice she have previously hear that the son of a neighbouring proprietor have buy a commission in luke 's regiment and this be almost like have news of luke himself presently the reader go on with the paragraph : ` we understand there have be a fatal disease which have carry off many of the ' ------ the farmer make a pause here and lucy 's heart sink within she ` oh i see ' the old gentleman ejaculate ` the corner be turn down -- have carry off many -- yes -- many of the -- horse ' this little incident produce such strong emotion in lucy 's frame that though she feel upon the whole much gratify by merely hear about luke 's regiment and its horse yet she become too ill to proceed with she work and find it necessary to return to the cottage lucy soon alter she plan of engage herself out for the idea strike she that if she be to make lace on a sort of speculation and keep it by she till it be want she would in the end make a greater profit have when she father be in good circumstance be partly educate at a exeter boarding-school she have acquire there some knowledge of draw and by exercise she pencil she now invent some very pretty lace-patterns lucy work and hope on for another year still nothing be hear from luke a new calamity have fall upon lucy she father a broken and decayed man have come to live near she and be now nearly dependent on she for support both modbury and farmer larkin give he little job to do for which they liberally recompense he the quantity of lace lucy be employ to make be so small that it just suffice to keep she and she father while she little capital instead of increase be gradually absorb by the purchase of material for the stock she industry accumulate susan larkin frequently visit she and modbury be seldom absent no ill-fortune seem to depress the persevere girl even though she be work almost night and day she still keep up she spirit indeed at every new misfortune a fresh accession of firmness and resolution seem to nerve she about this time she father die invoke blessing on she for have be so good a daughter after the first shock of grief have pass she continue she task amidst the most hopeless circumstance the lace-trade sink lower and lower still lucy work on under a strong presentiment that it would improve she do not relax one hour 's labor although she be now receive much less for it than when she begin she accumulate so large a stock that at last every shilling of she savings be spend for material in exchange however she possess a large quantity of beautiful lace that even if it sell at the present low price would have yield a small profit at last thing become so bad that a sale seem unavoidable disadvantageous as it might be lucy now a object of commiseration amongst the neighbor still retain she cheerfulness that so much patience modesty and firmness of purpose should not meet its reward seem almost impossible and fortune smile on lucy when nearly every hope seem to have leave she it be well know by what trifle in the mercantile world fortune be lose and win the detention of a ship the non-arrival of a mail have ruin hundred whilst some equally unforeseen caprice of fashion or similar accident have make as many fortune it happen when lucy have the greatest cause for despondency that within a short period two member of the royal family die mourning lace be then much in request and it happen that most of lucy 's stock be of that kind suddenly commission from honiton flow in and lucy be keep constantly at work at wages much higher than before -- she own stock acquire fresh value while the price continue to rise young larkin who be a shrewd fellow advise she to ` hold ' it till the value increase still more she take the advice and at the proper moment sell it at a price she never hope to realize at the end of a week she find herself in possession of a sum which be within a few pound sufficient to procure she lover 's discharge from the army poor lucy could hardly believe she eye when the manufacturer lay down the bank-note before she she pin they carefully into the bosom of she frock and hasten to tell dame damerel that all they trouble be over the old woman 's eye glisten as lucy unpin she treasure and lay it on the table it be count re-counted and wonder over what be to be do with it till the rest be procure who would take care of it this delight be however somewhat damp when they come to consider that put aside all uncertainty about he fate it would be at least six month before luke 's discharge could reach he then a additional half-year would elapse ere he could get back it be a long time to wait ` never mind dear mother ' say lucy ` the time that have pass since he leave seem scarcely a year although it be three it be only because the twelvemonth be to come that it appear to be so long still ' she say consider and heave a deep sigh ` we have not get he discharge yet and great as this sum be some more must be earn to make up the rest ' ` leave that to I ' return mr damerel next day when lucy return from the post-office where she have take a letter for luke she find another lie on the table in larkin 's handwriting on read the superscription she find it be address to the war-office ` yes ' say mrs damerel in answer to she inquire glance ` it be all do now lucy and this letter be to be send off to tell the great people that we can have the money ready to buy we dear luke off again ' larkin have in truth gladly supply the small sum which be deficient the letter be send and in less than a week a immense dispatch find its way to the village which excite universal wonderment it be a great oblong missive with the word ` on he majesty 's service ' print at the top it have a enormous seal and be direct to ` mr thoma larkin ' a crowd of idler follow the postman with this epistolary phenomenon in the hope of get some knowledge of its contents tom however when he read it coolly put it into he pocket and walk to the cottage without say a word to anybody this letter seem like a climax to lucy 's good-fortune and ` beg to inform mr larkin that corporal farrier damerel be on he way to england to superintend the selection of troop-horse and that he discharge should be make out when he have arrive and perform that duty ' scarcely a month after the arrival of the official dispatch a corporal of dragoon be see trespassing on farmer modbury 's field by cross they in great haste without any regard to the footpath a old ploughman roughly warn he off threatening personal ejection ` what roger dart ' exclaim the soldier ` be this the way you welcome a man home after a long absence ' the ploughman stare and say he do not know he ` do you know ' rejoin the corporal with a tremble voice and anxious countenance -- ` do you know lucy fennel ' ` of course i do ' return roger ` everybody know she and if i may make so bold love she too why sure enough there she be sit -- do not you see -- there sit at dame damerel 's door make lace for the life of she ' the stranger fly across the field and the ploughman see he bind over the hedge take lucy into he arm and drag she bewildered and enrapture into the cottage ` why dang I if it bea not luke damerel ' exclaim the rustic slapping the thigh of he leather breeches ` how main glad the folk will be to see ` un -- i know what i 'll do ' whereupon roger trudge across the field towards the church he happen to be one of the parish-ringer and call he mate from the field they all trudge off to the bell-tower and ring out as merry a peal as ever be hear the whole country be in a commotion the news run like wild-fire from lip to lip and from ear to ear till the cottage be beset with visitor within and without but luke hear no welcome feel no grasp but that of lucy and he mother as to lucy a intense happiness thrill through she which absorb all she faculty except that of feel the full extent of she bliss this story of patience endurance and faith in humble life be almost end luke 's furlough only extend to a week which he spend as a inmate of the farm at modbury 's earnest entreaty for he now give up all hope of lucy and determine to help in reward she patience by promote the match with he rival at the end of that time luke be oblige to depart for yorkshire to meet the veterinary-surgeon and purchase horse in which he be find of the utmost use but this together with he excellent character operate most unfavourably for he discharge the authority be unwilling to lose so good a soldier the interest of the ` squire ' however whose son be a cornet in luke 's troop be set to work the hard-earned money pay and the discharge obtain damerel get a farm let to he on advantageous term close to he native village and be marry amidst more noisy demonstration by roger and he company of ringer modbury have take to wife lucy 's friend susan larkin the last time i be in devonshire i call on mr and mr damerel they be a interesting old couple who have bring up a large family in comfort and respectability billy egg ` can you direct I to mr william egg 's ' say i one morning to a smart shopman who be loitering at the door of a showy haberdasher in the principal street of a town in ireland in which for a few month i once reside i have be tell by two or three person that billy egg 's be the best shop in the place for that he be a general dealer on a very large scale i should be sure to get ` everything in the world ' there moreover i have be instruct that he sell good article at a cheap rate and be a stranger i feel truly glad that i have be recommend to a tradesman on whom i could confidently rely ` can you direct I to mr egg 's ' i repeat see that the smart shopman be so much occupy either in admire he window or he own person that he have not at first attend to my question ' i know no such person ma'am ' he reply rather sharply and as i now perceive that the house bear the evidence of fresh paint and recent alteration it occur to I that the smart shopkeeper might be a new-comer and ignorant of the old resident nothing daunt i next enter the shop of a neighbouring bookseller and repeat my inquiry but with no better success i then make my way to that of a milliner and though a young girl who be busily engage at she needle look up for a moment with a arch smile and then turn away as i plainly perceive to repress a hearty laugh she mistress dismiss I with the expression of she opinion ` that no such person live in that town nor she believe in any other ' i feel a little puzzle to know what the girl have find so ludicrous in my simple question and wonder if my repeat disappointment have give I a forlorn air ` at any rate ' thought i ` this mr egg be not so generally know as i expect to find he i have better walk up the street and try if i can discover any outward indication of he abode ' i spend a weary half-hour in this endeavor and as it now seem evident to I that no considerable shop could belong to the object of my search i lower my tone in address a old apple-woman who sit behind a table cover with she store at the corner of the street ` pray can you direct I to billy egg 's ' i ask drop the mr altogether and adopt the familiar term which have be use to I ` och then to be shure i will a ' welcome if it be a mile off but there it be just furnint ye -- that big grand shop there wid the big letther gilt wid goold over the big windee ' ` my good woman ' i reply ' i be afraid you must be mistake the name there be william carter ' ` och do not i know that but they call he billy egg because all he have -- and half the town that be he -- come out of a egg ' a exclamation of surprise escape I and the old woman continue -- ` och but well he desarve it for he be a dacent man and good to the poor god bless he every day he rise and make the heaven he bed at last ' as i take part of she speech as a hint to myself i give she sixpence and believe there be some story worth the hearing i begged my new acquaintance to call on I in the evening and relate it instead of hinder she business and mine by listen to it at that moment although i suspect she would have be nothing loath to have give I the full and particular account there and then for she tell I she know every circumstance ` consarn he and he ' i proceed without further delay to the ` big grand shop ' where i saw in the master the veritable billy egg he be a fine portly personage with a good open countenance and it be evident he could not have acquire he nickname from bear even the most remote resemblance to a egg he serve I himself with zeal and civility and my purchase be soon complete in the evening my old apple-woman be true to she appointment and from she i gather the follow particulars : william carter be a poor boy the eldest of a large family who with they mother be leave destitute by the death of they father they poor neighbor be charitable as the poor to they credit be it speak so often be and one take one child and one another until something could be think of and do for they subsistence william have make the most of the scanty schooling he father have afford he and could read a little he be moreover a steady hard-working boy yet the only occupation he be able to obtain be that of tend a cow on the border of a large bog in return for this service he be comfortably lodge and feed and for a time the clothes he have be sufficient he be in the habit of save any scrap of print paper which fall in he way and by means of these he somewhat improve in he reading for while the cow be munch away little billy have ample time for he study without neglect she either for he make a point of look out for the sweetest grass and lead she to it by he care and attention he give such satisfaction to he employer that by the time he clothes be wear out he be allow wages sufficient to replenish they and he good-behaviour give such confidence and respectability to he family that a neighbouring farmer engage one of he younger brother in a capacity similar to he own one day this farmer give billy a newly-laid goose 's egg think it might make he a good meal and be something of a dainty and as a sort of return for a act of good-nature and watchfulness on billy 's part he have notice that a certain gate lead to the kitchen-garden have be leave open take the precaution to close it thereby prevent the incursion of a greedy sow and she interesting family which would undoubtedly have play the part of the goth in that flourish spot it be very likely that billy 's first impulse be to boil he egg and eat it but a moment 's reflection convinced he that this would be conduct very like that of the boy in the fable who slaughter the goose that lay golden egg but how to hatch he egg -- for this be what he think of -- become now the question the good woman of the house notice that billy be unusually silent at supper-time and think at first that some disaster must have happen she learn however that the cow have she customary bed of soft heather which it be billy 's pride to pick for she and have be as carefully attend to as usual in every particular we ought to mention that billy be a great favorite with he mistress and perhaps he have win she heart by the care and attention he have bestow at every spare moment on one of she little one who be a very sickly fretful child but who somehow or other be always most quickly pacify by billy she soon learn the cause of he thoughtful silence and kindly offer to remove two or three egg from under a duck which be then sit and give they place to she cow-boy 's single treasure this be the foundation of william carter 's fortune and it be worthy of remark that both the gift of the egg and the opportunity of hatch it he owe to act of thoughtful good-nature on he own part in due time the goslin appear and billy feed it from he own scanty fare take it with he when he be herd by christmas it have become a large fat goose and its owner be offer half-a-crown for it but he have a higher ambition for it than this and he be not to be tempt from he purpose by the prospect of present gain the follow spring he set she on twelve egg which she have herself produce and by and by twelve goslin appear we hero be now oblige to exercise some ingenuity in find food for so large a family of dependent but he accomplish he end by bartering away three of they in exchange for permission that the remainder should feed in he master 's yard until they should be old enough to pick up they subsistence in company with they mother and the cow upon the common and indulge in swim there in the abundant pool at the proper time he sell the young goose for the largest sum he have ever see in he life for though to have keep some of they might have prove a additional source of profit he know that he have only accommodation for one to hatch a portion of he money he give to he mother but he place a one-pound note in the safe-keeping of he kind mistress and when spring again come round he buy with it a year-old heifer which he send to graze on the mountain pay with it a small sum the remnant of he money which he have reserve for this purpose old goosy again present he with young one the sale of which enable he to purchase fodder for he cow when she be send home at the end of the season and now he build a little shed for she with fir stick from the bog and heather sod so that perhaps she be better care for than many a rich man 's cow we may be pretty sure however that billy never neglect he master 's business to attend to he own private affair or he and he wife would not have encourage he in he plan as they evidently do it be not worth while to follow the fortune of the prudent industrious little fellow step by step or to declare precisely how he deal in cow and goose it may be enough to say that at the end of six year he quit servitude a richer man than ever he father have be on which occasion he present the venerable goose to he mother to whose necessity and comfort he have for some time constantly contribute so soon as he be thoroughly establish in the world he marry but not till he have provide a neat cottage for he parent who have the happiness to enjoy for many year the prosperity of she son and who live to see the poor cow-boy a man among the most respected and esteem in he native county ` and so you see ' say the old apple-woman in conclusion ` it be a foolish thing to despise small beginning thrue as i be tell it ye this be how mr carter get the name of billy egg though d'ye see he never be call billy _ goose _ -- no never ' the pledge redeem towards the close of the reign of loui xiv a plant of mocha coffee be bring to the king 's garden which very soon increase and the genius of the government of that day think that by transplant into they west indium colony this shrub a immense source of riches might be open to the country the carry out of this idea be entrust to chevalier desclieux who provide with a young coffee-plant set out from nante thence to convey it to martinique imbed in its native mould the precious exile be place in a oak-wood box impenetrable to cold and cover with a glass frame so form as to catch the least ray of the sun and double its heat and in case the sun do not shine a small aperture hermetically seal could admit heated air when it be think proper to do so we can imagine all the charge desclieux receive when he enter the ship in which he be to embark : but he do not need they he see at a glance all the distinction he would gain by this expedition which would secure to he country a inexhaustible source of riches it be then with a really patriotic feeling that he take the plant under he care promise to devote himself to it as he would to he country and to all the duty of he profession and when the skiff after have quit the vessel return again to renew the charge and to remind desclieux once more that the plant must be water every day and that copiously he pledge he honor that rather than fail in this he would himself die of thirst the ship sail the crew be compose of about one hundred man and of some passenger about to settle in the antille amongst whom be a amiable family consist of father mother and they only daughter louisa a beautiful and accomplished girl of eighteen in a vessel where people be so much throw together meet constantly for a length of time destine perhaps to share the same death but little time be require to form a intimacy which often ripen into last friendship and thus it prove in the case of the parent of louisa and desclieux scarcely have they pass the light-house of cordouan glittering in the twilight of a lovely evening when they be already friend already this fresh and delicate plant interesting as a exile as a flower transplant from its own soil as a child tear from its mother become a mutual object of attraction it be thus that louisa point it out to she parent as it lay on the deck in its glass case expose to the mid-day sun she charm the tedium of the voyage in hourly watch the progress which she believe visible in the feeble offset she have feel interested in it from the moment desclieux have show she all the glory he be to gain by it for france and then she have become attach to it for it be a beautiful proof of the magnanimity of woman -- they love for all that be glorious even during the five day they have be at sea the little coffee-plant have evidently increase -- two small leaf of a most delicate green have appear and every morning louisa 's first thought after prayer be the cherish plant but she could not see it till desclieux have leave he room for he always keep the sacred deposit with he every evening he water it abundantly and then let hot air into the frame by means of the tube as he have be direct : he keep it as close as possible to he at night that even during sleep he might administer heat to it never do bird brood over its young more fondly -- never do nurse cherish more tenderly the new-born babe as soon as desclieux appear on deck in the morning to lay he precious charge in the sun louisa immediately run thither she delight to point out to she mother its growth during the night a growth imperceptible to indifferent eye but she have become attach to it and as the slightest emotion be visible to we in the feature of those we love though unperceived by stranger so she discover the least change even in the thickness of the stalk or the length of the leaf and desclieux see the young girl thus attach herself to what have be confide to he and what he so cherish feel touch and grateful they meet with a terrible assault when close to madeira it be about the middle of a dark night though not stormy the vessel be glide along noiselessly and all on board be asleep except the officer on watch -- and indeed he too perhaps sleep or he would have hear the noise of the keel cut the wave as a bird 's wing cut the air and he would have cry : ` ship ahoy ' a ship be indeed quite close to desclieux 's vessel and the token it give of its vicinity be a cannonade which awake up every one in a moment both crew and passenger it be a pirate vessel of tuni a poor chebeck but formidable in the night -- a time that magnify every fear -- and formidable too from the desperate bravery of the bandit who man she believe themselves assail by superior force the ship 's crew prepare for a resistance as vigorous as desperate as the attack better far to die than to be carry slave to africa all the passenger be at prayer distract tremble or half dead louisa alone remain calm for she be sustain by the thought that to she desclieux have entrust he precious charge the fight commence the ship fire eight cannon on the chebeck and it be time for already the captain have board the french ship but be immediately cut down by desclieux 's axe a last discharge of gun on each side and the firing cease the pirate feel its inferiority and retreat while the conqueror continue they course two hour of torture suspense have pass since the terrible awakening which but serve to make the feeling of restore security the more delightful and the remainder of the night be spend in relate the event of the rencontre louisa 's be not the least interesting : she have be regardless of danger during the combat while watch over she charge then she take it to desclieux who admire she the more -- love she the more for courage always beautiful have a still greater charm when display by a woman it be a lovely morning the sun be unusually bright and warm and desclieux leave the plant on deck the glass frame half raise to admit the fresh air and revive heat while he with louisa and she parent sit near and enjoy see it expand its pretty leaf and as it be smilingly greet the sun 's ray which infuse into it such genial warmth and seem to thank they for they care but desclieux 's brow now kindle with higher thought in this feeble offset he see the pretty little starry flower then the perfumed berry and the negro gather it abundantly and then the ocean bearing vessel to france laden with its produce all this he could see in the few small leaf scarcely aboveground enthusiastically do he tell these bright vision to louisa and as she kindle in she turn the coffee-plant become dearer and dearer to she and she lavish as tender care upon it as she would upon a newborn brother she seem to have common sympathy with it and if she feel that the heat might be too much for its slender stem she draw over it little curtain of green silk which she have make expressly for it just as a tender mother curtain the cradle of she infant and then she read to desclieux and she parent a long account of the coffee of mocha and picture vividly to they imagination the tree to grow out of the nursling whose infancy they watch over sometimes the conversation take a different turn and the parent of louisa speak as if to a old familiar friend of they fortune of they family interest of they view for the establishment of they only daughter and desclieux in return impart to they he plan by degree these communication lead to project of marriage between he and louisa it be no unpleasing thought to either and the very day they cross the line a declaration be make and a engagement form and it be agree that they union should take place immediately on they return to france we may well think that louisa become more attach than ever to the plant now become a source of distinction in which she would one day share : imagine then she consternation when one morning she behold it languish she say nothing hope it might revive but the next morning find its leaf still more withered she do not trust herself to speak of it to desclieux who also have but too plainly see it at last the thought occur to he that whilst in the intense heat of the tropics the plant would require more water and therefore pour on it almost he whole allowance the effect be immediate in restore its life and verdure and louisa be again happy the ship be still some hundred of league from martinique when a violent tempest arise apparently the last of a fearful hurricane which have rage through the antille it be find that the ship have spring a leak the pump be not sufficient : they be in imminent danger and the necessity of lighten the vessel be so urgent that they be force to throw overboard almost all the merchandise a part of the ballast and even several barrel of water this last sacrifice be a appalling one : it be with a solemn feeling they make it similar to that with which one hear the earth fall upon a coffin or give to the depart one the ocean for its tomb indeed these cask of water carry with they the life of many individual who have now no escape from a cruel death by thirst desclieux impress like the other with this idea only think of he precious coffee-plant however they be not very far from port and with a favourable wind might get in in a few day and in effect the tempest be over and the leak close with great difficulty a fresh breeze spring up and for a day and a night they sail fast and the stormy state of the atmosphere have produce on the coffee-plant the usual effect it might almost have be say to have flourish the more for the tempest louisa and desclieux contemplate it with a sweet joy as at once the emblem and the omen of domestic happiness amid the storm of life but alas the wind suddenly lull -- not the least breath to fill the sail not a wave break against the motionless vessel : a awful calm succeed and what be more terrible upon this scene of continual agitation than a calm unwonted and too often fatal the dead heat of the tropics be feel in all its power by the helpless voyager they languish and faint with a continual thirst and horrible to relate the water be fail for they have throw so much overboard that they be limit to a very small allowance -- a cupful at most if man notwithstanding they energy sink under the suffering cause by the intense heat and burning thirst what must have be the state of the poor little plant which fade away before the eye it have its allowance also but it be not enough and every morning and evening desclieux give it he only for which it would have die louisa be astonish to see the feeble plant yet bear up but desclieux carefully conceal from she the means he be use lest she also would deprive herself of water for it and that he do not wish -- he prefer suffering alone and a long sojourn in the hottest part of arabium have in a great measure inure he to the climate so that he do not feel it so much as other the calm be uninterrupted the remainder of the water be nearly exhaust they situation be become dreadful and there be no hope in they case of any relief from another vessel for all be alike becalm and it be sad to see the ocean without a sail in the horizon or if there be one it too be motionless they ration of water be now reduce to one small liqueur glass one drop only just to moisten he lip and desclieux pour the rest on the plant now apparently die ` alas how you be change ' say louisa to he one day : ` how pale you have become you be suffer : this heat be kill you ' he know it but he have promise to water the plant even though he himself be to die of thirst and he be faithful to he word one evening when louisa and she parent be question he he thus answer in a feeble voice ` you be right i die of thirst that my charge may live -- it be my duty ' and say these word he lay he parched lip upon its withered leaf as one would kiss the hand of a expire friend and continue : ` you have all promise to love I : if i do not live be careful of this coffee-plant which hold out to we such brilliant prospects i ask it of you as a favor and bequeath to you the distinction i hope to have gain by it ' at the moment they be distribute the scanty portion of water and though he be perish he throw the whole of it upon the shrub -- louisa do the same it be as it be a sacred bond between they -- a indissoluble tie i be convince that many of my reader have frequently feel a lively and almost inexplicable pleasure in water a flower dry up by the scorching sun and in see it revive have feel as if benefit themselves what pleasure then it must have give to desclieux and louisa to see they plant raise its sickly leaf once more at length the wind begin to rise lightly and the vessel move though slowly desclieux be ill -- in a burning fever but he continue to share with the plant he allowance of water and louisa add hers it increase they happiness that it owe its recovery to they mutual self-denial and it seem as if they household life have begin in a common endurance of suffer the breeze still freshen : and when the vessel anchor in the port of st pierre there be not a single drop of water on board but the coffee-plant be save the colony enrich by it desclieux 's pledge redeem and three month after louisa be he wife the tree and the forest a story write for the young but which may be read by the old ` what splendid tree ' say monsieur d'ambly as he be pass by a fine forest of oak ` what a splendid fire they would make ' reply he son eugene eugene have read a few day before in a book of travels the description of a wood on fire and he could think of nothing else he be a admirer of everything that be uncommon everything that produce a effect or a commotion and like most child he seldom carry he idea beyond what he see ` if it would not injure any person ' say he ' i would be very glad this forest would take fire it would be a glorious sight i be sure papa that its light would extend as far as the château ' ` would it then be such a pleasant thing to see a tree burning ' ` oh a tree ' say eugene ` that would be hardly worth the trouble but a forest would be magnificent ' ` since we be on the subject of burn ' say monsieur d'ambly ' i think it would be well to cut down that young lime-tree on the lawn opposite the château it grow too fast and if it should spread much more it would quite intercept we view i will therefore cut it down for fuel ' ` oh papa ' exclaim eugene ` that lime-tree that have grow so beautiful since last year i be look at it the other day and i see shoot of this year as long as my arm ' at this moment they come to a young poplar which have be blow down by a storm the precede day its leaf be not yet wither but its young shoot though still green begin to lose they vigor they be soft and weak as if droop from want of water but in that case a refreshing shower would have restore it to health and freshness whereas now it be beyond recovery eugene stop before the poplar and lament it ` such ' say monsieur d'ambly ` will in two day more be the state of we lime-tree ' ` ah ' cry eugene ` can you have the heart to say so ' ` why not a lime be not more valuable than a poplar or a oak and you would like to see this whole forest in a blaze ' ` indeed papa that be a very different thing ' ` yes there be certainly a vast difference between a person cut down a tree that incommode he and that he would then make use of for fuel and fourteen or fifteen thousand that you would burn for you pleasure ' ` but i do not know those tree ' ` neither do you know this poplar that you have just be lament ' ` but at least i see it ' ` you can as easily see all those that surround it look at this one how strong and how straight it be ' ` oh what a fine oak i do not think my arm could reach round it see papa how high it be and those three great branch which grow from it look like large tree ' ` it must be sixty or seventy year old : it will grow at least twenty more ' ` how enormous it will be then i hope i shall see it ' ` but if it should be burn in the meantime ' ' i should be very sorry now that i know it ' ` you would then only spare those tree from the fire which have come under you own particular notice : this be too common a case would it give you more pleasure to see this one burning ' say monsieur d'ambly as he show he another divide into four enormous trunk which shoot from the same root ` no indeed look it make quite a arbor papa some day when we have more time we will come and sit here shall we not ' ` so then here be two that you would spare from the conflagration of the forest ' ` oh if i could but see it on fire what a fine effect it would have from the window of the château i should think only of my two favorite oak that i should be so sorry to see burn ' ` but all those you see equally deserve to become favorite and those you can not see be quite as fine they have each in they different form something that would interest you as much as you two favorite oak the poplar or we lime-tree ' ' i do believe that if i be to think of every particular tree that compose a forest it would take away all wish to see it burn ' ` that show the necessity of consideration my son to avoid the risk of form unreasonable wish to put they in practice perhaps when you grow up you will probably never have a forest to burn but you may have man to conduct : just think what might be the consequence of you forget that a district a town a community be compose of individual as you just now forget that a forest be compose of tree ' ` ah papa in such a case i could not forget myself ' ' i know some year ago ' say monsieur d'ambly ' a very good but rather obstinate man of the name of de marne he have a quarrel with the director of a hospital establish in a small town on one of he estate the greater part of the property of the hospital be situate on this estate and dependent on it as be then the custom -- that be to say the hospital only hold these land on condition of pay certain rent to monsieur de marne and of receive two patient at he option this right he hold in consequence of he ancestor have give these land to the hospital and it descend to all the proprietor of the estate the director begin to dispute with monsieur de marne about the payment of the rent and maintain that he bad no right to send more than one patient to the hospital monsieur de marne be exceedingly angry and a lawsuit be the consequence and it so happen that the person employ by monsieur de marne in search the papers which have be send to he to prove he right discover or think he have discover that the ground which have occasion the lawsuit belong to monsieur de marne and not to the hospital because say he the ancestor of monsieur de marne only give it for a certain time and on certain condition which have not be fulfil so that monsieur de marne ought to take possession of it this would be the ruin of the hospital the day monsieur de marne receive this intelligence he be delighted and the more so as he have just learn that one of the patient whom he have send to the hospital have die in consequence of a relapse from have be discharge too soon he widow who be leave destitute travel on foot to pari with she youngest child on she back to implore the assistance of monsieur de marne she cry bitterly as she relate the last word of she husband who say when he be die if monsieur de marne have be here he would have have I keep in the hospital and i should have recover ` as monsieur de marne listen with tear in he eye to this recital he exclaim : that villain of a director i will be the ruin of he he forget that it be the hospital he would ruin and that he would thus put out perhaps a hundred patient all as poor and as sick as poor jacque and whose condition have he recollect it would be equally grievous ` the lawsuit be carry on with great vigor not by monsieur de marne who be detain by business in pari but by he law-agent who be interested in support what he have advance pursue it warmly and fear that monsieur de marne would relinquish he right take care to keep back what be say in the country of he folly and madness in try to ruin a hospital which be such a public benefit and the daily melancholy account of the state to which the patient be reduce because the director be oblige to give up a great deal of time and money to the lawsuit have not enough for the necessary expense of the hospital have monsieur de marne know all these particulars he kindly feeling would have return -- he could not have endure the idea of cause so much evil but instead of that he agent only entertain he with account of the ill doings of the director and of the design he have against he every letter he receive make he more and more angry and he hatred of one man make he forget the claim of a hundred other on whom he should have have compassion ` at length he gain he lawsuit he have for some day be endeavor to procure admission for a poor woman into the hospital of incurable at paris here be two piece of good news say he as he read the letter which announce the success of each of he undertaking and he write immediately to he law-agent express he satisfaction at the manner in which he have conduct he suit and to the person who have procure admission for the poor woman into the hospital of incurable thank he for he kindness ` for some time he think no more of the matter however he one day receive a letter from he agent tell he that the director have become a bankrupt and have flee that no one know where he be and to increase he dislike to the man he add that during three day that he flight be unknown because he say he be only go into the country the patient have neither bread nor broth and that only for some charitable individual in the neighborhood who have send they relief most of they must have die and that it be probable some of they would die from the effect of they suffering and from they dismay at hear that the hospital be likely to fall to the ground he say it have obtain some respite as the gentry in the town and neighborhood have give great assistance but it be all insufficient and they be oblige to discharge the least suffering that they leave the hospital in tear and that several who live in distant village have fall on the road from weakness and disappointment all these detail begin to make monsieur de marne very uneasy the agent add at the end of he letter : every one observe that the director have neither order nor economy : for a long time the affair of the hospital have be in a bad state and the loss of the suit have complete it then monsieur de marne feel he conscience reproach he for what he have do : he picture to himself those unfortunate people leave the hospital in tear sink with weakness and grief and perhaps call for curse upon he he think of the three day that they have be without either bread or broth and he fancy he see they pale and emaciated countenance and begin to consider each of they individually as you just now begin to consider the tree of the forest there be not one of they that he would not have shed he blood to save he could not endure the idea of all the evil which he have cause they and endeavor to throw all the blame upon the director he write to he agent desire he to send relief to a considerable amount and as soon as it be possible he set off himself to this estate where he have not be for a long time on he arrival he repair to the town where the hospital have be : it be close : the last patient have leave it and the house be to be sell to satisfy the creditor monsieur de marne perceive that a great many people avoid he the lawsuit have give they a very bad opinion of he and the friend and relation of the director have contribute to increase it indeed the misery which have be cause to so many poor people have throw a odium over the whole affair and turn every person against he the report spread that he be come to purchase the house and the rest of the hospital land and one day as he be pass through the street the child throw stone at he he begin to feel all the injury he have do and a thousand circumstance perpetually remind he of it the son of jacque the poor man whose widow he have assist have break he leg and it remain quite distorted monsieur de marne tell he mother that she ought to have have it set that would have be easy she reply when there be a hospital here but now ------ and she stop ` he see that the country people be neglect to cultivate they garden which he know have be profitable to they and inquire the reason oh say they we use to sell we vegetable to the hospital but now ------ and they stop and monsieur de marne see that every one 's mind be fill with a subject which it would be impossible for he ever to forget he be about to quit the country and even to sell he estate when a epidemical disease break out in the next village it be prevalent there almost every year and it be for that reason especially that the hospital have be originally found by a man of wealth who have be attack by the disease make a vow that if he recover he would find a hospital into which all the poor of the village and of a certain distance round it should be receive and take care of when he benevolent object be complete all the poor on the first symptom of disease repair to the hospital where from the care and attention they receive they in most case soon recover and it be also a great means of prevent contagion this year the disorder be particularly severe and the ill feeling towards monsieur de marne rise to a great height he send large assistance to the village and endeavor to mitigate the suffering of the poor people but he still hear it say as he pass along : there go monsieur de marne who have come to restore some small part of the hospital land if he visit a sick person and inquire after he health he would say : i thank you sir it be tolerable but i should have recover much sooner at the hospital overwhelm with remorse uneasiness and fatigue he take the disorder and die chiefly of grief for have at any time forget that a hospital be fill with individual as you just now forget that a forest be compose of separate tree ' ` ah papa how melancholy that be ' say eugene who have listen with the greatest attention ` my son ' say monsieur d'ambly ` when you grow up you will see even worse consequence arise from that want of reflection which make we regardless of everything that do not come under we own observation so that when object be too great for we to see they detail we think nothing about they ' at that moment eugene in a muse mood take up a stone as be he custom to throw among a flight of sparrow which have alight near he : he pause ` papa ' say he ' i will not throw a stone at those sparrow for i remember how sorry i feel when any person torment my sister 's canary bird and when i see the poor little thing try to save itself in every corner of the cage : it seem to I as if each of those sparrow be i to frighten they would feel just as my sister 's bird do ' ` that be precisely my son what you ought to do if ever you be entrust with the interest of a number of person at once and that you may be tempt to forget that the regiment you command or the department you have to manage be compose of man like yourself and you should always put yourself or those you love in the place of each of they ' they now reach home and pass close by the lime-tree ` ah ' say eugene ' i must take my leave of you ' ` no ' say monsieur d'ambly smile ` it shall remain provide you promise to remember every time you look at it that each tree in a forest be entitle to as much respect as you lime and that in a assemblage of person whatever may be they denomination each person 's interest be of as much importance as you own ' the three friend : a osage legend by percy b st john the tribe know as the osage or wa-saw-see as they denominate themselves wander perennially round the head water of the arkansa and neosho or grand river hunting fishing and trading with the american at fort gibson the outermost south-western fort on the frontier of the united state tall even gigantic in stature they have many quality which excite the admiration and applause of they white brethren like most indian they be brave and warlike but they peculiarity consist in reject the custom of the whites particularly the use of whisky wear they wild and primitive costume they stalk amid the hunter squatter trapper and tramper that frequent the neighborhood of fort gibson overtop they in general by a head but still more surpass they in the essential virtue of sobriety and temperance -- a failure in the exercise of which would doubtless soon remove they from the pre-eminence they now enjoy in a secluded valley through which a stream that fall into the neosho wound its way lay some time back one of the village of this nomadic tribe the wigwam be about a hundred in number scatter over the narrow plain near the mouth of the valley and surround by a rude picket build of bark and reed they be evidently construct simply for the necessity of the summer season during which the warrior chase the deer and buffalo for immediate consumption and to lay up in store for winter overlook the village be a grassy mound that narrow the mouth of the valley and cause the ripple stream that flow at its foot to turn abruptly from its course from the summit of this hillock the lodge wear the appearance of a huge congregation of bee-hive while the eye rest pleasantly on many adjunct to the scene which render it agreeable and picturesque the village be alive with a busy throng of woman few if any man be discover while child be see at every point add still greater animation to the picture the first be all actively employ some stand at the entrance of they wigwam busily engage in cooking other be dry and pack the result of the hunting of the warrior while other again be laboriously occupy in clean fresh buffalo-skin preparatory to they be cure for use as robe not a married woman be idle not so however the maiden they be yet enjoy the sweet of a liberty which however despite the hardship incident to the married state in the wild they be no less anxious to sacrifice than be many bright-eyed beauty nearer home the osage girl -- and many of they be exceedingly pretty -- be congregate near the edge of the stream in which dozen of little urchin be bathing dancing be usually they chief amusement but on the present occasion they be spectator of a scene which possess more immediate interest somewhat apart from the maiden be a group on which the osage girl gaze curiously and enviously three indian youth all under twenty nowise relate by blood but connect only by the bond of friendship stand on a rise bank in deep abstraction nah-com-e-shee koha-tunha and mun-ne-pushee -- for such be the name of the young man -- have at a early age contract for one another one of those peculiar affection which inexplicably arise sometimes between person of the same sex and which often be more sincere and durable even than love so wed be they to this feeling as to have publicly declare they intention of never marry in order that they amity might suffer no division they heart they say be so occupy by friendship that love could not find the remotest corner to creep into how many smile face be cloud by this strange announcement we can not say but sure we be if any have before suffer they to occupy they thought this resolution increase the number of they admirer manifold indian girl have way and means of set they cap at young man as the phrase be as well as more civilised damsel and the osage maiden be not idle on this occasion besides that many really love the youth the honor of the sex be concern it be not to be bear that friendship should triumph over love and it may therefore be readily conceive what a artillery of bright eye be reproachfully open upon the three friend they however remain insensible to all the attraction of female society they join not in the dance nor tell nor listen to the tale of love or war by the evening fire but ride together hunt together trap together and earn the highest renown as indefatigable and bold huntsman the ambition of the three friend however reach to higher flight than emulate the first hunter of they tribe they wish to equal in renown the greatest warrior of the osage nation and it be a knowledge of the fact that they be about to start on a maraud expedition which create so great a sensation in the throng of maiden the three youth have be deeply engage in discuss they plan and be at the moment we speak of utter a silent prayer to the great manitou for success in they undertaking tall erect and admirably proportion they present a excellent group for a statuary while they shaven head be adorn with the helmet crest and eagle plume they bear round they neck ornament of the gayest kind a magnificent cloak of buffalo-skin adorn they shoulder while a spear shield tomahawk bow and quiver form they arm leggings moccasin with wampum garter tie below the knee complete with the waist-cloth they attire three fine horse be tie to a adjoining tree show that they be in every way ready for the expedition it be still morning and many mile of ground be to be cross before night the youth have signify they intention of make a excursion into the pawnee pict territory as soon as they silent invocation be end the osage brave stalk gravely towards they richly-caparisoned steed and mount they ride slowly from the camp for some mile they course be along a wide-spread rolling prairie but soon the presence of tree give sign of they approach a river it be not however until nightfall that they gain the bank of the arkansa hitherto they progress have be open and bold be within the hunting-grounds of they own people but now the frontier line of the pawnee pict lay before they in the shape of the dark rolling water of the arkansa and it be time to use caution and artifice it be determine as they horse be somewhat fatigued and as they depend on they for escape in case of need that they should seek repose upon the friendly side of the river and cross the arkansa in the morning they horse be accordingly tethered a diminutive fire light in a deep dell or hole and every other needful preparation make to pass the night a frugal repast be consume and then each warrior lean against a tree and smoking he pipe gravely converse upon the best mode of acquire distinction and renown many opinion be give : but nothing less than surprising a whole pawnee village slaughter the inhabitant and return to they home load with scalp appear to the heated imagination of the youth a sufficiently glorious enterprise to satisfy they ambition at length the fatigue of the day overpower they and the three friend fall into a deep sleep the sun have just tip with gold the summit of the tree the wild-cock be crow in the wood the thousand chorister of the forest be peal in rich harmony when the osage warrior awake they smile grimly on one another and then start each man mechanically place he hand upon the back and crown of he head they scalp lock helmet crest and eagle ' plume have all disappear petrified with astonishment they start to they foot who could have do so daring a deed not a enemy surely or they would have take the life thus place within they power the friend waste they thought in vain conjecture and then burn with indignation turn to seek they horse the long sweeping tail of these animal have also be cut off that it be the pawnee pict they no longer doubt and fearful be the ire of the osage at the contempt with which they have be treat the trail of they night visitor be plainly marked and lead towards a copse where they have evidently leave they horse it then turn to the river-bank and be lose nah-com-e-shee however glance he eye over the opposite plain give a cry of delight and point out to he companion the flash of spear in the morning sun to plunge into the river to reach the other shore and to ride madly over the plain in chase of they audacious foe be the work of a instant in vain however they strain they eye to catch another glimpse of the retreat party until again the flash of the spear-head be see near at hand and plunge over the next hillock the friend find themselves in presence of -- three lance stick in the ground if the indian boil with passion before they rage now know no bound : they vow with little consideration for the possibility or probability of the matter to exterminate every pawnee pict from the face of the earth this resolution be unanimous a halt be make and a council of war hold some ten minute be pass in discussion and then away go the osage on the trail of they foe just as they catch sight in the rear of a perfect cloud of horseman pour over the plain in the distance it be a war-party of the pawnee pict about twenty of whom come ride fast in pursuit of the three friend a thickly-wooded ravine lay about a mile distant towards this the osage hasten for refuge they soul bound with delight at the prospect of a contest which now open before they the ravine be soon reach it be narrow and on both side thickly wood while several clump of timber lay near its mouth the osage see that the only hope of cope with a superior force be by defend the entrance and accordingly dismount from they steed turn they loose and string they bow on come the pawnee pict ride furiously over the prairie the intention of the osage be too plain to be mistaken and none of they pursuer venture to brave the discharge of arrow which be ready for they reception but imitate the example set they cast loose they horse and seek the shelter of a copse the unequal struggle now commence and loud war-whoop ring through the valley arrow fly constantly from foe to foe the pawnee have a great superiority in number succeed oftenest in wound they adversary still they gain not upon they the osage though soon severely hurt preserve the same undaunted front and return they missile with unabated vigor at length however they arrow be spend and clutch they tomahawk the friend cast a glance of stern but undying affection on each other prepared to die like man on come the pawnee yell the fearful war-whoop and wave they hatchet on high already be a dozen of they within a few yard of the devoted trio when they yell be echo from the forest and three of they foremost warrior lay low slay by a flight of arrow from the top of the ravine back turn the pawnee to they shelter while the osage take advantage of the confusion snatch the usual trophy of victory from they fall foe and then catch they steed mount and flee guide by the trampling of horse they rush in pursuit of those to whose timely assistance they owe they life in vain however do they urge they steed they unknown assistant be not to be overtake for about a hour the three friend continue they ride and then halt to bind up they wound and conceal themselves for the rest of the day the spot select be admirably adapt for the purpose be a open glade in the forest surround on all side by tree here they turn they horse loose once more and lay down upon the grass weary and faint to find herb and with they to form a kind of poultice fasten on with bark by means of ligature of grass be they first duty and then the inner man be consider none of they have taste food since the previous night and there be none in they possession nah-com-e-shee be the warrior who be least severely wound and have pick up several pawnee arrow start into the forest in search of game with the keen perception of a indian he select that side which appear a little inclined to descend as it naturally excite he suspicion that a stream lay in that direction this be the more probable that a little purling spring that bubble up in the green open glade tend thither nor be the warrior 's sagacity at fault for a smart walk bring he to the bank of a narrow and slowly-running river within sight of this nah-com-e-shee conceal himself and prepare to wait even for hour the passage of a deer or elk he patience be not however put to so severe a test as ere long a rustling in the bush opposite attract he attention raise he eye from they fix position he see the antler of a buck rear themselves over a thicket of brush and next moment a noble deer bound to the bank to drink a arrow pierce its heart from the indian 's unerring bow ere its lip have touch the water and nah-com-e-shee rush eagerly towards the spot three mount warrior be before he and while he seek cover capture and bear away the prize the osage know that it be useless to remain on the watch any longer and pursuit be madness turn back and seek he companion who be more indignant than ever at this new outrage repose be however absolutely necessary and be now seek all trust to the keenness of they sens to awake ere they could be surprise it be dark night ere they awake and then the three friend groan with rage that be absolutely frightful each feel himself ornament by a squaw 's petticoat throw loosely over he burn with passion they grasp one another 's hand and vow terrible vengeance at this instant a dim light be see through the tree blaze up at a considerable distance in the forest it be the fire of a camp and the heart of the osage warrior be at last glad they have be so often outwit that the utmost caution be use each divest himself of every unnecessary article of clothing while they tomahawk be the only arm they preserve clutch these they creep stealthily and with a serpent 's tread into the forest as they advance the glare of the fire grow brighter and at length when within a couple of hundred yard they could plainly hear the green wood crackle in the full stillness of evening a faint odour of broil venison come pleasingly to they nostril and then three figure be plainly discern round the fire between the spot occupy by the osage and the hostile camp lay a rough piece of ground full of hole and natural ditch across this the three friend begin to crawl hold they breath and clutch they deadly weapon while they heart beat with anxiety lest they victim should escape half the distance be pass over and still more strongly be the cooking make evident to the hungry sens of the creep osage still the unconscious warrior move not but keep they back turn to the approach foe they be evidently eating and hold converse at interval at length as the friend come still nearer they appear to finish they meal and sink gradually on the leafy ground to rest the osage breathe more freely and advance with less caution until at length when within half-a-dozen yard they rise give the terrific war-whoop and leap madly upon the camp it be vacant -- they victim have escape the friend amaze be about to fly from they dangerous proximity to the light when three distinct laugh be hear the osage stand immovable gaze at one another with a grim half-angry half-comic expression and ere they could speak three maiden disguise as warrior stand meekly one before each brave a horse 's tail in one hand and the other trophy in the other the friend try they utmost to look angry but the countenance of the girl be so meek and yet so malicious that the gravity of the brave be overcome and they laugh heartily at the conclusion of they expect deadly struggle the girl then explain that for reason of they own disapproving of the celibacy of the three friend they have resolve to excite they admiration and interest that they have follow they immediately after they departure have creep on they in the night and divest they of they crest & c and play they every other trick which have be record in this legend the warrior listen and when they narrate how they have save they life in the ravine seem each strike with the same sudden conviction namely that the life thus preserve belong to the preserver and at once make public they opinion the damsel laugh gaily and promise to entertain the notion but recall they lover to a remembrance of they hungry state merrily and blithely sup the three maiden and the three friend that night beneath the greenwood tree and when in after-year they meet at eventide all happy husband and wife with dusky boy and girl crowd round they that it be the brightest moment of they existence be the oft-repeated saying of the three friend the artist 's daughter : a tale by miss anna marium sargeant act well thy part -- there the true honor lie -- pope ' i wish papa you would teach I to be a painter ' be the exclamation of a fair-haired child over whose brow eleven summer have scarcely pass as she sit earnestly watch a stern middle-aged man who be give the last touch to the head of a madonna ` pshaw ' pettishly return the artist ` go play with you doll and do not talk about thing you can not understand ' ` but i should like to learn papa ' the child resume : ' i think it would be so pretty to paint and besides it would get we some more money and then we could have a large house and servant such as we use to have and that would make you happy again would it not papa ' ` you be a good girl amy to wish to see I happy ' the father rejoin somewhat soften by the artless affection of he little daughter ` but woman be never painter -- that be they be never great painter ' the child make no further comment but still retain she seat until she father 's task be accomplish the chamber in which this brief dialogue take place be a meanly-furnished apartment in a small house situate in the suburb of manchester the appearance of the artist be that of a disappointed man who contend doggedly with adversity rather than stem the torrent with fortitude habitual discontent be stamp on he countenance but ever and anon a glance of fierceness shot from he full dark eye as the thought of the position to which he talent ought to have raise he would flit across he brain a greater contrast could scarcely be conceive than exist between the father and child : the latter add to the charm of that early period of life a face and form of exquisite beauty she dazzling complexion rich auburn hair and graceful attitude accord ill with the rusty black frock which be the mourning habiliment for she maternal parent and the expression of she feature be that of natural joyousness temper but not wholly suppress by thoughtfulness beyond she year leonard beaufort have once be as be imply by he daughter in a different station to that he how occupied he be by birth and education a gentleman but partly owe to he own mismanagement and extravagance and partly from misfortune altogether unavoidable -lrb- though he choose to attribute he reverse wholly to the latter cause -rrb- he find himself suddenly plunge from competence into utter destitution he have hitherto practiced painting as a amateur but now he be force to embrace it as the only means afford he of support he family which at that time consist of a wife and two child he be not without some share of talent but unhappily for those who depend on he exertion he be too indolent to make much progress in a art which require the exercise of perseverance no less than the possession of genius and after struggle for more than three year with the bitterest poverty he wife and youngest child fall victim to they change of circumstance little amy be thus leave motherless and would have be friendless but for the care of a neighbor who pity she forlorn condition watch over she with almost maternal regard mr lyddiard be the widow of a merchant 's clerk who have no other provision than that which be afford she by she own labor in a little school but from these humble means she be enable by prudent management to give she only child herbert -- a boy about three year the senior of amy -- a tolerable education which would fit he to undertake a similar situation to that which he father have fill towards this amiable woman and she son the warm affection which have be pen up in the young heart of we little heroine since the death of she mother and infant brother now gush forth in copious stream for though she love she father with a tenderness scarcely to be expect and certainly unmerited by one who manifest such indifference in return she dare not express she feeling in word or caress beaufort would usually devote a few of the morning hour to he profession and then grow weary throw aside he pencil in disgust and either wander about the neighborhood in moody silence or spend the rest of the day in the society of a few dissolute person of education with whom he have become acquaint since he residence in manchester the indolence of the parent have however the effect of awaken the latent energy of the daughter 's mind and young as she be at the time we introduce she to we reader she thought be engage upon a scheme which if successful would she deem reinstate they in competence this be for she to become possess of a knowledge of she father 's art -lrb- secretly since he have give a check to she plan -rrb- and she believe she could accomplish it by watch he progress and practise during he long absence from home as mr lyddiard warmly approve of the proposition it be immediately put into execution and herbert who be also make a confidant volunteer to purchase she color and brush for she dare not make use of she father 's for fear of discovery the performance of the young artist for the first twelve month as might be expect do not rise above mediocrity but by increase perseverance and a determination to excel she rapidly improve the disposal of a few of she picture furnish she with the means to procure material for other but she still studiously conceal she knowledge from she father intend to do so till she skill approximate in some degree to he eight year thus glide away and the beautiful and artless child have now become a elegant and lovely young woman she nineteenth birthday be approach and she determine to prepare a specimen of she ability to be display on that occasion she select lear and cordelium for she subject think it would tacitly express the affection which have instigate she desire to acquire a knowledge of she father 's profession she complete she task and the lyddiard be lavish in they praise of the performance herbert declare it to be quite equal to any she father have do and he approbation it must be acknowledge be highly value by the fair artist on the evening before the eagerly-anticipated day beaufort come home at a unusually early hour and what be of rare occurrence in excellent spirit ` i have sell that piece from shakespeare i finish last week to a gentleman who be go abroad ' he say address he daughter with unwonted confidence and kindness for it be not often that he deign to make she acquaint with anything connect with he profession ` what the prospero and miranda i admire so much papa ' amy ask ` yes and he want another to pair it do within a fortnight so i must rise early and labor hard for the day be short but i be better remunerate than commonly which make it worth my while to put myself to a little inconvenience ' ` you will like to have you coffee at six to-morrow morning then ' amy observe ` yes child not a moment later ' the coffee be prepare to the minute and contrary to the expectation of the daughter she father be up to partake of it for it be not a uncommon case for he to talk of execute a painting in a hurry and then be more than usually dilatory in its performance in this instance however he seem in earnest for after have hastily swallow he breakfast he sit down to sketch out the piece amy silently withdraw from the room not daring at present to broach the subject which be uppermost in she thought and employ herself with she domestic duty till the time when she deem he would require she assistance in mix he color which be she usual task ` it will not do the design be bad ' the artist petulantly exclaim as he daughter re-enter the apartment and he dash he pencil to the ground ` what will not do dear papa ' amy gently inquire ` i have spend the whole night decide on a subject and now that i have sketch it see that it be not suitable ' he pettishly make answer ` what be it papa ' ` coriolanus and he mother ' ` well in my opinion that would be very appropriate as the other be a father and daughter here be a mother and son but if you do not like it what think you of lear and cordelium ' amy 's voice falter and she dare not raise she eye from the sketch which she affect to be examine ` i be not in a mood for painting to-day : i 'll try tomorrow ' ` but you time you say be short ' amy venture to interpose ` well if i can not get it do he must go without it ' be he irritable reply ` i be not go to be tie down to the easel whether disposed or not for such a paltry sum ' ' i think you tell I that this gentleman would remunerate you handsomely ' ` handsomely ' the artist scornfully repeat ` it be better than i be usually pay but not a fiftieth part of what i ought to receive see how some man not possess of half my talent succeed but they have the patronage of the great to aid they ' ` and perhaps brighter day may yet dawn on you dear father ' plead the daughter ` never ' and beaufort rise in haste to attire himself for departure ` papa ' cry amy gently catch he arm ` will you just stay for a few minute i have something to say to you ' and a deep flush of crimson suffused she cheek as she speak beaufort turn hesitatingly ` it be my birthday ' she pursue -- ' i be this day nineteen ' ` that be no subject for rejoice girl ' he doggedly observe ' i have be look forward to this period with intense anxiety meaning then to make you acquaint with a subject which have long engross my thought ' she timidly say ` no foolish love affair i hope ' beaufort almost fiercely demand look sternly in he daughter 's agitate and flush countenance as he utter the word ` perhaps ' he sarcastically continue without give she time to reply -- ` perhaps you deem yourself marriageable at the matron-like ' age of nineteen and have select some country boor for my son-in-law ' this speech be direct at herbert lyddiard and amy feel it but she thought be at this moment occupy by another subject of absorb interest ` no ' she return with modest dignity ' i have at present no desire to alter _ my _ condition but i have for year be intent upon better _ yours _ i may be presumptuous in suppose it possible that any effort of mine could do so but i be resolve to make the trial and this shall speak for I ' as she conclude she draw from a closet the picture she have so anxiously prepared and display it to she parent 's astonished gaze beaufort could not speak but stand for some minute immovable with he eye fix on the piece as if doubt the reality of what he behold ` amy ' he exclaim ` be it possible that this be you performance ' ` it be father ' ` and you have have no teacher ' ` yes you have be my teacher for eight long year i have be you pupil -- a silent but a most attentive pupil i owe all my knowledge to you ' ` it be admirable ' he murmur ` and the very thing i want as like my execution as if i myself have do it ' ` do you say so my father ' amy exultingly exclaim ` do you say so that be praise beyond what i have ever dare to hope for ' and for the first time in she life she throw herself into she parent 's embrace beaufort re-examine the work ` do you intend it to pair my prospero and miranda ' he ask ' i do though not with the idea of its ever be sell as such i greatly admire you father and daughter and think i would attempt a similar piece i think to ' -- she stop for a moment then blushingly add -- ' i think it a appropriate offering from one who desire to be a cordelium to you ' the sale of he daughter 's picture be a fresh era in the life of the artist as it be the means of introduce he to several person of rank and influence who be at the time visitor at the house of the purchaser though amy 's picture be more highly finish than she father 's no one guess that the lear and cordelium and the prospero and miranda be not do by the same hand amy have catch she father 's bold style but add to it a delicate softness which he from impatience not want of ability usually omit the call upon she time be now incessant for beaufort grow more indolent than ever when he find that she cheerfully take so large a portion of he labor off he hand he would frequently sketch a outline and then leave it for she to finish without regard the inroad he be by these means make on he daughter 's health meanwhile he spend the profit of she toil in luxury in which she share not still allow she the miserable pittance which barely keep want from they dwelling and would not permit of she making either in she home or she person a appearance above the humbler class of mechanic ` we will bid a joyful adieu to this hateful town and settle again in london ' the artist exclaim as late one evening he enter he house in a excited state after a visit to one of he new patron ` be you in earnest papa ' amy ask whilst the color forsake she cheek ` in earnest girl ' he repeat ` to be sure i be i think i have drone here long enough and it be time that some change take place for the better the purchaser of my last picture be a young baronet who have just come into possession of a princely fortune and by a little flattery i have so far get myself into he good grace that he have promise to provide money to enable I to make a suitable appearance in town : he say too that amongst he acquaintance alone he can procure I sufficient employment which shall be liberally remunerate ` tis true ' beaufort laughingly add ' he have no more taste for painting than he valet and perhaps not so much but that matter not : he think that he have and it be not my place to undeceive he for as he be rich and influential he may be a valuable friend to we ' amy listen without make any reply ` you be silent girl ' she father resume ' i think you would be delighted with the intelligence will you not be glad to exchange this miserable hovel for a handsomely-furnished house and you shall have master to instruct you in dance singing and music for i expect that you will now have a opportunity of get settle in the rank of life in which you be bear ' still amy reply not ` well you be the strangest girl i ever meet with ' beaufort pursue in tone indicative of rise wrath ` but i see how it be i have suspect as much for some time you would rather marry a beggarly clerk i can tell you however that herbert lyddiard be no husband for you and i positively forbid you to hold any further intercourse with he or he mother ' ` oh father ' cry amy in the agony of she feeling now find utterance ` can you require I to be so base as thus to treat a friend who have be to I like a mother ' ' i have no personal objection to the woman nor to she son either have i not reason to believe that he aspire to a alliance with you ' he rejoin add : ` now hear what i say girl i start for london to-morrow and shall send for you in a few day during which time i shall get a house prepare for you reception here be the means to provide suitable apparel for the position we shall resume in society and i expect that you hold yourself in readiness to depart at a hour 's warning ' amy dare not oppose she father 's command and take the offer purse in silence as might be expect the knowledge of miss beaufort 's intended departure draw from herbert lyddiard a full confession of he long-cherished love and amy could not deny that it be reciprocal though she think it right to make know to he the cruel prohibition she father have enjoin the mother strive to console the young couple by represent that it be probable that some change might take place which would induce mr beaufort to withdraw he opposition to they union and counsel amy for the present to yield implicit obedience to she father 's command ` you be yet very young my dear child ' she say ` and that direct providence which have hitherto smile upon you early attachment will not i trust see fit to sever you ' the dreaded summons come within a week beaufort not think it safe for she to remain longer than necessity oblige in the neighborhood of she humble lover 's residence he receive she in a elegant house in the vicinity of portman square which in this brief time he have handsomely furnish and provide with servant amy enter it with a sickening heart and as he lead she from room to room demand she approbation she feel more disposed to weep than to rejoice ` amy ' he say when they be quite alone in the room design for he studio ` you be to reign mistress here but be careful never to drop a hint regard the humble manner in which you have live for so many year no one must surmise that we have be in poverty or we ruin be certain i intend give a entertainment to my friend a few night hence and then i shall introduce you to society meantime i expect that you will provide yourself with elegant and appropriate attire for the occasion for on you much of my success may depend ' ` on I ' amy exclaim in astonishment then recollect herself she add : ` if you mean on my exertion father you may still depend upon they ' ` no i do not mean you exertion though at present i must avail myself of you assistance but i mean by the manner in which you receive my friend amy ' he continue look steadily in he daughter 's face ` you be possess of uncommon beauty you be doubtless aware of it herbert lyddiard have not fail i daresay to tell you so a beautiful young woman be at all time a powerful attraction and to I it be everything to extend the circle of my acquaintance ' amy 's cheek which have be flush by the former part of this speech turn deadly pale at its conclusion how could she who have all she life be shut out from society entertain she father 's male guest -- she a retire and almost ignorant girl without one female friend or adviser she do not speak but beaufort see that powerful feeling be agitate she breast and strove to laugh away what he term she foolish fear ' a few evening will dispel all you _ mauvaise honte _ ' he gaily say ' i will hear of no silly objection ' and thrust a purse of gold into she hand he leave the room amy could scarcely realize the truth of the position in which she stand the event of the last few day seem like a dream but if so it be a dream from which she would have be glad to have awaken and to have find herself in she former humble home she could not but fear that all she father possess be hold upon a very uncertain tenure and what be worse that it be obtain by dishonourable means this idea be strengthen when the gala evening arrive and we heroine be introduce to she father 's principal patron a vain and weak-minded man who listen to he host 's extravagant adulation with evident complacency though to every one else it be palpably insincere beaufort insist on he visit he studio to give he opinion of the grouping of a historical piece he have sketch out for amy to fill up the baronet thus flattered suggest some alteration which would have make it absolutely ridiculous and the artist would actually have comply have not he daughter who have be request to be present interpose and she guest gallantly acquiesce in she judgment from this period a new trial await the unhappy girl for sir philip rushwood now become she profess admirer beaufort have plan this affair from the moment of he first introduction to the young man though he have warily conceal he wish from amy he have contrived to display as if by accident a miniature portrait he have once take of he daughter and as he pretend unwillingness to make know the name of the original the curiosity of the baronet be naturally excite on finding that the beautiful young woman he so much admire be the artist 's daughter he become anxious to see she but she father be determine that a meeting should not take place until amy be in a situation to set off she natural charm and be remove from she humble lover little suspect the scheme which have be lay she meet sir philip with feeling of gratitude but they be exchange for sentiment border on disgust when he become a suitor for she hand there be nothing vicious about the young man -- he be the dupe not the deceiver but to a mind like amy 's fill too as it be with the image of herbert lyddiard he attention be intolerable the open encouragement he now receive from the father however embolden he to persevere and he profess to look upon she marked disapproval as nothing but maidenly diffidence and proceed to address she as though a positive engagement exist between they amy now spend she day either at the easel or in receive instruction from the master she father hire and she evening in entertaining he guest he appear not to have a idea that prudence require that some matronly lady should become the chaperon of he isolate child much less that she heart could yearn for feminine society to one who be naturally so sensitive and timid the task be exquisitely painful yet she dare not murmur or a volley of abuse would have be the result nine month thus pass away in splendid misery during which period beaufort have often indirectly express he wish that he daughter would accept the overture of the baronet but on the morning of she twentieth birthday he call she into he studio say that he have a matter of importance to consult with she upon poor amy guess too well the subject he be about to introduce but she be appal when in a few hurry word and with a voice almost choke by agitation he tell she that it depend on she decision respect the acceptance of sir philip rushwood 's suit whether he be to give she away at the altar as a bride or be himself drag to a prison ` but why father should there be so dreadful a alternative ' she eagerly ask ` because i have nothing but what i owe to he on he credit this house have be furnish and he trades-people have supply we table you very apparel have be purchase from sum of money i have from time to time borrow from he -- for i have not yet meet with the increase sale and handsome remuneration for my picture i be lead to expect indeed many of those you suppose to be order be pledge for a tenth part of they value if however you become he wife ' he proceed ` we shall never want for he fortune be immense and he be easily persuade to part with it but if you refuse he vanity which be he ruling passion will be so deeply wound that he will withdraw he assistance from I and we ruin be inevitable i have amuse he with hope of success and assurance that you will smile on he at last in spite of you girlish coquetry till he be incense at the delay and he last night tell I that he would be put off no longer but have a positive answer _ from you own lip _ this very evening ' amy press she hand upon she burning brow in unutterable anguish ` yes ' she father resume ` this very evening you must set you seal to we destiny it remain for you either to open a brilliant career before I or to shut I up in a prison in disgrace i ask you not to give _ I _ a answer you bane and antidote be both before you but remember that on the decision of you lip to-night we mutual welfare depend ' as beaufort conclude he rise from he seat and hurriedly leave the room whilst poor amy remain panic-struck and scarcely comprehend the extent of she wretchedness she energy be however arouse and direct into a fresh channel when a few minute after she father 's departure a servant place a note in she hand bear the well-known character of herbert lyddiard which she say have be deliver at the door by a meanly-dressed young man she almost fly to she chamber to peruse the contents which though write by herbert be dictate by he mother she state that she son have lose he situation in manchester by the death of he employer have

she unfortunate friend in they present exigence she have a few guinea leave from she father 's last gift but she now shrink from use they even for so sacred a purpose the coach stop at the door of a large but mean-looking house in a narrow crowded street and she inquiry if mr lyddiard live there be answer in the affirmative by a ragged boy who ask if he should carry she parcel amy follow he not without some apprehension up three flight of dark steep stair but she fear be relieve when she gentle tap at the door to which she guide point be answer by the well-known voice of she early friend the meeting be affect in the extreme but amy do not find the invalid reduce quite so low as she imagination have picture though a few month only have elapse since they part each have a long tale of trial to tell and that amy have to relate be render doubly distressing by the confession she be force to make of a parent 's delinquency at length she speak of the decision which be expect from she that night ` and how do you intend to act ' ask she companion in breathless anxiety ' i feel that i dare not offer you counsel i be too deeply interested for it would be drain the last drop of earthly bliss from my cup to see you wed to any other than to my son ' ' i never will mr lyddiard ' cry amy energetically rise at the same time from she kneel position beside the bed of the invalid ' i feel myself justify in make this resolution i have be a unwilling nay i may say a unconscious agent in a scheme of dishonor but i should be culpable if by any act of mine i further it even though the motive should be to save a parent from disgrace and a prison still my father claim my duteous regard and so long as my personal exertion and self-denial can afford he aid i will never desert he ' ` you have speak nobly my dear amy ' mrs lyddiard exclaim she eye brighten and she pale cheek flush with pleasure ` you own upright heart be you best adviser and heaven will aid you filial piety ' as we heroine prudently wish to avoid a meeting with she lover she leave the house earlier than she otherwise would have do and return home to prepare she mind for the trial which await she she resolve to decline the baronet 's suit respectfully yet firmly allude with gratitude to the service he have render she father and she hope much notwithstanding the anger he have evince from the natural mildness of he character she have not however be long in she chamber when she to she surprise receive another summons from she father who she have imagine to be from home the dark frown which cloud he brow too

have the opportunity of display you triumph ' ` what do you mean papa ' amy interrogate wholly at a loss to understand the import of he word ` oh you be in utter ignorance that you vagabond suitor lyddiard leave a billet for you this morning ' he resume in the same sarcastic strain ` and you be quite unconscious that you be carry in a coach to he residence but the lynx-eye of jealousy watch you and you have convert a friend into a foe it be i however ' he fiercely add ` who must suffer the penalty of you disobedience and duplicity and either die in a prison or become a exile from my country

everything to you connect with my visit to mr lyddiard but i entreat you not to add to the dishonor you be already involve in by flight surely the debt you have contract be not to so large a amount but they may be liquidate in time by we mutual exertion let we descend to the sphere from which we have so lately rise if by that mean we can honourably overcome we difficulty ' ` talk not to I in this manner ' beaufort angrily interpose : ' i will not brook the disgrace you obstinacy have bring upon I and you have yourself alone to blame that you be not the mistress of a princely fortune go to you beggarly lover if he will receive you when penniless and homeless -- the tie between _ we _ be break ' and with these word he rise to quit the room ` do not leave I father ' amy shriek forth cling around he to prevent he departure ' i will share a prison with you if such he the dreadful alternative i will labor for you support but do not -- do not leave I ' beaufort shake she from he with a violence which throw she to the ground ` go wretched girl ' he vociferate as he descend the stair ` you have be _ my _ ruin ' it be the last word he address to she -- they meet no more scarcely allow

departure of zambellus and how could one domestic excite attention among the number who have inhabit this hotel the most frequented in rouen ` it be at this time ' continue the lieutenant of police ` that cornelius bring he complaint before I like he i feel assure that a great crime have be commit between rouen and pari but how could it be prove how could the criminal be discover at last a sudden thought strike I six or seven month since a goldsmith name martel have open a shop at rouen where he be entirely unknown there be something strange in he manner and the expression of he face : he say nothing of he parent or family and those who hazard question on the subject receive from he evasive answer give with ill-disguised embarrassment strike with he business be the same as zambellus 's and act under a involuntary presentiment i send a person who under pretence of make purchase enter into conversation with martel in which as if by chance he introduce the name of zambellus at this name martel grow pale and show sign of inquietude look anxiously at he questioner this strengthen my suspicion : i resolve to satisfy myself but here i confess the excess of my zeal lead I into error ` by my order a sergeant go to martel to demand payment of a bond for four hundred crown which i have fabricate under a false name martel when he see the bond cry out that it be feign and refuse to pay it when take to prison by the sergeant martel follow he first impulse accompany he with the security of a man who be certain he owe nothing but soon stop suddenly in great agitation he say : i be quite easy as to the bond it be entirely false and i can prove it but be there nothing else against I have you hear of anything the sergeant have feign astonishment and protest that he know nothing martel become calm and follow he with a firmer step to the jail where he name be register among the list of prisoner a hour afterwards he be bring before I it be now no time for pretence say i in a imperative tone yes the bond be false but as you have betray fear i must tell you that there be other thing against you a citizen of lucca name zambellus be dead and you be he murderer deny it not i have proof -- certain proof but calm you fear : zambellus be a stranger no one here care to avenge he death with some sacrifice on you part we can hush up this sad affair only you must confess all with sincerity -- you life be the price of it ` petrified by the assurance with which i speak and glad to purchase with gold the life which hang on a thread martel cry out : i see -- i see it be heaven 's do since that which no eye witness save my own be reveal i will confess all : let my fortune save my life he be about to begin when the appearance of the notary whom i have send for to take down he confession rouse he as out of a dream he perceive the snare and when i command he to begin he say firmly : no i have nothing to tell i be innocent ` all my effort to induce he to confess be vain i send he to prison but now he protest against he incarceration declare the falseness of the bond and accuse publicly the sergeant and myself ` this be my error you my lord can not doubt the purity of my motive but what will the parliament say -- always so severe towards inferior officer must the service of thirty year be blot out because i be carry away by excess of zeal my lord advocate you know all now judge I as you will ' ` be encourage ' say laurence bigot ` the parliament be acquaint with all and pardon you the chamber assemble to-day to judge this matter i have speak for you with the warmth of a man who esteem and respect you but you thirty year of service and integrity have plead more eloquently than i could do the proceedings which martel dare to commence against you have be stay for three month : the suit relative to the murder of zambellus be bring before parliament and martel be transfer to the conciergerie every search shall be make to discover the body of the murder man for though i firmly believe that you have discover the assassin yet there be no proof for you lieutenant though pardon you be not guiltless listen ' say the old man turn to he son and to etienne pasquier ` you be both destine to wear the toga of justice -- you emerie perhaps to succeed I and you etienne pasquier probably to distinguish yourself in the judgment-seat at pari or some foreign court remember that none may do evil that good may come above all a judge should not seek to discover the truth by means of a lie and do himself what he punish in other such means be unworthy of a magistrate ' three week from that time there be great excitement in the village of argenteuil the inhabitant have suspend they labor quit they house and gather together about the door of the hotel du heaume by they earnest conversation among themselves and they eager question of those who come out of the hotel it be clear that something unwonted be go forward there in short the large room of the hotel be for this day transform into a justice-chamber where laurence bigot assist by the magistrate of argenteuil question numerous witness about the murder of zambellus how many effort have this zealous judge make since he quit rouen on he search for the trace of the crime he visit many village question numerous officer of police but all in vain when he be about to return in despair of accomplish he object he be inform that some month before a corpse have be discover hide in a vineyard near argenteuil bigot hasten thither and the state of preservation of the remains enable he on view the body to decide clearly that it be that of zambellus accord as he have be describe by cornelius he brother the magistrate begin to read the evidence aloud when he be interrupt by a piercing cry and a blind man whom no one have as yet perceive present himself before the assembly it be old gervai a wander beggar bear in the neighborhood well know and much like when he way lead through argenteuil he be always admit to the hotel and have arrive that day he have seat himself unnoticed in he usual place in the chimney-corner he have spring forward with a loud cry when in listen as the magistrate read he hear of a corpse be discover among the vine but what could a blind man and one so long absent from argenteuil have to communicate laurence bigot regard with a kind of respect the serene and venerable countenance of the old beggar ` unfortunate man ' say he ` what can _ you _ have to tell we ' but after he first involuntary movement the blind man appear embarrassed and undecided ` ah my lord ' say he ` may i speak without danger of my life ' and he turn he white head on every side with a terrify air ` speak freely ' say bigot ` fear nothing ' then the old man relate how many month since he be leave argenteuil on he usual pilgrimage and have gain the high ground beyond the village when the violent bark of he dog cause he to listen attentively a man 's voice feeble and suppliant be distinctly hear ` monster ' it say ` thy master thy benefactor -- mercy must i die so far from my country and my brother mercy mercy ' then the blind man hear a fearful cry like that of a die man in he last agony and all be silence after a time he distinguish the step of one who seem stagger under a heavy burden ` influence by a sudden impulse ' say gervai ' i go forward ask what be the matter and who have be moan so ' nothing nothing say a voice in a agitate tone only a sick man who be be carry home and have faint on the way and the voice add in a lower and menacing tone : you may thank god that you be blind or i would have do the same to you i know then that a horrible crime have be commit and be seize with terror all thing conspire to overwhelm I with fear for immediately a dreadful storm arise and the loud thunder seem to pursue the murderer i think the world be at a end tremble i continue my journey resolve never to reveal what i have hear for the criminal may belong to these part and the life of a poor old blind man be at the mercy of every one but when the judge speak of a corpse be find so near to the place where i hear the voice i could not avoid a sudden exclamation i have now tell all god grant that no evil come to I from it ' during this relation laurence bigot appear absorb in a deep reverie which last long after the blind man cease to speak then address gervai : ` old man ' say he ' i wish to ask you a question reflect well before answer it do you remember exactly the voice that you hear that day on the hill which reply to you question and threaten you do you think that you could recognize it again -- recognize it so as not to confound it with any other ' ` yes my lord advocate ' cry gervai immediately : ` yes even as i should recognize the voice of my mother if she be live still poor woman ' ` but ' say the judge ` have you consider that eight or nine month have pass since then ' ` it seem but a few hour ago ' answer the blind man ` my terror be so great that even now i seem always to hear the voice that cry for mercy and that which speak to I and the awful thunder ' and when bigot still doubt gervai lift he hand to heaven say : ` god be good and forsake not the poor blind since i lose my sight i can hear wonderfully call the people of argenteuil they will tell you how they amuse themselves with embarrassing I and say in counterfeited tone who speak to thee ask they if they have ever succeed in deceive I ' the people cry out that all that the blind man say be true he knowledge of voice be wonderful some hour after laurence bigot depart for rouen and everything go on as usual in the village of argenteuil bigot convey gervai with he to rouen in the sixteenth century the great hall of audience of the norman parliament be renown for its beauty the ceiling be of ebony stud with graceful arabesque in gold azure and vermilion the tapestry work in fleur-de-lis the immense fireplace the gilded wainscot the violet-coloured _ dais _ and above all the immense picture in which be represent loui xii the father of he people and he virtuous minister and friend the good cardinal d'amboise -- all unite to give the great hall a aspect at once beautiful and impose the effect be increase when on day of judicial solemnity a hundred and twenty magistrate be seat in judgment there with they long white beard and scarlet robe have at they head the president attire in ermine mantle above whom be a painting depict the legislator mose and the four evangelist it be in this magnificent hall that the parliament assemble by a special convocation on christmas-eve in the year 16 -- but this time they be attire in black robe and they serious countenance show they have a rigorous office to perform this secret meeting of parliament excited great curiosity throughout the whole town the murder of the merchant of lucca the arrest of the presumed criminal the discovery of the body of he suppose victim the unhoped-for testimony give by a blind man at argenteuil furnish a inexhaustible subject of discussion for the crowd that throng the avenue of the palace every one agree that the day be come which would liberate a innocent man or dismiss a murderer to the scaffold the parliament after many long debate have decide that the blind man of argenteuil should be hear gervai appear before they he frank and circumstantial deposition make a deep impression but some doubt still remain it be a fearful thing to place a man 's life at the mercy of the fugitive reminiscence of a blind man who could only trust to he hear it seem almost impossible that gervai should recognize faithfully a voice which he have hear but once only the parliament determine to prove he and to bring before he successively all the prisoner of the conciergerie martel among the rest if after have hear they speak the blind man spontaneously and without once hesitate should recognize the voice which have strike he so powerfully this evidence unite to other should be hold conclusive it be not without design that christmas-eve be choose for this strange trial unheard-of in the annals of justice to have bring up the prisoner together on a ordinary day would have awaken they suspicion perhaps suggest to they various stratagem and thus leave the success of this novel experiment to chance on christmas-eve the order excite no surprise as it be customary on the eve of high festival to bring all the prisoner of the conciergerie before the parliament who sometimes out of respect to the day liberate those criminal who have be imprison for trifling offence above all as it be necessary to make the blind man understand the almost sacred importance of the judgment with which heaven have invest he a solemn oath be administer by the president of the assembly the old man take the oath in a truthful earnest manner which leave no doubt of he sincerity and the trial commence eighteen prisoner be bring up and answer the question propose to they but the old man never move and they on they part on perceive the unknown man evince no sign of alarm at last the nineteenth prisoner be introduce who shall paint he horror and stupefaction at the sight of gervai he feature grow contract he hair rise up and a sudden faintness overpower he so that the turnkey be oblige to lead he to a seat when he recover a little he involuntary and convulsive movement seem to show the poignant remorse of a guilty and tortured soul or perhaps the horrible regret of not have commit a second crime and finish he work the president and judge anxiously await the result at the first word that martel utter in reply to the president 's question the blind man who ignorant of he presence have hitherto remain quiet and immovable suddenly bent forward listen intently then shrink back with horror and fear cry out : ` it be he -- it be the voice that i hear on the height of argenteuil ' the jailer lead away martel more dead than alive obey in this the president 's order who in a loud tone have desire he to bring out another prisoner but this command be accompany by a sign which the jailer understand and some minute after he again introduce martel who be interrogate under a false name fresh question elicit fresh reply but the blind man shake he head with a air of incredulity immediately cry out : ` no no it be all a feint that be the voice which converse with I on the height of argenteuil ' at last the horrible mystery be clear up the wretched criminal tremble despair stammer out a confession which be now almost needless since the magistrate be fully convince of the truth which have be wonderfully elicit by the sole witness who could declare the crime but a few hour pass and martel lay in a gloomy dungeon of the conciergerie whilst in a public place not far from the prison be make the preparation for execution for at this period the scaffold follow the sentence so rapidly that a condemn man never behold

be to be direct to good he have be tell that he must resist he own passion but no one have show he what arm to make use of in this moral warfare he have be tell to love virtue and to hate vice but no

be no one could tell he family be now limit to sophium and he wife he have have another daughter fair and amiable as sophium but the sad school of the world and the all-powerful empire of love have

willingly accede to they request the two day of delay to edoardo 's departure be past and in those two day the signora cadorus have have a new and very violent attack which place she life in danger edoardo come to take leave of the family when alone the conversation the adieus of the lover be not long they both weep look at each other and be silent yet how many thing have they to say to each

heart since the day of you birth it be the gift of you father take it and wear it in memory of you poor mother you will find in my chest a sum of money and some bill on the imperial bank of vienna it be no great riches but it be sufficient for the unforeseen want that may press upon a woman i would never consent to give up these sum to you father and that be one source of we disagreement but it be impossible for the heart of a mother to deprive herself of what she could one day share with she child and i be glad that i have not do so for without such aid you poor sister would have die of misery as she do of grief and despair ' she say more and seem to make other confidence to she daughter but she word be utter so feebly that they be lose she then lean she head on the shoulder of sophium never to raise it more four month after this event the time of study return and edoardo come again to padua he do not bring the consent of he father to they marriage but only some distant hope cadori who be aware of sophium 's inclination forbid edoardo to frequent he house until the formal permission of he father could be procure thus be sophia deprive of the pleasure of be often near she lover of enjoy he society he conversation she could see he but seldom and that unknown to she father but edoardo be change he be no longer the frank the loving edoardo of former time a residence of five

have suffer himself to be fascinate by the fierce delight which be find in gaming play have become he occupation he chief need play and its effect the orgy that precede the excess that follow be the life of edoardo waste and debt be the consequence and when he have under a thousand pretence extort from he father all the money he could he begin on arrive in padua to apply to sophium whom he neglect at least do not see as often as he might though he still love she sophium be as indulgent as he be indiscreet at every fatal request for money she offer he double the sum he have ask when edoardo begin to tell she some feigned story to conceal the shameful source of he want and to give she a account of how he have employ those sum she would not listen to he ` why ' say she ` should i demand a account of you action why should i think over and debate what you have already consider will not all you have be one day mine shall we not be one day man and wife ' and these word take away from edoardo every sense of remorse : conscience cease to reproach he for the baseness of despoil that poor girl of the little she possess the thought that he be one day to make she he wife justify he in he own eye for by this he think he should have recompense she for all she sacrifice edoardo 's demand increase with he exigency he be make rapid advance into the most terrible phase of the gamester 's vice and the mania in sophium of give -- of sacrifice all she means for edoardo do not stop all the money leave she by she mother have already disappear most of she valuable ornament have be sell some of the bank bill have be part with : but as this could not be do without she father 's knowledge he have make the law interpose and sequestrate the remainder sophium do not dare to speak or complain she feel in she heart that she father be probably in the right that she own conduct be at least unreflecting and that edoardo 's expense be too great but still she find a thousand argument to excuse both herself and he she spend all the day make flower and steal a great part of the night from repose to devote it to this labor but she formerly so ready to make present of she flower and adorn with they the young girl of she acquaintance now exact payment for they so that every one wonder at this new and sudden avarice but what do she care what be say of she what do she care for appear without those ornament which woman so love and which add so much to they charm what matter it to she that she be ruin she own health by deprive herself of rest toiling and weep one look one smile of edoardo the have satisfy one of he desire compensate for all what afflict and trouble she be that she labor should be so insufficient to meet he want often do it occur to she mind that he gamble that he be ruin himself and she think of reprove he for it but have not courage to do so sometimes she accuse herself of aid he to destroy himself then she think that she be mistaken she doubt seem to she as injury to he love and she grieve for have for a moment admit they one treasure alone remain the cross which she mother have give she on she death-bed it be of brilliant and might bring a large sum she think over this and weep for a whole week many time she go out with the intention of sell it but she heart could not resolve to do so and she return penitent and sorrowful meanwhile edoardo be involve himself more and more in debt assail by creditor on one side and draw to the gaming-table by desire and necessity on the other menace with a prison threaten to be denounce to he father stupid from want of rest midnight revelling and anxiety he one day present himself before sophium in a state so different from usual that the poor girl be terrify at he whither edoardo have depart the beauty the freshness of you youthful year -- whither you simplicity of heart bury bury amid dice and card sophia no longer doubt that edoardo gamble that he have give himself up to a life worthy of reprehension but she be dispose to pardon he to hope that he would repent and turn to better counsel but what make she tremble be the hoarse and desperate accent in which he tell she that he have need of money that he be hard press by necessity oblige to pay ten thousand _ lira _ the glance that he direct to every corner of the apartment perhaps because he do not dare to look she in the face be dark and unsteady : some broken word utter in a low voice pierce she heart like a dagger and without any available means she promise edoardo to procure he the require sum by next day when he leave the house therefore she throw herself at she father 's foot and beg he for a sum of money that belong to she but of which she could not dispose without he signature but cadorus refuse it i shall not repeat they dialogue i shall only say that she come out from that conference in a state of distraction she mind be fraught with desolation hideous thought pass through she brain it be night : she find she be alone she feel desperate a terrible temptation pass through she mind she father she know have heap of gold lie useless in he coffer but lock and bolt place they contents out of reach she then bethink herself of the countess 's bureau in which she own cross have be deposit secure from the old man 's covetousness there too the countess keep she treasure she take a light observe whether any one see she or could follow she and repair to the apartment of the countess galeazzus who be from home spend the evening with a old acquaintance hardly breathe and walk on tiptoe sophium take a key from under a bell-glass and open the bureau oh how she feel she heart throb she be terrify she tremble in every movement the noise she make in open the money-drawer seem to be the footstep of some person follow to lay hand on she the light of the lamp reflect in the mirror and in the furniture seem to she so many eye that look on and reproach she she open the drawer and take out she cross under it be several note of the bank of vienna the temptation be strong she lay she hand on the papers but a thrill of terror seem communicate through she frame by the touch and overcome by intense excitement she fall senseless on the floor some time afterwards the countess galeazzus return home on enter she apartment she behold the wretched girl stretch on the floor with the diamond cross in she hand the bureau be still open she run to succor sophium and by the application of essence recall she to life the moment the latter awake to consciousness she throw herself on she knee weep desperately try to speak but could not the only word she be at length able to articulate be -- ` forgive I forgive I ' the countess use every mean to pacify she by the compassionate expression of she countenance by she maternal gesture caress and press she to she bosom with word of comfort and tenderness ` calm yourself calm yourself ' she say ` go and take some repose you have need of it ' ` countess ' reply sophium then weep anew ` shame shame and desperation oh wretch that i be oh my poor heart ' ` go go to bed sophium to-morrow we will talk here be the light ' say this she reach she the lamp with one hand and lead she by the other use a little affectionate violence to conduct she out of the room and prevent she from speak another word the next day sophium be so overwhelmed with grief and shame that she take to she bed strike down by a violent fever which be the commencement of a dangerous illness the countess be she nurse edoardo have lose the source whence he derive all he supplies through the illness of sophium could no longer prevent he father from come to the knowledge of he irregularity he be immediately recall to venice and shut up in a house of correction disgrace in the eye of the companion of he debauchery and force in he solitary confinement to make painful reflection on the consequence of he conduct he seem to be cure of he fatal passion and when release he return no more to padua but give up the study of the law he devote himself to commerce to which the contagious mania of make money of become rich make he steadily apply himself he old inclination have change its name it be ` mercantile speculation ' but the substance remain the same he have write to sophia that he father would not consent to he marriage unless it be with a lady of large fortune : unfortunately she be not rich enough however that he would wed none but she and that they must be resign and trust to time and sophium living on the few letter that edoardo continue to write she and

holland charles-loui know as the ` duke of normandy ' this individual present one of those extraordinary instance of doubtful identity which we find scatter over ancient and modern biography the mystery of he birth have not be clear up by he death and continue as impenetrable as that of the celebrated man with the iron mask it be well know that in 1791 loui xvi of france be overtake during he attempted flight from france at varenne and afterwards drag to the prison of the temple he be accompany by he family which consist of he wife marie antoinette he sister daughter and he only son the dauphin of france on the 21st January 1793 the unfortunate monarch be behead and he son still a prisoner be partially acknowledge as loui xvii though only in the ninth year of he age this be but a mockery for he captivity only become the more close and cruel he be separate from he mother and hand over to the custody of one simon a ferocious cobbler and he wife who besides practise all sort of external cruelty on he try every means to demoralise he mind when this ruffian be promote to a seat in the ` commune ' -lrb- a kind of common council -rrb- the royal prisoner 's hardship increase he be shut up in a room render totally dark both night and day in this he be keep for a whole year without once be allow to leave it neither be he body or bed linen change during that time the filth stench and vermin amidst which the child drag on he existence at length it be say terminate it on the eve of death he persecutor send the physician dessault to see if he life could be prolong by better treatment but the doctor 's reply be that it be too late : nothing could save he and he demise be announce to have take place on the 8th of June 1795 at the age of ten year and two month the national convention which then manage the public affair appoint a commission to verify the event and the body be open by two surgeon name pelletan and dumangin in speaking of the remains they describe they as a corpse ` represent to we as that of charles-loui ' the doctor pelletan take out the heart and preserve it in spirit of wine which he give to the decease 's sister when she have marry the duke d'angoulême the rest of the body be huddle with other corpse into a common grave in the cemetery of the parish of st margaret so that at the restoration of the bourbon in 1815 when loui xviii desire that the remains of he predecessor should be disentomb they could not be distinguish the equivocal wording of the medical report aid by other suspicion cause a idea to gain extensive currency that a dead child have be substitute for the royal infant and that he have escape from he jailer by a well-laid plan carry out by he partisan this notion be so prevalent that we find amongst the record of the convention a decree date June 14 1795 -- only six day after the date fix as that of the young king 's death -- order he to be seek for along all the road of the kingdom however the better-informed part of the community be firmly convince that loui xvii be dead and bury and from that time till 1832 the belief be never effectually disturbed take advantage of the doubt several impostor make they appearance claim to be the prince the first of these be one hervagaut who when discover to be a tailor 's son be condemn in 1802 to four year ' imprisonment in 1818 mathurin bruneau a shoemaker try the same trick but fail be sentence to seven year ' imprisonment in short no fewer than fifteen impostor have be enumerate all of whom pretend to be the wretched young prince return from exile after escape from the temple the latest claimant be the subject of the present notice and so startlingly do some of the circumstance of he career coincide with the short history of the son of loui xvi that many well-informed person really believe he be the person he represent himself to be between the termination of charles-loui 's imprisonment by death or otherwise and the appearance of this individual on the scene it may be necessary to remind the reader that several revolution and counter-revolution have sweep over france napoleon 's career have begin and end the ally have seat the bourbon on the throne in the person of loui xviii brother to loui xvi and uncle to he latest predecessor charle x have succeed and be drive from the throne by the revolution of 1830 which seat louis-philippe on it in he stead all these event have take place when the story of the so-called duke of normandy commence on a unusually hot evening for the season -- a early day in the may of 1832 -- a man cover with dust and who appear to be bear down with fatigue enter pari through the barrier d'italie still he traverse the boulevard de l'hôpital with a firm step be a fine well-made man apparently about forty-eight year old on arrive at the bridge of austerlitz he cross to the toll-bar at the further extremity and be accost by the keeper a invalid soldier who demand the toll upon this he make a sign that he do not understand french but on the other pull out a sous piece to intimate the nature of he demand the stranger shake he head heave a deep sigh and after some hesitation draw forth a fine handkerchief which he throw towards the toll-keeper and hasten away in the direction of the boulevard bourbon to père la chaise he get within the gate just before they be close for the night and conceal himself amongst the tomb and bush escape the notice of the watchman it be thus that the stranger pass he first night in paris the day be far advance when he be find too much overcome by hunger and fatigue to rise a gentleman accidentally pass observe and pity he condition after supply he with some food he recommend he to solicit the assistance of a benevolent lady whom he name as she be know far and near for she readiness to help foreigner in distress besides she speak the german language fluently the only one the worn-out traveller understand act upon this advice he repair to the generous comtesse de r 's residence at no 16 rue richer she be a lady well stricken in year and preserve a enthusiastic veneration for the bourbon branch of the royal family have be _ femme de chambre _ to the son of loui xvi when the wretched wayfarer present himself to she she naturally inquire who he be to which he reply in german ' i be charles-louis duke of normandy son of loui xvi and marie antoinette ' upon hear this unexpected reply the good old countess faint on recover she sens she exclaim ` good heaven he be the very image of he unfortunate mother ' on calmer reflection however she be but half convinced and determine to put the stranger 's identity to another test she have keep as a relic a little blue robe with metal button which be worn by the royal infant when she nurse he this she bring forth and the stranger no sooner see it than he exclaim ` ah my little coat ' after this comtesse de r declare she belief that he be she prince to be so firm that she would have die on the scaffold rather than recant without hesitation she give up the best apartment of she house for he use and occupation she even offer for he acceptance the remains of she fortune this however he at once refuse ask no more from she than that she would send for a tailor to equip he with habiliment more in accordance with he pretension than the tatters he then wear this the countess do and be not slow in impart to she royalist friend of whom she be the honor hostess all acknowledge the extraordinary similarity both in person and manner which the stranger bear to the royal family some be enthusiastic believer other with all they _ legitimist _ enthusiasm be sceptical amongst the former be a certain monsieur s de l who think the appearance of the ` prince ' a miracle in reference to that particular time louis-philippe when he accept the crown nearly two year before have do so with great apparent reluctance ` how happy therefore will he be ' say this visionary politician ` to remove the burden of the state from he own shoulder to those of the rightful heir to the throne ' but before so curious a proposition be make to the king of the french the other royalist consult m de talleyrand he reply with he usual epigrammatic irony ` there be some people who be bear with two leave hand this be poor s 's case : add to which he seem to have be bring into the world without brain ' upon this the party wisely determine to keep the ` prince 's ' presence in pari as quiet as possible another of he adherent m de forbin janson the fiery bishop of nancy suggest that as the illustrious stranger 's chance of the throne be somewhat remote he should enter the church in which the highest dignity await he this be also find to be impracticable when neündorf -lrb- the name by which the ` prince ' now declare he have hitherto be know -rrb- reveal that he be a married man and the father of six child the more sceptical part of he adherent very naturally wish to know -- suppose he story to be true -- how in he early year he escape from the temple and when the stranger have sufficiently master the french language -- which he take but a short time to acquire -- he give a most circumstantial and plausible account of he early adventure he narrative be carefully note down at the time and translate consist in substance as follow : ' i can not be say to have _ escape _ from my jailer ' he begin ` for i leave the prison in the most natural manner possible some time before the day of my suppose death a royalist committee be form for the purpose of save I one of these be m frotté who as the pupil of my physician dessault be allow free ingress and egress to the temple one day he enter my cell motion I to be silent seize I and drag I to a cabinet under the spire of the tower a sick child who have be give over by the faculty be substitute in my place and he die two day after -lrb- 8th June 1795 -rrb- be bury as loui xvii at my suppose death there be no more prisoner in the temple all the keeper and guard be withdraw and i be conduct outside the wall without meet a single official the ruse however get wind and the decree of the 14th of June be the consequence to frustrate this the royalist committee cause several child to personate I impart to the impostor several circumstance connect with my family one they send to bordeaux another to la vendée a third to germany and so on these be the child who when they become man try to keep up the character which they have be previously teach to play this explain the incredible number of false _ dauphin _ who have appear ' he end by declare that when in 1814 the congress of vienna cede the crown of france to loui xviii they know perfectly well of he existence but the obligation the ally be under to ` he uncle ' overwhelm the scruple they feel at invest that prince with a sovereignty to which he have no title one thing appear improbable -- how the assume prince should have forget he native language he be ten year of age at the period of he leave france and speak french as cleverly as any other boy if not more so how then do he lose this faculty a residence in germany even for so great a length of time as thirty-seven year could hardly have obliterate the french language from he mind this do not appear to have teen explain and with some other circumstance it serve to check the credulity of party half incline to believe the representation of m neündorf further proof be therefore require and several be afterwards afford the detail of the first be somewhat singular at this time -lrb- July 1832 -rrb- there live in the village of gallardon at the extremity of beauce a peasant name martin who have the reputation of receive revelation from above which he acquire so far back as 1818 when mathew burneau and other spurious prince make they appearance one Sunday in that year during mass martin see a vision in which he say a angel command he to get a interview with loui xviii the purport of which should be afterwards reveal to he immediately after he return from church martin have take leave of he wife and family commence he journey on foot to pari on the fifth day he arrive there go straight to the palace of the tuilery and demand to be admit to the king in the simplicity of he heart he tell the guard that he mission be of a celestial nature but they not find messenger from above among the list of visitor set down in the order of the day hand poor martin over to the municipal authority who transfer he to the bicêtre lunatic asylum here he remain for some time during which he exemplary piety and touching resignation attract the attention and respect of the principal physician who often make he the subject of general conversation at the end of two month loui hear of the circumstance and actually consent to see the harmless man at the interview he impart to the king the substance of a second revelation which be that he majesty 's nephew loui xvii be still alive and would return at no very distant period and that if the king he address attempt to undergo the ceremony of coronation the direst calamity would follow amongst other the dome of the cathedral -lrb- of rheim -rrb- would fall in and crush every soul take part in the rite whether the majesty of france take any serious heed of this enthusiast 's warn it be impossible to say but one thing be certain -- loui xviii never _ be _ formally crown when martin return to he village he find that the king have buy the house which he rent and present it to he to live in for the rest of he day this together with he interview with royalty -- of which he of course make no secret -- elevate the poor visionary to the character of a prophet amongst the population of that part of the country many of whom indeed form themselves into a sect call martinist and devoutly expect the re-appearance of the son of loui xvi as these fact be notorious in 1818 they have not be forget in 1832 and it be not at all unnatural that the least credulous of the comtesse de r 's friend should suggest that neündorf should be show to the beauce prophet accordingly in September a journey to st arnould near dourdan be undertake and without say who he be or pretend to be neündorf be there confront with martin in a instant it be say the prophet recognize he as the person he have see in he second vision as loui xvii he enthusiasm know no bound he embrace the ` prince ' with tear of joy and in the evening the whole party hear mass at the modest little church of st arnould whatever effect this scene may have have upon neündorf 's more educate companion it create a prodigious sensation in that part of the country and one which be extremely beneficial to the ` prince ' the honest people could not do enough to testify they delight after he return to pari they organise subscription in collect which the village priest take the lead under they influence the farmer and peasantry subscribe not only cash but produce a regular supply of which be send every Saturday to pari under the charge of a farmer of st arnould name noel pequet it be ascertain that during the four month succeed he appearance at st arnould the value of upward of # 16000 sterling be remit to he from various part of france with these supplies and the contribution of the comtesse de r and she friend neündorf be able to take a house and set up a establishment which he do as duc de normandie the title which have be give by loui xvi to he son he begin housekeeping on a scale of regal magnificence he buy a carriage and collect a handsome stud of horse he servant ' livery be splendid and adorn with gilt button on which be emboss a broken crown he even go so far as to form a court and appoint a ministry and that nothing should be want he actually start a newspaper to advocate he cause the gentleman who undertake the responsible editorship of this journal have however neglect to deposit the security require by law with the proper authority be arrest and condemn to a long imprisonment which he duly suffer the unfortunate victim to loyal sentiment be one m widerkeer this be the only evidence vouchsafe by the higher power of they knowledge of the duke 's proceedings that the government of louis-philippe do not apprehend any very serious extent of belief in neündorf 's pretension must be infer from the immunity with which they allow he to carry on he proceedings and to accept the contribution of the royalist on the other hand it must be notice that louis-philippe 's seat on the throne be not so firm as it afterwards become and he may have be afraid to disturb neündorf lest he should have excite the enmity of a very powerful party it must be own that the evidence which the pretender have hitherto produce be only calculate to gain over person of limited experience and strong legitimist prejudice a circumstance however which afterwards take place be of a nature to stagger more obstinate sceptic : it have indeed that effect we translate it from the word of a individual who be present when it happen the duc de normandie be at dinner surround by several friend ` among the company be a old lady who have recently arrive from the province have never hear of the prince and on be present to he be extremely astonished to find herself in the presence of so illustrious a person after dinner the conversation turn upon the duke 's younger day and the lady refer to address he in these word -- i monseigneur never see the dauphin but a old friend who be constantly near he person in he infancy have describe to I that from the midst of he lower jaw there spring out two tooth they be incisor and as straight and point as the tooth of a rabbit without speak a word he pull open he lower lip and exhibit to the company such a pair of rabbit ' tooth as be describe ' this occurrence confirm the duke 's adherent in they belief of he identity with the victim of the first revolution and the presence of the rightful heir to the throne of france create some stir in pari perhaps the aspirant to royalty and he friend feel disappointed that the government do not evince its dread by some little persecution over and above the imprisonment of widerkeer to account for this forbearance dark suspicion be whisper regard the _ secret _ intention of the ruling power and these be not long in be corroborate one day in November the duke express a desire to imitate certain other royalty by examine the street of the capital and mix with its humble citizen _ incog _ to this end he sally forth alone and even condescend to take he dinner at véfour 's celebrated restaurant the evening be unusually dark and while return to he house across the open space at the back of the tuilery -lrb- la place de carousal -rrb- he feel he shoulder suddenly grasp by a strong hand and in another instant a poniard be plunge more than once into he breast with the word ` die capet ' -lrb- \* -rrb- fortunately the intended victim wear inside he coat a medal of the virgin which have belong it be understand to marie antoinette he mother this receive the point of the dagger preserve he life though several flesh wound be inflict the assassin flee nor do the duke make any alarm for fear of be oblige to appear at the municipal guardhouse and thus get into the power of the government when he reach home he be faint from loss of blood and keep he bed for a fortnight -lrb- footnote : _ meur capet _ -- capet be the family name of the bourbon as guelph be that of the house of brunswick -rrb- the suspicion of foul-play entertain by he ` court ' be confirm they regard the bravo as a emissary of the government and the _ ` meur capet ' _ as a acknowledgment of the duke 's right to the crown there be however ill-natured people who go about hint that as the victim be quite alone and become the teller of he own story the diabolical deed _ might _ have be do by himself to strengthen the faith of he follower nor be these sceptic silence when the gash in the coat the dent in the medal and the blood of the royal sufferer be point out but upon the whole whether true or false the circumstance materially strengthen the duke 's position and on recovery he begin to play the prince in earnest he write to the duchess of berrus and to ` he sister ' the duchess of angoulême to the latter he offer to prove he identity in the follow manner : ` when in the temple ' he say ` we royal mother and we aunt write several line on a paper which paper be cut in half one piece be give to you and when we meet i will produce its fellow which have never be out of my possession since we fatal separation ' the truth of this be never put to the test for no answer be deign to he letter at length the state in which the duke of normandy live the constant visit of he increase partisan and he general proceedings attract the attention of the police and the heir to the french throne be make to understand that he stand a likely chance of be throw into prison and bring up to answer for he conduct before the court of assize upon this he determine to live less ostentatiously and withdraw to a hotel in the rue st guillaume -lrb- no 34 -rrb- with which address none but a choose few of he devoted partisan be make acquaint though formerly disappoint at have be pass so contemptuously over by the authority he now seem in great dread of they he never dare to appear abroad and institute particular sign and mode of knock at he door when those in the secret wish admittance the proprietor of the house entertain from these proceedings very disagreeable suspicion and lest he should get into trouble himself give he illustrious lodger notice to quit some week after the claimant of the crown be really arrest but exile and not imprisonment be he doom he be place in the _ coupe _ of a diligence between two policeman and conduct beyond the frontier of france in 1838 we find he in england still call himself the duke of normandy he take up he quarter in camberwell green near london and in November of the above year suffer a second attempt upon he life he be it seem return from a outhouse in the garden when a man confront he and fire two pistol at he breast he push aside the weapon with the candlestick he happen to be carry but two bullet enter he left arm the assassin escape over a drain into a back-street but have be recognize be subsequently capture a surgeon be send for and the bullet extract after have do no serious injury the criminal turn out to be one of he late adherent by name desire rousselle who on examination before the magistrate of the police-office at union hall could assign no motive for the deed and after two more examination he be discharge the duke decline to prosecute the next appearance of he grace of normandy at a police-office be in character of defendant it seem that he have turn he attention to the art of pyrotechnics and he explosive experiment be so alarming to the quiet neighborhood of camberwell that he be summon to answer for he conduct but on promising not to repeat it the complaint be dismiss it would appear that he experiment be not altogether useless for at a trial of newly-invented shell before the board of ordnance at woolwich the duke 's missile be declare either second or third we forget which in point of efficiency indeed he seem to have occupy himself almost exclusively with scientific pursuit whilst in england at chelsea whither he remove the duke construct a set of work-shop and laboratory in which he with he assistant and pupil diligently work in what he scientific labor and experiment would have result it be impossible to say for they be interrupt by a third attempt on he life while alone in one of he work-shop late at night a bullet be fire at he from a hidden and still undiscovered enemy the shot miss he but afraid to remain in this country any longer he retire to delft in holland where it seem he die a natural death on the 10th of August 1845 whatever opinion may be form of the truth of this individual 's story of he birth it be certain that a great many person in france whose opinion be entitle to respect believe he to have be loui xvii amongst the notice in the french papers to which he decease give rise be a note write by m herbert once director of the military post in italy it appear that when in that office the man neündorf be in 1810 arrest at rome and interrogate by m radet chief of police in that city : the latter pronounced he to be in reality the son of loui xvi than m radet there could not be a better judge of the matter for he happen to be one of the five person who arrest loui and he family when they try to quit france and be intercept at varenne we own impression be notwithstanding this and all other circumstance to the contrary that the man be a impostor and such we believe will also be the impression generally among we reader dutch anna it be shortly after the outbreak of the french revolution that the humble heroine of this story make she appearance in my native village dutch anna -lrb- for so she be call by the country people -rrb- be as the name imply a native of holland and at that time she might be about twenty-five year of age she be of the middle size stoutly and firmly build with a round good-humoured face dark hair clear honest-looking hazel eye and a mouth which though wide be expressive of decision and firmness she dress which never vary in style consist of a color petticoat of a thick woollen material a short bed-gown of striped cotton confine round the waist by the string of a snow-white apron a close-fitting modest cap underneath the plaited border of which appear she glossy hair neatly braid over she low broad forehead add to this a pair of well-knit stocking which the shortness of she petticoat afford ample opportunity of admire with heavy wooden shoe and you have a complete picture of dutch anna 's costume at the time i speak of the prejudice entertain by the mass of the people against foreigner be much greater than in the present day when the means of communication between different country be so much improve and the general diffusion of knowledge have show the unreasonableness of regard with distrust and contempt those of we fellow-creature who have be bear in a different climate and train in different custom to we own it may therefore be readily imagine that anna be for a time regard with suspicion and jealousy for the very reason which ought to have command the sympathy and good-will of she neighbor -- ` that she be a stranger in the land ' she mode of life perhaps increase the prejudice against she respect the reason of she voluntary exile she preserve a study silence though i afterwards learn that the persecution she endure from she own family on the subject of religion be the principal cause we village adjoin a populous manufacturing district and anna have be accustom to such occupation soon obtain employment be a person of a peculiarly reserve and serious turn of mind she could not endure the thought of living in lodgings and as she be not able to furnish or pay the rent of a cottage she hire for a trifling sum a old lonely barn belong to my father who be a small farmer and with the labor of she own hand manage to put it into a habitable condition the furniture of this rude dwelling be simple enough consist of a bed of clean straw a round deal table and two three-legged stool the whitewashed wall be ornament with color print on scripture subject

inoffensive though singular woman and many be the story circulate all tend to keep alive the prejudice she eccentricity be calculate to excite a casual circumstance which lead to my become oblige to anna at length enable I to overcome the suspicion and dislike with which we neighbor be regard we acquaintance speedily ripen into friendship for with the reaction natural to the generous i feel as though i could never sufficiently compensate for my former injustice towards she often in a evening i would put on my bonnet and take my work with I go to spend a leisure hour with dutch anna and on these occasion she generally entertain I with description of she own country and of the custom and manners of its inhabitant or with striking anecdote and incident which have come under she own personal observation never fail to draw some useful moral or illustrate some important truth from what she relate she could read well and write a little -- rare accomplishment in those day for one in she situation in life she power of observation be extremely acute and she memory retentive but what strike I as she most remarkable characteristic be she sincere and unaffected piety she undeviating truthfulness and she extraordinary decision and fearlessness when i have say on bidding she good-night ` anna be you not afraid to be leave alone here during the night with no one within call ' she have reply ` afraid miss mary no how can i feel afraid know myself under the protection of one as great and powerful as he be wise and good i be never alone for god be ever present with I ' after anna have reside some year in this country during which time she have by she constant good-conduct gain the esteem of all who know she and by she good-nature and willingness to oblige win the kindly feeling of even the most prejudiced she become anxious to pay a visit to she native land and as the accommodation for travel at that period besides be few be costly she obtain letter of recommendation from she employer and other gentleman in the place to friend reside in different town on she route and set out intend to perform the greater part of she land-journey on foot at the end of several month she return and quietly resume she former mode of life not till fully a year after this period do she relate to I a adventure which have occur to she on she journey homeward and which i shall now transcribe it be at the close of a autumn day that anna who have be walk since early morning with scarcely a interval of rest find herself in spite of she great capability of endure fatigue somewhat foot-sore and weary on arrive at the town of -- as she pass along the street she observe a unusual degree of bustle and excitement and on inquire the cause find that a large detachment of soldier on they way to the continent have arrive in the town that afternoon and that some difficulty be experience in find they accommodation this be not very agreeable news for anna tire as she be however she pursue she way to the house of the clergyman where she have in pass that way before be hospitably entertain hope that there she might be able to procure a lodging however humble but in this she be disappoint for though the good clergyman and he wife receive she kindly they could not offer she shelter for the night as they have already more guest than they could conveniently accommodate anna would have be contented and thankful for a bed of straw by the kitchen fire but even this they could not give as the lower apartment be want by those who have be oblige to give up they bed at length after some hesitation the clergyman say ' i know but of one place where you could at this time find a lodging you appear to be a woman of good courage and if you dare venture you may occupy a room in that house you see from this window it be uninhabited and have be so for some year as it have the reputation of be haunt anna look in the direction indicate and see through the deepen twilight a large two-storied house build of a dull red brick with stone coping stand at some distance from the high-road the house itself occupy a considerable extent of ground be beautifully situate with front to the south and west the principal entrance be by folding-door half of which be glass and the house be sheltered on the north and east by a grove of tree whose branch now but thinly cover with leaf wave mournfully to and fro in the night wind ` the last proprietor of that place ' continue the clergyman ` be a vicious and depraved man whose very existence be a curse to the neighborhood in which he dwell at a early age he come into possession of a large property which he spend in the gratification of every base and lawless passion he life as far as i can learn be one unmixed course of cruelty lust and impiety unredeemed by one noble aspiration one generous unselfish action he die suddenly in the prime of life in the midst of one of he riotous midnight orgy and the house have ever since be desert it be say and believe by we good towns-folk that there he still hold he revel with fiend for he companion and many affirm that they have hear the sound of they unearthly merriment mingle with shriek and wailing bear upon the night-breeze whilst the few who have venture within its wall tell of shape see and sound hear which would cause the stoutest heart to quail for myself i be no great believer in the supernatural and have no doubt that imagination unite to the loneliness of the spot and the strange freak the wind play through a large uninhabited house have originate report which we be sure would lose nothing in the recital so if you be incline to make the trial i will see that what be necessary be provide and i think i may venture to promise you a undisturbed night 's rest ' anna as i have before say be remarkable for she fearlessness so she thank the gentleman for he proposal say ` that she have not the least fear of spirit good or bad that the former if indeed they be ever visible to mortal eye could be but messenger of mercy and for the latter she could not conceive that a be infinite in goodness would ever permit they to revisit this earth for the sole purpose of terrifying and torment innocent individual like herself that she far more dreaded evil man than evil spirit and that as from the estimation in which the place be hold she should feel herself secure from they she would thankfully accept he offer ' as soon therefore as the necessary preparation be make and anna have partake of the good substantial fare set before she she beg to be allow to retire to rest as she be fatigue with she day 's journey and wish to set out again early the next morning she request be immediately comply with the good clergyman himself insist upon see she safely to she destination when have ascertain that proper provision have be make for she comfort and tell she that refreshment should be provide for she early next morning at he house he bid she good-night and leave she to repose as soon as he be go anna proceed to take a more particular survey of she apartment it be a large but not very lofty room panel with oak and have two window look across a wide lawn to the main road the bright fire in the ample fireplace illuminate the richly-carved cornice with its grotesque head and fanciful scrollwork it have evidently be a dining-room for some of the heavy furniture in the fashion of the period in which it have be last inhabit still remain there be the massive table and the old-fashioned high-backed chair with cover of what have once be bright embroidery doubtless the work of many a fair hand but what attract she attention most be a picture over the chimney-piece it be paint on the wooden panel perhaps the reason it have never be remove though evidently the work of no mean artist it represent a scene of wild revelry at the head of a table cover with a profusion of fruit with glass and decanter of various elegant form stand a young man high above he head he hold a goblet fill to the brim with wine excitement flash from he bright blue eye and flush the round cheek light-brown hair untouched by powder curl round the low narrow forehead whilst the small sensual mouth express all the worst passion of we nature around the table sit he admiring parasite young beauty and hoary age the strength of manhood and the earliest youth be there alike debase by the evidence of lawless passion with what a master-hand have the painter seize upon the individual expression of each there the glutton and here the sot now the eye fall on the mean pander or the royster boon-companion now on the wit look with a roguish leer upon he fair neighbor or the miserable wretch maudlin in he cup and again on the knave profit by the recklessness of those around he the bright blaze of the fire light up the different countenance with a vivid and lifelike expression and as anna gaze fascinate and spell-bound she thought naturally revert to what she have hear of the life and character of the last owner of the place be that youthful figure so evidently the master of the revel a portrait of the unhappy man himself who have thus unconsciously leave behind he not only a memorial but a warn how often have the now silent hall echo to the brawl of the drunkard the song of the wanton the jest of the profane the laugh of the scorner it be here perhaps in this very room that the dread hand of death have strike he here he have be suddenly call to account for property misuse a life misspend sadden by these reflection she turn from the picture and take she bible from she bundle she draw aside the tarnished curtain and seat herself at one of the window the moon have by this time rise and be shed she soft light on the peaceful landscape without the beauty of the scene soothe she excite feeling and as she read she mind resume its accustomed serenity close she book she prepare to retire to rest first examine the door of which there be two : the one by which she have enter open into the front hall she find to be without a lock or indeed any fastening at all the other lead in a opposite direction she be unable to open as however she be quite free from apprehension she feel no uneasiness from this circumstance and commend herself to the care of she heavenly father she compose herself to rest and soon fall soundly asleep how long she have sleep she could not tell when she be awake by what seem to she the confused sound of song and merriment so deep have be she sleep that it be some time before she could rouse herself to a recollection of she situation when however she have do so she raise herself in bed and listen all be silent save that the night have become rather gusty the wind at interval sweep moaningly round the desert mansion the fire be almost out but the candle in the lantern which stand by she bedside shed a feeble light upon the oaken floor and the moon though occasionally overcast be still high in the heaven readily conclude the disturbance to have be wholly imaginary the result of the impression make by she waking thought upon she sleeping fancy anna compose herself again to sleep but scarcely have she lie down when the same sound low at first but gradually become louder and more distinct break in upon the silence the noise appear to she to proceed from a distant part of the house and come with a kind of muffle sound as though door of some thickness intervene peal of laughter burst of applause snatch of song crash of glass mingle in wild confusion higher and higher grow the mirth louder and louder swell the tumult until when the uproar appear to have reach its height there be a pause -- a silence as profound as it be sudden and appalling then there ring through the wide desert hall and chamber a shrill despairing shriek whilst far and near above below around rise mocking and insulting laughter dauntless as anna be and firm as be she reliance on the protection of heaven it would perhaps be too much to say that she feel no quickening of the pulse no fluttering and throbbing of the heart as she listen but surprise and a strong desire to penetrate the mystery greatly preponderate over any feeling of alarm and she first impulse be immediately to endeavor to find she way to the scene of the disturbance but a moment 's consideration show she how foolish and imprudent this would be totally unacquainted as she be with the house and with no better light than the feeble glimmer of she lantern if it be the work of design person such a step would be but to expose herself to danger whilst if the effect of supernatural agency she could neither learn what they wish to conceal nor shun what they choose to reveal she therefore decide upon passively await the result of she adventure as these thought pass rapidly through she mind the noise subside the laughter become fainter and fainter until at length it die away seemingly lose in the distance and silence once more reign around after the lapse of a short interval this be again break by a noise resemble the rattle and clank of a chain drag heavily along which seem to approach by slow degree towards she apartment and as gradually recede then again approach and again recede and so on several time but each time come nearer than before until at length it pause beside that door of she room which anna have be unable to open cautiously raise she head from the pillow anna endeavor with fix and strain look to pierce the darkness in which that part of the room be envelop but though she could not distinguish anything and though no sound be make she become with a thrill more nearly approach terror than she have before experienced instinctively conscious that she be no longer alone resolutely determine however not to yield to feeling of alarm anna say in a firm unfaltering voice : ` whoever or whatever you be that thus disturb my repose and intrude upon my privacy show yourself and name you errand if you want anything from I if not begone for you attempt to terrify I be vain i fear you not ' the only answer return be a low laugh and where the moonlight stream in through the partly-drawn window-curtain there stand a frightfully-grotesque figure its body as well as anna could distinguish resemble that of a beast but the head face and shoulder be those of a human be the former be decorate with a horn over each shaggy eyebrow it stand upon all fours but the front leg be longer than those behind and terminate in claw like a bird round its neck a iron chain be hung which as it now slowly advanced sometimes in the light and sometimes in the shade it rattle menacingly the sight of this creature far from increase anna 's alarm considerably diminish it and she lay perfectly quiet steadily watch its movement until it come within arm 's - length of she when suddenly spring forward she seize hold of it with a firm grasp exclaim : ` this be no spirit for here be flesh and bone like myself ' apparently the ghost be compose of too solid material to melt in air have no other resource than to oppose strength to strength for it struggle vigorously and with some difficulty succeed in free itself from anna 's hold no sooner be it at liberty than it make for the door with as much speed as its various encumbrance would allow and anna now completely rouse and forget all prudential consideration in the excitement of the moment hastily put on a few article of clothing and throw she cloak around she seize she lantern and follow the ghost have however gain so much in advance of she that it be with some difficulty she could decide which way to turn but guide by the clanking of the chain she go boldly along a wide stone passage and through several room open one out of another until just as she be again within sight and almost within reach of the object of she pursuit it suddenly disappear and anna in she eagerness spring quickly forward be herself the next moment precipitate through a opening in the floor in she fall break she lantern fortunately she alight on a heap of straw or the consequence might have be fatal as it be though bruise and stun by she sudden descent she do not entirely lose consciousness but be sensible of a confused murmur of voice near she and as she perception become clearer she be aware that the tone though low be earnest and angry and that she herself be the subject of conversation ' i tell you it be the only thing to be do so what be the use of talk about it you fool ' be the first word she distinguish ` but ' interrupted another voice evidently a woman 's ` would it not be better to wait and see ' ` death and fury wait and see what ' fiercely exclaim the first speaker ` if she be dead it 'll do she no harm and if she be not the sooner a stopper 's put in she mouth the better ' completely rouse from she stupor by the danger with which she be threaten anna open she eye and perceive that she be in a large vaulted cellar at one end of which be a small heated furnace scatter about the floor and on rudely-constructed work-bench as though the person use they have hastily abandon they employment be many curious-looking tool and machine together with heap of metal of different size and in different stage of manufacture from the merely moulded shape to the finish shilling or guinea some half-dozen or eight man and woman be group together amongst whom she recognize the _ ghost _ not quite divest of he masquerade dress in a single glance anna perceive all this and it need no conjuror to tell she that she have fall into the hand of a gang of coiner fully sensible of the peril of she situation she extraordinary courage do not forsake she for anna though somewhat peculiar in she religious opinion be perfectly sincere and even at this awful moment feel unshaken confidence in the protect care of providence though a foreigner she possess great command of the english language and she style notwithstanding its singularity and quaintness be well calculate to overawe the rude and lawless band into whose hand she have fall with a calm and steady gaze she meet the eye of the ruffian who brandish he weapon before she and say ' i pray you do not commit this great wickedness nor shed the blood of a helpless woman who have never injure you ' ` oh come ' interrupt the man in a surly tone ` let 's have none of that gammon for it 'll be of no use if folk will meddle in other folk 's concern they must take the consequence we be not such fool as to put the rope round we own neck i can tell you ' ` nay but hear what i have to say ' repeat anna elude the man 's grasp as he endeavor to seize hold of she ` my come here be no fault of my own and i promise not to betray you ' ` oh ay a likely tale ' say the man with a brutal laugh ` we be all for ourselves in this world and no mistake so we shall just put you where you can tell no tale old girl ' ` stop hear what she have to say : you shall you must ' cry a young woman who start up from a table at the further end of the cellar at which she have be seat with she face bury in she hand during the foregoing colloquy ' i tell you jack ' she continue advance into the midst of the group and lay she hand on the man 's arm ` you sha not touch that woman : you will not i know you will not bad enough you be -- we all be god know -- but there be no blood upon we hand yet and ' add she lower she voice ` blood will speak you know -- _ remember _ ' the man 's countenance fall as the girl utter the last word he relax he hold of the knife and anna take advantage of he indecision and the relent expression she think she read in the dark face round she related she simple story dwelling particularly upon the danger the corner would incur be she miss and they security in case she be allow to proceed on she journey after see she friend the clergyman take courage from the attention of she hearer she even venture to remonstrate with they upon they dangerous mode of life and entreat they to abandon it and seek they subsistence honestly there be a pause of some minute after anna cease speak during which the coiner exchange with each other look of mingled admiration and astonishment at length one of they who appear to take the lead address he companion say ` the woman have speak well and there be reason in what she say it be true enough that murder will out and though she be a stranger she be know to come here she disappearance might excite suspicion suspicion would lead to inquiry inquiry to search and then all would be up with we besides a few week will see we clear of this place if we have luck and i think we may trust she so long ' then turn to anna he continue ` you have a spirit of you own and i like you the better and would trust you the sooner for it none but fool rely on the word of a coward but one who dare speak the honest truth without fear or favor when in peril of life be not likely to break faith i think so you shall go free on condition that you take a solemn oath not to reveal to any one the event of this night until six month have pass by that time we shall have quit not only this neighborhood but the country and ' he add with a laugh ` the ghost that have keep all the man in -- quake after dark like a pack of frightened child will be lay for ever have i say well my comrade ' there be a general murmur of assent and the man continue : ` recollect then that if you break you oath you life will be the forfeit : we have means to ascertain and punish treachery and should you attempt foul-play you can no more escape we vengeance than here in this lonely place you can resist we power will you swear by all you hold most dear and sacred to keep we secret inviolable for the time agree ' to this proposition anna as will be readily believe joyfully assent and be conduct by she strange acquaintance back to she sleep apartment she most gladly when morning dawn bade adieu to the scene of she singular and alarming adventure on arrive at the clergyman 's house she be not sorry to find but few of the family stir as she naturally wish to avoid much question in answer to the inquiry which be make as to how she have pass the night she say that she have be much annoyed and disturbed and though she avoid enter into particulars she strongly advise that no one should be permit to try a similar experiment assure they that she believe few could pass through what she have do without sustain severe if not permanent injury from it have thus as far as lay in she power acquit she conscience she pursue she journey in a few day she arrive at home but it be not until several month over the time specify have elapse that she relate the adventure to I in order to show how little dependence be to be place on the story tell of ghost and haunt house as dutch anna say : ` evil man have generally more to do with such story than evil spirit and after all it be possible to give a certain gentleman and he agent more than they due ' the locksmith of philadelphium some year ago in the city of philadelphium there live a ingenious locksmith name amo spark skilled as a maker and repairer of lock he be particularly celebrate for he dexterity in open they when it be necessary to do so in case of emergency like many man of talent in other department amo spark be poor though a very industrious and prudent man with a small and frugal family he merely obtain a comfortable subsistence but he never seem to accumulate property whether it be that he be not of the race of money-maker whose instinctive desire of accumulation force they to earn and hoard without a thought beyond the mere means of acquisition -- or whether the time occupy by the prosecution of new inquiry into still undiscovered region of he favorite pursuit and in conversation with those who come to inspect and admire the fruit of he ingenuity be the cause of he poverty we can not undertake to determine -- but perhaps various cause combine to keep he finances low and it be quite as notorious in the city that amo spark be a poor man as that he be a ingenious mechanic but he business be sufficient for the supply of he want and those of he family and so he study and work on and be content it happen that in the autumn of 18 -- a merchant in the city whose business be extensive and who have be bustling about the quay and on board he vessel all the morning return to he counting-house to lodge several thousand dollar in the philadelphium bank to renew some paper fall due that day when to he surprise he have either lose or mislay the key of he iron chest after diligent search with no success he be lead to conclude that in draw out he handkerchief he have drop the key in the street or perhaps into the dock what be to be do it be one o'clock -- the bank close at three and there be no time to advertise the key or to muster so large a sum of money as that require in he perplexity the merchant thought of the poor locksmith he have often hear of amo spark the case seem one particularly adapt to a trial of he power and be a desperate one if he could not furnish a remedy where else be there reasonable expectation of succor a clerk be hurry off for amo and have explain the difficulty speedily reappear follow by the locksmith with he implement in he hand the job prove more difficult than have be anticipate and fearful of lose credit by the delay the merchant offer five dollar ' reward to amo if he would open the chest in as many minute amo succeed the lock be pick and the chest fly open there the merchant 's treasure lay but they be not yet in he possession as he enjoy but a poor reputation for uprightness of deal amo could not trust to he promise of payment hold the lid in he hand he respectfully request the sum which have be offer and as he have expect it be refuse a much less sum be meanly propose in its stead on the plea that it be surely sufficient for a few minute ' work amo be indignant and inexorable the merchant shuffle and fume in a instant down go the lid of the chest and fastening by a spring it be again lock as securely as before the merchant look aghast at amo and then dart a glance at the clock : the hand point to within twenty minute of three and seem post over the figure with the speed of light what be to be do at first he try to bully but it would not do amo tell he if he have sustain any injury he might sue as soon as he please for that he time be too precious just now to be waste in trifling affair and with a face of unruffled composure he turn on he heel and be leave the office the merchant call he back -- he have no alternative -- he credit be at stake -- he be humble by the necessity of the case and hand forth the five dollar ` there spark ' say he ` take you money and let we have no more word ' ' i must have ten dollar now ' reply the locksmith ` you would have take advantage of a poor man and besides open you strong box there i have a lesson to offer which be well worth a trifling sum you would not only have deprive I of what have be fairly earn but have tempt I into a lawsuit which would have ruin my family you will never in future presume upon you wealth in you dealings with the poor without think of the locksmith and those five dollar may save you much sin and much repentance ' this homily besides be preach in a tone of calm determination which leave no room to hope for any abatement have exhaust another minute or two of the time already so precious the merchant hurriedly count out the ten dollar which amo deliberately inspect to see that they belong to no insolvent bank and then deposit they in he pocket have thus make quite sure of he reward he dexterously open the lock and place the merchant in possession of he property in time to save he credit at the bank about a month after this affair the philadelphium bank be rob of coin and note to the amount of fifty thousand dollar the bar of a window have be cut and the vault enter so ingeniously that it be evident the burglar have possess besides daring courage a good deal of mechanical skill the police scour the city and country round about but no clue to the discovery of the robbery could be trace the public mind be powerfully excite everybody who have anything to lose feel that daring and ingenious felon be abroad who might probably pay they a visit all be therefore interested in the discovery and the conviction of the perpetrator of so daring a deed suspicion at length begin to settle on spark but yet he poverty and known integrity seem to give they the lie the story of the iron chest which the merchant have hitherto be ashamed and amo too forgiving to tell -- for the latter do not care to set the town laughing at the man who have wrong he -- now begin to be tell the merchant influence by a vindictive spirit have whisper it to the director of the bank with sundry shrug and innuendo and of course it soon spread far and wide with all sort of exaggerated variation and addition amo think for several day that some of he neighbor look and act rather oddly and he miss one or two who use to drop in and chat almost every afternoon but not suspect for a moment that there be any cause for altered behavior these matter make but a slight impression on he mind in all such case the person most interested be the last to hear disagreeable news and the first hint that the locksmith get of the universal suspicion be from the officer of the police who come with a party of constable to search he premise astonishment and grief be the portion of amo and he family for that day ` cheer up my darling ' say amo who be the first to recover the sobriety of thought that usually characterise he -- ` cheer up -- all will yet he well it be impossible that the unjust suspicion can long hover about we a life of honesty and fair-dealing will not be without its reward the real author of this outrage will probably be discover soon for a fraud so extensive will make all party vigilant and if not why then when we neighbor see we toiling at we usual occupation with no evidence of secret wealth or lavish expenditure on we person or at we board and remember how many year we have be so occupied and so attire without a suspicion of wrong-doing even in small matter attach to we there will be good-sense and good-feeling enough in the city to do we justice ' there be sound sense and much consolation in this reasoning : the obvious probability of the case be in favor of the fulfilment of the locksmith 's expectation but a scene of trial and excitement -- of prolonged agony and hope defer -- lay before he the extent of which it would have be difficult if not impossible for he then to have foresee toil in the search the director of the bank send one of they body to negotiate with amo -- to offer he a large sum of money and a guarantee from further molestation if he would confess restore the property and give up he accomplice if any there be it be in vain that he protest he innocence and avow he abhorrence of the crime the banker rally he on he assumed composure and threaten he with consequence until the locksmith who have be unaccustomed to dialogue found on the presumption that he be a villain order he tormentor out of he shop with the spirit of a man who though poor be resolve to preserve he self-respect and protect the sanctity of he dwelling from impertinent and insulting intrusion the banker retire baffled and threatening vengeance a consultation be hold and it be finally determine to arrest spark and commit he to prison in the hope that by shut he up and separate he from he family and accomplice he would be less upon he guard against the collection of evidence necessary to a conviction and perhaps be frighten into term or induce to make a full confession this be a severe blow to he family the privation force upon they by the want of the locksmith 's earnings be bear without a murmur -- and out of the little that could be muster a portion be always reserve to buy some trifling but unexpected comfort or luxury to carry to the prisoner some month have pass without spark have make any confession or the discovery of any new fact whereby he guilt might be establish he prosecutor find themselves reluctantly compel to bring he to trial they have not a tittle of evidence except some strange lock and implement find in the shop and which prove the talent but not the guilt of the mechanic but these be so various and execute with such elaborate art and such a evident expenditure of labor that but few even of the judge jury or spectator could be persuade that a man so poor would have devote himself so sedulously to such a employment unless he have have some other object in view than mere instruction or amusement he friend and neighbor give he a excellent character but on they cross-examination all admit he entire devotion to he favorite pursuit the counsel for the banker exert himself with considerable ability calculate in some degree on the state of the public mind and upon the influence which vague rumor couple with the evidence of the mechanic 's handicraft exhibit in court might have on the mind of the jury he dwell upon every ward and wind -- on the story of the iron chest -- on the evident poverty of the locksmith and yet he apparent waste of time -- and ask if all this work be not intend to insure success in some vast design he believe that a verdict would be immediately follow by a confession for he think amo guilty and succeed in make the belief pretty general among he audience some of the jury be half inclined to speculate on the probability of a confession and sweep away by the current of suspicion be not indispose to convict without evidence in order that the result might do credit to they penetration but this be impossible even in a american court of justice in the good old time of which we write hang person on suspicion and acquit felon because the mob think murder no crime be modern invention the charge of the judge be clear and decisive he admit that there be grounds of suspicion -- that there be circumstance connect with the prisoner 's peculiar mode of life that be not reconcilable with the lowness of he finances but yet of direct testimony there be not a vestige and of circumstantial evidence there be not only link want in the chain but in fact there be not a single link extend beyond the locksmith 's dwelling spark be accordingly acquit but as no other clue be find to direct suspicion it still lay upon he like a cloud the vindictive merchant and the dissatisfied banker do not hesitate to declare that although the charge could not be legally bring home they have no doubt whatever of he guilt this opinion be take up and reiterate until thousand who be too careless to investigate the story be satisfy that amo spark be a rogue amo rejoice in he acquittal as one who feel that the jury have perform a solemn duty faithfully and who be glad to find that he present experience have strengthen rather than impaired he reliance on the tribunal of he country he embrace he family as one snatch from great responsibility and peril and yet amo feel that though acquit by the jury he be not by the town : he see that in the face of some of the jury and most of the audience which he be too shrewd a observer to misunderstand he wish it be otherwise but he be contented to take he chance of some subsequent revelation and if it come not of live down the foul suspicion but amo have never think of how he be to live the cold look avert face and rude scandal of the neighbor could be bear because really there be some excuse in the circumstance and because he hope that there would be a joyful ending of it all at some future day but the loss of custom first open he eye to he real situation no work come to he shop he make article but he could not sell they and as the little money he have save be necessarily exhaust in the unavoidable expense of the trial the family find it impossible aid by the utmost exertion and economy to meet they current outlay one article of furniture after another be reluctantly sacrifice or some little comfort abridge until at the end of month of degradation and absolute distress they bare board be spread within bare wall and it become necessary to beg to starve or to remove the latter expedient have often be suggest in family consultation and it be one that in america be the common remedy for all great calamity the sparks would have remove but they still cling to the hope that the real perpetrator would he discover and the mystery clear up and besides they think it would he a acknowledgment of the justice of the general suspicion if they turn they hack and flee they live upon the expectation of the renew confidence and companionship of old friend and neighbor when providence should deem it right to draw the veil aside at length to live longer in philadelphium become impossible and the whole family prepare to depart they effect be easily transport and as they have have no credit since the arrest there be nobody to prevent they from seek a livelihood elsewhere embark in one of the river boat they push up the schuylkill and settle at norristown the whole family be industrious and oblige they soon begin to gather little comfort around they and as these be not embittered by the cold look and insulting sneer of the neighborhood they be comparatively happy for a time but even here there be for they no permanent place of rest a traveller pass through norristown on he way from the capital to the blue mountain recognize spark and tell somebody he know that he wish the community joy of have add to the number of its inhabitant the notorious locksmith of philadelphium the news soon spread the family find that they be shun as they have formerly be by those who have know they longer than the good people of norristown and have a fair prospect of starvation opening before they they remove again this time there be no inducement to linger for they have no local attachment to detain they they cross the mountain and descend into the vale of the susquehanna pitch they tent at sunbury here the same temporary success excite the same hope only to be blighted in the bud by the breath of slander which seem so widely circulate as to leave they hardly any asylum within the limit of the state we need not enumerate the different town and village in which they essay to gain a livelihood and fail they have nearly cross the state in its whole length be drive from pittsburg and be slowly wend they way further west and be stand on the high ground overlook middleton as though doubtful if there be to be
