produce by juliet sutherland shon mccarley and pg distribute proofreader short story old and new select and edit by c alphonso smith edgar allan poe professor of english in the university of virginium author of the american short story etc 1916 introduction every short story have three part which may be call set or background plot or plan and character or character if you be go to write a short story as i hope you be you will find it necessary to think through these three part so as to relate they interestingly and naturally one to the other and if you want to assimilate the best that be in the follow story you will do well to approach they by the same three route the setting or background give we the time and the place of the story with such detail of custom scenery and dialect as time and place imply it answer the question _ when where _ the plot tell we what happen it give we the incident and event the hap or mishap that be interweave to make up the warp and woof of the story sometimes there be hardly any interweave just a plain plan or simple outline be follow as in the christmas carol or the great stone face we may still call the core of these two story the plot if we want to but plan would be the more accurate this part of the story answer the question _ what _ under the head character or character we study the personality of the man and woman who move through the story and give it unity and coherence sometimes as in the christmas carol or markheim one character so dominate the other that they be mere spoke in he hub or incident in he career but in the gift of the magus though more space be give to della she and jim act from the same motive and contribute equally to the development of the story in one of we story the main character be a dog but he be so human that we may still say that the chief question to be answer under this head be _ who _ many book have be write about these three part of a short story but the great lesson to be learn be that the excellence of a story long or short consist not in the separate excellence of the setting or of the plot or of the character but in the perfect blending of the three to produce a single effect or to impress a single truth if the setting do not fit the plot if the plot do not rise gracefully from the setting if the character do not move naturally and self-revealingly through both the story be a failure emerson might well have have we three part of the short story in mind when he write all be need by each one nothing be fair or good alone contents introduction i esther from the old testament

story from begin to end if the setting have be in jerusalem esther could not have preach the noble doctrine when in rome do not do as rome do but be true to the old ideal of home and race _ plot _ esther seem to I the best-told story in the bible observe how the note of empty persian bigness versus simple jewish faith be strike at the very begin and be echo to the end thus ahasuerus rule over one hundred and twenty-seven province the opening banquet last one hundred and eighty-seven day the king 's bulletin be as unalterable as the tide the gallows erect be eighty-three foot high the bed be of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble the money wrest from the jew be to be eighteen million dollar etc the word banquet occur twenty time in this short story and only twenty time in all the remain thirty-eight book of the old testament in other word ahasuerus and he trencher-mate eat and drink as much in five day as have be eat and drunk by all the other old testament character from genesis to malachi note also the contrast between the two queen the two prime minister the two edict and the two later banquet the most masterly part of the plot be the handling of event between these banquet read again from chapter v begin at verse 9 through chapter vi and note how skillfully the pen be hold in motivation as well as in symmetry and naturalness the story be without a peer there be humor too in the solemn deliberation over vashtus 's no -lrb- chapter i verse 12-22 -rrb- and in the strange procession lead by pedestrian haman -lrb- chapter vi verse 6-11 -rrb- the purpose of the story be to encourage the feast of purim -lrb- chapter ix verse 20-32 -rrb- and to promote national solidarity it may be compare to a christmas carol which be write to restore the wane celebration of christmas and to we declaration of independence which be re-read on every fourth of July to quicken we sense of national fellowship but esther be more than a institution it be the old story of two conflict civilization one represent bigness the other greatness one standing for materialism the other for idealism one enthrone the body the other the spirit _ character _ these be finely individualize though each seem to I a type ahasuerus be a tank that run blood or wine accord to the hand that turn the spigot he be use for good but deserve and receive no credit for it no man ever miss a greater opportunity he be bring face to face with the two greatest world-civilization of history but understand neither he remain only a muddy place in the road along which greek and hebrew pass to world-conquest haman a blend of vanity and cruelty and cowardice but not without some power of initiative be a fit minister for he king he live in history as one who better than in hamlet 's illustration be hoist with he own petard the petard in he case be a gallows he typify also the just fate of the man who spur by the hate of one include in he scheme of extermination a whole people collective vengeance never receive a better illustration nor a more exemplary punishment mordecaus be altogether admirable in refuse to kowtow to haman and in he unselfish devotion to he fair cousin esther the noblest sentiment in the book -- who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this -- come from mordecaus but the lead character be esther not because she be fair and beautiful but because she be hospitable to the great thought suggest by mordecaus none but a jew could have ask who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this and none but a jew could have answer as esther answer the question imply a sense of personal responsibility and of divine guidance far beyond the reach of persian or mede or greek of that time it call up many a quiet hour when esther and mordecaus talk together of they strange lot in this heathen land and wonder if the time would ever come when they could interpret they trial in term of national service rather than of meaningless fate imagine the blank and bovine expression that ahasuerus or haman would have turn upon you if you have put such a question to either of they but in the case of esther mordecaus 's appeal unlock a unused reservoir of power that have make she one of the world 's heroine she have she fault or rather she limitation but since she time man have go to the stake have build up and tear down principality and power on the dynamic conviction that they have be send to the kingdom for such a time as this -rrb- chapter i the story of vashtus 1 now it come to pass in the day of ahasuerus -lrb- this be ahasuerus which reign from indium even unto ethiopium over a hundred and seven and twenty province -rrb- 2 that in those day when the king ahasuerus sit

cord of fine linen and purple to silver ring and pillar of marble : the bed be of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble 7 and they give they drink in vessel of gold -lrb- the vessel be diverse one from another -rrb- and royal wine in abundance accord to the state of the king 8 and the drinking be accord to the law none do compel : for so the king have appoint to all the officer of he house that they should do accord to every man 's pleasure 9 also vashti the queen make a feast for the woman in the royal house which belong to king ahasuerus 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the king be merry with wine he command mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carca the seven chamberlain that serve in the presence of ahasuerus the

commandment by he chamberlain : therefore be the king very wroth and he anger burn in he 13 then the king say to the wise man which know the time -lrb- for so be the king 's manner toward all that know law and judgment : 14 and the next unto he be carshena shethar admatha tarshish mere marsena and memucan the seven prince of persium and media which see the king 's face and which sit the first in the kingdom -rrb- 15 what shall we do unto the queen vashtus accord to law because she have not perform the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlain 16 and memucan answer before the king and the prince vashti the queen have not do wrong to the king only but also to all the prince and to all the people that be in all the province of the king ahasuerus 17 for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all woman so that they shall despise they husband in they eye when it shall be report the king ahasuerus command vashtus the queen to be bring in before he but she come not 18 likewise shall the lady of persium and media say this day unto all the king 's prince which have hear of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath 19 if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from he and let it be write among the law of the persian and the mede that it be not alter that vashtus come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give she royal estate unto another that be better than she 20 and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be publish throughout all he empire -lrb- for it be great -rrb- all the wife shall give to they husband honor both to great and small 21 and the say pleased the king and the prince and the king do accord to the word of memucan : 22 for he send letter into all the king 's province into every province accord to the write thereof and to every people after they language that every man should bear rule in he own house and that it should be publish accord to the language of every people chapter ii esther make queen 1 after these thing when the wrath of king ahasuerus be appease he remember vashtus and what she have do and what be decree against she 2 then say the king 's servant that minister unto he let there be fair young virgin seek for the king : 3 and let the king appoint officer in all the province of he kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgin unto shushan the palace to the house of the woman unto the custody of hegaus the king 's chamberlain keeper of the woman and let they thing for purification be give they : 4 and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashtus and the thing please the king and he do so 5 now in shushan the palace there be a certain jew whose name be mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the

kindred : for mordecaus have charge she that she should not shew it 11 and mordecaus walk every day before the court of the woman 's house to know how esther do and what should become of she 12 now when every maid 's turn be come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she have be twelve month accord to the manner of the woman -lrb- for so be the day of they purification accomplish to wit six

esther above all the woman and she obtain grace and favor in he sight more than all the virgin so that he set the royal crown upon she head and make she queen instead of vashtus 18 then the king make a great feast unto all he prince and he servant even esther 's feast and he make a release to the province and give gift accord to the state of the king 19 and when the virgin be gather together the second time then mordecai sit in the king 's gate 20 esther have not yet shew she kindred nor she people as mordecaus have charge she : for esther do the commandment of mordecaus like as when she be

to lay hand on the king ahasuerus 22 and the thing be know to mordecaus who tell it unto esther the queen and esther certify the king thereof in mordecaus 's name 23 and when inquisition be make of the matter it be find out therefore they be both hang on a tree : and it be write in the book of the chronicle before the king chapter iii the conspiracy of haman 1 after these thing do king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advance he and set he seat above all the prince that be with he 2 and all the king 's servant that be in the king 's gate bow and reverence haman : for the king have so command concern he but mordecaus bow not nor do he reverence 3 then the king 's servant which be in the king 's gate say unto mordecaus why transgressest thou the king 's commandment 4 now it come to pass when they speak daily unto he and he hearken not unto they that they tell haman to see whether mordecaus 's matter would stand : for he have tell they that he be a jew 5 and when haman see that mordecaus bow not nor do he reverence then be haman full of wrath 6 and he think scorn to lay hand on mordecaus alone for they have shew he the people of mordecaus : wherefore haman seek to destroy all the jew that be throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecaus 7 in the first month that be the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that be the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that be the month adar 8 and haman say unto king ahasuerus there be a certain people

whithersoever the king 's commandment and he decree come there be great mourning among the jew and fasting and weep and wail and many lay in sackcloth and ash 4 so esther 's maid and she chamberlain come and tell it she then be the queen exceedingly grieve and she send raiment to clothe mordecaus and to take away he sackcloth from he : but he receive it not 5 then call esther for hatach one of the king 's chamberlain whom he have appoint to attend upon she and give he a commandment to mordecaus to know what it be and why it be 6 so hatach go forth to mordecaus unto the street of the city which be before the king 's gate 7 and mordecaus tell he of all that have happen unto he and of the sum of the money that haman have promise to pay to the king 's treasury for the jew to destroy they

holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jew from another place but thou and thy father 's house shall be destroy : and who knoweth whether thou art

unknown -lrb- _ setting _ this story like esther take place in persium the story of the arabian night as a whole probably originate in indium be modify and augment by the persian and have the finishing touch put upon they by the arabian bagdad on the tigri be the city that figure most prominently in the story and the good caliph haroun al-raschid -lrb- or alraschid -rrb- who rule from 786 to 809 ad be the monarch most often mention a goodly place a goodly time for it be in the golden prime of good haroun alraschid however old the germ of the story be the form in which we have they hardly antedate the year 1450 the absence of all mention of coffee and tobacco preclude at least a date much later they begin to be translate into the language of europe during the reign of queen anne and with the exception of the old testament have be the chief orientalize influence in modern literature the setting of alus baba show the four characteristic of all these perso-arabian tale : it have to do with town life not country life it presuppose one faith the mohammedan it show a fondness for magic and it take for grant a audience interested not in moral or ethical distinction but in story-telling for story-telling 's sake _ plot _ the plot of the short story as a distinct type of literature have be say to show a steady progress from the impossible through the improbable and probable to the inevitable when we say of a story that the conclusion be inevitable we mean that with the give background and character it could not have end in any other way just as with a give multiplier and multiplicand one product and only one be possible this can not be say of alus baba because the five part be not link together in a logical sequence as be the event in the gold-bug or by any control idea of reform such as we find in a christmas carol or by any underlie moral purpose like that which give unity and dignity to the great stone face these perso-arabian tale in other word be story of random incident loosely but charmingly tell with always the note of strangeness and unexpectedness the incident however reflect accurately the manners and custom of time and place we do not believe that a door ever open to the magic of mere word but we do believe and can not help believe that the author tell the truth when he write of leather jar full of oil of band of mount robber of a poor man who could support himself by haul wood from the free-for-all forest of slavery from which one might escape by notable fidelity of funeral rite perform by the imaum and other minister of the mosque and of the unwillingness of a assassin to attempt the life of a man with whom he have just eat salt fancy it be true mingle with fact in the arabian night but it do not replace fact _ character _ morgiana be the lead character she furnish all the brain employ in the story the narrator praise she courage twice but she have more than courage fidelity initiative and resourcefulness must also be put among she asset we can hardly imagine she as act from esther 's high motive but she live up to the best standard of conduct that she know whoever serve as a model for he own time may serve as a model for ours duty change but duty remain -rrb- i cassim ali baba 's brother discover and kill by the robber there once live in a town of persium two brother one name cassim and the other

while all this be go on the forty robber again visit they cave in the forest great be they surprise to find cassim 's body take away with some of they bag of gold we be certainly find out say the captain the body and the money have be take by some one else who know we secret for we own life ' sake we must try and find he what say you my lad the robber all agree that this must be do well say the captain one of you the boldest and most skillful must go to the town disguise as a stranger and try if he can hear any talk of the man we kill and find out where he live this matter be so important that the man who undertake it and fail should suffer death what say you one of the robber without wait to know what the rest might think start up and say : i submit to this condition and think it a honor to expose my life to serve the troop this win great praise from the robber 's comrade and he disguise himself at once so that nobody could take he for what he be just at daybreak he enter the town and walk up and down till he come by chance to baba mustapha 's stall which be always open before any of the shop the old cobbler be just go to work when the robber bid he good-morrow

as i be i have excellent eye you will not doubt I when i tell you that i sew the body of a dead man together in a place where i have not so much light as i have now a dead body exclaim the robber amaze yes yes answer baba mustapha i see you want to know more but you shall not the robber feel sure that he be on the right track he put a piece of gold into baba mustapha 's hand and say to he : -- i do not want to learn you secret though you could safely trust I with it the only thing i ask of you be to show I the house where you stitch up the dead body i could not do that reply baba mustapha if i would i be take to a certain place whence i be lead blindfold to the house and afterwards bring back again in the same manner well reply the robber you may remember a little of the way that you be lead blindfold come let I blind you eye at the same place we will walk together and perhaps you may recall the way here be another piece of gold for you this be enough to bring baba mustapha to he foot they soon reach the place where morgiana have bandage he eye and here he be blindfold again baba mustapha and the robber walk on till they come to cassim 's house where alus baba now live here the old man stop and when the thief pull off the band and find that he guide could not tell he whose house it be he let he go but before he start back for the forest himself well pleased with what he have learn he mark the door with a piece of chalk which he have ready in he hand soon after this morgiana come out upon some errand and when she return she see the mark the robber have make and stop to look at it what can this mean she say to herself somebody intend my master harm and in any case it be best to guard against the worst then she fetch a piece of chalk and marked two or three door on each side in the same manner say nothing to she master or mistress when the robber rejoin he troop in the forest and tell of he good fortune in meet the one man that could have help he they be all delighted comrade say the captain we have no time to lose let we set off at once well armed and disguised enter the town by two and join at the great square meanwhile we comrade who have bring we the good news and i will go and find out the house and decide what have best be do two by two they enter the town last of all go the captain and the spy when they come to the first of the house which morgiana have mark the spy point it out but the captain notice that the next door be chalk in the same manner and ask he guide which house it be that or the first the guide know not what answer to make and be still more puzzle when he and the captain see five or six house mark after this same fashion he assure the captain with a oath that he have mark but one and could not tell who have chalk the rest nor could he say at which house the cobbler have stop there be nothing to do but to join the other robber and tell they to go back to the cave here they be tell why they have all return and the guide be declare by all to be worthy of death indeed he condemn himself own that he ought to have be more careful and prepared to receive the stroke which be to cut off he head the safety of the troop still demand that the second comer to the cave should be find and another of the gang offer to try it with the same penalty if he should fail like the other robber he find out baba mustapha and through he the house which he mark in a place remote from sight with red chalk but nothing could escape morgiana 's eye and when she go out not long after and see the red chalk she argue with herself as before and mark the other house near by in the same place and manner the robber when he tell he comrade what he have do pride himself on he carefulness and the captain and all the troop think they must succeed this time again they enter the town by two but when the robber and he captain come to the street they find the same trouble the captain be enraged and the robber as much confuse as the former guide have be thus the captain and he troop go back again to the cave and the robber who have fail willingly give himself up to death iv the robber except the captain discover and kill by morgiana the captain could not afford to lose any more of he brave fellow and decide to take upon himself the task in which two have fail like the other he go to baba mustapha and be show the house unlike they he put no mark on it but study it carefully and pass it so often that he could not possibly mistake it when he return to the troop who be wait for he in the cave he say : -- now comrade nothing can prevent we full revenge as i be certain of the house as i return i thought of a way to do we work but if any one think of a better let he speak he tell they he plan and as they think it good he order they to go into the village about and buy nineteen mule with thirty-eight large leather jar one full of oil and the other empty within two or three day they return with the mule and the jar and as the mouth of the jar be rather too narrow for the captain 's purpose he cause they to be widen have put one of he man into each jar with the weapon which he think fit and have a seam wide enough open for each man to breathe he rub the jar on the outside with oil from the full vessel thus prepare they set out for the town the nineteen mule load with the thirty-seven robber in jar and the jar of oil with the captain as they driver when he reach alus baba 's door he find alus baba sit there take a little fresh air after he supper the captain stop he mule and say : -- i have bring some oil a great way to sell at to-morrow 's market and it be now so late that i do not know where to lodge will you do I the favor to let I pass the night with you though alus baba have see the captain in the forest and have hear he speak he could not know he in the disguise of a oil-merchant and bid he welcome he open he gate for the mule to go into the yard and order a slave to put they in a stable and feed they when they be unloaded and then call morgiana to get a good supper for he guest after supper he charge she afresh to take good care of the stranger and say to she : -- to-morrow morning i intend to go to the bath before day take care to have my bathing linen ready give it to abdallum -lrb- which be he slave 's name -rrb- and make I some good broth against my return after this he go to bed in the mean time the captain of the robber go into the yard and take off the lid of each jar and tell he people what they must do to each in turn he say : -- as soon as i throw some stone out of the chamber window where i lie do not fail to come out and i will join you at once then he go into the house and morgiana show he he chamber where he soon put out the light and lay himself down in he clothes to carry out alus baba 's order morgiana get he bathing linen ready and bid abdallum to set on the pot for the broth but soon the lamp go out and there be no more oil in the house nor any candle she know not what to do till the slave remind she of the oil-jar in the yard she thank he for the thought take the oil-pot and go out when she come nigh the first jar the robber within say softly : be it time of course she be surprise to find a man in the jar instead of the oil but she see at once that she must keep silence as alus baba he family and she herself be in great danger therefore she answer without show any fear : not yet but presently in this manner she go to all the jar and give the same answer till she come to the jar of oil by this mean morgiana find that she master have admit to he house thirty-eight robber of whom the pretended oil-merchant they captain be one she make what haste she could to fill she oil-pot and return to she kitchen light she lamp and take a great kettle go back to the oil-jar and fill it then she set the kettle on a large wood fire and as soon as it boil go and pour enough into every jar to stifle and destroy the robber within when this deed worthy of the courage of morgiana be do without any noise as she have plan she return to the kitchen with the empty kettle put out the lamp and leave just enough of the fire to make the broth then she sit silent resolve not to go to rest till she have see through the window that open on the yard whatever might happen there it be not long before the captain of the robber get up and see that all be dark and quiet give the appoint signal by throw little stone some of which hit the jar as he doubt not by the sound they give as there be no response he throw stone a second and a third time and could not imagine why there be no answer to he signal much alarm he go softly down into the yard and go to the first jar to ask the robber if he be ready smell the hot boil oil which send forth a steam out of the jar from this he suspect that he plot be find out and look into the jar one by one he find that all he gang be dead enraged to despair he force the lock of a door that lead from the yard to the garden and make he escape when morgiana see he go she go to bed well pleased that she have save she master and he family alus baba rise before day and go to the bath without know of what have happen in the night when he return he be very much surprised to see the oil-jar in the yard and the mule in the stable god preserve you and all you family say morgiana when she be ask what it mean you will know better when you have see what i have to show you so say she lead he to the first jar and ask he to see if there be any oil when he see a man instead he start back in alarm do not be afraid say morgiana he can do neither you nor anybody else the least harm he be dead now look into all the other jar ali baba be more and more amaze as he go on and see all the dead man and the sunken oil-jar at the end he stand look from the jar to morgiana till he find word to ask : and what be become of the merchant merchant answer she he be as much one as i be then she lead he into the house and tell of all that she have do from the first notice of the chalk-mark to the death of the robber and the flight of they captain on hearing of these brave deed from morgiana 's own lip ali baba say to she : -- god by you means have deliver I from death for the first token of what i owe you i give you you liberty from this moment till i can fully reward you as i intend near the tree at the end of alus baba 's long garden he and abdallum dig a trench large enough to hold the body of the robber when they be bury there ali baba hide the jar and weapon and as the mule be of no use to he he send they at different time to be sell in the market by he slave v the captain discover and kill by morgiana the captain of the forty robber have return to he cave in the forest but find himself so lonely there that the place become frightful to he he resolve at the same time to avenge the fate of he comrade and to bring about the death of alus baba for this purpose he return to the town disguise as a merchant of silk by degree he bring from he cavern many sort of fine stuff and to dispose of these he take a warehouse that happen to be opposite cassim 's which ali baba 's son have occupy since the death of he uncle he take the name of cogium houssain and as a newcomer be very civil to the merchant near he ali baba 's son be one of the first to converse with he and the new merchant be most friendly within two or three day ali baba come to see he son and the captain of the robber know he at once and soon learn from he son who he be from that time forth he be still more polite to ali baba 's son who soon feel bind to repay the many kindness of he new friend as he own house be small he arrange with he father that on a certain afternoon when he and the merchant be pass by alus baba 's house they should stop and he should ask they both to sup with he this plan be carry out though at first the merchant with whose own plan it agree perfectly make as if to excuse himself he even give it as a reason for not remain that he could eat no salt in he victuals if that be all say alus baba it need not deprive I of the honor of you company and he go to the kitchen and tell morgiana to put no salt into anything she be cook that evening thus cogia houssain be persuade to stay but to morgiana it seem very strange that any one should refuse to eat salt she wish to see what manner of man it might be and to this end when she have finish what she have to do in the kitchen she help abdallum carry up the dish look at cogium houssain she know he at first sight in spite of he disguise to be the captain of the robber and scanning he very closely see that he have a dagger under he garment i see now why this greatest enemy of my master would eat no salt with he he intend to kill he but i will prevent he while they be at supper morgiana make up she mind to do one of the boldest deed ever conceive she dress herself like a dancer gird she waist with a silver-gilt girdle from which hang a poniard and put a handsome mask on she face then when the supper be end she say to abdallum : -- take you tabor and let we go and divert we master and he son 's friend as we sometimes do when he be alone they present themselves at the door with a low bow and morgiana be bid to enter and show cogium houssain how well she dance this he know would interrupt he in carry out he wicked purpose but he have to make the best of it and to seem pleased with morgiana 's dancing she be indeed a good dancer and on this occasion outdo herself in graceful and surprising motion at the last she take the tabor from abdallum 's hand and hold it out like those who dance for money alus baba put a piece of gold into it and so do he son when cogium houssain see that she be come to he he pull out he purse from he bosom to make she a present but while he be put he hand into it morgiana with courage worthy of herself plunge the poniard into he heart unhappy woman exclaim alus baba what have you do to ruin I and my family it be to preserve not to ruin you answer morgiana then she show the dagger in cogium houssain 's garment and say : look well at he and you will see that he be both the pretended oil-merchant and the captain of the band of forty robber as soon as you tell I that he would eat no salt with you i suspect who it be and when i see he i know alus baba embrace she

story irving be the first american master of local color and local tradition since 1870 the american short story follow the example of irving have be the lead agency by which the south the west and new england have make known and thus perpetuate they local scenery legend custom and dialect irving however seem afraid of dialect there be it be true many legend about the hudson before irve be bear but they have find no expression in literature mr josiah quincy who make a voyage up the hudson in 1786 write : we captain have a legend for every scene either supernatural or traditional or of actual occurrence during the war and not a mountain rear its head unconnected with some marvellous story irving therefore do not have to manufacture local tradition he only give they wider currency and fit they more artistically into they natural setting irve choose for he set the twenty year that embrace the revolutionary war because the numerous social and political change that take place then enable he to bring rip back after he sleep into a world not realize you will appreciate much better the art of this time-setting if you will try you hand on a somewhat similar story and place it between 1820 and 1840 when railroad telegraph line and transatlantic steamer make a new world out of the old or if you story take place in the south you might make you background include the interval between 1855 and 1875 when slavery be abolish when the old plantation system be change when the name of new hero emerge and when new social and political and industrial problem have to be grapple with _ plot _ the plot be divide into two almost equal part which we may call before and after take a recent critic have say : the actual forward movement of the plot do not begin until the sentence ` in a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day rip have unconsciously scramble to one of the highest part of the kaatskill mountain ' the critic have miss i think the main structural excellence of the story dame van winkle the child who hang around rip he own child he dog the social club at the inn with the portrait of george the third van bummel and nichola vedder all have to be mention before rip begin the ascent of the mountain otherwise when he return we should have have no means of measure the swift passage of time during he sleep each be a skillfully set timepiece or milepost which on rip 's return mislead the poor fellow at every turn and thus produce the exact kind of totality of effect that irve intend the forward movement of the plot begin with this careful planning of the route that rip be to take on he return trip when twenty year shall have do they work cut out these _ point de repère _ and see how effectively the forward movement of the plot be retard _ character _ rip be the first character in american fiction to be know far beyond we own border and he remain one of the best know in the class with he belong jame fenimore cooper 's leatherstocking -lrb- or natty bumppo -rrb- harriet beecher stowe 's uncle tom joel chandler harri 's uncle remus and mark twain 's huckleberry finn and tom sawyer he have be call un-american and so he be and so irving plainly intend he to be if one insist on find a bit of distinctive americanism somewhere in the story he will find it not in rip but in the number and rapidity of the change that american life undergo during the twenty year that serve as background to the story george william curtis call rip the constant and unconscious satirist of american life but surely irve would have smile at find so purposeful a mission lay upon the stoop shoulder of he vagabond ne'er - do-well hero rip be no satirist conscious or unconscious he be a provincial dutch type such as irving have see a hundred time but he be so lovable and be sketch so lovingly that we hardly realize the consummate art the human sympathy and the keen power of observation that have go into he make every other character in the story include wolf be a sidelight on rip of the legend of sleepy hollow irving say : the story be a mere whimsical band to connect the description of scenery custom manners etc the emphasis in other word be put on the setting of rip van winkle might he not have say the description of scenery custom manners etc be but so many channel through which the character of rip find outlet and expression -rrb- whoever have make a voyage up the hudson must remember the kaatskill mountain they be a dismembered branch of the great appalachian family and be see away to the west of the river swell up to a noble height and lord it over the surrounding country every change of season every change of weather indeed every hour of the day produce some change in the magical hue and shape of these mountain and they be regard by all the good wife far and near as perfect barometer when the weather be fair and settle they be clothe in blue and purple and print they bold outline on the clear evening sky but sometimes when the rest of the landscape be cloudless they will gather a hood of gray vapor about they summit which in the last ray of the setting sun will glow and light up like a crown of glory at the foot of these fairy mountain the voyager may have descry the light smoke curl up from a village whose shingle-roof gleam among the tree just where the blue tint of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape it be a little village of great antiquity have be found by some of the dutch colonist in the early time of the province just about the beginning of the government of the good peter stuyvesant -lrb- may he rest in peace -rrb- and there be some of the house of the original settler stand within a few year build of small yellow brick bring from holland have latticed window and gable front surmount with weathercock in that same village and in one of these very house -lrb- which to tell the precise truth be sadly time-worn and weather-beaten -rrb- there live many year since while the country be yet a province of great britain a simple good-natured fellow of the name of rip van winkle he be a descendant of the van winkle who figure so gallantly in the chivalrous day of peter stuyvesant and accompany he to the siege of fort christina he inherit however but little of the martial character of he ancestor i have observe that he be a simple good-natured man he be moreover a kind neighbor and a obedient henpecked husband indeed to the latter circumstance might be owe that meekness of spirit which gain he such universal popularity for those man be most apt to be obsequious and conciliate abroad who be under the discipline of shrew at home they temper doubtless be render pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation and a curtain lecture be worth all the sermon in the world for teach the virtue of patience and long-suffering a termagant wife may therefore in some respects be consider a tolerable blessing and if so rip van winkle be thrice bless certain it be that he be a great favorite among all the good wife of the village who as usual with the amiable sex take he part in all family squabble and never fail whenever they talk those matter over in they evening gossiping to lay all the blame on dame van winkle the child of the village too would shout with joy whenever he approach he assist at they sport make they plaything teach they to fly kite and shoot marble and tell they long story of ghost witch and indian whenever he go dodge about the village he be surround by a troop of they hang on he skirt clamber on he back and play a thousand trick on he with impunity and not a dog would bark at he throughout the neighborhood the great error in rip 's composition be a insuperable aversion to all kind of profitable labor it could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance for he would sit on a wet rock with a rod as long and heavy as a tartar 's lance and fish all day without a murmur even though he should not be encourage by a single nibble he would carry a fowling-piece on he shoulder for hour together trudge through wood and swamp and up hill and down dale to shoot a few squirrel or wild pigeon he would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the roughest toil and be a foremost man at all country frolic for husk indian corn or building stone-fence the woman of the village too use to employ he to run they errand and to do such little odd job as they less oblige husband would not do for they in a word rip be ready to attend to anybody 's business but he own but as to do family duty and keep he farm in order he find it impossible in fact he declare it be of no use to work on he farm it be the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country everything about it go wrong and would go wrong in spite of he he fence be continually fall to piece he cow would either go astray or get among the cabbage weed be sure to grow quicker in he field than anywhere else the rain always make a point of set in just as he have some out-door work to do so that though he patrimonial estate have dwindle away under he management acre by acre until there be little more left than a mere patch of indian corn and potato yet it be the worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood he child too be as ragged and wild as if they belong to nobody he son rip a urchin begotten in he own likeness promise to inherit the habit with the old clothes of he father he be generally see troop like a colt at he mother 's heel equip in a pair of he father 's cast-off galligaskin which he have much ado to hold up with one hand as a fine lady do she train in bad weather rip van winkle however be one of those happy mortal of foolish well-oiled disposition who take the world easy eat white bread or brown whichever can be get with least thought or trouble and would rather starve on a penny than work for a pound if leave to himself he would have whistle life away in perfect contentment but he wife keep continually din in he ear about he idleness he carelessness and the ruin he be bring on he family morning noon and night she tongue be incessantly go and everything he say or do be sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence rip have but one way of reply to all lecture of the kind and that by frequent use have grow into a habit he shrug he shoulder shake he head cast up he eye but say nothing this however always provoke a fresh volley from he wife so that he be fain to draw off he force and take to the outside of the house -- the only side which in truth belong to a henpecked husband rip 's sole domestic adherent be he dog wolf who be as much henpeck as he master for dame van winkle regard they as companion in idleness and even look upon wolf with a evil eye as the cause of he master 's go so often astray true it be in all point of spirit befitting a honorable dog he be as courageous a animal as ever scour the wood -- but what courage can withstand the ever-during and all-besetting terror of a woman 's tongue the moment wolf enter the house he crest fall he tail droop to the ground or curl between he leg he sneak about with a gallows air casting many a sidelong glance at dame van winkle and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle he would fly to the door with yelp precipitation time grow worse and worse with rip van winkle as year of matrimony roll on a tart temper never mellow with age and a sharp tongue be the only edge tool that grow keener with constant use for a long while he use to console himself when drive from home by frequent a kind of perpetual club of the sage philosopher and other idle personage of the village which hold its session on a bench before a small inn designate by a rubicund portrait of he majesty george the third here they use to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer 's day talk listlessly over village gossip or tell endless sleepy story about nothing but it would have be worth any statesman 's money to have hear the profound discussion that sometimes take place when by chance a old newspaper fall into they hand from some pass traveller how solemnly they would listen to the contents as drawl out by derrick van bummel the schoolmaster a dapper learn little man who be not to be daunt by the most gigantic word in the dictionary and how sagely they would deliberate upon public event some month after they have take place the opinion of this junto be completely control by nichola vedder a patriarch of the village and landlord of the inn at the door of which he take he seat from morning till night just move sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree so that the neighbor could tell the hour by he movement as accurately as by a sun-dial it be true he be rarely hear to speak but smoke he pipe incessantly he adherent however -lrb- for every great man have he adherent -rrb- perfectly understand he and know how to gather he opinion when anything that be read or relate displeased he he be observe to smoke he pipe vehemently and to send forth short frequent and angry puff but when pleased he would inhale the smoke slowly and tranquilly and emit it in light and placid cloud and sometimes take the pipe from he mouth and let the fragrant vapor curl about he nose would gravely nod he head in token of perfect approbation from even this stronghold the unlucky rip be at length route by he termagant wife who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the assemblage and call the member all to naught nor be that August personage nichola vedder himself sacred from the daring tongue of this terrible virago who charge he outright with encourage she husband in habit of idleness poor rip be at last reduce almost to despair and he only alternative to escape from the labor of the farm and clamor of he wife be to take gun in hand and stroll away into the wood here he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree and share the contents of he wallet with wolf with whom he sympathize as a fellow-sufferer in persecution poor wolf he would say thy mistress lead thee a dog 's life of it but never mind my lad whilst i live thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee wolf would wag he tail look wistfully in he master 's face and if dog can feel pity i verily believe he reciprocate the sentiment with all he heart in a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day rip have unconsciously scramble to one of the highest part of the kaatskill mountain he be after he favorite sport of squirrel shooting and the still solitude have echo and re-echo with the report of he gun panting and fatigue he throw himself late in the afternoon on a green knoll cover with mountain herbage that crown the brow of a precipice from a opening between the tree he could overlook all the lower country for many a mile of rich woodland he see at a distance the lordly hudson far far below he move on its silent but majestic course with the reflection of a purple cloud or the sail of a lagging bark here and there sleep on its glassy bosom and at last lose itself in the blue highland on the other side he look down into a deep mountain glen wild lonely and shag the bottom fill with fragment from the impending cliff and scarcely light by the reflect ray of the setting sun for some time rip lay musing on this scene evening be gradually advance the mountain begin to throw they long blue shadow over the valley he see that it would be dark long before he could reach the village and he heave a heavy sigh when he think of encounter the terror of dame van winkle as he be about to descend he hear a voice from a distance hallooing rip van winkle rip van winkle he look round but could see nothing but a crow wing its solitary flight across the mountain he think he fancy must have deceive he and turn again to descend when he hear the same cry ring through the still evening air : rip van winkle rip van winkle -- at the same time wolf bristle up he back and give a low growl skulk to he master 's side look fearfully down into the glen rip now feel a vague apprehension steal over he he look anxiously in the same direction and perceive a strange figure slowly toiling up the rock and bend under the weight of something he carry on he back he be surprise to see any human be in this lonely and unfrequented place but suppose it to be some one of the neighborhood in need of he assistance he hasten down to yield it on nearer approach he be still more surprised at the singularity of the stranger 's appearance he be a short square-built old fellow with thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard he dress be of the antique dutch fashion : a cloth jerkin strap round the waist several pair of breeches the outer one of ample volume decorate with row of button down the side and bunch at the knee he bear on he shoulder a stout keg that seem full of liquor and make sign for rip to approach and assist he with the load though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance rip comply with he usual alacrity and mutually relieve one another they clamber up a narrow gully apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent as they ascend rip every now and then hear long rolling peal like distant thunder that seem to issue out of a deep ravine or rather cleft between lofty rock toward which they rugged path conduct he pause for a moment but suppose it to be the muttering of one of those transient thunder-shower which often take place in mountain height he proceed pass through the ravine they come to a hollow like a small amphitheatre surround by perpendicular precipice over the brink of which impending tree shoot they branch so that you only catch glimpse of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud during the whole time rip and he companion have labor on in silence for though the former marvel greatly what could be the object of carry a keg of liquor up this wild mountain yet there be something strange and incomprehensible about the unknown that inspired awe and check familiarity on enter the amphitheatre new object of wonder present themselves on a level spot in the center be a company of odd-looking personage play at ninepin they be dress in a quaint outlandish fashion some wear short doublet other jerkin with long knife in they belt and most of they have enormous breeches of similar style with that of the guide 's they visage too be peculiar one have a large beard broad face and small piggish eye the face of another seem to consist entirely of nose and be surmount by a white sugar-loaf hat set off with a little red cock 's tail they all have beard of various shape and color there be one who seem to be the commander he be a stout old gentleman with a weather-beaten countenance he wear a lace doublet broad belt and hanger high-crowned hat and feather red stocking and high-heeled shoe with rose in they the whole group remind rip of the figure in a old flemish painting in the parlor of dominie van shaick the village parson which have be bring over from holland at the time of the settlement what seem particularly odd to rip be that though these folk be evidently amusing themselves yet they maintain the gravest face the most mysterious silence and be withal the most melancholy party of pleasure he have ever witness nothing interrupt the stillness of the scene but the noise of the ball which whenever they be roll echo along the mountain like rumble peal of thunder as rip and he companion approach they they suddenly desist from they play and stare at he with such fix statue-like gaze and such strange uncouth lack-lustre countenance that he heart turn within he and he knee smite together he companion now empty the contents of the keg into large flagon and make sign to he to wait upon the company he obey with fear and tremble they quaff the liquor in profound silence and then return to they game by degree rip 's awe and apprehension subside he even venture when no eye be fix upon he to taste the beverage which he find have much of the flavor of excellent holland he be naturally a thirsty soul and be soon tempt to repeat the draught one taste provoke another and he reiterate he visit to the flagon so often that at length he sens be overpower he eye swim in he head he head gradually decline and he fall into a deep sleep on wake he find himself on the green knoll whence he have first see the old man of the glen he rub he eye -- it be a bright sunny morning the bird be hop and twitter among the bush and the eagle be wheeling aloft and breast the pure mountain breeze surely think rip i have not sleep here all night he recall the occurrence before he fall asleep the strange man with a keg of liquor -- the mountain ravine -- the wild retreat among the rock -- the woe-begone party at ninepin -- the flagon -- oh that flagon that wicked flagon thought rip -- what excuse shall i make to dame van winkle he look round for he gun but in place of the clean well-oiled fowling-piece he find a old firelock lie by he the barrel incrust with rust the lock fall off and the stock worm-eaten he now suspect that the grave roisterer of the mountain have put a trick upon he and have dose he with liquor have rob he of he gun wolf too have disappear but he might have stray away after a squirrel or partridge he whistle after he and shout he name but all in vain the echo repeat he whistle and shout but no dog be to be see he determine to revisit the scene of the last evening 's gambol and if he meet with any of the party to demand he dog and gun as he rise to walk he find himself stiff in the joint and want in he usual activity these mountain bed do not agree with I think rip and if this frolic should lay I up with a fit of the rheumatism i shall have a bless time with dame van winkle with some difficulty he get down into the glen he find the gully up which he and he companion have ascend the precede evening but to he astonishment a mountain stream be now foam down it leap from rock to rock and fill the glen with babble murmur he however make shift to scramble up its side work he toilsome way through thicket of birch sassafras and witch-hazel and sometimes trip up or entangled by the wild grapevine that twist they coil or tendril from tree to tree and spread a kind of network in he path at length he reach to where the ravine have open through the cliff to the amphitheatre but no trace of such opening remain the rock present a high impenetrable wall over which the torrent come tumble in a sheet of feathery foam and fall into a broad deep basin black from the shadow of the surround forest here then poor rip be bring to a stand he again call and whistle after he dog he be only answer by the cawing of a flock of idle crow sport high in air about a dry tree that overhang a sunny precipice and who secure in they elevation seem to look down and scoff at the poor man 's perplexity what be to be do the morning be pass away and rip feel famish for want of he breakfast he grieve to give up he dog and gun he dread to meet he wife but it would not do to starve among the mountain he shake he head shoulder the rusty firelock and with a heart full of trouble and anxiety turn he step homeward as he approach the village he meet a number of people but none whom he know which somewhat surprise he for he have think himself acquaint with every one in the country round they dress too be of a different fashion from that to which he be accustom they all stare at he with equal mark of surprise and whenever they cast they eye upon he invariably stroke they chin the constant recurrence of this gesture induce rip involuntarily to do the same when to he astonishment he find he beard have grow a foot long he have now enter the skirt of the village a troop of strange child run at he heel hoot after he and point at he gray beard the dog too not one of which he recognize for a old acquaintance bark at he as he pass the very village be alter it be larger and more populous there be row of house which he have never see before and those which have be he familiar haunt have disappear strange name be over the door -- strange face at the window -- everything be strange he mind now misgive he he begin to doubt whether both he and the world around he be not bewitch surely this be he native village which he have leave but the day before there stand the kaatskill mountain -- there run the silver hudson at a distance -- there be every hill and dale precisely as it have always be -- rip be sorely perplex -- that flagon last night think he have addle my poor head sadly it be with some difficulty that he find the way to he own house which he approach with silent awe expect every moment to hear the shrill voice of dame van winkle he find the house go to decay -- the roof fall in the window shatter and the door off the hinge a half-starved dog that look like wolf be skulk about it rip call he by name but the cur snarl show he tooth and pass on this be a unkind cut indeed -- my very dog sigh poor rip have forget I he enter the house which to tell the truth dame van winkle have always keep in neat order it be empty forlorn and apparently abandon this desolateness overcome all he connubial fear -- he call loudly for he wife and child -- the lonely chamber ring for a moment with he voice and then again all be silence he now hurry forth and hasten to he old resort the village inn -- but it too be go a large rickety wooden building stand in its place with great gaping window some of they broken and mend with old hat and petticoat and over the door be paint the union hotel by jonathan doolittle instead of the great tree that use to shelter the quiet little dutch inn of yore there now be rear a tall naked pole with something on the top that look like a red night-cap and from it be flutter a flag on which be a singular assemblage of star and stripe -- all this be strange and incomprehensible he recognize on the sign however the ruby face of king george under which he have smoke so many a peaceful pipe but even this be singularly metamorphose the red coat be change for one of blue and buff a sword be hold in the hand instead of a sceptre the head be decorate with a cocked hat and underneath be paint in large character general washington there be as usual a crowd of folk about the door but none that rip recollect the very character of the people seem change there be a busy bustling disputatious tone about it instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity he look in vain for the sage nichola vedder with he broad face double chin and fair long pipe utter cloud of tobacco-smoke instead of idle speech or van bummel the schoolmaster dole forth the contents of a ancient newspaper in place of these a lean bilious-looking fellow with he pocket full of hand-bill be harangue vehemently about rights of citizen -- election -- member of congress -- liberty -- bunker 's hill -- hero of seventy-six -- and other word which be a perfect babylonish jargon to the bewildered van winkle the appearance of rip with he long grizzled beard he rusty fowling-piece he uncouth dress and a army of woman and child at he heel soon attract the attention of the tavern-politician they crowd round he eye he from head to foot with great curiosity the orator bustle up to he and draw he partly aside inquire on which side he vote rip stare in vacant stupidity another short but busy little fellow pull he by the arm and rise on tiptoe inquire in he ear whether he be federal or democrat rip be equally at a loss to comprehend the question when a know self-important old gentleman in a sharp cocked hat make he way through the crowd put they to the right and leave with he elbow as he pass and plant himself before van winkle with one arm akimbo the other rest on he cane he keen eye and sharp hat penetrate as it be into he very soul demand in a austere tone what bring he to the election with a gun on he shoulder and a mob at he heel and whether he mean to breed a riot in the village -- alas gentleman cry rip somewhat dismayed i be a poor quiet man a native of the place and a loyal subject of the king god bless he here a general shout burst from the bystander -- a tory a tory a spy a refugee hustle he away with he it be with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cock hat restore order and have assume a tenfold austerity of brow demand again of the unknown culprit what he come there for and whom he be seek the poor man humbly assure he that he mean no harm but merely come there in search of some of he neighbor who use to keep about the tavern well -- who be they -- name they rip bethought himself a moment and inquire where 's nichola vedder there be a silence for a little while when a old man reply in a thin piping voice : nichola vedder why he be dead and go these eighteen year there be a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that use to tell all about he but that be rotten and go too where 's brom dutcher oh he go off to the army in the beginning of the war some say he be kill at the storm of stony point -- other say he be drown in a squall at the foot of antony 's nose i do not know -- he never come back again where 's van bummel the schoolmaster he go off to the war too be a great militia general and be now in congress rip 's heart die away at hearing of these sad change in he home and friend and find himself thus alone in the world every answer puzzle he too by treat of such enormous lapse of time and of matter which he could not understand : war -- congress -- stony point he have no courage to ask after any more friend but cry out in despair do nobody here know rip van winkle oh rip van winkle exclaim two or three oh to be sure that be rip van winkle yonder lean against the tree rip look and behold a precise counterpart of himself as he go up the mountain : apparently as lazy and certainly as ragged the poor fellow be now completely confound he doubt he own identity and whether he be himself or another man in the midst of he bewilderment the man in the cock hat demand who he be and what be he name god know exclaim he at he wit 's end i be not myself -- i be somebody else -- that be I yonder -- no -- that be somebody else get into my shoe -- i be myself last night but i fall asleep on the mountain and they have change my gun and everything 's change and i be change and i can not tell what be my name or who i be the bystander begin now to look at each other nod wink significantly and tap they finger against they forehead there be a whisper also about secure the gun and keep the old fellow from do mischief at the very suggestion of which the self-important man in the cock hat retire with some precipitation at this critical moment a fresh comely woman press through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man she have a chubby child in she arm which frighten at he look begin to cry hush rip cry she hush you little fool the old man will not hurt you the name of the child the air of the mother the tone of she voice all awaken a train of recollection in he mind what be you name my good woman ask he judith gardenier and you father 's name ah poor man rip van winkle be he name but it be twenty year since he go away from home with he gun and never have be hear of since -- he dog come home without he but whether he shoot himself or be carry away by the indian nobody can tell i be then but a little girl rip have but one question more to ask and he put it with a falter voice : -- where 's you mother oh she too have die but a short time since she break a blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a new england peddler there be a drop of comfort at least in this intelligence the honest man could contain himself no longer he catch he daughter and she child in he arm i be you father cry he -- young rip van winkle once -- old rip van winkle now do nobody know poor rip van winkle all stand amaze until a old woman totter out from among the crowd put she hand to she brow and peer under it in he face for a moment exclaim sure enough it be rip van winkle -- it be himself welcome home again old neighbor -- why where have you be these twenty long year rip 's story be soon tell for the whole twenty year have be to he but as one night the neighbor stare when they hear it some be see to wink at each other and put they tongue in they cheek and the self-important man in the cock hat who when the alarm be over have return to the field screw down the corner of he mouth and shake he head -- upon which there be a general shake of the head throughout the assemblage it be determine however to take the opinion of old peter vanderdonk who be see slowly advance up the road he be a descendant of the historian of that name who write one of the earliest account of the province peter be the most ancient inhabitant of the village and well verse in all the wonderful event and tradition of the neighborhood he recollect rip at once and corroborate he story in the most satisfactory manner he assure the company that it be a fact hand down from he ancestor the historian that the kaatskill mountain have always be haunt by strange being that it be affirm that the great hendrick hudson the first discoverer of the river and country keep a kind of vigil there every twenty year with he crew of the half-moon be permit in this way to revisit the scene of he enterprise and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city call by he name that he father have once see they in they old dutch dress play at ninepin in a hollow of the mountain and that he himself have hear one summer afternoon the sound of they ball like distant peal of thunder to make a long story short the company break up and return to the more important concern of the election rip 's daughter take he home to live with she she have a snug well-furnished house and a stout cheery farmer for a husband whom rip recollect for one of the urchin that use to climb upon he back as to rip 's son and heir who be the ditto of himself see lean against the tree he be employ to work on the farm but evince a hereditary disposition to attend to anything else but he business rip now resume he old walk and habit he soon find many of he former crony though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of time and prefer make friend among the rise generation with whom he soon grow into great favor have nothing to do at home and be arrive at that happy age when a man can be idle with impunity he take he place once more on the bench at the inn door and be reverence as one of the patriarch of the village and a chronicle of the old time before the war it be some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip or could be make to comprehend the strange event that have take place during he torpor how that there have be a revolutionary war -- that the country have throw off the yoke of old england -- and that instead of be a subject of he majesty george the third he be now a free citizen of the united state rip in fact be no politician the change of state and empire make but little impression on he but there be one species of despotism under which he have long groan and that be -- petticoat government happily that be at a end he have get he neck out of the yoke of matrimony and could go in and out whenever he please without dread the tyranny of dame van winkle whenever she name be mention however he shake he head shrug he shoulder and cast up he eye which might pass either for a expression of resignation to he fate or joy at he deliverance he use to tell he story to every stranger that arrive at mr doolittle 's hotel he be observe at first to vary on some point every time he tell it which be doubtless owe to he have so recently awake it at last settle down precisely to the tale i have relate and not a man woman or child in the neighborhood but know it by heart some always pretend to doubt the reality of it and insist that rip have be out of he head and that this be one point on which he always remain flighty the old dutch inhabitant however almost universally give it full credit even to this day they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the kaatskill but they say hendrick hudson and he crew be at they game of ninepin and it be a common wish of all henpecked husband in the neighborhood when life hang heavy on they hand that they might have a quiet draught out of rip van winkle 's flagon iv the gold-bug -lrb- 1843 -rrb- by edgar allan poe -lrb- 1809-1849 -rrb- -lrb- _ setting _ sullivan 's island be at the entrance of charleston harbor just east of charleston south carolina it be the site of fort moultrie where poe serve as a private soldier in battery h of the first artillery unite state army from November 1827 to November 1828 the atmosphere of the place in poe 's time be well preserved but no such beetle as the gold-bug have be discover poe may have find a hint for he story in the wreck of the old brigantine _ cid campeador _ off the coast of south carolina in 1745 the affidavit of the bury of the treasure be still preserve in the probate court record of charleston _ plot _ the gold-bug be recognize as one of the world 's greatest short story and mark a distinct advance in short-story structure the plot be divide into two part which we may call mystery and solution or complication and explication or rise and fall the second part begin with the short paragraph on page 91 beginning when at length we have conclude we examination etc notice how skillfully the interest be preserved and even heighten as the plot pass from the romantic action of part one to the subtle exposition of part two these two part may be say to represent the two side of poe 's genius the imaginative or poetical and the intellectual or scientific the treasure-trove be the symbol of the first the cryptogram of the second story have be write about bury treasure and about cryptogram before 1843 but the two interest have never before be combine poe 's example however have bear abundant fruit _ character _ poe 's strength do not lie in the creation of character he be so intent on the development of the winding and unwinding of he story that the character become mere puppet originate and control by the need of the plot jupiter deserve mention as one of the earliest attempt make by a american short-story writer to portray negro character but jupiter have be so far surpass in breadth and reality by joel chandler harri thoma nelson page and a score of other as to be almost negligible in the count in defense of jupiter 's barbarous lingo which have be often criticize it should be remember that poe intend he as a representative of the gullah -lrb- or gullum -rrb- dialect it be the negro dialect say joel chandler harri in its most primitive state -- the ` gullah ' talk of some of the negro on the sea island be merely a confused and untranslatable mixture of english and african word william legrand though not a great or notable character in any way be admirably fit to do what be require of he in the story like poe he be solitary proud quick-tempered and subject to perverse mood of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy he have also poe 's passion for puzzle jupiter be hardly more than a awkward tool fashion to display legrand 's analytic and directive genius and the other character in the story like dr watson in conan doyle 's sherlock holme story be introduce merely to ask such question as must be answer if the reader be to follow intelligently the unfold of the plot they be agent rather than character -rrb- what ho what ho this fellow be dance mad he have be bite by the tarantula all in the wrong many year ago i contract a intimacy with a mr william legrand he be of a ancient huguenot family and have once be wealthy but a series of misfortune have reduce he to want to avoid the mortification consequent upon he disaster he leave new orlean the city of he forefather and take up he residence at sullivan 's island near charleston south carolina this island be a very singular one it consist of little else than the sea sand and be about three mile long its breadth at no point exceed a quarter of a mile it be separate from the mainland by a scarcely perceptible creek ooze its way through a wilderness of reed and slime a favorite resort of the marsh-hen the vegetation as might be suppose be scant or at least dwarfish no tree of any magnitude be to be see near the western extremity where fort moultrie stand and where be some miserable frame building tenant during summer by the fugitive from charleston dust and fever may be find indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the exception of this western point and a line of hard white beach on the seacoast be cover with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle so much prize by the horticulturist of england the shrub here often attain the height of fifteen or twenty foot and form a almost impenetrable coppice burden the air with its fragrance in the utmost recess of this coppice not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island legrand have build himself a small hut which he occupy when i first by mere accident make he acquaintance this soon ripened into friendship -- for there be much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem i find he well educate with unusual power of mind but infected with misanthropy and subject to perverse mood of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy he have with he many book but rarely employ they he chief amusement be gun and fishing or saunter along the beach and through the myrtle in quest of shell or entomological specimen -- he collection of the latter might have be envy by a swammerdamm in these excursion he be usually accompany by a old negro call jupiter who have be manumit before the reverse of the family but who could be induce neither by threat nor by promise to abandon what he consider he right of attendance upon the footstep of he young massa will it be not improbable that the relative of legrand conceive he to be somewhat unsettled in intellect have contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer the winter in the latitude of sullivan 's island be seldom very severe and in the fall of the year it be a rare event indeed when a fire be consider necessary about the middle of October 18 -- there occur however a day of remarkable chilliness just before sunset i scramble my way through the evergreen to the hut of my friend whom i have not visit for several week -- my residence be at that time in charleston a distance of nine mile from the island while the facility of passage and repassage be very far behind those of the present day upon reach the hut i rapped as be my custom and get no reply seek for the key where i know it be secrete unlock the door and go in a fine fire be blaze upon the hearth it be a novelty and by no mean a ungrateful one i throw off a overcoat take a armchair by the crackling log and await patiently the arrival of my host soon after dark they arrive and give I a most cordial welcome jupiter grin from ear to ear bustle about to prepare some marsh-hen for supper legrand be in one of he fit -- how else shall i term they -- of enthusiasm he have find a unknown bivalve form a new genus and more than this he have hunt down and secure with jupiter 's assistance a _ scarabæus _ which he believe to be totally new but in respect to which he wish to have my opinion on the morrow and why not to-night i ask rub my hand over the blaze and wish the whole tribe of _ scarabæi _ at the devil ah if i have only know you be here say legrand but it be so long since i see you and how could i foresee that you would pay I a visit this very night of all other as i be come home i meet lieutenant g -- from the fort and very foolishly i lend he the bug so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning stay here to-night and i will send jup down for it at sunrise it be the loveliest thing in creation what -- sunrise nonsense no -- the bug it be of a brilliant gold color -- about the size of a large hickory-nut -- with two jet-black spot near one extremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the other the _ antennæ _ be -- dey aint _ no _ tin in he massa will i keep a tellin on you here interrupt jupiter de bug be a goole-bug solid ebery bit of he inside and all sep he wing -- neber feel half so hebby a bug in my life well suppose it be jup reply legrand somewhat more earnestly it seem to I than the case demand be that any reason for you let the bird burn the color -- here he turn to I -- be really almost enough to warrant jupiter 's idea you never see a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scale emit -- but of this you can not judge till to-morrow in the meantime i can give you some idea of the shape say this he seat himself at a small table on which be a pen and ink but no paper he look for some in a drawer but find none never mind say he at length this will answer and he draw from he waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i take to be very dirty foolscap and make upon it a rough drawing with the pen while he do this i retain my seat by the fire for i be still chilly when the design be complete he hand it to I without rise as i receive it a low growl be hear succeed by a scratch at the door jupiter open it and a large newfoundland belong to legrand rush in leap upon my shoulder and load I with caress for i have show he much attention during previous visit when he gambol be over i look at the paper and to speak the truth find myself not a little puzzle at what my friend have depict well i say after contemplate it for some minute this _ be _ a strange _ scarabæus _ i must confess new to I never see anything like it before -- unless it be a skull or a death 's - head which it more nearly resemble than anything else that have come under _ my _ observation a death 's - head echo legrand -- oh -- yes -- well it have something of that appearance upon paper no doubt the two upper black spot look like eye eh and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth -- and then the shape of the whole be oval perhaps so say i but legrand i fear you be no artist i must wait until i see the beetle itself if i be to form any idea of its personal appearance well i do not know say he a little nettled i draw tolerably -- _ should _ do it at least -- have have good master and flatter myself that i be not quite a blockhead but my dear fellow you be joke then say i this be a very passable _ skull _ -- indeed i may say that it be a very _ excellent _ skull accord to the vulgar notion about such specimen of physiology -- and you _ scarabæus _ must be the queerest _ scarabæus _ in the world if it resemble it why we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint i presume you will call the bug _ scarabæus caput homini _ -lrb- \* -rrb- or something of that kind -- there be many similar title in the natural history but where be the _ antennæ _ you speak of -lrb- \* _ scarabæus caput homini _ death 's - head beetle -rrb- the _ antennæ _ say legrand who seem to be get unaccountably warm upon the subject i be sure you must see the _ antennæ _ i make they as distinct as they be in the original insect and i presume that be sufficient well well i say perhaps you have -- still i do not see they and i hand he the paper without additional remark not wish to ruffle he temper but i be much surprised at the turn affair have take he ill humor puzzle I -- and as for the drawing of the beetle there be positively _ no antennæ _ visible and the whole _ do _ bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cut of a death 's - head he receive the paper very peevishly and be about to crumple it apparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at the design seem suddenly to rivet he attention in a instant he face grow violently red -- in another as excessively pale for some minute he continue to scrutinize the draw minutely where he sit at length he arise take a candle from the table and proceed to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room here again he make a anxious examination of the paper turn it in all direction he say nothing however and he conduct greatly astonish I yet i think it prudent not to exacerbate the grow moodiness of he temper by any comment presently he take from he coat pocket a wallet place the paper carefully in it and deposit both in a writing-desk which he lock he now grow more compose in he demeanor but he original air of enthusiasm have quite disappear yet he seem not so much sulky as abstracted as the evening wear away he become more and more absorb in revery from which no sally of mine could arouse he it have be my intention to pass the night at the hut as i have frequently do before but see my host in this mood i deem it proper to take leave he do not press I to remain but as i depart he shake my hand with even more than he usual cordiality it be about a month after this -lrb- and during the interval i have see nothing of legrand -rrb- when i receive a visit at charleston from he man jupiter i have never see the good old negro look so dispirited and i fear that some serious disaster have befall my friend well jup say i what be the matter now -- how be you master why to speak de troof massa he not so berry well as mought be not well i be truly sorry to hear it what do he complain of dar dat 's it -- he neber plain of notin -- but he berry sick for all dat _ very _ sick jupiter -- why do not you say so at once be he confine to bed no dat he aint -- he aint find nowhar -- dat 's just whar de shoe pinch -- my mind be get to be berry hebby bout poor massa will jupiter i should like to understand what it be you be talk about you say you master be sick have not he tell you what ail he why massa taint worf while for to git mad bout de matter -- massa will say noffin at all aint de matter wid he -- but den what make he go bout look di here way wid he head down and he soldier up and as white as a gose and then he keep a syphon all de time -- keep a what jupiter keep a syphon wid de figgur on de slate -- de queerest figgurs i ebber do see ise gittin to be skeered i tell you hab for to keep mighty tight eye pon he noover todder day he gib I slip fore de sun up and be go de whole ob de bless day i have a big stick ready cut for to gib he d -- d good beating when he do come -- but ise sich a fool dat i have not de heart arter all -- he look so berry poorly eh -- what -- ah yes -- upon the whole i think you have better not be too severe with the poor fellow -- do not flog he jupiter -- he can not very well stand it -- but can you form no idea of what have occasion this illness or rather this change of conduct have anything unpleasant happen since i see you no massa dey aint bin noffin onpleasant _ since _ den -- ' t be _ fore _ den i be fear -- ' t be de berry day you be dare how what do you mean why massa i mean de bug -- dare now the what de bug -- i be berry sartain dat massa will bin bit somewhere bout de head by dat goole-bug and what cause have you jupiter for such a supposition claw enuff massa and mouff too i nebber do see sich a d -- d bug -- he kick and he bite every ting what cum near he massa will cotch he fuss but have for to let he go gin mighty quick i tell you -- den be de time he must ha get de bite i do

dat be de way and you think then that you master be really bite by the beetle and that the bite make he sick i do not tink noffin about it -- i nose it what make he dream bout de goole so much if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug ise heerd bout dem goole-bug fore di but how do you know he dream about gold how i know why cause he talk about it in he sleep -- dat 's how i nose well jup perhaps you be right but to what fortunate circumstance be i to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day what de matter massa do you bring any message from mr legrand no massa i bring di here pissel and here jupiter hand I a note which run thus : my dear -- : why have i not see you for so long a time i hope you have not be so foolish as to take offense at any little _ brusquerie _ of mine but no that be improbable since i see you i have have great cause for anxiety i have something to tell you yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should tell it at all i have not be quite well for some day past and poor old jup annoy I almost beyond endurance by he well-meant attention would you believe it -- he have prepare a huge stick the other day with which to chastise I for give he the slip and spend the day _ solus _ among the hill on the mainland i verily believe that my ill look alone save I a flogging i have make no addition to my cabinet since we meet if you can in any way make it convenient come over with jupiter _ do _ come i wish to see you _ tonight _ upon business of importance i assure you that it be of the _ highest _ importance ever yours william legrand there be something in the tone of this note which give I great uneasiness its whole style differ materially from that of legrand what could he be dream of what new crotchet possess he excitable brain what business of the highest importance could _ he _ possibly have to transact jupiter 's account of he bode no good i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune have at length fairly unsettle the reason of my friend without a moment 's hesitation therefore i prepare to accompany the negro upon reach the wharf i notice a scythe and three spade all apparently new lie in the bottom of the boat in which we be to embark what be the meaning of all this jup i inquire he syfe massa and spade very true but what be they do here he de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for he in de town and de debbil 's own lot of money i have to gib for em but what in the name of all that be mysterious be you ` massa will ' go to do with scythe and spade dat 's more dan _ i _ know and debbil take I if i do not believe ` tis more dan he know too but it be all cum ob de bug finding that no satisfaction be to be obtain of jupiter whose whole intellect seem to be absorb by de bug i now step into the boat and make sail with a fair and strong breeze we soon run into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie and a walk of some two mile bring we to the hut it be about three in the afternoon when we arrive legrand have be await we in eager expectation he grasp my hand with a nervous _ empressement _ which alarm I and strengthen the suspicion already entertain he countenance be pale even to ghastliness and he deep-set eye glare with unnatural lustre after some inquiry respect he health i ask he not know what better to say if he have yet obtain the _ scarabæus _ from lieutenant g -- oh yes he reply color violently i get it from he the next morning nothing should tempt I to part with that _ scarabæus _ do you know that jupiter be quite right about it in what way i ask with a sad foreboding at heart in suppose it to be a bug of _ real gold _ he say this with a air of profound seriousness and i feel inexpressibly shock this bug be to make my fortune he continue with a triumphant smile to reinstate I in my family possession be it any wonder then that i prize it since fortune have think fit to bestow it upon I i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it be the index jupiter bring I that _ scarabæus _ what de bug massa i would rudder not go fer trubble dat bug -- you mus git he for you own self hereupon legrand arise with a grave and stately air and bring I the beetle from a glass case in which it be enclose it be a beautiful _ scarabæus _ and at that time unknown to naturalist -- of course a great prize in a scientific point of view there be two round black spot near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the scale be exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnish gold the weight of the insect be very remarkable and take all thing into consideration i could hardly blame jupiter for he opinion respect it but what to make of legrand 's agreement with that opinion i could not for the life of I tell i send for you say he in a grandiloquent tone when i have complete my examination of the beetle i send for you that i might have you counsel and assistance in further the view of fate and of the bug -- my dear legrand i cry interrupt he you be certainly unwell and have better use some little precaution you shall go to bed and i will remain with you a few day until you get over this you be feverish and -- feel my pulse say he i feel it and to say the truth find not the slightest indication of fever but you may be ill and yet have no fever allow I this once to prescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next -- you be mistaken he interpose i be as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer if you really wish I well you will relieve this excitement and how be this to be do very easily jupiter and myself be go upon a expedition into the hill upon the mainland and in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide you be the only one we can trust whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now perceive in I will be equally allay i be anxious to oblige you in any way i reply but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle have any connection with you expedition into the hill it have then legrand i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding i be sorry -- very sorry -- for we shall have to try it by ourselves try it by yourselve the man be surely mad -- but stay -- how long do you propose to be absent probably all night we shall start immediately and be back at all event by sunrise and will you promise I upon you honor that when this freak of yours be over and the bug business -lrb- good god -rrb- settle to you satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly as that of you physician yes i promise and now let we be off for we have no time to lose with a heavy heart i accompany my friend we start about four o'clock -- legrand jupiter the dog and myself jupiter have with he the scythe and spade -- the whole of which he insist upon carry more through fear it seem to I of trust either of the implement within reach of he master than from any excess of industry or complaisance he demeanor be dog in the extreme and dat d -- d bug be the sole word which escape he lip during the journey for my own part i have charge of a couple of dark lantern while legrand contented himself with the _ scarabæus _ which he carry attach to the end of a bit of whip-cord twirl it to and fro with the air of a conjuror as he go when i observe this last plain evidence of my friend 's aberration of mind i could scarcely refrain from tear i think it best however to humor he fancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more energetic measure with a chance of success in the meantime i endeavored but all in vain to sound he in regard to the object of the expedition have succeed in induce I to accompany he he seem unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance and to all my question vouchsafe no other reply than we shall see we cross the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff and ascend the high grounds on the shore of the mainland proceed in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep be to be see legrand lead the way with decision pause only for a instant here and there to consult what appear to be certain landmark of he own contrivance upon a former occasion in this manner we journey for about two hour and the sun be just set when we enter a region infinitely more dreary than any yet see it be a species of table-land near the summit of a almost inaccessible hill densely wood from base to pinnacle and intersperse with huge crag that appear to lie loosely upon the soil and in many case be prevent from precipitate themselves into the valley below merely by the support of the tree against which they recline deep ravine in various direction give a air of still sterner solemnity to the scene the natural platform to which we have clamber be thickly overgrow with bramble through which we soon discover that it would have be impossible to force we way but for the scythe and jupiter by direction of he master proceed to clear for we a path to the foot of a immensely large tulip-tree which stand with some eight or ten oak upon the level and far surpass they all and all other tree which i have then ever see in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread of its branch and in the general majesty of its appearance when we reach this tree legrand turn to jupiter and ask he if he think he could climb it the old man seem a little staggered by the question and for some moment make no reply at length he approach the huge trunk walk slowly around it and examine it with minute attention when he have complete he scrutiny he merely say : yes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life then up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too dark to see what we be about how far mus go up massa inquire jupiter get up the main trunk first and then i will tell you which way to go -- and here -- stop take this beetle with you de bug massa will -- de goole-bug cry the negro draw back in dismay -- what for mu tote de bug way up detree -- d -- n if i do if you be afraid jup a great big negro like you to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle why you can carry it up by this string -- but if you do not take it up with you in some way i shall be under the necessity of break you head with this shovel what de matter now massa say jup evidently shame into compliance always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger be only funnin anyhow _ I _ feered de bug what i keer for de bug here he take cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string and maintain the insect as far from he person as circumstance would permit prepared to ascend the tree in youth the tulip-tree or _ liriodendron tulipifera _ the most magnificent of american forester have a trunk peculiarly smooth and often rise to a great height without lateral branch but in its riper age the bark become gnarled and uneven while many short limb make they appearance on the stem thus the difficulty of ascension in the present case lay more in semblance than in reality embrace the huge cylinder as closely as possible with he arm and knee seize with he hand some projection and rest he naked toe upon other jupiter after one or two narrow escape from fall at length wriggle himself into the first great fork and seem to consider the whole business as virtually accomplish the _ risk _ of the achievement be in fact now over although the climber be some sixty or seventy foot from the ground which way mu go now massa will he ask keep up the largest branch -- the one on this side say legrand the negro obey he promptly and apparently with but little trouble ascend higher and higher until no glimpse of he squat figure could be obtain through the dense foliage which envelop it presently he voice be hear in a sort of halloo how much fudder be get for go how high up be you ask legrand ebber so fur reply the negro can see de sky fru de top ob de tree never mind the sky but attend to what i say look down the trunk and count the limb below you on this side how many limb have you pass one two tree four fibe -- i do pass fibe big limb massa pon di side then go one limb higher in a few minute the voice be hear again announce that the seventh limb be attain now jup cry legrand evidently much excited i want you to work you way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see anything strange let I know by this time what little doubt i might have entertain of my poor friend 's insanity be put finally at rest i have no alternative but to conclude he stricken with lunacy and i become seriously anxious about get he home while i be ponder upon what be best to be do jupiter 's voice be again hear mo feerd for to ventur pon di limb berry far -- ' t be dead limb putty much all de way do you say it be a _ dead _ limb jupiter cry legrand in a quavering voice yes massa he dead as de door-nail -- do up for sartain -- do depart di here life what in the name of heaven shall i do asked legrand seemingly in the greatest distress do say i glad of a opportunity to interpose a word why come home and go to bed come now -- that be a fine fellow it be get late and besides you remember you promise jupiter cry he without heed I in the least do you hear I yes massa will hear you ebber so plain try the wood well then with you knife and see if you think it _ very _ rotten he rotten massa sure nuff reply the negro in a few moment but not so berry rotten as mought be mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself dat 's true by yourself -- what do you mean why i mean de bug ` tis _ berry _ hebby bug spose i drop he down fuss and den de limb will not break wid just de weight ob one nigger you infernal scoundrel cry legrand apparently much relieved what do you mean by tell I such nonsense as that as sure as you let that beetle fall i 'll break you neck look here jupiter do you hear I yes massa need not hollo at poor nigger dat style well now listen -- if you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe and not let go the beetle i 'll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down i be gwine massa will -- deed i be reply the negro very promptly -- most out to the eend now _ out to the end _ here fairly scream legrand do you say you be out to the end of that limb soon be to de eend massa -- o-o-o-o-oh lorgol-a-marcy what _ be _ di here pon de tree well cry legrand highly delighted what be it why taint nuffin but a skull -- somebody bin lef he head up de tree and de crow do gobble ebery bit ob de meat off a skull you say -- very well -- how be it fasten to the limb -- what hold it on sure nuff massa mu look why dis berry curous sarcumstance pon my word -- dare 's a great big nail in de skull what fasten ob it on to de tree well now jupiter do exactly as i tell you -- do you hear yes massa pay attention then -- find the left eye of the skull hum hoo dat 's good why dar aint no eye lef at all curse you stupidity do you know you right hand from you left yes i nose dat -- nose all bout dat -- ` tis my lef hand what i chop de wood wid to be sure you be left-handed and you left eye be on the same side as you left hand now i suppose you can find the left eye of the skull or the place where the left eye have be have you find it here be a long pause at length the negro ask be de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull too -- cause de skull aint get not a bit ob a hand at all -- nebber mind i get de lef eye now -- here de lef eye what must do wid it let the beetle drop through it as far as the string will reach -- but be careful and not let go you hold of the string all dat do massa will mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole -- look out for he dar below during this colloquy no portion of jupiter 's person could be see but the beetle which he have suffer to descend be now visible at the end of the string and glisten like a globe of burnish gold in the last ray of the setting sun some of which still faintly illumine the eminence upon which we stand the _ scarabæus _ hang quite clear of any branch and if allow to fall would have fall at we foot legrand immediately take the scythe and clear with it a circular space three or four yard in diameter just beneath the insect and have accomplish this order jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree drive a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle fall my friend now produce from he pocket a tape-measure fasten one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which be nearest the peg he unroll it till it reach the peg and thence farther unrolled it in the direction already establish by the two point of the tree and the peg for the distance of fifty foot -- jupiter clearing away the bramble with the scythe at the spot thus attain a second peg be drive and about this as a center a rude circle about four foot in diameter describe take now a spade himself and give one to jupiter and one to I legrand beg we to set about digging as quickly as possible to speak the truth i have no especial relish for such amusement at any time and at that particular moment would most willingly have decline it for the night be come on and i feel much fatigue with the exercise already take but i see no mode of escape and be fearful of disturbing my poor friend 's equanimity by a refusal could i have depend indeed upon jupiter 's aid i would have have no hesitation in attempt to get the lunatic home by force but i be too well assure of the old negro 's disposition to hope that he would assist I under any circumstance in a personal contest with he master i make no doubt that the latter have be infect with some of the innumerable southern superstition about money bury and that he fantasy have receive confirmation by the finding of the _ scarabæus _ or perhaps by jupiter 's obstinacy in maintain it to be a bug of real gold a mind dispose to lunacy would readily be lead away by such suggestion especially if chime in with favorite preconceived idea and then i call to mind the poor fellow 's speech about the beetle 's be the index of he fortune upon the whole i be sadly vex and puzzle but at length i conclude to make a virtue of necessity -- to dig with a good will and thus the sooner to convince the visionary by ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the opinion he entertain the lantern have be light we all fall to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause and as the glare fall upon we person and implement i could not help think how picturesque a group we compose and how strange and suspicious we labor must have appear to any interloper who by chance might have stumble upon we whereabouts we dig very steadily for two hour little be say and we chief embarrassment lay in the yelping of the dog who take exceed interest in we proceedings he at length become so obstreperous that we grow fearful of he give the alarm to some straggler in the vicinity or rather this be the apprehension of legrand for myself i should have rejoice at any interruption which might have enable I to get the wanderer home the noise be at length very effectually silence by jupiter who get out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation tie the brute 's mouth up with one of he suspenders and then return with a grave chuckle to he task when the time mention have expire we have reach a depth of five foot and yet no sign of any treasure become manifest a general pause ensue and i begin to hope that the farce be at a end legrand however although evidently much disconcerted wipe he brow thoughtfully and recommence we have excavate the entire circle of four foot diameter and now we slightly enlarged the limit and go to the farther depth of two foot still nothing appear the gold-seeker whom i sincerely pity at length clamber from the pit with the bitterest disappointment imprint upon every feature and proceed slowly and reluctantly to put on he coat which he have throw off at the beginning of he labor in the meantime i make no remark jupiter at a signal from he master begin to gather up he tool this do and the dog have be unmuzzled we turn in profound silence towards home we have take perhaps a dozen step in this direction when with a loud oath legrand stride up to jupiter and seize he by the collar the astonished negro open he eye and mouth to the fullest extent let fall the spade and fall upon he knee you scoundrel say legrand hiss out the syllable from between he clenched tooth -- you infernal black villain -- speak i tell you -- answer I this instant without prevarication -- which -- which be you left eye oh my golly massa will aint di here my lef eye for sartain roar the terrify jupiter place he hand upon he _ right _ organ of vision and hold it there with a desperate pertinacity as if in immediate dread of he master 's attempt at a gouge i think so i know it hurrah vociferated legrand let the negro go and execute a series of curvet and caracole much to the astonishment of he valet who arise from he knee look mutely from he master to myself and then from myself to he master come we must go back say the latter the game 's not up yet and he again lead the way to the tulip-tree jupiter say he when we reach its foot come here be the skull nail to the limb with the face outward or with the face to the limb de face be out massa so dat de crow could get at de eye good widout any trouble well then be it this eye or that through which you drop the beetle here legrand touch each of jupiter 's eye ' t be dis eye massa -- de lef eye -- ji as you tell I and here it be he right eye that the negro indicate that will do -- we must try it again here my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancy that i see certain indication of method remove the peg which mark the spot where the beetle fall to a spot about three inch to the westward of its former position take now the tape-measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg as before and continue the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty foot a spot be indicate remove by several yard from the point at which we have be digging around the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the former instance be now describe and we again set to work with the spade i be dreadfully weary but scarcely understand what have occasion the change in my thought i feel no longer any great aversion from the labor impose i have become most unaccountably interested -- nay even excited perhaps there be something amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrand -- some air of forethought or of deliberation -- which impress I i dig eagerly and now and then catch myself actually look with something that very much resemble expectation for the fancied treasure the vision of which have demented my unfortunate companion at a period when such vagary of think most fully possess I and when we have be at work perhaps a hour and a half we be again interrupt by the violent howling of the dog he uneasiness in the first instance have be evidently but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assume a bitter and serious tone upon jupiter 's again attempt to muzzle he he make furious resistance and leap into the hole tear up the mould frantically with he claw in a few seconds he have uncover a mass of human bone form two complete skeleton intermingle with several button of metal and what appear to be the dust of decayed woollen one or two stroke of a spade upturn the blade of a large spanish knife and as we dig farther three or four loose piece of gold and silver coin come to light at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrain but the countenance of he master wear a air of extreme disappointment he urge we however to continue we exertion and the word be hardly utter when i stumble and fall forward have catch the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half bury in the loose earth we now work in earnest and never do i pass ten minute of more intense excitement during this interval we have fairly unearth a oblong chest of wood which from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness have plainly be subject to some mineralizing process -- perhaps that of the bichloride of mercury this box be three foot and a half long three foot broad and two and a half foot deep it be firmly secure by band of work iron rivet and form a kind of trellis-work over the whole on each side of the chest near the top be three ring of iron -- six in all -- by means of which a firm hold could be obtain by six person we utmost united endeavor serve only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed we at once see the impossibility of remove so great a weight luckily the sole fastening of the lid consist of two slide bolt these we draw back -- tremble and pant with anxiety in a instant a treasure of incalculable value lay gleam before we as the ray of the lantern fall within the pit there flash upward from a confused heap of gold and of jewel a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzle we eye i shall not pretend to describe the feeling with which i gaze amazement be of course predominant legrand appear exhaust with excitement and speak very few word jupiter 's countenance wear for some minute as deadly a pallor as it be possible in the nature of thing for any negro 's visage to assume he seem stupefy -- thunder-stricken presently he fall upon he knee in the pit and bury he naked arm up to the elbow in gold let they there remain as if enjoy the luxury of a bath at length with a deep sigh he exclaim as if in a soliloquy : and dis all cum ob de goole-bug de putty goole-bug de poor little goole-bug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint you shame ob yourself nigger -- answer I dat it become necessary at last that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of remove the treasure it be grow late and it behoove we to make exertion that we might get everything house before daylight it be difficult to say what should be do and much time be spend in deliberation -- so confused be the idea of all we finally lighten the box by remove two-third of its contents when we be enable with some trouble to raise it from the hole the article take out be deposit among the bramble and the dog leave to guard they with strict order from jupiter neither upon any pretence to stir from the spot nor to open he mouth until we return we then hurriedly make for home with the chest reach the hut in safety but after excessive toil at one o'clock in the morning wear out as we be it be not in human nature to do more just now we rest until two and have supper start for the hill immediately afterwards arm with three stout sack which by good luck be upon the premise a little before four we arrive at the pit divide the remainder of the booty as equally as might be among we and leave the hole unfilled again set out for the hut at which for the second time we deposit we golden burden just as the first streak of the dawn gleam from over the tree-top in the east we be now thoroughly break down but the intense excitement of the time deny we repose after a unquiet slumber of some three or four hour ' duration we arise as if by preconcert to make examination of we treasure the chest have be full to the brim and we spend the whole day and the greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its contents there have be nothing like order or arrangement everything have be heap in promiscuously have assorted all with care we find ourselves possess of even vaster wealth than we have at first suppose in coin there be rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollar -- estimate the value of the piece as accurately as we could by the table of the period there be not a particle of silver all be gold of antique date and of great variety : french spanish and german money with a few english guinea and some counter of which we have never see specimen before there be several very large and heavy coin so worn that we could make nothing of they inscription there be no american money the value of the jewel we find more difficulty in estimate there be diamond -- some of they exceedingly large and fine -- a hundred and ten in all and not one of they small eighteen ruby of remarkable brilliancy three hundred and ten emerald all very beautiful and twenty-one sapphire with a opal these stone have all be break from they setting and throw loose in the chest the setting themselves which we pick out from among the other gold appear to have be beat up with hammer as if to prevent identification besides all this there be a vast quantity of solid gold ornament : nearly two hundred massive finger and ear-ring rich chain -- thirty of these if i remember eighty-three very large and heavy crucifix five gold censer of great value a prodigious golden punch-bowl ornament with richly chase vine-leaf and bacchanalian figure with two sword-handle exquisitely embossed and many other smaller article which i can not recollect the weight of these valuable exceed three hundred and fifty pound avoirdupois and in this estimate i have not include one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watch three of the number be worth each five hundred dollar if one many of they be very old and as time-keepers valueless the work have suffer more or less from corrosion but all be richly jewelled and in case of great worth we estimate the entire contents of the chest that night at a million and a half of dollar and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinket and jewel -lrb- a few be retain for we own use -rrb- it be find that we have greatly undervalue the treasure when at length we have conclude we examination and the intense excitement of the time have in some measure subside legrand who see that i be die with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle enter into a full detail of all the circumstance connect with it you remember say he the night when i hand you the rough sketch i have make of the _ scarabæus _ you recollect also that i become quite vex at you for insist that my draw resemble a death 's - head when you first make this assertion i think you be jest but afterwards i call to mind the peculiar spot on the back of the insect and admit to myself that you remark have some little foundation in fact still the sneer at my graphic power irritated I -- for i be consider a good artist -- and therefore when you hand I the scrap of parchment i be about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire the scrap of paper you mean say i no : it have much of the appearance of paper and at first i suppose it to be such but when i come to draw upon it i discover it at once to be a piece of very thin parchment it be quite dirty you remember well as i be in the very act of crumple it up my glance fall upon the sketch at which you have be look and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceive in fact the figure of a death 's - head just where it seem to I i have make the drawing of the beetle for a moment i be too much amaze to think with accuracy i know that my design be very different in detail from this -- although there be a certain similarity in general outline presently i take a candle and seat myself at the other end of the room proceed to scrutinize the parchment more closely upon turn it over i see my own sketch upon the reverse just as i have make it my first idea now be mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline -- at the singular coincidence involve in the fact that unknown to I there should have be a skull upon the other side of the parchment immediately beneath my figure of the _ scarabæus _ and that this skull not only in outline but in size should so closely resemble my draw i say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefy I for a time this be the usual effect of such coincidence the mind struggle to establish a connection -- a sequence of cause and effect -- and be unable to do so suffer a species of temporary paralysis but when i recover from this stupor there dawn upon I gradually a conviction which startle I even far more than the coincidence i begin distinctly positively to remember that there have be _ no _ draw on the parchment when i make my sketch of the _ scarabæus _ i become perfectly certain of this for i recollected turn up first one side and then the other in search of the cleanest spot have the skull be then there of course i could not have fail to notice it here be indeed a mystery which i feel it impossible to explain but even at that early moment there seem to glimmer faintly within the most remote and secret chamber of my intellect a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night 's adventure bring to so magnificent a demonstration i arise at once and put the parchment securely away dismiss all farther reflection until i should be alone when you have go and when jupiter be fast asleep i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair in the first place i consider the manner in which the parchment have come into my possession the spot where we discover the _ scarabæus _ be on the coast of the mainland about a mile eastward of the island and but a short distance above high-water mark upon my take hold of it it give I a sharp bite which cause I to let it drop jupiter with he accustomed caution before seize the insect which have fly towards he look about he for a leaf or something of that nature by which to take hold of it it be at this moment that he eye and mine also fall upon the scrap of parchment which i then suppose to be paper it be lie half-buried in the sand a corner stick up near the spot where we find it i observe the remnant of the hull of what appear to have be a ship 's long boat the wreck seem to have be there for a very great while for the resemblance to boat timber could scarcely be trace well jupiter pick up the parchment wrap the beetle in it and give it to I soon afterwards we turn to go home and on the way meet lieutenant g -- i show he the insect and he beg I to let he take it to the fort on my consent he thrust it forthwith into he waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it have be wrap and which i have continue to hold in my hand during he inspection perhaps he dread my change my mind and think it best to make sure of the prize at once -- you know how enthusiastic he be on all subject connect with natural history at the same time without be conscious of it i must have deposit the parchment in my own pocket you remember that when i go to the table for the purpose of make a sketch of the beetle i find no paper where it be usually keep i look in the drawer and find none there i search my pocket hope to find a old letter and then my hand fall upon the parchment i thus detail the precise mode in which it come into my possession for the circumstance impress I with peculiar force no doubt you will think I fanciful -- but i have already establish a kind of _ connection _ i have put together two link of a great chain there be a boat lie on a seacoast and not far from the boat be a parchment -- _ not a paper _ -- with a skull depict on it you will of course ask ` where be the connection ' i reply that the skull or death 's - head be the well-known emblem of the pirate the flag of the death 's - head be hoist in all engagement i have say that the scrap be parchment and not paper parchment be durable -- almost imperishable matter of little moment be rarely consign to parchment since for the mere ordinary purpose of draw or write it be not nearly so well adapt as paper this reflection suggest some meaning -- some relevancy -- in the death 's - head i do not fail to observe also the _ form _ of the parchment although one of its corner have be by some accident destroy it could be see that the original form be oblong it be just such a slip indeed as might have be choose for a memorandum -- for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved but i interpose you say that the skull be _ not _ upon the parchment when you make the drawing of the beetle how then do you trace any connection between the boat and the skull -- since this latter accord to you own admission must have be design -lrb- god only know how or by whom -rrb- at some period subsequent to you sketch the _ scarabæus _ ah hereupon turn the whole mystery although the secret at this point i have comparatively little difficulty in solve my step be sure and could afford but a single result i reason for example thus : when i draw the _ scarabæus _ there be no skull apparent on the parchment when i have complete the drawing i give it to you and observe you narrowly until you return it _ you _ therefore do not design the skull and no one else be present to do it then it be not do by human agency and nevertheless it be do at this stage of my reflection i endeavor to remember and _ do _ remember with entire distinctness every incident which occur about the period in question the weather be chilly -lrb- o rare and happy accident -rrb- and a fire be blaze on the hearth i be heat with exercise and sit near the table you however have draw a chair close to the chimney just as i place the parchment in you hand and as you be in the act of inspect it wolf the newfoundland enter and leap upon you shoulder with you left hand you caress he and keep he off while you right hold the parchment be permit to fall listlessly between you knee and in close proximity to the fire at one moment i think the blaze have catch it and be about to caution you but before i could speak you have withdraw it and be engage in its examination when i consider all these particulars i doubt not for a moment that _ heat _ have be the agent in bring to light on the parchment the skull which i see design on it you be well aware that chemical preparation exist and have exist time out of mind by means of which it be possible to write on either paper or vellum so that the character shall become visible only when subject to the action of fire zaffre digest in _ aqua regium _ and dilute with four time its weight of water be sometimes employ a green tint result the regulus of cobalt dissolve in spirit of nitre give a red these color disappear at longer or shorter interval after the material write upon cool but again become apparent upon the reapplication of heat i now scrutinize the death 's - head with care its outer edge -- the edge of the draw nearest the edge of the vellum -- be far more _ distinct _ than the other it be clear that the action of the caloric have be imperfect or unequal i immediately kindle a fire and subject every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat at first the only effect be the strengthening of the faint line in the skull but on persevere in the experiment there become visible at the corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death 's - head be delineate the figure of what i at first suppose to be a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfy I that it be intend for a kid ha ha say i to be sure i have no right to laugh at you -- a million and a half of money be too serious a matter for mirth -- but you be not about to establish a third link in you chain : you will not find any especial connection between you pirate and a goat pirate you know have nothing to do with goat they appertain to the farming interest but i have just say that the figure be _ not _ that of a goat well a kid then -- pretty much the same thing pretty much but not altogether say legrand you may have hear of one _ captain _ kidd i at once look on the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i say signature because its position on the vellum suggest this idea the death 's - head at the corner diagonally opposite have in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal but i be sorely put out by the absence of all else -- of the body to my imagine instrument -- of the text for my context i presume you expect to find a letter between the stamp and the signature something of that kind the fact be i feel irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impend i can scarcely say why perhaps after all it be rather a desire than a actual belief -- but do you know that jupiter 's silly word about the bug being of solid gold have a remarkable effect on my fancy and then the series of accident and coincidence -- these be so _ very _ extraordinary do you observe how mere a accident it be that these event should have occur on the _ sole _ day of all the year in which it have be or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without the fire or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appear i should never have become aware of the death 's - head and so never the possessor of the treasure but proceed -- i be all impatience well you have hear of course the many story current -- the thousand vague rumor afloat about money bury somewhere on the atlantic coast by kidd and he associate these rumor must have have some foundation in fact and that the rumor have exist so long and so continuously could have result it appear to I only from the circumstance of the bury treasure still _ remain _ entomb have kidd conceal he plunder for a time and afterwards reclaim it the rumor would scarcely have reach we in they present unvarying form you will observe that the story tell be all about money-seeker not about money-finder have the pirate recover he money there the affair would have drop it seem to I that some accident -- say the loss of a memorandum indicate its locality -- have deprive he of the means of recover it and that this accident have become know to he follower who otherwise might never have hear that treasure have be conceal at all and who busy themselves in vain because unguided attempt to regain it have give first birth and then universal currency to the report which be now so common have you ever hear of any important treasure be unearth along the coast never but that kidd 's accumulation be immense be well know i take it for grant therefore that the earth still hold they and you will scarcely be surprise when i tell you that i feel a hope nearly amount to certainty that the parchment so strangely find involve a lose record of the place of deposit but how do you proceed i hold the vellum again to the fire after increase the heat but nothing appear i now think it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure so i carefully rinse the parchment by pour warm water over it and have do this i place it in a tin pan with the skull downward and put the pan upon a furnace of light charcoal in a few minute the pan have become thoroughly heated i remove the slip and to my inexpressible joy find it spot in several place with what appear to be figure arrange in line again i place it in the pan and suffer it to remain another minute upon take it off the whole be just as you see it now here legrand have reheat the parchment submit it to my inspection the follow character be rudely trace in a red tint between the death 's - head and the goat : -- 53 $ $ +305 -rrb- -rrb- 6 \* 4826 -rrb- 4

the dark as ever be all the jewel of golconda await I on my solution of this enigma i be quite sure that i should be unable to earn they and yet say legrand the solution be by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the character these character as any one might readily guess form a cipher -- that be to say they convey a meaning but then from what be know of kidd i could not suppose he capable of construct any of the more abstruse cryptograph i make up my mind at once that this be of a simple species -- such however as would appear to the crude intellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key and you really solve it readily i have solve other of a abstruseness ten thousand time greater circumstance and a certain bias of mind have lead I to take interest in such riddle and it may well be doubt whether human ingenuity can construct a enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not by proper application resolve in fact have once establish connected and legible character i scarcely give a think to the mere difficulty of develop they import in the present case -- indeed in all case of secret writing -- the first question regard the _ language _ of the cipher for the principle of solution so far especially as the more simple cipher be concerned depend on and be vary by the genius of the particular idiom in general there be no alternative but experiment -lrb- direct by probability -rrb- of every tongue know to he who attempt the solution until the true one be attain but with the cipher now before we all difficulty be remove by the signature the pun upon the word ` kidd ' be appreciable in no other language than the english but for this consideration i should have begin my attempt with the spanish and french as the tongue in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have be write by a pirate of the spanish main as it be i assume the cryptograph to be english you observe there be no division between the word have there be division the task would have be comparatively easy in such case i should have commence with a collation and analysis of the shorter word and have a word of a single letter occur as be most likely -lrb- _ a _ or _ i _ for example -rrb- i should have consider the solution as assure but there be no division my first step be to ascertain the predominant letter as well as the least frequent count all i construct a table thus : of the character 8 there be 33 26 4 19 $ -rrb- 16 \* 13 5 12 6 11 +1 8 0 6 92 5 :3 4 3 ¶ 2 -rrb- -- 1 now in english the letter which most frequently occur be _ e _ afterwards the succession run thus : _ a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z e _ predominate however so remarkably that a individual sentence of any length be rarely see in which it be not the prevail character here then we have in the very begin the groundwork for something more than a mere guess the general use which may be make of the table be obvious -- but in this particular cipher we shall only very partially require its aid as we predominant character be 8 we will commence by assume it as the _ e _ of the natural alphabet to verify the supposition let we observe if the 8 be see often in couple -- for _ e _ be double with great frequency in english -- in such word for example as ` meet ' ` fleet ' speed ' ` see ' ` be ' ` agree ' etc in the present instance we see it double no less than five time although the cryptograph be brief let we assume 8 then as _ e _ now of all _ word _ in the language ` the ' be most usual let we see therefore whether there be not repetition of any three character in the same order of collocation the last of they be 8 if we discover repetition of such letter so arrange they will most probably represent the word ` the ' on inspection we find no less than seven such arrangement the character be 48 we may therefore assume that the semicolon represent _ t _ that 4 represent _ h _ and that 8 represent _ e _ -- the last be now well confirm thus a great step have be take but have establish a single word we be enable to establish a vastly important point that be to say several commencement and termination of other word let we refer for example to the last instance but one in which the combination 48 occur -- not far from the end of the cipher we know that the semicolon immediately ensue be the commencement of a word and of the six character succeed this ` the ' we be cognizant of no less than five let we set these character down thus by the letter we know they to represent leave a space for the unknown -- t eeth here we be enable at once to discard the ' _ th _ ' as form no portion of the word commence with the first _ t _ since by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapt to the vacancy we perceive that no word can be form of which this _ th _ can be a part we be thus narrow into t ee and go through the alphabet if necessary as before we arrive at the word ` tree ' as the sole possible reading we thus gain another letter _ r _ represent by -lrb- with the word ` the tree ' in juxtaposition look beyond these word for a short distance we again see the combination 48 and employ it by way of _ termination _ to what immediately precede we have thus this arrangement : the tree4 -lrb- $ 34 the or substitute the natural letter where know it read thus : the tree thr $ 3h the now if in place of the unknown character we leave blank space or substitute dot we read thus : the tree thrh the when the word ' _ through _ ' make itself evident at once but this discovery give we three new letter _ o u _ and _ g _ represent by $ and 3 look now narrowly through the cipher for combination of known character we find not very far from the begin this arrangement : 83 -lrb- 88 or egree which plainly be the conclusion of the word ` degree ' and give we another letter _ d _ represent by + four letter beyond the word ` degree ' we perceive the combination 46 -lrb- 88 \* translate the known character and represent the unknown by dot as before we read thus : thrtee a arrangement immediately suggestive of the word ` thirteen ' and again furnish we with two new character _ i _ and_n _ represent by 6 and \* refer now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the combination 53 $ $ + translate as before we obtain good which assure we that the first letter be _ a _ and that the first two word be ' a good ' to avoid confusion it be now time that we arrange we key as far as discover in a tabular form it will stand thus : 5 represent a + d 8 e 3 g 4 h 6 i \* n $ o -lrb- r t we have therefore no less than ten of the most important letter represent and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the detail of the solution i have say enough to convince you that cipher of this nature be readily soluble and to give you some insight into the rationale of they development but be assure that the specimen before we appertain to the very simplest species of cryptograph it now only remain to give you the full translation of the character upon the parchment as unriddled here it be : ' _ a good glass in the bishop 's hostel in the devil 's seat twenty one degree and thirteen minute northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death 's - head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty foot out _ ' but say i the enigma seem still in as bad a condition as ever how be it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about ` devil 's seat ' ` death 's - head ' and ` bishop 's hostel ' i confess reply legrand that the matter still wear a serious aspect when regard with a casual glance my first endeavor be to divide the sentence into the natural division intend by the cryptographist you mean to punctuate it something of that kind but how be it possible to effect this i reflect that it have be a _ point _ with the writer to run he word together without division so as to increase the difficulty of solution now a not over-acute man in pursue such a object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter when in the course of he composition he arrive at a break in he subject which would naturally require a pause or a point he would be exceedingly apt to run he character at this place more than usually close together if you will observe the m in the present instance you will easily detect five such case of unusual crowding act on this hint i make the division thus : ' _ a good glass in the bishop 's hostel in the devil 's seat -- twenty-one degree and thirteen minute -- northeast and by north -- main branch seventh limb east side -- shoot from the left eye of the death 's - head -- a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty foot out _ ' even this division say i leave I still in the dark it leave I also in the dark reply legrand for a few day during which i make diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of sullivan 's island for any building which go by the name of the ` bishop 's hotel ' for of course i drop the obsolete word ` hostel ' gain no information on the subject i be on the point of extend my sphere of search and proceeding in a more systematic manner when one morning it enter into my head quite suddenly that this ` bishop 's hostel ' might have some reference to a old family of the name of bessop which time out of mind have hold possession of a ancient manor-house about four mile to the northward of the island i accordingly go over to the plantation and reinstitute my inquiry among the older negro of the place at length one of the most aged of the woman say that she have hear of such a place as _ bessop 's castle _ and think that she could guide I to it but that it be not a castle nor a tavern but a high rock i offer to pay she well for she trouble and after some demur she consent to accompany I to the spot we find it without much difficulty when dismiss she i proceed to examine the place the ` castle ' consist of a irregular assemblage of cliff and rock -- one of the latter be quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulate and artificial appearance i clamber to its apex and then feel much at a loss as to what should be next do while i be busy in reflection my eye fall on a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stand this ledge project about eighteen inch and be not more than a foot wide while a niche in the cliff just above it give it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chair use by we ancestor i make no doubt that here be the ` devil 's seat ' allude to in the m and now i seem to grasp the full secret of the riddle the ` good glass ' i know could have reference to nothing but a telescope for the word ` glass ' be rarely employ in any other sense by seaman now here i at once saw be a telescope to be use and a definite point of view _ admit no variation _ from which to use it nor do i hesitate to believe that the phrase ` twenty-one degree and thirteen minute ' and ` northeast and by north ' be intend as direction for the levelling of the glass greatly excite by these discovery i hurry home procure a telescope and return to the rock i let myself down to the ledge and find that it be impossible to retain a seat on it unless in one particular position this fact confirm my preconceived idea i proceed to use the glass of course the ` twenty-one degree and thirteen minute ' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon since the horizontal direction be clearly indicate by the word ` northeast and by north ' this latter direction i at once establish by means of a pocket-compass then point the glass as nearly at a angle of twenty-one degree of elevation as i could do it by guess i move it cautiously up or down until my attention be arrest by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtop its fellow in the distance in the center of this rift i perceive a white spot but could not at first distinguish what it be adjust the focus of the telescope i again look and now make it out to be a human skull on this discovery i be so sanguine as to consider the enigma solve for the phrase ` main branch seventh limb east side ' could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree while ` shoot from the left eye of the death 's - head ' admit also of but one interpretation in regard to a search for bury treasure i perceive that the design be to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull and that a bee-line or in other word a straight line draw from the nearest point of the trunk through ` the shot ' -lrb- or the spot where the bullet fall -rrb- and thence extend to a distance of fifty foot would indicate a definite point -- and beneath this point i think it at least _ possible _ that a deposit of value lay conceal all this i say be exceedingly clear and although ingenious still simple and explicit when you leave the bishop 's hotel what then why have carefully take the bearing of the tree i turn homewards the instant that i leave ` the devil 's seat ' however the circular rift vanish nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards turn as i would what seem to I the chief ingenuity in this whole business be the fact -lrb- for repeat experiment have convince I it _ be _ a fact -rrb- that the circular opening in question be visible from no other attainable point of view than that afford by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock in this expedition to the ` bishop 's hotel ' i have be attend by jupiter who have no doubt observe for some week past the abstraction of my demeanor and take especial care not to leave I alone but on the next day get up very early i contrived to give he the slip and go into the hill in search of the tree after much toil i find it when i come home at night my valet propose to give I a flog with the rest of the adventure i believe you be as well acquaint as myself i suppose say i you miss the spot in the first attempt at digging through jupiter 's stupidity in let the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull precisely this mistake make a difference of about two inch and a half in the ` shot ' -- that be to say in the position of the peg nearest the tree and have the treasure be _ beneath _ the ` shot ' the error would have be of little moment but the ` shot ' together with the nearest point of the tree be merely two point for the establishment of a line of direction of course the error however trivial in the beginning increase as we proceed with the line and by the time we have go fifty foot throw we quite off the scent but for my deep-seated conviction that treasure be here somewhere actually bury we might have have all we labor in vain i presume the fancy of _ the skull _ -- of let fall a bullet through the skull 's eye -- be suggest to kidd by the piratical flag no doubt he feel a kind of poetical consistency in recover he money through this ominous insignium perhaps so still i can not help think that common-sense have quite as much to do with the matter as poetical consistency to be visible from the devil 's seat it be necessary that the object if small should be _ white _ and there be nothing like you human skull for retain and even increase its whiteness under exposure to all vicissitude of weather but you grandiloquence and you conduct in swing the beetle -- how excessively odd i be sure you be mad and why do you insist on let fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull why to be frank i feel somewhat annoy by you evident suspicion touch my sanity and so resolve to punish you quietly in my own way by a little bit of sober mystification for this reason i swing the beetle and for this reason i let it fall from the tree a observation of yours about its great weight suggest the latter idea yes i perceive and now there be only one point which puzzle I what be we to make of the skeleton find in the hole that be a question i be no more able to answer than yourself there seem however only one plausible way of accounting for they -- and yet it be dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply it be clear that kidd -- if kidd indeed secrete this treasure which i doubt not -- it be clear that he must have have assistance in the labor but the worst of this labor conclude he may have think it expedient to remove all participant in he secret perhaps a couple of blow with a mattock be sufficient while he coadjutor be busy in the pit perhaps it require a dozen -- who shall tell v a christmas carol -lrb- 1843 -rrb- by charle dickens -lrb- 1812-1870 -rrb- -lrb- _ setting _ in this most famous of christmas story dickens give we the very atmosphere of the season with all the contrast that poverty and wealth miserliness and charity the past and the future can suggest though he have london in mind any great industrial center would have serve as well for dickens be think primarily of the relation between employer and employee that christma be better keep in england now than when dickens write be a triumph due more to a christmas carol than to any other one piece of prose or verse _ plot _ the story be plan rather than plot by call it a carol and divide it into stave dickens would have we think of it not as a narrative but as a song full of the joy and good will that christma ought to diffuse it be a rill from the fountain of the first great christmas chant on earth peace good will toward man the theme be not so much the duty of service as the joy of service the happiness that we feel in make other happy and the four carol mark the four stage in the conversion of scrooge from solitary selfishness to social good will the plan be simple but it be suffuse with a love and sympathy that no one but dickens or o henry could have give it if the gold-bug be a triumph of the analytic intellect this story be a triumph of the social impulse that make the world better it seem to I say thackeray a national benefit and to every man and woman who read it a personal kindness while write it dickens say : i weep and laugh and weep again and yet the psychology of the plot be as soundly intellectual as the style be emotional dickens know that a flint-hearted man like scrooge could not be change by force bring to bear from without the appeal must come from within he must himself see he past he present and he probable future but in a new light and from a wider angle of vision the dream be only a means to this end a man move to a higher realm of thought and action not by learn new truth but by see the old truth differently related _ character _ scrooge be of course the central character he be also a perfect example of the change character as contrast with the stationary character in fact all the other character remain essentially the same while scrooge who at the beginning be unfriendly and friendless become at the end as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city know or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world it be difficult to create any kind of character whether stationary or change but the latter be the more difficult both demand rare power of observation and interpretation but the ascend or descend character demand a knowledge of the chemistry of conduct that only the master have the cratchit must not be overlook tiny tim 's god bless we every one have at least become the symbol of christmas benevolence wherever christmas be celebrate in english-speaking land -rrb- stave one marley 's ghost marley be dead to begin with there be no doubt whatever about that the register of he burial be sign by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner scrooge sign it and scrooge 's name be good upon ` change for anything he choose to put he hand to old marley be as dead as a door-nail scrooge know he be dead of course he do how could it be otherwise scrooge and he be partner for i do not know how many year scrooge be he sole executor he sole administrator he sole assign he sole residuary legatee he sole friend he sole mourner scrooge never paint out old marley 's name however there it yet stand year afterwards above the warehouse door -- scrooge and marley the firm be know as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business call scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley he answer to both name it be all the same to he oh but he be a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone be scrooge a squeeze wrenching grasp scrape clutch covetous old sinner external heat and cold have little influence on he no warmth could warm no cold could chill he no wind that blow be bitterer than he no fall snow be more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty foul weather do not know where to have he the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over he in only one respect -- they often come down handsomely and scrooge never do nobody ever stop he in the street to say with gladsome look my dear scrooge how be you when will you come to see I no beggar implore he to bestow a trifle no child ask he what it be o'clock no man or woman ever once in all he life inquire the way to such and such a place of scrooge even the blind man 's dog appear to know he and when they see he come on would tug they owner into doorway and up court and then would wag they tail as though they say : no eye at all be better than a evil eye dark master but what do scrooge care it be the very thing he like to edge he way along the crowded path of life warn all human sympathy to keep its distance be what the know one call nut to scrooge once upon a time -- of all the good day in the year upon a christmas eve -- old scrooge sit busy in he counting-house it be cold bleak bite foggy weather and the city clock have only just go three but it be quite dark already the door of scrooge 's counting-house be open that he might keep he eye upon he clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank be copy letter scrooge have a very small fire but the clerk 's fire be so very much smaller that it look like one coal but he could not replenish it for scrooge keep the coal-box in he own room and so surely as the clerk come in with the shovel the master predict that it would be necessary for they to part wherefore the clerk put on he white comforter and try to warm himself at the candle in which effort not be a man of a strong imagination he fail a merry christmas uncle god save you cry a cheerful voice it be the voice of scrooge 's nephew who come upon he so quickly that this be the first intimation scrooge have of he approach bah say scrooge humbug christma a humbug uncle you do not mean that i be sure i do out upon merry christmas what be christmas time to you but a time for pay bill without money a time for find yourself a year older and not a hour richer a time for balance you book and have every item in 'em through a round dozen of month present dead against you if i have my will every idiot who go about with ` merry christmas ' on he lip should be boil with he own pudding and bury with a stake of holly through he heart he should uncle nephew keep christmas in you own way and let I keep it in mine keep it but you do not keep it let I leave it alone then much good may it do you much good it have ever do you there be many thing from which i might have derive good by which i have not profit i dare say christmas among the rest but i be sure i have always think of christmas time when it have come round -- apart from the veneration due to its sacred origin if anything belong to it _ can _ be apart from that -- as a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when man and woman seem by one consent to open they shut-up heart freely and to think of people below they as if they really be fellow-traveller to the grave and not another race of creature bind on other journey and therefore uncle though it have never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it _ have _ do I good and _ will _ do I good and i say god bless it the clerk in the tank involuntarily applaud let I hear another sound from _ you _ say scrooge and you 'll keep you christmas by lose you situation -- you be quite a powerful speaker sir he add turn to he nephew i wonder you do not go into parliament do not be angry uncle come dine with we to-morrow scrooge say that he would see he -- yes indeed he do he go the whole length of the expression and say that he would see he in that extremity first but why cry scrooge 's nephew why why do you get marry because i fall in love because you fall in love growl scrooge as if that be the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas good afternoon nay uncle but you never come to see I before that happen why give it as a reason for not come now good afternoon i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why can not we be friend good afternoon i be sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never have any quarrel to which i have be a party but i have make the trial in homage to christmas and i 'll keep my christmas humor to the last so a merry christmas uncle good afternoon and a happy new year good afternoon he nephew leave the room without a angry word notwithstanding the clerk in let scrooge 's nephew out have let two other people in they be portly gentleman pleasant to behold and now stand with they hat off in scrooge 's office they have book and papers in they hand and bow to he scrooge and marley 's i believe say one of the gentleman refer to he list have i the pleasure of address mr scrooge or mr marley mr marley have be dead these seven year he die seven year ago this very night at this festive season of the year mr scrooge say the gentleman take up a pen it be more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousand be in want of common necessaries hundred of thousand be in want of common comfort sir be there no prison plenty of prison but under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the unoffending multitude a few of we be endeavor to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it be a time of all other when want be keenly feel and abundance rejoice what shall i put you down for nothing you wish to be anonymous i wish to be leave alone since you ask I what i wish gentleman that be my answer i do not make merry myself at christmas and i can not afford to make idle people merry i help to support the prison and the workhouse -- they cost enough -- and those who be badly off must go there many can not go there and many would rather die if they would rather die they have better do it and decrease the surplus population at length the hour of shut up the counting-house arrive with a ill-will scrooge dismount from he stool tacitly admit the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuff he candle out and put on he hat you 'll want all day to-morrow i suppose if quite convenient sir it be not convenient and it be not fair if i be to stop half a crown for it you would think yourself mightily ill-used i 'll be bind yes sir and yet you do not think _ I _ ill-used when i pay a day 's wages for no work it be only once a year sir a poor excuse for pick a man 's pocket every twenty-fifth of December but i suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier _ next _ morning the clerk promise that he would and scrooge walk out with a growl the office be close in a twinkling and the clerk with the long end of he white comforter dangle below he waist -lrb- for he boast no great-coat -rrb- go down a slide at the end of a lane of boy twenty time in honor of its be christmas eve and then run home as hard as he could pelt to play at blind-man 's - buff scrooge take he melancholy dinner in he usual melancholy tavern and have read all the newspaper and beguile the rest of the evening with he banker 's book go home to bed he live in chamber which have once belong to he deceased partner they be a gloomy suite of room in a lower pile of build up a yard the building be old enough now and dreary enough for nobody live in it but scrooge the other room be all let out as office now it be a fact that there be nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door of this house except that it be very large also that scrooge have see it night and morning during he whole residence in that place also that scrooge have as little of what be call fancy about he as any man in the city of london and yet scrooge have he key in the lock of the door see in the knocker without its undergo any intermediate process of change not a knocker but marley 's face marley 's face with a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar it be not angry or ferocious but it look at scrooge as marley use to look -- with ghostly spectacles turn up upon its ghostly forehead as scrooge look fixedly at this phenomenon it be a knocker again he say pooh pooh and close the door with a bang the sound resound through the house like thunder every room above and every cask in the wine-merchant 's cellar below appear to have a separate peal of echo of its own scrooge be not a man to be frighten by echo he fasten the door and walk across the hall and up the stair slowly too trim he candle as he go up scrooge go not care a button for its be very dark darkness be cheap and scrooge like it but before he shut he heavy door he walk through he room to see that all be right he have just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that sitting-room bedroom lumber-room all as they should be nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel -lrb- scrooge have a cold in he head -rrb- upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in he dressing-gown which be hang up in a suspicious attitude against the wall lumber-room as usual old fire-guard old shoe two fish-basket washing-stand on three leg and a poker quite satisfied he close he door and lock himself in double-locked himself in which be not he custom thus secure against surprise he take off he cravat put on he dressing-gown and slipper and he night-cap and sit down before the very low fire to take he gruel as he throw he head back in the chair he glance happen to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hang in the room and communicate for some purpose now forget with a chamber in the highest story of the building it be with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he look he see this bell begin to swing soon it ring out loudly and so do every bell in the house this be succeed by a clank noise deep down below as if some person be drag a heavy chain over the cask in the wine-merchant 's cellar then he hear the noise much louder on the floor below then come up the stair then come straight towards he door it come on through the heavy door and a spectre pass into the room before he eye and upon its come in the die flame leap up as though it cry i know he marley 's ghost the same face the very same marley in he pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boot he body be transparent so that scrooge observe he and look through he waistcoat could see the two button on he coat behind scrooge have often hear it say that marley have no bowels but he have never believe it until now no nor do he believe it even now though he look the phantom through and through and see it stand before he -- though he feel the chilling influence of its death-cold eye and notice the very texture of the fold kerchief bind about its head and chin -- he be still incredulous how now say scrooge caustic and cold as ever what do you want with I much -- marley 's voice no doubt about it who be you ask I who i _ be _ who _ be _ you then in life i be you partner jacob marley can you -- can you sit down i can do it then scrooge ask the question because he do not know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and feel that in the event of its be impossible it might involve the necessity of a embarrassing explanation but the ghost sit down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he be quite use to it you do not believe in I i do not what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of you sens i do not know why do you doubt you sens because a little thing affect they a slight disorder of the stomach make they cheat you may be a undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of a underdone potato there be more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you be scrooge be not much in the habit of crack joke nor do he feel in he heart by any means waggish then the truth be that he try to be smart as a means of distract he own attention and keep down he horror but how much greater be he horror when the phantom take off the bandage round its head as if it be too warm to wear in-door its lower jaw drop down upon its breast mercy dreadful apparition why do you trouble I why do spirit walk the earth and why do they come to I it be require of every man that the spirit within he should walk abroad among he fellow-men and travel far and wide and if that spirit go not forth in life it be condemn to do so after death i can not tell you all i would a very little more be permit to I i can not rest i can not stay i can not linger anywhere my spirit never walk beyond we counting-house -- mark I -- in life my spirit never rove beyond the narrow limit of we money-changing hole and weary journey lie before I seven year dead and travel all the time you travel fast on the wing of the wind you might have get over a great quantity of ground in seven year o blind man blind man not to know that age of incessant labor by immortal creature for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it be susceptible be all develop not to know that any christian spirit work kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life 's opportunity misuse yet i be like this man i once be like this man but you be always a good man of business jacob falter scrooge who now begin to apply this to himself business cry the ghost wring its hand again mankind be my business the common welfare be my business charity mercy forbearance benevolence be all my business the dealings of my trade be but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business scrooge be very much dismayed to hear the spectre go on at this rate and begin to quake exceedingly hear I my time be nearly go i will but do not be hard upon I do not be flowery jacob pray i be here to-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escape my fate a chance and hope of my procure ebenezer you be always a good friend to I thank ` ee you will be haunt by three spirit be that the chance and hope you mention jacob i -- i think i would rather not without they visit you can not hope to shun the path i tread expect the first to-morrow night when the bell toll one expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve have cease to vibrate look to see I no more and look that for you own sake you remember what have pass between we it walk backward from he and at every step it take the window raise itself a little so that when the apparition reach it it be wide open scrooge close the window and examine the door by which the ghost have enter it be double-locked as he have lock it with he own hand and the bolt be undisturbed scrooge try to say humbug but stop at the first syllable and be from the emotion he have undergo or the fatigue of the day or he glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose he go straight to bed without undress and fall asleep on the instant stave two the first of the three spirit when scrooge awake it be so dark that look out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque wall of he chamber until suddenly the church clock toll a deep dull hollow melancholy one light flash up in the room upon the instant and the curtain of he bed be draw aside by a strange figure -- like a child : yet not so like a child as like a old man view through some supernatural medium which give he the appearance of have recede from the view and be diminish to a child 's proportion its hair which hang about its neck and down its back be white as if with age and yet the face have not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom be on the skin it hold a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem have its dress trim with summer flower but the strangest thing about it be that from the crown of its head there spring a bright clear jet of light by which all this be visible and which be doubtless the occasion of its use in its duller moment a great extinguisher for a cap which it now hold under its arm be you the spirit sir whose come be foretell to I i be who and what be you i be the ghost of christmas past long past no you past the thing that you will see with I be shadow of the thing that have be they will have no consciousness of we scrooge then make bold to inquire what business bring he there you welfare rise and walk with I it would have be in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour be not adapt to pedestrian purpose that the bed be warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he be clad but lightly in he slipper dressing-gown and night-cap and that he have a cold upon he at that time the grasp though gentle as a woman 's hand be not to be resist he rise but find that the spirit make towards the window clasp its robe in supplication i be a mortal and liable to fall bear but a touch of my hand _ there _ say the spirit lay it upon he heart and you shall be uphold in more than this as the word be speak they pass through the wall and stand in the busy thoroughfare of a city it be make plain enough by the dress of the shop that here too it be christmas time the ghost stop at a certain warehouse door and ask scrooge if he know it know it be i apprentice here they go in at sight of a old gentleman in a welsh wig sit behind such a high desk that if he have be two inch taller he must have knock he head against the ceiling scrooge cry in great excitement : why it be old fezziwig bless he heart it be fezziwig alive again old fezziwig lay down he pen and look up at the clock which point to the hour of seven he rub he hand adjust he capacious waistcoat laugh all over himself from he shoe to he organ of benevolence and call out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there ebenezer dick a living and move picture of scrooge 's former self a young man come briskly in accompany by he fellow - ` prentice dick wilkin to be sure say scrooge to the ghost my old fellow - ` prentice bless I yes there he

come the housemaid with she cousin the baker in come the cook with she brother 's particular friend the milkman in they all come one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some push some pull in they all come anyhow and everyhow away they all go twenty couple at once hand half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stage of affectionate group old top couple always turn up in the wrong place new top couple start off again as soon as they get there all top couple at last and not a bottom one to help they when this result be bring about old fezziwig clap he hand to stop the dance cry out well do and the fiddler plunge he hot face into a pot of porter especially provide for that purpose there be more dance and there be forfeit and more dance and there be cake and there be negus and there be a great piece of cold roast and there be a great piece of cold boil and there be mince-pie and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening come after the roast and boil when the fiddler strike up sir roger de coverley then old fezziwig stand out to dance with mr fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for they three or four and twenty pair of partner people who be not to be trifle with people who _ would _ dance and have no notion of walk but if they have be twice as many -- four time -- old fezziwig would have be a match for they and so would mr fezziwig as to _ she _ she be worthy to be he partner in every sense of the term a positive light appear to issue from fezziwig 's calf they shine in every part of the dance you could not have predict at any give time what would become of 'em next and when old fezziwig and mr fezziwig have go all through the dance -- advance and retire turn you partner bow and courtesy cockscrew thread the needle and back again to you place -- fezziwig cut -- cut so deftly that he appear to wink with he leg when the clock strike eleven this domestic ball break up mr and mr fezziwig take they station one on either side the door and shake hand with every person individually as he or she go out wish he or she a merry christmas when everybody have retire but the two ` prentice they do the same to they and thus the cheerful voice die away and the lad be leave to they bed which be under a counter in the back shop a small matter say the ghost to make these silly folk so full of gratitude he have spend but a few pound of you mortal money -- three or four perhaps be that so much that he deserve this praise it be not that say scrooge heat by the remark and speak unconsciously like he former not he latter self -- it be not that spirit he have the power to render we happy or unhappy to make we service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that he power lie in word and look in thing so slight and insignificant that it be impossible to add and count 'em up : what then the happiness he give be quite as great as if it cost a fortune he feel the spirit 's glance and stop what be the matter nothing particular something i think no no i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now that be all my time grow short observe the spirit quick this be not address to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produce a immediate effect for again he see himself he be older now a man in the prime of life he be not alone but sit by the side of a fair young girl in a black dress in whose eye there be tear it matter little she say softly to scrooge 's former self to you very little another idol have displace I and if it can comfort you in time to come as i would have try to do i have no just cause to grieve what idol have displace you a golden one you fear the world too much i have see you nobler aspiration fall off one by one until the master-passion gain engross you have i not what then even if i have grow so much wiser what then i be not change towards you have i ever seek release from we engagement in word no never in what then in a changed nature in a altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end if you be free to-day to-morrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girl or choose she do i not know that you repentance and regret would surely follow i do and i release you with a full heart for the love of he you once be spirit remove I from this place i tell you these be shadow of the thing that have be say the ghost that they be what they be do not blame I remove I scrooge exclaimed i can not bear it leave I take I back haunt I no longer as he struggle with the spirit he be conscious of be exhaust and overcome by a irresistible drowsiness and further of be in he own bedroom he have barely time to reel to bed before he sink into a heavy sleep stave three the second of the three spirit scrooge awake in he own bedroom there be no doubt about that but it and he own adjoining sitting-room into which he shuffle in he slipper attract by a great light there have undergo a surprising transformation the wall and ceiling be so hung with live green that it look a perfect grove the leaf of holly mistletoe and ivy reflect back the light as if so many little mirror have be scatter there and such a mighty blaze go roar up the chimney as that petrifaction of a hearth have never know in scrooge 's time or marley 's or for many and many a winter season go heap upon the floor to form a kind of throne be turkey goose game brawn great joint of meat suck pig long wreath of sausage mince-pie plum-pudding barrel of oyster red-hot chestnut cherry-cheeked apple juicy orange luscious pear immense twelfth-cake and great bowl of punch in easy state upon this couch there sit a giant glorious to see who bear a glowing

contents all vanish instantly and they stand in the city street upon a snowy christmas morning scrooge and the ghost pass on invisible straight to scrooge 's clerk 's and on the threshold of the door

five minute after it have pass away they be ten time merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful be do with bob cratchit tell they how he have a situation in he eye for master peter which would bring in if obtain full five and sixpence weekly the two young cratchit laugh tremendously at the idea of peter 's be a man of business and peter himself look thoughtfully at the fire from between he collar as if he be deliberate what particular investment he should favor when he come into the receipt of that bewildering income martha who be a poor apprentice at a milliner 's then tell they what kind of work she have to do and how many hour she work at a stretch and how she mean to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest to-morrow be a holiday she pass at home also how she have see a countess and a lord some day before and how the lord be much about as tall as peter at which peter pull up he collar so high that you could not have see he head if you have be there all this time the chestnut and the jug go round and round and by and by they have a song about a lose child travel in the snow from tiny tim who have a plaintive little voice and sing it very well indeed there be nothing of high mark in this they be not a handsome family they be not well dress they shoe be far from be water-proof they clothes be scanty and peter might have know and very likely do the inside of a pawnbroker 's but they be happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they fade and look happier yet in the bright sprinkling of the spirit 's torch at parting scrooge have he eye upon they and especially on tiny tim until the last it be a great surprise to scrooge as this scene vanish to hear a hearty laugh it be a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognize it as he own nephew 's and to find himself in a bright dry gleam room with the spirit standing smile by he side and look at that same nephew it be a fair even-handed noble adjustment of thing that while there be infection in disease and sorrow there be nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humor when scrooge 's nephew laugh scrooge 's niece by marriage laugh as heartily as he and they assemble friend be not a bit behindhand laugh out lustily he say that christmas be a humbug as i live cry scrooge 's nephew he believe it too more shame for he fred say scrooge 's niece indignantly bless those woman they never do anything by half they be always in earnest she be very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled surprised-looking capital face a ripe little mouth that seem make to be kiss -- as no doubt it be all kind of good little dot about she chin that melt into one another when she laugh and the sunniest pair of eye you ever see in any little creature 's head altogether she be what you would have call provoke but satisfactory too o perfectly satisfactory he be a comical old fellow say scrooge 's nephew that be the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however he offence carry they own punishment and i have nothing to say against he who suffer by he ill whim himself always here he take it into he head to dislike we and he will not come and dine with we what be the consequence he do not lose much of a dinner indeed i think he lose a very good dinner interrupted scrooge 's niece everybody else say the same and they must be allow to have be competent judge because they have just have dinner and with the dessert upon the table be cluster round the fire by lamplight well i be very glad to hear it say scrooge 's nephew because i have not any great faith in these young housekeeper what do _ you _ say topper topper clearly have he eye on one of scrooge 's niece 's sister for he answer that a bachelor be a wretched outcast who have no right to express a opinion on the subject whereat scrooge 's niece 's sister -- the plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rose -- blush after tea they have some music for they be a musical family and know what they be about when they sing a glee or catch i can assure you -- especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large vein in he forehead or get red in the face over it but they do not devote the whole evening to music after a while they play at forfeit for it be good to be child sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder be a child himself there be first a game at blind-man 's - buff though and i no more believe topper be really blind than i believe he have eye in he boot because the way in which he go after that plump sister in the lace tucker be a outrage on the credulity of human nature knock down the fire-iron tumble over the chair bump up against the piano smother himself among the curtain wherever she go there go he he always know where the plump sister be he would not catch anybody else if you have fall up against he as some of they do and stand there he would have make a feint of endeavor to seize you which would have be a affront to you understanding and would instantly have sidle off in the direction of the plump sister here be a new game say scrooge one half-hour spirit only one it be a game call yes and no where scrooge 's nephew have to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answer to they question yes or no as the case be the fire of question to which he be expose elicit from he that he be think of a animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal a animal that growl and grunt sometimes and talk sometimes and live in london and walk about the street and be not make a show of and be not lead by anybody and do not live in a menagerie and be never kill in a market and be not a horse or a ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear at every new question put to he this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and be so inexpressibly tickled that he be oblige to get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister cry out -- i have find it out i know what it be fred i know what it be what be it cry fred it be you uncle scro-o-o-o-oge which it certainly be admiration be the universal sentiment though some object that the reply to be it a bear ought to have be yes uncle scrooge have imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have drunk to the unconscious company in a inaudible speech but the whole scene pass off in the breath of the last word speak by he nephew and he and the spirit be again upon they travels much they see and far they go and many home they visit but always with a happy end the spirit stand beside sick-bed and they be cheerful on foreign land and they be close at home by struggle man and they be patient in they greater hope by poverty and it be rich in alms-house hospital and jail in misery 's every refuge where vain man in he little brief authority have not make fast the door and bar the spirit out he leave he blessing and teach scrooge he precept suddenly as they stand together in a open place the bell strike twelve scrooge look about he for the ghost and see it no more as the last stroke cease to vibrate he remember the prediction of old jacob marley and lift up he eye behold a solemn phantom draped and hooded come like a mist along the ground towards he stave four the last of the spirit the phantom slowly gravely silently approach when it come near he scrooge bent down upon he knee for in the air through which this spirit move it seem to scatter gloom and mystery it be shroud in a deep black garment which conceal its head its face its form and leave nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand he know no more for the spirit neither speak nor move i be in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come ghost of the future i fear you more than any spectre i have see but as i know you purpose be to do I good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i be i be

with he money ask a red-faced gentleman i have not hear say the man with the large chin company perhaps he have not leave it to I that be all i know by by scrooge be at first inclined to be surprise that the spirit should attach importance to conversation apparently so trivial but feel assure that it must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it be likely to be it could scarcely be suppose to have any bearing on the death of jacob he old partner for that be past and this ghost 's province be the future he look about in that very place for he own image but another man stand in he accustomed corner and though the clock point to he usual time of day for be there he see no likeness of himself among the multitude that pour in through the porch it give he little surprise however for he have be revolve in he mind a change of life and he think and hope he see he new-born resolution carry out in this they leave this busy scene and go into a obscure part of the town to a low shop where iron old rag bottle bone and greasy offal be buy a gray-haired rascal of great age sit smoking he pipe scrooge and the phantom come into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop but she have scarcely enter when another woman similarly laden come in too and she be closely follow by a man in fade black after a short period of blank

work of nature in she mood of majestic playfulness seem to have give the suggestion the profile mountain be a part of cannon mountain which be one of the white mountain of new hampshire but the larger background be to be seek in the interplay of the spiritual and physical force which hawthorne have here stage in allegory the mountain be the symbol of a lofty ideal that bless those that follow its beckoning and mark the degree of failure of those that slight or ignore it _ plot _ the plan of the story be as simple and beautiful as the teaching be profound and helpful mr hawthorne write mr hawthorne say he be rather ashamed of the mechanical structure of the story the moral be so plain and manifest but what be the plain and manifest moral that the structure of the story be design to bring out one interpreter say that the last shall be first another that success be not to be measure by human standard the central thought seem to I to be larger than either of these and to include both it be rather the assimilative power of a lofty ideal and be best phrase in 2 corinthian iii 18 : but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord be change into the same image from glory to glory by set he ideal high and by look and longing ernest grow daily in spiritual stature and be save from be the victim of the popular and pass allurement of war money and politics allurement to which he neighbor succumb because they do not live in vital communion with the great stone face the poet it be true feel the appeal of the great stone face but only afar off for he life do not correspond with he thought it be one of the finest touch in the story that though ernest meet the double requirement of thought and act he still hope that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear if a man once catch up with he ideal it cease to be a ideal ernest do not think that he have attain _ character _ ernest like scrooge be a develop character he do not have as far to go as scrooge and he development be differently work but both pass from weakness to strength and from isolation to service the one through the ministry of a single profound experience the other through the constant challenge of a high ideal the other character fall below ernest because they do not relate themselves as whole-heartedly to the influence of the great stone face mr

and at last the gifted poet type of the discord between word and work all be native of the same valley of opportunity but the great stone face be the measure of they defect rather than the means of they attainment because unlike esther and scrooge and ernest they be disobedient unto the heavenly vision -rrb- one afternoon when the sun be go down a mother and she little boy sit at the door of they cottage talk about the great stone face they have but to lift they eye and there it be plainly to be see though mile away with the sunshine brighten all its feature and what be the great stone face embosome amongst a family of lofty mountain there be a valley so spacious that it contain many thousand inhabitant some of these good people dwell in log hut with the black forest all around they on the steep and difficult hillside other have they home in comfortable farm-house and cultivate the rich soil on the gentle slope or level surface of the valley other again be congregate into populous village where some wild highland rivulet tumble down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region have be catch and tame by human cunning and compel to turn the machinery of cotton-factory the inhabitant of this valley in short be numerous and of many mode of life but all of they grown people and child have a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possess the gift of distinguish this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of they neighbor the great stone face then be a work of nature in she mood of majestic playfulness form on the perpendicular side of the mountain by some immense rock which have be throw together in such a position as when view at a proper distance precisely to resemble the feature of the human countenance it seem as if a enormous giant or a titan have sculpture he own likeness on the precipice there be the broad arch of the forehead a hundred foot in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lip which if they could have speak would have roll they thunder accent from one end of the valley to the other true it be that if the spectator approach too near he lose the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rock pile in chaotic ruin one upon another retrace he step however the wondrous feature would again be see and the farther he withdraw from they the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact do they appear until as it grow dim in the distance with the cloud and glorified vapor of the mountain clustering about it the great stone face seem positively to be alive it be a happy lot for child to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before they eye for all the feature be noble and the expression be at once grand and sweet as if it be the glow of a vast warm heart that embrace all mankind in its affection and have room for more it be a education only to look at it accord to the belief of many people the valley owe much of its fertility to this benign aspect that be continually beam over it illuminate the cloud and infuse its tenderness into the sunshine as we begin with say a mother and she little boy sit at they cottage-door gazing at the great stone face and talk about it the child 's name be ernest mother say he while the titanic visage smile on he i wish that it could speak for it look so very kindly that its voice must need be pleasant if i be to see a man with such a face i should love he dearly if a old prophecy should come to pass answer he mother we may see a man some time or other with exactly such a face as that what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquire ernest pray tell I all about it so he mother tell he a story that she own mother have tell to she when she herself be younger than little ernest a story not of thing that be past but of what be yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indian who formerly inhabit this valley have hear it from they forefather to whom as they affirm it have be murmur by the mountain stream and whisper by the wind among the treetop the purport be that at some future day a child should be bear hereabouts who be destine to become the greatest and noblest personage of he time and whose countenance in manhood should bear a exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few old-fashioned people and young one likewise in the ardor of they hope still cherish a enduring faith in this old prophecy but other who have see more of the world have watch and wait till they be weary and have behold no man with such a face nor any man that prove to be much greater or nobler than he neighbor conclude it to be nothing but a idle tale at all event the great man of the prophecy have not yet appear o mother dear mother cry ernest clap he hand above he head i do hope that i shall live to see he he mother be a affectionate and thoughtful woman and feel that it be wisest not to discourage the generous hope of she little boy so she only say to he perhaps you may and ernest never forget the story that he mother tell he it be always in he mind whenever he look upon the great stone face he spend he childhood in the log-cottage where he be bear and be dutiful to he mother and helpful to she in many thing assist she much with he little hand and more with he loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grow up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sunbrown with labor in the field but with more intelligence brighten he aspect than be see in many lad who have be teach at famous school yet ernest have have no teacher save only that the great stone face become one to he when the toil of the day be over he would gaze at it for hour until he begin to imagine that those vast feature recognize he and give he a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to he own look of veneration we must not take upon we to affirm that this be a mistake although the face may have look no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret be that the boy 's tender and confide simplicity discern what other people could not see and thus the love which be mean for all become he peculiar portion about this time there go a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretell from age long ago who be to bear a resemblance to the great stone face have appear at last it seem that many year before a young man have migrate from the valley and settle at a distant seaport where after get together a little money he have set up as a shopkeeper he name -- but i could never learn whether it be he real one or a nickname that have grow out of he habit and success in life -- be gathergold be shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develop itself in what the world call luck he become a exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ship all the country of the globe appear to join hand for the mere purpose of add heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one man 's wealth the cold region of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle send he they tribute in the shape of fur hot africa sift for he the golden sand of she river and gather up the ivory tusk of she great elephant out of the forest the east come bring he the rich shawl and spice and tea and the effulgence of diamond and the gleaming purity of large pearl the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yield up she mighty whale that mr gathergold might sell they oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it be gold within he grasp it might be say of he as of mida in the fable that whatever he touch with he finger immediately glisten and grow yellow and be change at once into sterling metal or which suit he still better into pile of coin and when mr gathergold have become so very rich that it would have take he a hundred year only to count he wealth he bethink himself of he native valley and resolve to go back thither and end he day where he be bear with this purpose in view he send a skilful architect to build he such a palace as should be fit for a man of he vast wealth to live in as i have say above it have already be rumor in the valley that mr gathergold have turn out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly look for and that he visage be the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people be the more ready to believe that this must need be the fact when they behold the splendid edifice that rise as if by enchantment on the site of he father 's old weather-beaten farm-house the exterior be of marble so dazzlingly white that it seem as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler one which mr gathergold in he young play-day before he finger be gifted with the touch of transmutation have be accustom to build of snow it have a richly ornamented portico support by tall pillar beneath which be a lofty door stud with silver knob and make of a kind of variegated wood that have be bring from beyond the sea the window from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment be compose respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it be say to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody have be permit to see the interior of this palace but it be report and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever be iron or brass in other house be silver or gold in this and mr gathergold 's bedchamber especially make such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have be able to close he eye there but on the other hand mr gathergold be now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have close he eye unless where the gleam of it be certain to find its way beneath he eyelid in due time the mansion be finish next come the upholsterer with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servant the harbinger of mr gathergold who in he own majestic person be expect to arrive at sunset we friend ernest meanwhile have be deeply stir by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many age of delay be at length to be make manifest to he native valley he know boy as he be that there be a thousand way in which mr gathergold with he vast wealth might transform himself into a angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affair as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubt not that what the people say be true and that now he be to behold the living likeness of those wondrous feature on the mountain-side while the boy be still gaze up the valley and fancy as he always do that the great stone face return he gaze and look kindly at he the rumble of wheel be hear approach swiftly along the wind road here he come cry a group of people who be assemble to witness the arrival here come the great mr gathergold a carriage draw by four horse dash round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appear the physiognomy of a little old man with a skin as yellow as if he own midas-hand have transmute it he have a low forehead small sharp eye pucker about with innumerable wrinkle and very thin lip which he make still thinner by press they forcibly together the very image of the great stone face shout the people sure enough the old prophecy be true and here we have the great man come at last and what greatly perplex ernest they seem actually to believe that here be the likeness which they speak of by the roadside there chance to be a old beggar-woman and two little beggar-children straggler from some far-off region who as the carriage roll onward hold out they hand and lift up they doleful voice most piteously beseech charity a yellow claw -- the very same that have claw together so much wealth -- poke itself out of the coach-window and dropt some copper coin upon the ground so that though the great man 's name seem to have be gathergold he might just as suitably have be nickname scattercopper still nevertheless with a earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellow -- he be the very image of the great stone face but ernest turn sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gaze up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeam he could still distinguish those glorious feature which have impress themselves into he soul they aspect cheer he what do the benign lip seem to say he will come fear not ernest the man will come the year go on and ernest cease to be a boy he have grow to be a young man now he attract little notice from the other inhabitant of the valley for they see nothing remarkable in he way of life save that when the labor of the day be over he still love to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face accord to they idea of the matter it be a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest be industrious kind and neighborly and neglect no duty for the sake of indulge this idle habit they know not that the great stone face have become a teacher to he and that the sentiment which be express in it would enlarge the young man 's heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathy than other heart they know not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learn from book and a better life than could be mould on the defaced example of other human life neither do ernest know that the thought and affection which come to he so naturally in the field and at the fireside and wherever he commune with himself be of a higher tone than those which all man share with he a simple soul -- simple as when he mother first teach he the old prophecy -- he behold the marvellous feature beam adown the valley and still wonder that they human counterpart be so long in make he appearance by this time poor mr gathergold be dead and bury and the oddest part of the matter be that he wealth which be the body and spirit of he existence have disappear before he death leave nothing of he but a living skeleton cover over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of he gold it have be very generally concede that there be no such striking resemblance after all betwixt the ignoble feature of the ruin merchant and that majestic face upon the mountain-side so the people cease to honor he during he lifetime and quietly consign he to forgetfulness after he decease once in a while it be true he memory be bring up in connection with the magnificent palace which he have build and which have long ago be turn into a hotel for the accommodation of stranger multitude of whom come every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold be discredit and throw into the shade the man of prophecy be yet to come it so happen that a native-born son of the valley many year before have enlist as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting have now become a illustrious commander whatever he may be call in history he be know in camp and on the battle-field under the nickname of old blood-and-thunder this war-worn veteran be now infirm with age and wound and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that have so long be ring in he ear have lately signify a purpose of return to he native valley hope to find repose where he remember to have leave it the inhabitant he old neighbor and they grown-up child be resolve to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it be affirm that now at last the likeness of the great stone face have actually appear a aid-de-camp of old blood-and-thunder travel through the valley be say to have be strike with the resemblance moreover the schoolmate and early acquaintance of the general be ready to testify on oath that to the best of they recollection the aforesaid general have be exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only that the idea have never occur to they at that period great therefore be the excitement throughout the valley and many people who have never once think of glance at the great stone face for year before now spend they time in gaze at it for the sake of know exactly how general blood-and-thunder look on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley leave they work and proceed to the spot where the sylvan banquet be prepare as he approach the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast be hear beseech a blessing on the good thing set before they and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they be assemble the table be arrange in a clear space of the wood shut in by the surround tree except where a vista open eastward and afford a distant view of the great stone face over the general 's chair which be a relic from the home of washington there be a arch of verdant bough with the laurel profusely intermix and surmount by he country 's banner beneath which he have win he victory we friend ernest raise himself on he tiptoe in hope to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there be a mighty crowd about the table anxious to hear the toast and speech and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company do duty as a guard prick ruthlessly with they bayonet at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of a unobtrusive character be thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old blood-and-thunder 's physiognomy than if it have be still blaze on the battle-field to console himself he turn towards the great stone face which like a faithful and long-remembered friend look back and smile upon he through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remark of various individual who be compare the feature of the hero with the face on the distant mountain-side ti the same face to a hair cry one man cut a caper for joy wonderfully like that be a fact respond another like why i call it old blood-and-thunder himself in a monstrous looking-glass cry a third and why not he be the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt and then all three of the speaker give a great shout which communicate electricity to the crowd and call forth a roar from a thousand voice that go reverberate for mile among the mountain until you might have suppose that the great stone face have pour its thunder-breath into the cry all these comment and this vast enthusiasm serve the more to interest we friend nor do he think of question that now at length the mountain-visage have find its human counterpart it be true ernest have imagine that this long-looked-for personage would appear in the character of a man of peace utter wisdom and do good and make people happy but take a habitual breadth of view with all he simplicity he contend that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effect even by a warrior and a bloody sword should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matter so the general the general be now the cry hush silence old blood-and-thunder 's go to make a speech even so for the cloth be remove the general 's health have be drunk amid shout of applause and he now stand upon he foot to thank the company ernest see he there he be over the shoulder of the crowd from the two glitter epaulet and embroidered collar upward beneath the arch of green bough with interwined laurel and the banner droop as if to shade he brow and there too visible in the same glance through the vista of the forest appear the great stone face and be there indeed such a resemblance as the crowd have testify alas ernest could not recognize it he behold a war-worn and weather-beaten countenance full of energy and expressive of a iron will but the gentle wisdom the deep broad tender sympathy be altogether want in old blood-and-thunder 's visage and even if the great stone face have assume he look of stern command the milder trait would still have temper it this be not the man of prophecy sigh ernest to himself as he make he way out of the throng and must the world wait longer yet the mist have congregate about the distant mountain-side and there be see the grand and awful feature of the great stone face awful but benignant as if a mighty angel be sit among the hill and enrobe himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple as he look ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beam over the whole visage with a radiance still brighten although without motion of the lip it be probably the effect of the western sunshine melting through the thinly diffused vapor that have sweep between he and the object that he gaze at but -- as it always do -- the aspect of he marvellous friend make ernest as hopeful as if he have never hope in vain fear not ernest say he heart even as if the great face be whisper he -- fear not ernest he will come more year speed swiftly and tranquilly away ernest still dwell in he native valley and be now a man of middle age by imperceptible degree he have become know among the people now as heretofore he labor for he bread and be the same simple-hearted man that he have always be but he have think and feel so much he have give so many of the best hour of he life to unworldly hope for some great good to mankind that it seem as though he have be talk with the angel and have imbibe a portion of they wisdom unaware it be visible in the calm and well-considered beneficence of he daily life the quiet stream of which have make a wide green margin all along its course not a day pass by that the world be not the better because this man humble as he be have live he never step aside from he own path yet would always reach a blessing to he neighbor almost involuntarily too he have become a preacher the pure and high simplicity of he thought which as one of its manifestation take shape in the good deed that drop silently from he hand flow also forth in speech he utter truth that work upon and mould the life of those who hear he he auditor it may be never suspect that ernest they own neighbor and familiar friend be more than a ordinary man least of all do ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet come thought out of he mouth that no other human lip have speak when the people 's mind have have a little time to cool they be ready enough to acknowledge they mistake in imagine a similarity between general blood-and-thunder 's truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountain-side but now again there be report and many paragraph in the newspaper affirm that the likeness of the great stone face have appear upon the broad shoulder of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old blood-and-thunder be a native of the valley but have leave it in he early day and take up the trade of law and politics instead of the rich man 's wealth and the warrior 's sword he have but a tongue and it be mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent be he that whatever he might choose to say he auditor have no choice but to believe he wrong look like right and right like wrong for when it please he he could make a kind of illuminated fog with he mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it he tongue indeed be a magic instrument : sometimes it rumble like the thunder sometimes it warble like the sweetest music it be the blast of war -- the song of peace and it seem to have a heart in it when there be no such matter in good truth he be a wondrous man and when he tongue have acquire he all other imaginable success -- when it have be hear in hall of state and in the court of prince and potentate -- after it have make he know all over the world even as a voice cry from shore to shore -- it finally persuade he countryman to select he for the presidency before this time -- indeed as soon as he begin to grow celebrated -- he admirer have find out the resemblance between he and the great stone face and so much be they strike by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman be know by the name of old stony phiz the phrase be consider as give a highly favorable aspect to he political prospects for as be likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever become president without take a name other than he own while he friend be do they best to make he president old stony phiz as he be call set out on a visit to the valley where he be bear of course he have no other object than to shake hand with he fellow-citizen and neither think nor care about any effect which he progress through the country might have upon the election magnificent preparation be make to receive the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horseman set forth to meet he at the boundary line of the state and all the people leave they business and gather along the wayside to see he pass among these be ernest though more than once disappoint as we have see he have such a hopeful and confide nature that he be always ready to believe in whatever seem beautiful and good he keep he heart continually open and thus be sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he go forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face the cavalcade come prance along the road with a great clattering of hoof and a mighty cloud of dust which rise up so dense and high that the visage of the mountain-side be completely hide from ernest 's eye all the great man of the neighborhood be there on horseback : militia officer in uniform the member of congress the sheriff of the county the editor of newspaper and many a farmer too have mount he patient steed with he Sunday coat upon he back it really be a very brilliant spectacle especially as there be numerous banner flaunt over the cavalcade on some of which be gorgeous portrait of the illustrious statesman and the great stone face smile familiarly at one another like two brother if the picture be to be trust the mutual resemblance it must be confess be marvellous we must not forget to mention that there be a band of music which make the echo of the mountain ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strain so that airy and soul-thrilling melody break out among all the height and hollow as if every nook of he native valley have find a voice to welcome the distinguished guest but the grandest effect be when the far-off mountain precipice fling back the music for then the great stone face itself seem to be swell the triumphant chorus in acknowledgment that at length the man of prophecy be come all this while the people be throw up they hat and shout with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of ernest kindle up and he likewise throw up he hat and shout as loudly as the loudest huzza for the great man huzza for old stony phiz but as yet he have not see he here he be now cry those who stand near ernest there there look at old stony phiz and then at the old man of the mountain and see if they be not as like as two twin-brother in the midst of all this gallant array come a open barouche draw by four white horse and in the barouche with he massive head uncovered sit the illustrious statesman old stony phiz himself confess it say one of ernest 's neighbor to he the great stone face have meet its match at last now it must be own that at he first glimpse of the countenance which be bow and smile from the barouche ernest do fancy that there be a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountain-side the brow with its massive depths and loftiness and all the other feature indeed be boldly and strongly hew as if in emulation of a more than heroic of a titanic model but the sublimity and stateliness the grand expression of a divine sympathy that illuminate the mountain visage and etherealize its ponderous granite substance into spirit might here be seek in vain something have be originally leave out or have depart and therefore the marvellously gifted statesman have always a weary gloom in the deep cavern of he eye as of a child that have outgrow its plaything or a man of mighty faculty and little aim whose life with all its high performance be vague and empty because no high purpose have endow it with reality still ernest 's neighbor be thrust he elbow into he side and press he for a answer confess confess be not he the very picture of you old man of the mountain no say ernest bluntly i see little or no likeness then so much the worse for the great stone face answer he neighbor and again he set up a shout for old stony phiz but ernest turn away melancholy and almost despondent for this be the saddest of he disappointment to behold a man who might have fulfil the prophecy and have not will to do so meantime the cavalcade the banner the music and the barouche sweep past he with the vociferous crowd in the rear leave the dust to settle down and the great stone face to be reveal again with the grandeur that it have wear for untold century lo here i be ernest the benign lip seem to say i have wait longer than thou and be not yet weary fear not the man will come the year hurry onward tread in they haste on one another 's heel and now they begin to bring white hair and scatter they over the head of ernest they make reverend wrinkle across he forehead and furrow in he cheek he be a aged man but not in vain have he grow old more than the white hair on he head be the sage thought in he mind he wrinkle and furrow be inscription that time have grave and in which he have write legend of wisdom that have be test by the tenor of a life and ernest have cease to be obscure unsought for undesired have come the fame which so many seek and make he know in the great world beyond the limit of the valley in which he have dwell so quietly college professor and even the active man of city come from far to see and converse with ernest for the report have go abroad that this simple husbandman have idea unlike those of other man not gain from book but of a higher tone -- a tranquil and familiar majesty as if he have be talk with the angel as he daily friend whether it be sage statesman or philanthropist ernest receive these visitor with the gentle sincerity that have characterize he from boyhood and speak freely with they of whatever come uppermost or lay deepest in he heart or they own while they talk together he face would kindle unawares and shine upon they as with a mild evening light pensive with the fulness of such discourse he guest take leave and go they way and pass up the valley pause to look at the great stone face imagine that they have see its likeness in a human countenance but could not remember where while ernest have be grow up and grow old a bountiful providence have grant a new poet to this earth he likewise be a native of the valley but have spend the greater part of he life at a distance from that romantic region pour out he sweet music amid the bustle and din of city often however do the mountain which have be familiar to he in he childhood lift they snowy peak into the clear atmosphere of he poetry neither be the great stone face forget for the poet have celebrate it in a ode which be grand enough to have be utter by its own majestic lip this man of genius we may say have come down from heaven with wonderful endowment if he sing of a mountain the eye of all mankind behold a mightier grandeur repose on its breast or soar to its summit than have before be see there if he theme be a lovely lake a celestial smile have now be throw over it to gleam forever on its surface if it be the vast old sea even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seem to swell the higher as if move by the emotion of the song thus the world assume another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet bless it with he happy eye the creator have bestow he as the last best touch to he own handiwork creation be not finish till the poet come to interpret and so complete it the effect be no less high and beautiful when he human brethren be the subject of he verse the man or woman sordid with the common dust of life who cross he daily path and the little child who play in it be glorified if he behold they in he mood of poetic faith he show the golden link of the great chain that intertwine they with a angelic kindred he bring out the hidden trait of a celestial birth that make they worthy of such kin some indeed there be who think to show the soundness of they judgment by affirm that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world exist only in the poet 's fancy let such man speak for themselves who undoubtedly appear to have be spawn forth by nature with a contemptuous bitterness she have plaster they up out of she refuse stuff after all the swine be make as respects all thing else the poet 's ideal be the truest truth the song of this poet find they way to ernest he read they after he customary toil seat on the bench before he cottage-door where for such a length of time he have fill he repose with think by gaze at the great stone face and now as he read stanza that cause the soul to thrill within he he lift he eye to the vast countenance beam on he so benignantly o majestic friend he murmur address the great stone face be not this man worthy to resemble thee the face seem to smile but answer not a word now it happen that the poet though he dwell so far away have not only hear of ernest but have meditate much upon he character until he deem nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom walk hand in hand with the noble simplicity of he life one summer morning therefore he take passage by the railroad and in the decline of the afternoon alight from the car at no great distance from ernest 's cottage the great hotel which have formerly be the palace of mr gathergold be close at hand but the poet with he carpet-bag on he arm inquire at once where ernest dwelt and be resolve to be accept as he guest approach the door he there find the good old man hold a volume in he hand which alternately he read and then with a finger between the leaf look lovingly at the great stone face good evening say the poet can you give a traveller a night 's lodging willingly answer ernest and then he add smile methink i never see the great stone face look so hospitably at a stranger the poet sit down on the bench beside he and he and ernest talk together often have the poet hold intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like ernest whose thought and feeling gush up with such a natural freedom and who make great truth so familiar by he simple utterance of they angel as have be so often say seem to have work with he at he labor in the field angel seem to have sit with he by the fireside and dwelling with angel as friend with friend he have imbibe the sublimity of they idea and imbue it with the sweet and lowly charm of household word so think the poet and ernest on the other hand be move and agitate by the living image which the poet fling out of he mind and which people all the air about the cottage-door with shape of beauty both gay and pensive the sympathy of these two man instruct they with a profounder sense than either could have attain alone they mind accord into one strain and make delightful music which neither of they could have claim as all he own nor distinguished he own share from the other 's they lead one another as it be into a high pavilion of they thought so remote and hitherto so dim that they have never enter it before and so beautiful that they desire to be there always as ernest listen to the poet he imagine that the great stone face be bend forward to listen too he gaze earnestly into the poet 's glowing eye who be you my strangely gifted guest he say the poet lay he finger on the volume that ernest have be read you have read these poem say he you know I then -- for i write they again and still more earnestly than before ernest examine the poet 's feature then turn towards the great stone face then back with a uncertain aspect to he guest but he countenance fall he shake he head and sigh wherefore be you sad inquire the poet because reply ernest all through life i have await the fulfilment of a prophecy and when i read these poem i hope that it might be fulfil in you you hope answer the poet faintly smile to find in I the likeness of the great stone face and you be disappoint as formerly with mr gathergold and old blood-and-thunder and old stony phiz yes ernest it be my doom you must add my name to the illustrious three and record another failure of you hope for -- in shame and sadness do i speak it ernest -- i be not worthy to be typify by yonder benign and majestic image and why ask ernest he point to the volume be not those thought divine they have a strain of the divinity reply the poet you can hear in they the far-off echo of a heavenly song but my life dear ernest have not correspond with my thought i have have grand dream but they have be only dream because i have live -- and that too by my own choice -- among poor and mean reality sometimes even -- shall i dare to say it -- i lack faith in the grandeur the beauty and the goodness which my own work be say to have make more evident in nature and in human life why then pure seeker of the good and true shouldst thou hope to find I in yonder image of the divine the poet speak sadly and he eye be dim with tear so likewise be those of ernest at the hour of sunset as have long be he frequent custom ernest be to discourse to a assemblage of the neighbor inhabitant in the open air he and the poet arm in arm still talk together as they go along proceed to the spot it be a small nook among the hill with a gray precipice behind the stern front of which be relieve by the pleasant foliage of many creep plant that make a tapestry for the naked rock by hang they festoon from all its rugged angle at a small elevation above the ground set in a rich framework of verdure there appear a niche spacious enough to admit a human figure with freedom for such gesture as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine emotion into this natural pulpit ernest ascend and throw a look of familiar kindness around upon he audience they stand or sit or recline upon the grass as seem good to each with the depart sunshine fall obliquely over they and mingle its subdue cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient tree beneath and amid the bough of which the golden ray be constrain to pass in another direction be see the great stone face with the same cheer combine with the same solemnity in its benignant aspect ernest begin to speak give to the people of what be in he heart and mind he word have power because they accord with he thought and he thought have reality and depth because they harmonize with the life which he have always live it be not mere breath that this preacher utter they be the word of life because a life of good deed and holy love be melt into they pearl pure and rich have be dissolve into this precious draught the poet as he listen feel that the be and character of ernest be a nobler strain of poetry than he have ever write he eye glisten with tear he gaze reverentially at the venerable man and say within himself that never be there a aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild sweet thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffuse about it at a distance but distinctly to be see high up in the golden light of the setting sun appear the great stone face with hoary mist around it like the white hair around the brow of ernest its look of grand beneficence seem to embrace the world at that moment in sympathy with a thought which he be about to utter the face of ernest assume a grandeur of expression so imbue with benevolence that the poet by a irresistible impulse throw he arm aloft and shout -- behold

and perilous way she sing bit of old song and psalm stop suddenly mingle the psalm of david and the diviner word of he son and lord with homely odds and end and scrap of ballad nothing more touching or in a sense more strangely beautiful do i ever witness she tremulous rapid affectionate eager scotch voice -- the swift aimless bewildered mind the baffled utterance the bright and perilous eye some wild word some household care something for jame the name of the dead rab call rapidly and in a fremyt voice and he start up surprised and slink off as if he be to blame somehow or have be dream he hear many eager question and beseeching which jame and i could make nothing of and on which she seem to set she all and then sink back ununderstood it be very sad but better than many thing that be not call sad jame hover about put out and miserable but active and exact as ever read to she when there be a lull short bit from the psalm prose and metre chant the latter in he own rude and serious

county californium the time and place be those that bret harte have make peculiarly he own the austerity and wildness of the scenery seem somehow to favor the intimate revelation of character that the story display there be no intervention of city crop fashion or convention between the different member of the character group or between the group as a whole and the reader all be bare like a white mountain peak notice also how the background of a common peril draw the character together and bring out at last the best in each _ plot _ the story set forth and interpret a dramatic situation the plot be stage so as to answer the question do not the people whom society regard as outcast have yet some redeeming virtue notice especially how a sense of common fellowship be develop in these outcast first they be subject to a common humiliation in be drive from poker flat by person whom the outcast consider no whit better than themselves next they be expose to a common danger a danger that lead the stronger to care instinctively for the weaker and the weaker to recognize that it be nobler to give than to receive at last in the unexpected entrance of the innocent tom simson and the guileless piney wood the outcast find a common challenge to the native goodness that have long lain dormant within they innocence and guilelessness may be laugh at as they be here but they appeal be often stronger than the appeal of disciplined virtue or of self-conscious superiority when bret harte be charge with confuse the boundary line of vice and virtue he reply that he plot conform to the rule lay down by a great poet who create the parable of the prodigal son and the good samaritan _ character _ oakhurst who be always call mr oakhurst be of course the dominant character the story begin with he and end with he he be the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcast of poker flat -- strong while there be anything to be do weak even to suicide when he have only to wait for the inevitable end he be a brave desperate solitary man whose thought and speech and action however be always those of the professional gambler bret harte who have put he into several story say of he in another place : go where he would and with whom he be always a notable man in ten thousand the admiration that we yield to such a man though it be only a qualify admiration be doubtless the admiration of power which we can not help think might be use beneficently if it could only be harness to a noble cause but if oakhurst be the dominant character piney wood be i think the central character she be central in this story just as little aglaïa be central in tennyson 's princess or eppie in george eliot 's sila marner or the baby offspring of cherokee sal in the luck of roar camp bret harte have just write the last-named story when he begin the composition of the outcast of poker flat the same great theme the radiate and redeem power of innocence and purity be carry over from the first story to the second the ministry of the baby and the ministry of the fifteen-year-old bride be the same in both like the great stone face in hawthorne 's story or like little pippa in browning 's poem they awaken the better nature of those about they they restore hope that have become but memory and memory that have almost cease to be hope -rrb- as mr john oakhurst gambler step into the main street of poker flat on the morning of the twenty-third of November 1850 he be conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the precede night two or three man converse earnestly together cease as he approach and exchange significant glance there be a sabbath lull in the air which in a settlement unused to sabbath influence look ominous mr oakhurst 's calm handsome face betray small concern in these indication whether he be conscious of any predispose cause be another question i reckon they be after somebody he reflect likely it be I he return to he pocket the handkerchief with which he have be whipping away the red dust of poker flat from he neat boot and quietly discharge he mind of any further conjecture in point of fact poker flat be after somebody it have lately suffer the loss of several thousand dollar two valuable horse and a prominent citizen it be experience a spasm of virtuous reaction quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the act that have provoke it a secret committee have determine to rid the town of all improper person this be do permanently in regard of two man who be then hang from the bough of a sycamore in the gulch and temporarily in the banishment of certain other objectionable character i regret to say that some of these be lady it be but due to the sex however to state that they impropriety be professional and it be only in such easily established standard of evil that poker flat venture to sit in judgment mr oakhurst be right in suppose that he be include in this category a few of the committee have urge hang he as a possible example and a sure method of reimburse themselves from he pocket of the sum he have win from they it be agin justice say jim wheeler to let this yer young man from roar camp -- a entire stranger -- carry away we money but a crude sentiment of equity residing in the breast of those who have be fortunate enough to win from mr oakhurst overrule this narrower local prejudice mr oakhurst receive he sentence with philosophic calmness none the less coolly that he be aware of the hesitation of he judge he be too much of a gambler not to accept fate with he life be at best a uncertain game and he recognize the usual percentage in favor of the dealer a body of armed man accompany the deport wickedness of poker flat to the outskirts of the settlement besides mr oakhurst who be know to be a coolly desperate man and for whose intimidation the armed escort be intend the expatriate party consist of a young woman familiarly know as the duchess another who have win the title of mother shipton and uncle billy a suspect sluice-robber and confirm drunkard the cavalcade provoke no comment from the spectator nor be any word utter by the escort only when the gulch which mark the uttermost limit of poker flat be reach the leader speak briefly and to the point the exile be forbid to return at the peril of they life as the escort disappear they pent-up feeling find vent in a few hysterical tear from the duchess some bad language from mother shipton and a parthian volley of expletive from uncle billy the philosophic oakhurst alone remain silent he listen calmly to mother shipton 's desire to cut somebody 's heart out to the repeat statement of the duchess that she would die in the road and to the alarming oath that seem to be bump out of uncle billy as he ride forward with the easy good-humor characteristic of he class he insist upon exchange he own riding-horse five spot for the sorry mule which the duchess ride but even this act do not draw the party into any closer sympathy the young woman readjust she somewhat draggled plume with a feeble fade coquetry mother shipton eye the possessor of five spot with malevolence and uncle billy include the whole party in one sweeping anathema the road to sandy bar -- a camp that not have as yet experience the regenerate influence of poker flat consequently seem to offer some invitation to the emigrant -- lay over a steep mountain range it be distant a day 's severe travel in that advanced season the party soon pass out of the moist temperate region of the foot-hill into the dry cold brace air of the sierra the trail be narrow and difficult at noon the duchess roll out of she saddle upon the ground declare she intention of go no farther and the party halt the spot be singularly wild and impressive a wooded amphitheatre surround on three side by precipitous cliff of naked granite slope gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlook the valley it be undoubtedly the most suitable spot for a camp have camping be advisable but mr oakhurst know that scarcely half the journey to sandy bar be accomplish and the party be not equip or provision for delay this fact he point out to he companion curtly with a philosophic commentary on the folly of throw up they hand before the game be play out but they be furnish with liquor which in this emergency stand they in place of food fuel rest and prescience in spite of he remonstrance it be not long before they be more or less under its influence uncle billy pass rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor the duchess become maudlin and mother shipton snore mr oakhurst alone remain erect lean against a rock calmly survey they mr oakhurst do not drink it interfere with a profession which require coolness impassiveness and presence of mind and in he own language he could not afford it as he gaze at he recumbent fellow-exile the loneliness begotten of he pariah-trade he habit of life he very vice for the first time seriously oppress he he bestir himself in dust he black clothes wash he hand and face and other act characteristic of he studiously neat habit and for a moment forget he annoyance the thought of desert he weaker and more pitiable companion never perhaps occur to he yet he could not help feel the want of that excitement which singularly enough be most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he be notorious he look at the gloomy wall that rise a thousand foot sheer above the circle pine around he at the sky ominously cloud at the valley below already deepen into shadow and do so suddenly he hear he own name call a horseman slowly ascend the trail in the fresh open face of the new-comer mr oakhurst recognize tom simson otherwise know as the innocent of sandy bar he have meet he some month before over a little game and have with perfect equanimity win the entire fortune -- amount to some forty dollar -- of that guileless youth after the game be finish mr oakhurst draw the youthful speculator behind the door and thus address he : tommy you be a good little man but you can not gamble worth a cent do not try it over again he then hand he he money back push he gently from the room and so make a devoted slave of tom simson there be a remembrance of this in he boyish and enthusiastic greet of mr oakhurst he have start he say to go to poker flat to seek he fortune alone no not exactly alone in fact -lrb- a giggle -rrb- he have run away with piney wood do not mr oakhurst remember piney she that use to wait on the table at the temperance house they have be engage a long time but old jake wood have object and so they have run away and be go to poker flat to be marry and here they be and they be tire out and how lucky it be they have find a place to camp and company all this the innocent deliver rapidly while piney a stout comely damsel of fifteen emerge from behind the pine-tree where she have be blush unseen and ride to the side of she lover mr oakhurst seldom trouble himself with sentiment still less with propriety but he have a vague idea that the situation be not fortunate he retain however he presence of mind sufficiently to kick uncle billy who be about to say something and uncle billy be sober enough to recognize in mr oakhurst 's kick a superior power that would not bear trifling he then endeavor to dissuade tom simson from delay further but in vain he even point out the fact that there be no provision nor means of make a camp but unluckily the innocent meet this objection by assure the party that he be provide with a extra mule load with provision and by the discovery of a rude attempt at a log-house near the trail piney can stay with mr oakhurst say the innocent point to the duchess and i can shift for myself nothing but mr oakhurst 's admonish foot save uncle billy from burst into a roar of laughter as it be he feel compel to retire up the cañon until he could recover he gravity there he confide the joke to the tall pine-tree with many slap of he leg contortion of he face and the usual profanity but when he return to the party he find they seat by a fire -- for the air have grow strangely chill and the sky overcast -- in apparently amicable conversation piney be actually talk in a impulsive girlish fashion to the duchess who be listen with a interest and animation she have not show for many day the innocent be hold forth apparently with equal effect to mr oakhurst and mother shipton who be actually relax into amiability be this yer a d -- d picnic say uncle billy with inward scorn as he survey the sylvan group the glance firelight and the tethered animal in the foreground suddenly a idea mingle with the alcoholic fume that disturbed he brain it be apparently of a jocular nature for he feel impel to slap he leg again and cram he fist into he mouth as the shadow creep slowly up the mountain a slight breeze rock the top of the pine-tree and moan through they long and gloomy aisle the ruin cabin patch and cover with pine-bough be set apart for the lady as the lover part they unaffectedly exchange a kiss so honest and sincere that it might have be hear above the sway pine the frail duchess and the malevolent mother shipton be probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity and so turn without a word to the hut the fire be replenish the man lay down before the door and in a few minute be asleep mr oakhurst be a light sleeper toward morning he awake benumbed and cold as he stir the die fire the wind which be now blow strongly bring to he cheek that which cause the blood to leave it -- snow he start to he foot with the intention of awaken the sleeper for there be no time to lose but turn to where uncle billy have be lie he find he go a suspicion leap to he brain and a curse to he lip he run to the spot where the mule have be tethered they be no longer there the track be already rapidly disappear in the snow the momentary excitement bring mr oakhurst back to the fire with he usual calm he do not waken the sleeper the innocent slumber peacefully with a smile on he good-humored freckled face the virgin piney sleep beside she frailer sister as sweetly as though attend by celestial guardian and mr oakhurst draw he blanket over he shoulder stroke he mustach and wait for the dawn it come slowly in a whirling mist of snow-flake that dazzle and confuse the eye what could be see of the landscape appear magically change he look over the valley and summon up the present and future in two word -- snow in a careful inventory of the provision which fortunately for the party have be store within the hut and so escape the felonious finger of uncle billy disclose the fact that with care and prudence they might last ten day longer that be say mr oakhurst _ sotto voce _ to the innocent if you be willing to board we if you be not -- and perhaps you would better not -- you can wait till uncle billy get back with provision for some occult reason mr oakhurst could not bring himself to disclose uncle billy 's rascality and so offer the hypothesis that he have wander from the camp and have accidentally stampede the animal he drop a warn to the duchess and mother shipton who of course know the fact of they associate 's defection they 'll find out the truth about we _ all _ when they find out anything he add significantly and there be no good frightening they now tom simson not only put all he worldly store at the disposal of mr oakhurst but seem to enjoy the prospect of they enforce seclusion we 'll have a good camp for a week and then the snow 'll melt and we 'll all go back together the cheerful gayety of the young man and mr oakhurst 's calm infected the other the innocent with the aid of pine-bough extemporize a thatch for the roofless cabin and the duchess direct piney in the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and tact that open the blue eye of that provincial maiden to they fullest extent i reckon now you be use to fine thing at poker flat say piney the duchess turn away sharply to conceal something that redden she cheek through its professional tint and mother shipton request piney not to chatter but when mr oakhurst return from a weary search for the trail he hear the sound of happy laughter echo from the rock he stop in some alarm and he thought first naturally revert to the whiskey which he have prudently _ cachéd _ and yet it do not somehow sound like whiskey say the gambler it be not until he catch sight of the blaze fire through the still blind storm and the group around it that he settle to the conviction that it be square fun whether mr oakhurst have _ cachéd _ he card with the whiskey as something debar the free access of the community i can not say it be certain that in mother shipton 's word he do not say card once during that evening haply the time be beguile by a accordion produce somewhat ostentatiously by tom simson from he pack notwithstanding some difficulty attend the manipulation of he instrument piney wood manage to pluck several reluctant melody from its key to a accompaniment by the innocent on a pair of bone castanets but the crowning festivity of the evening be reach in a rude camp-meeting hymn which the lover join hand sing with great earnestness and vociferation i fear that a certain defiant tone and covenanter 's swing to its chorus rather than any devotional quality cause it speedily to infect the other who at last join in the refrain : -- i be proud to live in the service of the lord and i be bind to die in he army the pine rock the storm eddy and whirl above the miserable group and the flame of they altar leap heavenward as if in token of the vow at midnight the storm abate the rolling cloud part and the star glitter keenly above the sleep camp mr oakhurst whose professional habit have enable he to live on the smallest possible amount of sleep in divide the watch with tom simson somehow manage to take upon himself the greater part of that duty he excuse himself to the innocent by say that he have often be a week without sleep do what ask tom poker reply oakhurst sententiously when a man get a streak of luck -- nigger-luck -- he do not get tire the luck give in first luck continue the gambler reflectively be a mighty queer thing all you know about it for certain be that it be bind to change and it be find out when it be go to change that make you we have have a streak of bad luck since we leave poker flat -- you come along and slap you get into it too if you can hold you card right along you be all right for add the gambler with cheerful irrelevance -- i be proud to live in the service of the lord and i be bind to die in he army the third day come and the sun look through the white-curtained valley see the outcast divide they slowly decrease store of provision for the morning meal it be one of the peculiarity of that mountain climate that its ray diffuse a kindly warmth over the wintry landscape as if in regretful commiseration of the past but it reveal drift on drift of snow pile high around the hut -- a hopeless uncharted trackless sea of white lie below the rocky shore to which the castaway still cling through the marvellously clear air the smoke of the pastoral village of poker flat rise mile away mother shipton see it and from a remote pinnacle of she rocky fastness hurl in that direction a final malediction it be she last vituperative attempt and perhaps for that reason be invest with a certain degree of sublimity it do she good she privately inform the duchess just you go out there and cuss and see she then set herself to the task of amusing the child as she and the duchess be please to call piney piney be no chicken but it be a soothing and original theory of the pair thus to account for the fact that she do not swear and be not improper when night creep up again through the gorge the reedy note of the accordion rise and fall in fitful spasm and long-drawn gasp by the flicker camp-fire but music fail to fill entirely the ache void leave by insufficient food and a new diversion be propose by piney -- story-telling neither mr oakhurst nor he female companion care to relate they personal experience this plan would have fail too but for the innocent some month before he have chance upon a stray copy of mr pope 's ingenious translation of the iliad he now propose to narrate the principal incident of that poem -- have thoroughly master the argument and fairly forget the word -- in the current vernacular of sandy bar and so for the rest of that night the homeric demigod again walk the earth trojan bully and wily greek wrestle in the wind and the great pine in the cañon seem to bow to the wrath of the son of peleus mr oakhurst listen with quiet satisfaction most especially be he interested in the fate of ash-heel as the innocent persist in denominate the swift-footed achille so with small food and much of homer and the accordion a week pass over the head of the outcast the sun again forsake they and again from leaden sky the snow-flake be sift over the land day by day closer around they draw the snowy circle until at last they look from they prison over drift wall of dazzling white that tower twenty foot above they head it become more and more difficult to replenish they fire even from the fall tree beside they now half hide in the drift and yet no one complain the lover turn from the dreary prospect and look into each other 's eye and be happy mr oakhurst settle himself coolly to the losing game before he the duchess more cheerful than she have be assume the care of piney only mother shipton -- once the strongest of the party -- seem to sicken and fade at midnight on the tenth day she call oakhurst to she side i be go she say in a voice of querulous weakness but do not say anything about it do not waken the kid take the bundle from under my head and open it mr oakhurst do so it contain mother shipton 's ration for the last week untouched give 'em to the child she say point to the sleep piney you have starve yourself say the gambler that be what they call it say the woman querulously as she lay down again and turn she face to the wall pass quietly away the accordion and the bone be put aside that day and homer be forget when the body of mother shipton have be commit to the snow mr oakhurst take the innocent aside and show he a pair of snow-shoe which he have fashion from the old pack-saddle there be one chance in a hundred to save she yet he say point to piney but it be there he add point towards poker flat if you can reach there in two day she be safe and you ask tom simson i 'll stay here be the curt reply the lover part with a long embrace you be not go too say the duchess as she see mr oakhurst apparently wait to accompany he as far as the cañon he reply he turn suddenly and kiss the duchess leave she pallid face aflame and she tremble lip rigid with amazement night come but not mr oakhurst it bring the storm again and the whirling snow then the duchess feed the fire find that some one have quietly pile beside the hut enough fuel to last a few day longer the tear rise to she eye but she hide they from piney the woman sleep but little in the morning look into each other 's face they read they fate neither speak but piney accept the position of the stronger draw near and place she arm around the duchess 's waist they keep this attitude for the rest of the day that night the storm reach its greatest fury and rend asunder the protect pine invade the very hut toward morning they find themselves unable to feed the fire which gradually die away as the ember slowly blacken the duchess creep closer to piney and break the silence of many hour : piney can you pray no dear say piney simply the duchess without know exactly why feel relieved and put she head upon piney 's shoulder speak no more and so recline the younger and purer pillow the head of she soil sister upon she virgin breast they fall asleep the wind lull as if it fear to waken they feathery drift of snow shake from the long pine-bough fly like white-winged bird and settle about they as they sleep the moon through the rifted cloud look down upon what have be the camp but all human stain all trace of earthly travail be hide beneath the spotless mantle mercifully fling from above they sleep all that day and the next nor do they waken when voice and footstep break the silence of the camp and when pity finger brush the snow from they wan face you could scarcely have tell from the equal peace that dwell upon they which be she that have sin even the law of poker flat recognize this and turn away leave they still lock in each other 's arm but at the head of the gulch on one of the largest pine-tree they find the deuce of club pin to the bark with a bowie-knife it bear the follow write in pencil in a firm hand : -- beneath this tree lie the body of john oakhurst who strike a streak of bad luck on the 23d of November 1850 and hand in he check on the 7th December 1850 and pulseless and cold with a derringer by he side and a bullet in he heart though still calm as in life beneath the snow lay he who be at once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcast of poker flat ix markheim -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- 1884 -rrb- -lrb- \* from the merry man use by permission of charle scribner 's son authorize american publisher of stevenson 's work -rrb- by robert loui stevenson -lrb- 1850-1894 -rrb- -lrb- _ set _ there be no finer model for the study of setting than this story afford it be three o'clock in the afternoon of a foggy christmas day in london if markheim 's manner and the dimly light interior of the antique shop suggest murder the garrulous clock the nodding shadow and the reflect mirror seem almost to compel confession and surrender and still as he continue to fill he pocket he mind accuse he with a sickening iteration of the thousand fault of he design he should have choose a more quiet hour so he should for the murder but for the self-confession which be stevenson 's ultimate design no time or place could have be better _ plot _ there be little action in the plot a man commit a dastardly murder and then be alone and undetected begin to think think think it be the turn point in he life and he know it instead of seize the treasure and escape he submit he past career to a rigid scrutiny and review this brooding over he past life and present outlook become so absorb that what bid fair to be a soliloquy become a dialogue a dialogue between the old self that commit the murder and the new self that begin to revolt at it the old self bid he follow the line of least resistance and go on as he have begin the newly awaken self bid he stop at once check the momentum of other day take this last chance and be a man he better nature win markheim find that though he deed have be uniformly evil he can still conceive great deed renunciation martyrdom though the active love of good seem too weak to be reckon as a asset he still have a hatred of evil and on this twin foundation ability to think great thought and to hate evil deed he build at last he culminate resolve the story be powerfully and yet subtly tell it sweep the whole gamut of the moral law many story develop the same theme but none just like this stevenson himself be draw again to the same problem a little later in dr jekyll and mr hyde hawthorne try it in howe 's masquerade in which the cloak figure be the phantom or reduplication of howe himself in poe 's william wilson to which stevenson be plainly indebted the evil nature triumph over the good but markheim by touch more chord and by sound lower depths make the triumph at the end seem like a permanent victory for universal human nature _ character _ if the story be the study of a give situation markheim who be another type of the develop character be the central factor in the situation we see and interpret the situation only through the personality of markheim himself another murderer might have act differently even with those clamorous clock and accuse mirror around he but not this murderer there be nothing abnormal about he however as a criminal he be thirty-six year old and through sheer weakness have go steadily downward but he have never before do a deed approach this in horror or in the power of sudden self-revelation he see himself now as he never see himself before and begin to take stock of he moral asset they be pitifully meager though he opportunity for character building have be good he have even have emotional revival which do not however issue in good deed but with it all markheim illustrate the nobility of human nature rather than its essential depravity i do not doubt he complete and permanent conversion when the terrible last question be put to he -- or when he put it to himself -- whether he be better now in any one particular than he be and when he be force to say no in none i have go down in all the moral resource of human nature itself seem to be exhaust but they be not i see clearly what remain for I say markheim by way of _ duty _ this word not use before sound a new challenge and mark the crisis of the story duty can fight without call in reserve from the past and without the vision of victory in the future i do not wonder that the feature of the visitant soften with a tender triumph the visitant be neither the devil as markheim first think he nor the savior of man as a recent editor pronounce he he be only markheim 's old self the self that enter the antique shop that with fear and tremble commit the deed and that now half-conscious all the time of inherent falseness urge the old argument and try to energize the old purpose it be this visitant that every man meet and overthrow when he come to himself when he break sharply with the old life and enter resolutely upon the new -rrb- yes say the dealer we windfall be of various kind some customer be ignorant and then i touch a dividend on my superior knowledge some be dishonest and here he hold up the candle so that the light fall strongly on he visitor and in that case he continue i profit by my virtue markheim have but just enter from the daylight street and he eye have not yet grow familiar with the mingled shine and darkness in the shop at these pointed word and before the near presence of the flame he blink painfully and look aside the dealer chuckle you come to I on christmas-day he resume when you know that i be alone in my house put up my shutter and make a point of refuse business well you will have to pay for that you will have to pay for my loss of time when i should be balance my book you will have to pay besides for a kind of manner that i remark in you to-day very strongly i be the essence of discretion and ask no awkward question but when a customer can not look I in the eye he have to pay for it the dealer once more chuckle and then change to he usual business voice though still with a note of irony you can give as usual a clean account of how you come into the possession of the object he continue still you uncle 's cabinet a remarkable collector sir and the little pale round-shouldered dealer stand almost on tip-toe look over the top of he gold spectacles and nod he head with every mark of disbelief markheim return he gaze with one of infinite pity and a touch of horror this time say he you be in error i have not come to sell but to buy i have no curio to dispose of my uncle 's cabinet be bare to the wainscot even be it still intact i have do well on the stock exchange and should more likely add to it than otherwise and my errand to-day be simplicity itself i seek a christmas-present for a lady he continue wax more fluent as he strike into the speech he have prepare and certainly i owe you every excuse for thus disturbing you upon so small a matter but the thing be neglect yesterday i must produce my little compliment at dinner and as you very well know a rich marriage be not a thing to be neglect there follow a pause during which the dealer seem to weigh this statement incredulously the ticking of many clock among the curious lumber of the shop and the faint rush of the cab in a near thoroughfare fill up the interval of silence well sir say the dealer be it so you be a old customer after all and if as you say you have the chance of a good marriage far be it from I to be a obstacle here be a nice thing for a lady now he go on this hand-glass -- fifteenth century warrant come from a good collection too but i reserve the name in the interest of my customer who be just like yourself my dear sir the nephew and sole heir of a remarkable collector the dealer while he thus run on in he dry and biting voice have stoop to take the object from its place and as he have do so a shock have pass through markheim a start both of hand and foot a sudden leap of many tumultuous passion to the face it pass as swiftly as it come and leave no trace beyond a certain tremble of the hand that now receive the glass a glass he say hoarsely and then pause and repeat it more clearly a glass for christmas surely not and why not cry the dealer why not a glass markheim be look upon he with a indefinable expression you ask I why not he say why look here -- look in it -- look at yourself do you like to see it no nor i -- nor any man the little man have jump back when markheim have so suddenly confront he with the mirror but now perceive there be nothing worse on hand he chuckle you future lady sir must be pretty hard favor say he i ask you say markheim for a christmas-present and you give I this -- this damned reminder of year and sin and folly -- this hand-conscience do you mean it have you a think in you mind tell I it will be better for you if you do come tell I about yourself i hazard a guess now that you be in secret a very charitable man the dealer look closely at he companion it be very odd markheim do not appear to be laugh there be something in he face like a eager sparkle of hope but nothing of mirth what be you drive at the dealer ask not charitable return the other gloomily not charitable not pious not scrupulous unloving unbeloved a hand to get money a safe to keep it be that all dear god man be that all i will tell you what it be begin the dealer with some sharpness and then break off again into a chuckle but i see this be a love match of yours and you have be drink the lady 's health ah cry markheim with a strange curiosity ah have you be in love tell I about that i cry the dealer i in love i never have the time nor have i the time to-day for all this nonsense will you take the glass where be the hurry return markheim it be very pleasant to stand here talk and life be so short and insecure that i would not hurry away from any pleasure -- no not even from so mild a one as this we should rather cling cling to what little we can get like a man at a cliff 's edge every second be a cliff if you think upon it -- a cliff a mile high -- high enough if we fall to dash we out of every feature of humanity hence it be best to talk pleasantly let we talk of each other why should we wear this mask let we be confidential who know we might become friend i have just one word to say to you say the dealer either make you purchase or walk out of my shop true true say markheim enough fooling to business show I something else the dealer stoop once more this time to replace the glass upon the shelf he thin blonde hair fall over he eye as he do so markheim move a little nearer with one hand in the pocket of he great-coat he draw himself up and fill he lung at the same time many different emotion be depict together on he face -- terror horror and resolve fascination and a physical repulsion and through a haggard lift of he upper lip he tooth look out this perhaps may suit observe the dealer and then as he begin to re-arise markheim bound from behind upon he victim the long skewer-like dagger flash and fall the dealer struggle like a hen striking he temple on the shelf and then tumble on the floor in a heap time have some score of small voice in that shop some stately and slow as be become to they great age other garrulous and hurry all these tell out the seconds in a intricate chorus of ticking then the passage of a lad 's foot heavily run on the pavement break in upon these smaller voice and startle markheim into the consciousness of he surroundings he look about he awfully the candle stand on the counter its flame solemnly wag in a draught and by that inconsiderable movement the whole room be fill with noiseless bustle and keep heave like a sea : the tall shadow nod the gross blot of darkness swell and dwindle as with respiration the face of the portrait and the china god change and waver like image in water the inner door stand ajar and peer into that leaguer of shadow with a long slit of daylight like a point finger from these fear-stricken roving markheim 's eye return to the body of he victim where it lay both hump and sprawl incredibly small and strangely meaner than in life in these poor miserly clothes in that ungainly attitude the dealer lay like so much sawdust markheim have fear to see it and lo it be nothing and yet as he gaze this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood begin to find eloquent voice there it must lie there be none to work the cunning hinge or direct the miracle of locomotion -- there it must lie till it be find find ay and then then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that would ring over england and fill the world with the echo of pursuit ay dead or not this be still the enemy time be that when the brain be out he think and the first word strike into he mind time now that the deed be accomplish -- time which have close for the victim have become instant and momentous for the slayer the thought be yet in he mind when first one and then another with every variety of pace and voice -- one deep as the bell from a cathedral turret another ringing on its treble note the prelude of a waltz -- the clock begin to strike the hour of three in the afternoon the sudden outbreak of so many tongue in that dumb chamber stagger he he begin to bestir himself go to and fro with the candle beleaguer by move shadow and startle to the soul by chance reflection in many rich mirror some of home design some from venice or amsterdam he see he face repeat and repeat as it be a army of spy he own eye meet and detect he and the sound of he own step lightly as they fall vex the surround quiet and still as he continue to fill he pocket he mind accuse he with a sickening iteration of the thousand fault of he design he should have choose a more quiet hour he should have prepare a alibi he should not have use a knife he should have be more cautious and only bind and gag the dealer and not kill he he should have be more bold and kill the servant also he should have do all thing otherwise poignant regret weary incessant toiling of the mind to change what be unchangeable to plan what be now useless to be the architect of the irrevocable past meanwhile and behind all this activity brute terror like scurry of rat in a desert attic fill the more remote chamber of he brain with riot the hand of the constable would fall heavy on he shoulder and he nerve would jerk like a hooked fish or he behold in gallop defile the dock the prison the gallows and the black coffin terror of the people in the street sit down before he mind like a besiege army it be impossible he think but that some rumor of the struggle must have reach they ear and set on edge they curiosity and now in all the neighbor house he divine they sit motionless and with uplifted ear -- solitary people condemn to spend christmas dwelling alone on memory of the past and now startlingly recall from that tender exercise happy family party strike into silence round the table the mother still with raise finger : every degree and age and humor but all by they own hearth prying and hearken and weave the rope that be to hang he sometimes it seem to he he could not move too softly the clink of the tall bohemian goblet ring out loudly like a bell and alarm by the bigness of the tick he be tempt to stop the clock and then again with a swift transition of he terror the very silence of the place appear a source of peril and a thing to strike and freeze the passer-by and he would step more boldly and bustle aloud among the contents of the shop and imitate with elaborate bravado the movement of a busy man at ease in he own house but he be now so pull about by different alarm that while one portion of he mind be still alert and cunning another tremble on the brink of lunacy one hallucination in particular take a strong hold on he credulity the neighbor hearken with white face beside he window the passer-by arrest by a horrible surmise on the pavement -- these could at worst suspect they could not know through the brick wall and shutter window only sound could penetrate but here within the house be he alone he know he be he have watch the servant set forth sweetheart in she poor best out for the day write in every ribbon and smile yes he be alone of course and yet in the bulk of empty house above he he could surely hear a stir of delicate footing -- he be surely conscious inexplicably conscious of some presence ay surely to every room and corner of the house he imagination follow it and now it be a faceless thing and yet have eye to see with and again it be a shadow of himself and yet again behold the image of the dead dealer reinspire with cunning and hatred at time with a strong effort he would glance at the open door which still seem to repel he eye the house be tall the skylight small and dirty the day blind with fog and the light that filter down to the ground story be exceedingly faint and show dimly on the threshold of the shop and yet in that strip of doubtful brightness do there not hang waver a shadow suddenly from the street outside a very jovial gentleman begin to beat with a staff on the shop-door accompany he blow with shout and raillery in which the dealer be continually call upon by name markheim smitten into ice glance at the dead man but no he lay quite still he be flee away far beyond earshot of these blow and shouting he be sink beneath sea of silence and he name which would once have catch he notice above the howling of a storm have become a empty sound and presently the jovial gentleman desist from he knock and depart here be a broad hint to hurry what remain to be do to get forth from this accuse neighborhood to plunge into a bath of london multitude and to reach on the other side of day that haven of safety and apparent innocence -- he bed one visitor have come : at any moment another might follow and be more obstinate to have do the deed and yet not to reap the profit would be too abhorrent a failure the money that be now markheim 's concern and as a means to that the key he glance over he shoulder at the open door where the shadow be still linger and shiver and with no conscious repugnance of the mind yet with a tremor of the belly he draw near the body of he victim the human character have quite depart like a suit half-stuffed with bran the limb lay scatter the trunk double on the floor and yet the thing repel he although so dingy and inconsiderable to the eye he fear it might have more significance to the touch he take the body by the shoulder and turn it on its back it be strangely light and supple and the limb as if they have be break fall into the oddest posture the face be rob of all expression but it be as pale as wax and shockingly smear with blood about one temple that be for markheim the one displease circumstance it carry he back upon the instant to a certain fair day in a fisher 's village : a gray day a piping wind a crowd upon the street the blare of brass the booming of drum the nasal voice of a ballad singer and a boy go to and fro bury over head in the crowd and divide between interest and fear until come out upon the chief place of concourse he behold a booth and a great screen with picture dismally design garishly color : brownrigg with she apprentice the manning with they murder guest weare in the death-grip of thurtell and a score besides of famous crime the thing be as clear as a illusion he be once again that little boy he be look once again and with the same sense of physical revolt at these vile picture he be still stun by the thumping of the drum a bar of that day 's music return upon he memory and at that for the first time a qualm come over he a breath of nausea a sudden weakness of the joint which he must instantly resist and conquer he judge it more prudent to confront than to flee from these consideration look the more hardily in the dead face bend he mind to realize the nature and greatness of he crime so little awhile ago that face have move with every change of sentiment that pale mouth have speak that body have be all on fire with governable energy and now and by he act that piece of life have be arrest as the horologist with interjected finger arrest the beating of the clock so he reason in vain he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness the same heart which have shudder before the paint effigy of crime look on its reality unmoved at best he feel a gleam of pity for one who have be endow in vain with all those faculty that can make the world a garden of enchantment one who have never live and who be now dead but of penitence no with a tremor with that shake himself clear of these consideration he find the key and advance toward the open door of the shop outside it have begin to rain smartly and the sound of the shower upon the roof have banish silence like some drip cavern the chamber of the house be haunt by a incessant echo which fill the ear and mingle with the ticking of the clock and as markheim approach the door he seem to hear in answer to he own cautious tread the step of another foot withdraw up the stair the shadow still palpitate loosely on the threshold he throw a ton 's weight of resolve upon he muscle and draw back the door the faint foggy daylight glimmer dimly on the bare floor and stair on the bright suit of armor post halbert in hand upon the landing and on the dark wood-carving and frame picture that hang against the yellow panel of the wainscot so loud be the beating of the rain through all the house that in markheim 's ear it begin to be distinguish into many different sound footstep and sigh the tread of regiment march in the distance the chink of money in the counting and the creaking of door hold stealthily ajar appear to mingle with the patter of the drop upon the cupola and the gushing of the water in the pipe the sense that he be not alone grow upon he to the verge of madness on every side he be haunt and begird by presence he hear they move in the upper chamber from the shop he hear the dead man get to he leg and as he begin with a great effort to mount the stair foot flee quietly before he and follow stealthily behind if he be but deaf he think how tranquilly he would possess he soul and then again and hearken with every fresh attention he bless himself for that unresisting sense which hold the outpost and stand a trusty sentinel upon he life he head turn continually on he neck he eye which seem start from they orbit scout on every side and on every side be half-rewarded as with the tail of something nameless vanish the four-and-twenty step to the first floor be four-and-twenty agony on that first story the door stand ajar three of they like three ambush shake he nerve like the throat of cannon he could never again he feel be sufficiently immured and fortify from man 's observe eye he long to be home girt in by wall bury among bedclothes and invisible to all but god and at that think he wonder a little recollect tale of other murderer and the fear they be say to entertain of heavenly avenger it be not so at least with he he fear the law of nature lest in they callous and immutable procedure they should preserve some damning evidence of he crime he fear tenfold more with a slavish superstitious terror some scission in the continuity of man 's experience some willful illegality of nature he play a game of skill depend on the rule calculate consequence from cause and what if nature as the defeat tyrant overthrow the chessboard should break the mold of they succession the like have befall napoleon -lrb- so writer say -rrb- when the winter change the time of its appearance the like might befall markheim : the solid wall might become transparent and reveal he doings like those of bee in a glass hive the stout plank might yield under he foot like quicksand and detain he in they clutch ay and there be soberer accident that might destroy he : if for instance the house should fall and imprison he beside the body of he victim the house next door should fly on fire and the fireman invade he from all side these thing he fear and in a sense these thing might be call the hand of god reach forth against sin but about god himself he be at ease he act be doubtless exceptional but so be he excuse which god know it be there and not among man that he feel sure of justice when he have get safe into the drawing-room and shut the door behind he he be aware of a respite from alarm the room be quite dismantle uncarpeted besides and strew with packing case and incongruous furniture several great pier-glass in which he behold himself at various angle like a actor on the stage many picture frame and unframed standing with they face to the wall a fine sheraton sideboard a cabinet of marquetry and a great old bed with tapestry hanging the window open to the floor but by great good fortune the lower part of the shutter have be close and this conceal he from the neighbor here then markheim draw in a packing case before the cabinet and begin to search among the key it be a long business for there be many and it be irksome besides for after all there might be nothing in the cabinet and time be on the wing but the closeness of the occupation sober he with the tail of he eye he see the door -- even glance at it from time to time directly like a besiege commander pleased to verify the good estate of he defens but in truth he be at peace the rain fall in the street sound natural and pleasant presently on the other side the note of a piano be waken to the music of a hymn and the voice of many child take up the air and word how stately how comfortable be the melody how fresh the youthful voice markheim give ear to it smilingly as he sort out the key and he mind be throng with answerable idea and image church-going child and the peal of the high organ child afield bather by the brook-side rambler on the brambly common kite-flyer in the windy and cloud-navigated sky and then at another cadence of the hymn back again to church and the somnolence of summer sunday and the high genteel voice of the parson -lrb- which he smile a little to recall -rrb- and the paint jacobean tomb and the dim lettering of the ten commandment in the chancel and as he sit thus at once busy and absent he be startle to he foot a flash of ice a flash of fire a burst gush of blood go over he and then he stand transfix and thrilling a step mount the stair slowly and steadily and presently a hand be lay upon the knob and the lock click and the door open fear hold markheim in a vice what to expect he know not whether the dead man walk or the official minister of human justice or some chance witness blindly stumble in to consign he to the gallows but when a face be thrust into the aperture glance round the room look at he nod and smile as if in friendly recognition and then withdraw again and the door close behind it he fear break loose from he control in a hoarse cry at the sound of this the visitant return do you call I he ask pleasantly and with that he enter the room and close the door behind he markheim stand and gaze at he with all he eye perhaps there be a film upon he sight but the outline of the newcomer seem to change and waver like those of the idol in the waver candle-light of the shop and at time he think he know he and at time he think he bear a likeness to himself and always like a lump of live terror there lay in he bosom the conviction that this thing be not of the earth and not of god and yet the creature have a strange air of the common-place as he stand look on markheim with a smile and when he add : you be look for the money i believe it be in the tone of everyday politeness markheim make no answer i should warn you resume the other that the maid have leave she sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here if mr markheim be find in this house i need not describe to he the consequence you know I cry the murderer the visitor smile you have long be a favorite of mine he say and i have long observe and often seek to help you what be you cry markheim : the devil what i may be return the other can not affect the service i propose to render you it can cry markheim it do be help by you no never not by you you do not know I yet thank god you do not know I i know you reply the visitant with a sort of kind severity or rather firmness i know you to the soul know I cry markheim who can do so my life be but a travesty and slander on myself i have live to belie my nature all man do all man be better than this disguise that grow about and stifle they you see each drag away by life like one whom bravo have seize and muffle in a cloak if they have they own control -- if you could see they face they would be altogether different they would shine out for hero and saint i be worse than most my self be more overlaid my excuse be know to I and god but have i the time i could disclose myself to I inquire the visitant to you before all return the murderer i suppose you be intelligent i think -- since you exist -- you would prove a reader of the heart and yet you would propose to judge I by my act think of it my act i be bear and i have live in a land of giant giant have drag I by the wrist since i be bear out of my mother -- the giant of circumstance and you would judge I by my act but can you not look within can you not understand that evil be hateful to I can you not see within I the clear writing of conscience never blur by any willful sophistry although too often disregard can you not read I for a thing that surely must be common as humanity -- the unwilling sinner all this be very feelingly express be the reply but it regard I not these point of consistency be beyond my province and i care not in the least by what compulsion you may have be drag away so as you be but carry in the right direction but time fly the servant delay look in the face of the crowd and at the picture on the hoarding but still she keep move nearer and remember it be as if the gallows itself be stride toward you through the christmas street shall i help you i who know all shall i tell you where to find the money for what price ask markheim i offer you the service for a christmas gift return the other markheim could not refrain from smile with a kind of bitter triumph no say he i will take nothing at you hand if i be die of thirst and it be you hand that put the pitcher to my lip i should find the courage to refuse it may be credulous but i will do nothing to commit myself to evil i have no objection to a death-bed repentance observe the visitant because you disbelieve they efficacy markheim cry i do not say so return the other but i look on these thing from a different side and when the life be do my interest fall the man have live to serve I to spread black look under color of religion or to sow tare in the wheat-field as you do in a course of weak compliance with desire now that he draw so near to he deliverance he can add but one act of service -- to repent to die smile and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more timorous of my survive follower i be not so hard a master try I accept my help please yourself in life as you have do hitherto please yourself more amply spread you elbow at the board and when the night begin to fall and the curtain to be draw i tell you for you greater comfort that you will find it even easy to compound you quarrel with you conscience and to make a truckling peace with god i come but now from such a death-bed and the room be full of sincere mourner listen to the man 's last word : and when i look into that face which have be set as a flint against mercy i find it smile with hope and do you then suppose I such a creature ask markheim do you think i have no more generous aspiration than to sin and sin and sin and at last sneak into heaven my heart rise at the thought be this then you experience of mankind or be it because you find I with red hand that you presume such baseness and be this crime of murder indeed so impious as to dry up the very spring of good murder be to I no special category reply the other all sin be murder even as all life be war i behold you race like starve mariner on a raft pluck crust out of the hand of famine and feeding on each other 's life i follow sin beyond the moment of they act i find in all that the last consequence be death and to my eye the pretty maid who thwart she mother with such take grace on a question of a ball drip no less visibly with human gore than such a murderer as yourself do i say that i follow sin i follow virtue also they differ not by the thickness of a nail they be both scythe for the reap angel of death evil for which i live consist not in action but in character the bad man be dear to I not the bad act whose fruit if we could follow they far enough down the hurtle cataract of the age might yet be find more bless than those of the rarest virtue and it be not because you have kill a dealer but because you be markheim that i offer to forward you escape i will lay my heart open to you answer markheim this crime on which you find I be my last on my way to it i have learn many lesson itself be a lesson a momentous lesson hitherto i have be drive with revolt to what i would not i be a bond-slave to poverty drive and scourge there be robust virtue that can stand in these temptation mine be not so : i have a thirst of pleasure but to-day and out of this deed i pluck both warning and riches -- both the power and a fresh resolve to be myself i become in all thing a free actor in the world i begin to see myself all change these hand the agent of good this heart at peace something come over I out of the past something of what i have dream on sabbath evening to the sound of the church organ of what i forecast when i shed tear over noble book or talk a innocent child with my mother there lie my life i have wander a few year but now i see once more my city of destination you be to use this money on the stock exchange i think remark the visitor and there if i mistake not you have already lose some thousand ah say markheim but this time i have a sure thing this time again you will lose reply the visitor quietly ah but i keep back the half cry markheim that also you will lose say the other the sweat start upon markheim 's brow well then what matter he exclaim say it be lose say i be plunge again in poverty shall one part of I and that the worse continue until the end to override the better evil and good run strong in I hale I both way i do not love the one thing i love all i can conceive great deed renunciation martyrdom and though i be fall to such a crime as murder pity be no stranger to my thought i pity the poor who know they trial better than myself i pity and help they i prize love i love honest laughter there be no good thing nor true thing on earth but i love it from my heart and be my vice only to direct my life and my virtue to lie without effect like some passive lumber of the mind not so good also be a spring of act but the visitant raise he finger for six-and-thirty year that you have be in this world say he through many change of fortune and variety of humor i have watch you steadily fall fifteen year ago you would have start at a theft three year back you would have blench at the name of murder be there any crime be there any cruelty or meanness from which you still recoil -- five year from now i shall detect you in the fact downward downward lie you way nor can anything but death avail to stop you it be true markheim say huskily i have in some degree comply with evil but it be so with all : the very saint in the mere exercise of live grow less dainty and take on the tone of they surroundings i will propound to you one simple question say the other and as you answer i shall read to you you moral horoscope you have grow in many thing more lax possibly you do right to be so and at any account it be the same with all man but grant that be you in any one particular however trifle more difficult to please with you own conduct or do you go in all thing with a looser rein in any one repeat markheim with a anguish of consideration no he add with despair in none i have go down in all then say the visitor content yourself with what you be for you will never change and the word of you part on this stage be irrevocably write down markheim stand for a long while silent and indeed it be the visitor who first break the silence that be so he say shall i show you the money and grace cry markheim have you not try it return the other two or three year ago do i not see you on the platform of revival meeting and be not you voice the loudest in the hymn it be true say markheim and i see clearly what remain for I by way of duty i thank you for these lesson from my soul : my eye be open and i behold myself at last for what i be at this moment the sharp note of the door-bell ring through the house and the visitant as though this be some concerted signal for which he have be wait change at once in he demeanor the maid he cry she have return as i forewarned you and there be now before you one more difficult passage she master you must say be ill you must let she in with a assure but rather serious countenance -- no smile no overacting and i promise you success once the girl within and the door close the same dexterity that have already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last danger in you path thenceforward you have the whole evening -- the whole night if needful -- to ransack the treasure of the house and to make good you safety this be help that come to you with the mask of danger up he cry : up friend you life hang tremble in the scale up and act markheim steadily regard he counsellor if i be condemn to evil act he say there be still one door of freedom open -- i can cease from action if my life be a ill thing i can lay it down though i be as you say truly at the beck of every small temptation i can yet by one decisive gesture place myself beyond the reach of all my love of good be damned to barrenness it may and let it be but i have still my hatred of evil and from that to you galling disappointment you shall see that i can draw both energy and courage the feature of the visitor begin to undergo a wonderful and lovely change they brighten and soften with a tender triumph and even as they brighten fade and dislimn but markheim do not pause to watch or understand the transformation he open the door and go down-stair very slowly think to himself he past go soberly before he he behold it as it be ugly and strenuous like a dream random as chance-medley -- a scene of defeat life as he thus review it tempt he no longer but on the further side he perceive a quiet haven for he bark he pause in the passage and look into the shop where the candle still burn by the dead body it be strangely silent thought of the dealer swarm into he mind as he stand gaze and then the bell once more break out into impatient clamor he confront the maid upon the threshold with something like a smile you have better go for the police say he : i have kill you master x the necklace -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- 1885 -rrb- -lrb- \* la parure from conte et nouvelles -rrb- by guy de maupassant -lrb- 1850-1893 -rrb- -lrb- _ setting _ the story be set in a pari atmosphere of social aspiration and discontent the background be one of study contrast contrast between the stolid contentment of a husband and the would-be luxuriousness of a wife between what madame loisel have and what she want between what she be and what she think she could be between she brief moment of triumph and the long year of she undoing between the trivialness of what she do and the heaviness of she punishment these contrast be develop not by reasoning but by action each action plunge madame loisel deeper and deeper into misery the author 's attitude toward he work form also a part of the real background maupassant show neither sympathy nor indignation he write as if he be the stenographer of impersonal and pitiless fate _ plot _ madame loisel a poor but beautiful and ambitious woman borrow and lose a diamond necklace value at $ 7200 that at least be what madame loisel think for ten terrible year and that be what the reader think till he come to the last word of the story the plot belong therefore to that large group know as hoax plot in most of these story one person play a joke on another in this story a grim fate be make to play the joke in fact the current phrase the irony of fate find here perfect illustration we use the expression not so much of a great misfortune as of a misfortune that seem bring about by a peculiarly malignant train of circumstance the injury in this case not only be irremediable but turn on a accident notice also how maupassant have sharpen the poignancy and bitterness of madame loisel 's misfortune by make it depend not only on a accident that might so easily not have happen but on a misunderstanding that might so easily have be explain when madame loisel just on the threshold of she life of drudgery take the necklace buy on credit to madame forestier the latter do not open the case to the relief of she friend the irony of fate could hardly go further but it do go further a little later when madame forestier still young and beautiful fail to recognize madame loisel because the latter have lose youth beauty daintiness she very self in toiling to pay to madame forestier a debt that be not a debt just before the final revelation madame loisel be make to say i be very glad there be a unique pathos in she use of this word : it lift she a little from the ground that she fall might be all the harder there be no deny the art of this story but it be art without heart the author be a craftsman rather than a creator a master of the loom rather than of the forge maupassant do perfectly what he want to do but he greatness and he limitation be both reveal what would have happen he say if she have not lose that necklace who know who know how strange life be how changeful how little a thing be need for we to be lose or to be save the greatest art may begin but not end this way _ character _ the man be only a foil to he wife he be introduce to bring into sharper relief she unhappiness and she powerlessness to better she condition he be not a bad man nor be she a bad woman to say that the story turn entirely on he honor and on she false pride be to miss i think the author 's purpose there be nothing distinctive in these character he be better than she but both be puppet in the grip of brute circumstance rather than everyday character shape by the ordinary pressure of life they be not type as rip be a type or scrooge or oakhurst maupassant show in he story that he be interested not so much in the free play or the full reaction of personality as in the enslavement of personality through passion or chance he see life without order because without center without reward because without desert and he character be make to see it through the same lens and to experience it on the same level they either do not react or do not react nobly have madame loisel and she husband be shape to fit into a less mechanical scheme of thing they would have recognize in they ten year ' trial the call to something higher they could have use they testing as a means of understand with keener sympathy the lifelong testing of other they could have attain a self-development that would have bring a happiness undreamed of before the fateful January 18 but this be browning 's way not maupassant 's the latter prefer to make madame loisel and she husband chiefly of putty so that they may illustrate the blind thrust of accident rather than the power of personality to turn stumbling-block into stepping-stone -rrb- she be one of those pretty and charming girl who as if by a mistake of destiny be bear in a family of employee she have no dowry no expectation no means of become known understand loved wed by any rich and distinguished man and so she let

who would be king -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- 1888 -rrb- -lrb- \* from the phantom ` rickshaw -rrb- by rudyard kipling -lrb- 1865 - -rrb- -lrb- _ set _ they call it kafiristan say dravot the unfortunate hero of the story by my reckon it be the top right-hand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred mile from peshawar determine to be king of kafiristan carnehan and dravot start probably from the capital of the punjab lahore where the newspaper office seem to have be ten mile west of peshawar they enter the famous khaiber -lrb- or khyber -rrb- pass a region which kiple describe more at length in the man who be the drum of the fore and aft the lose legion love o ' woman wee willie winkie and with the main guard no country in asia be less know to civilization than kafiristan the mohammedan trader say that it be the most attractive part of afghanistan the name mean country of unbeliever the kafir have resist all attempt to convert they to the mohammedan faith they be pure aryan be thus brother to the greek roman german english and ourselves they be note for they beauty and strength indium or rather anglo-indium have be almost re-discover by kiple but this be he only story of kafiristan it too as carnehan and dravot learn to they sorrow be a land of impenetrable mystery _ plot _ the real plot do not begin to unfold itself until carnehan wreck in body and mind return to the newspaper office and try to report he experience thus nearly one half of the story may be call introductory or preliminary this be unusual with kipling and with all other modern story writer the introduction justify itself however in this case because since a half-crazed man with weaken memory be to tell the real tale he narrative would have to be supplement by explanation on nearly every page unless the introductory part could be take for grant notice how often in read carnehan 's broken story you supply what he omit and interpret what he only fragmentarily say by reference to what have go before kiple have do more in this story than to present a character of limitless audacity he have impress again one of he favorite teaching there be he hold a barrier between east and west that can never be cross the west can go so far with the east but no farther brave man of the west may conquer the east and rule it but to take liberty with it be to uncover a vast realm of the unknown and to invite disaster in the return of imray a good-natured englishman pat the head of bahadur khan 's child and be kill for it another englishman in beyond the pale thought that he understand the heart of indium and here be he epitaph : he take too deep a interest in native life but he will never do so again dravot could play king and even god in kafiristan but when he expose himself ignorantly to a old racial superstition he meet instant and inevitable destruction _ character _ carnehan tell the story but dravot be the energize character captain jame cook the discoverer of the sandwich island be plainly the original of dravot read the thirtieth chapter of the second volume of mark twain 's rough it -lrb- 1872 -rrb- and you will find kipling 's story clearly outline one can not withhold a measure of admiration for this type of uncontrolled audacity dravot be not bad at heart he be only boundless a type of the adventurer that have give many a fascinating chapter to history as well as to literature in the research magnificent by mr hg well the hero benham say : i think what i want be to be king of the world it be the very core of I i mean to be a king in this earth _ king _ i be not mad he motive however be very different from dravot 's i see the world he continue stagger from misery to misery and there be little wisdom less rule folly prejudice limitation and it be my world and i be responsible as soon as you kingship be plain to you there be no more rest no peace no delight except in work in service in utmost effort the three weakness to be overcome be fear indulgence and jealousy both dravot and benham fail and the comment of each on he own failure be a autobiography benham : i can feel that greater world i shall never see as one feel the dawn come through the last darkness dravot : we have have a dash fine run for we money what be come next -rrb- brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar if he be find worthy the law as quote lay down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to follow i have be fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstance which prevent either of we find out whether the other be worthy i have still to be brother to a prince though i once come near to kinship with what might have be a veritable king and be promise the reversion of a kingdom -- army law-court revenue and policy all complete but to-day i greatly fear that my king be dead and if i want a crown i must go hunt it for myself the beginning of everything be in a railway train upon the road to mhow from ajmir there have be a deficit in the budget which necessitate travel not second-class which be only half as dear as first-class but by intermediate which be very awful indeed there be no cushion in the intermediate class and the population be either intermediate which be eurasian or native which for a long night journey be nasty or loafer which be amusing though intoxicated intermediate do not buy from refreshment-room they carry they food in bundle and pot and buy sweet from the native sweetmeat-seller and drink the roadside water that be why in hot weather intermediate be take out of the carriage dead and in all weather be most properly look down upon my particular intermediate happen to be empty till i reach nasirabad when a big black-browed gentleman in shirt-sleeve enter and follow the custom of intermediate pass the time of day he be a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with a educate taste for whiskey he tell tale of thing he have see and do of out-of-the-way corner of the empire into which he have penetrate and of adventure in which he risk he life for a few day ' food if indium be fill with man like you and I not know more than the crow where they would get they next day 's ration it be not seventy million of revenue the land would be pay -- it be seven hundred million say he and as i look at he mouth and chin i be dispose to agree with he we talk politics -- the politics of loaferdom that see thing from the underside where the lath and plaster be not smooth off -- and we talk postal arrangement because my friend want to send a telegram back from the next station to ajmir the turning-off place from the bombay to the mhow line as you travel westward my friend have no money beyond eight anna which he want for dinner and i have no money at all owe to the hitch in the budget before mention further i be go into a wilderness where though i should resume touch with the treasury there be no telegraph office i be therefore unable to help he in any way we might threaten a station-master and make he send a wire on tick say my friend but that would mean enquiry for you and for I and _ i _ have get my hand full these day do you say you be travel back along this line within any day within ten i say can not you make it eight say he mine be rather urgent business i can send you telegram within ten day if that will serve you i say i could not trust the wire to fetch he now i think of it it be this way he leave delhus on the 23rd for bombay that mean he 'll be run through ajmir about the night of the 23rd but i be go into the indian desert i explain well _ and _ good say he you 'll be change at marwar junction to get into jodhpore territory -- you must do that -- and he 'll be come through marwar junction in the early morning of the 24th by the bombay mail can you be at marwar junction on that time ' t will not be inconvenience you because i know that there be precious few pickings to be get out of these central indium state -- even though you pretend to be correspondent or the _ backwoodsman _ have you ever try that trick i ask again and again but the resident find you out and then you get escort to the border before you have time to get you knife into they but about my friend here i _ must _ give he a word o ' mouth to tell he what be come to I or else he will not know where to go i would take it more than kind of you if you be to come out of central indium in time to catch he at marwar junction and say to he : ` he have go south for the week ' he 'll know what that mean he be a big man with a red beard and a great swell he be you 'll find he sleep like a gentleman with all he luggage round he in a second-class apartment but do not you be afraid slip down the window and say : ` he have go south for the week ' and he 'll tumble it be only cut you time of stay in those part by two day i ask you as a stranger -- go to the west he say with emphasis where have _ you _ come from say i from the east say he and i be hope that you will give he the message on the square -- for the sake of my mother as well as you own englishman be not usually soften by appeal to the memory of they mother but for certain reason which will be fully apparent i see fit to agree it be more than a little matter say he and that be why i ask you to do it -- and now i know that i can depend on you do it a second-class carriage at marwar junction and a red-haired man asleep in it you 'll be sure to remember i get out at the next station and i must hold on there till he come or send I what i want i 'll give the message if i catch he i say and for the sake of you mother as well as mine i 'll give you a word of advice do not try to run the central indium state just now as the correspondent of the _ backwoodsman _ there be a real one knock about here and it might lead to trouble thank you say he simply and when will the swine be go i can not starve because he be ruin my work i want to get hold of the degumber rajah down here about he father 's widow and give he a jump what do he do to he father 's widow then fill she up with red pepper and slipper she to death as she hang from a beam i find that out myself and i be the only man that would dare go into the state to get hush-money for it they 'll try to poison I same as they do in chortumna when i go on the loot there but you 'll give the man at marwar junction my message he get out at a little roadside station and i reflect i have hear more than once of man personate correspondent of newspaper and bleed small native state with threat of exposure but i have never meet any of the caste before they lead a hard life and generally die with great suddenness the native state have a wholesome horror of english newspaper which may throw light on they peculiar method of government and do they best to choke correspondent with champagne or drive they out of they mind with four-in-hand barouche they do not understand that nobody care a straw for the internal administration of native state so long as oppression and crime be keep within decent limit and the ruler be not drug drunk or diseased from one end of the year to the other they be the dark place of the earth full of unimaginable cruelty touch the railway and the telegraph on one side and on the other the day of harun-al-raschid when i leave the train i do business with diver king and in eight day pass through many change of life sometimes i wear dress-clothes and consort with prince and political drink from crystal and eating from silver sometimes i lay out upon the ground and devour what i could get from a plate make of leaf and drink the run water and sleep under the same rug as my servant it be all in the day 's work then i head for the great indian desert upon the proper date as i have promise and the night mail set I down at marwar junction where a funny little happy-go-lucky native-managed railway run to jodhpore the bombay mail from delhus make a short halt at marwar she arrive as i get in and i have just time to hurry to she platform and go down the carriage there be only one second-class on the train i slip the window and look down upon a flaming red beard half cover by a railway rug that be my man fast asleep and i dig he gently in the rib he wake with a grunt and i see he face in the light of the lamp it be a great and shine face ticket again say he no say i i be to tell you that he be go south for the week he have go south for the week the train have begin to move out the red man rub he eye he have go south for the week he repeat now that be just like he impidence do he say that i be to give you anything 'cause i will not he do not i say and drop away and watch the red light die out in the dark it be horribly cold because the wind be blow off the sand i climb into my own train -- not a intermediate carriage this time -- and go to sleep if the man with the beard have give I a rupee i should have keep it as a memento of a rather curious affair but the consciousness of have do my duty be my only reward later on i reflect that two gentleman like my friend could not do any good if they forgather and personate correspondent of newspaper and might if they blackmail one of the little rat-trap state of central indium or southern rajputana get themselves into serious difficulty i therefore take some trouble to describe they as accurately as i could remember to people who would be interested in deport they : and succeed so i be later inform in have they head back from the degumber border then i become respectable and return to a office where there be no king and no incident outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper a newspaper office seem to attract every conceivable sort of person to the prejudice of discipline zenana-mission lady arrive and beg that the editor will instantly abandon all he duty to describe a christian prize-giving in a back-slum of a perfectly inaccessible village colonel who have be overpass for command sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten twelve or twenty-four lead article on seniority _ versus _ selection missionary wish to know why they have not be permit to escape from they regular vehicle of abuse and swear at a brother-missionary under special patronage of the editorial we strand theatrical company troop up to explain that they can not pay for they advertisement but on they return from new zealand or tahitus will do so with interest inventor of patent punkah-pulling machine carriage coupling and unbreakable sword and axle-tree call with specification in they pocket and hour at they disposal tea-company enter and elaborate they prospectus with the office pen secretary of ball-committees clamor to have the glory of they last dance more fully describe strange lady rustle in and say : i want a hundred lady 's card print _ at once _ please which be manifestly part of a editor 's duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramp the grand trunk road make it he business to ask for employment as a proof-reader and all the time the telephone-bell be ring madly and king be be kill on the continent and empire be say -- you be another and mister gladstone be call down brimstone upon the british dominion and the little black copy-boy be whine _ kaa-pi chay-ha-yeh _ -lrb- copy want -rrb- like tired bee and most of the paper be as blank as modred 's shield but that be the amusing part of the year there be six other month when none ever come to call and the thermometer walk inch by inch up to the top of the glass and the office be darken to just above reading-light and the press-machine be red-hot of touch and nobody write anything but account of amusement in the hill-station or obituary notice then the telephone become a tinkling terror because it tell you of the sudden death of man and woman that you know intimately and the prickly-heat cover you with a garment and you sit down and write : a slight increase of sickness be report from the khuda janta khan district the outbreak be purely sporadic in its nature and thanks to the energetic effort of the district authority be now almost at a end it be however with deep regret we record the death etc then the sickness really break out and the less recording and report the better for the peace of the subscriber but the empire and the king continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and the foreman think that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twenty-four hour and all the people at the hill-station in the middle of they amusement say : good gracious why can not the paper be sparkling i be sure there be plenty go on up here that be the dark half of the moon and as the advertisement say must be experience to be appreciate it be in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper begin run the last issue of the week on Saturday night which be to say Sunday morning after the custom of a london paper this be a great convenience for immediately after the paper be put to bed the dawn would lower the thermometer from 96 ° to almost 84 ° for half a hour and in that chill -- you have no idea how cold be 84 ° on the grass until you begin to pray for it -- a very tired man could get off to sleep ere the heat rouse he one Saturday night it be my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone a king or courtier or a courtesan or a community be go to die or get a new constitution or do something that be important on the other side of the world and the paper be to be hold open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram it be a pitchy black night as stifle as a June night can be and the _ loo _ the red-hot wind from the westward be booming among the tinder-dry tree and pretend that the rain be on its heel now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog but all we weary world know that be only pretence it be a shade cooler in the press-room than the office so i sit there while the type tick and click and the night-jars hoot at the window and the all but naked compositor wipe the sweat from they forehead and call for water the thing that be keep we back whatever it be would not come off though the _ loo _ drop and the last type be set and the whole round earth stand still in the choke heat with its finger on its lip to wait the event i drowsed and wonder whether the telegraph be a blessing and whether this die man or struggle people might be aware of the inconvenience the delay be cause there be no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension but as the clock-hand creep up to three o'clock and the machine spin they fly-wheel two and three time to see that all be in order before i say the word that would set they off i could have shriek aloud then the roar and rattle of the wheel shiver the quiet into little bit i rise to go away but two man in white clothes stand in front of I the first one say : it be he the second say : so it be and they both laugh almost as loudly as the machinery roar and mop they forehead we seed there be a light burning across the road and we be sleep in that ditch there for coolness and i say to my friend here ` the office be open let 's come along and speak to he as turn we back from the degumber state ' say the smaller of the two he be the man i have meet in the mhow train and he fellow be the red-bearded man of marwar junction there be no mistake the eyebrow of the one or the beard of the other i be not pleased because i wish to go to sleep not to squabble with loafer what do you want i ask half a hour 's talk with you cool and comfortable in the office say the red-bearded man we have _ like _ some drink -- the contrack do not begin yet peachey so you need not look -- but what we really want be advice we do not want money we ask you as a favor because we find out you do we a bad turn about degumber state i lead from the press-room to the stifle office with the map on the wall and the red-haired man rub he hand that be something like say he this be the proper shop to come to now sir let I introduce to you brother peachey carnehan that be he and brother daniel dravot that be _ I _ and the less say about we profession the better for we have be most thing in we time soldier sailor compositor photographer proof-reader street-preacher and correspondent of the _ backwoodsman _ when we think the paper want one carnehan be sober and so be i look at we first and see that be sure it will save you cut into my talk we 'll take one of you cigar apiece and you shall see we light up i watch the test the man be absolutely sober so i give they each a tepid whiskey and soda well _ and _ good say carnehan of the eyebrow wipe the froth from he moustache let I talk now dan we have be all over indium mostly on foot we have be boiler-fitter engine-drivers petty contractor and all that and we have decide that indium be not big enough for such as we they certainly be too big for the office dravot 's beard seem to fill half the room and carnehan 's shoulder the other half as they sit on the big table carnehan continue : the country be not half work out because they that govern it will not let you touch it they spend all they bless time in govern it and you can not lift a spade nor chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the government say -- ` leave it alone and let we govern ' therefore such _ as _ it be we will let it alone and go away to some other place where a man be not crowd and can come to he own we be not little man and there be nothing that we be afraid of except drink and we have sign a contrack on that _ therefore _ we be go away to be king king in we own right muttered dravot yes of course i say you have be tramp in the sun and it be a very warm night and have not you better sleep over the notion come to-morrow neither drunk nor sunstruck say dravot we have sleep over the notion half a year and require to see book and atlas and we have decide that there be only one place now in the world that two strong man can sar-a - _ whack _ they call it kafiristan by my reckon it be the top right-hand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred mile from peshawar they have two-and-thirty heathen idol there and we 'll be the thirty-third and fourth it be a mountaineous country and the woman of those part be very beautiful but that be provide against in the contrack say carnehan neither woman nor liqu-or daniel and that be all we know except that no one have go there and they fight and in any place where they fight a man who know how to drill man can always be a king we shall go to those part and say to any king we find -- would ' you want to vanquish you foe ' and we will show he how to drill man for that we know better than anything else then we will subvert that king and seize he throne and establish a dy-nasty you 'll be cut to piece before you be fifty mile across the border i say you have to travel through afghanistan to get to that country it be one mass of mountain and peak and glacier and no englishman have be through it the people be utter brute and even if you reach they you could not do anything that be more like say carnehan if you could think we a little more mad we would be more pleased we have come to you to know about this country to read a book about it and to be show map we want you to tell we that we be fool and to show we you book he turn to the book-case be you at all in earnest i say a little say dravot sweetly as big a map as you have get even if it be all blank

map i hand he wood on the _ source of the oxus _ carnehan be deep in the _ encyclopædia _ they be a mixed lot say dravot reflectively and it will not help we to know the name of they tribe the more tribe the more they 'll fight and the better for we from jagdallak to ashang h ` mm but all the information about the country be as sketchy and inaccurate as can be i protest no one know anything about it really here be the file of the _ unite service ' institute _ read what bellew say blow bellew say carnehan dan they be a stinkin ' lot of heathen but this book here say they think they be relate to we english i smoked while the man pore over _ raverty wood _ the map and the _ encyclopædia _ there be no use you waiting say dravot politely it be about four o'clock now we 'll go before

leave alone to wonder my eye could detect no failure in the disguise the scene in the seraus prove that they be complete to the native mind there be just the chance therefore that carnehan and dravot would be able to wander through afghanistan without detection but beyond they would find death -- certain and awful death ten day later a native correspondent give I the news of the day from peshawar wound up he letter with : there have be much laughter here on account of a certain mad priest who be go in he estimation to sell petty gaud and insignificant trinket which he ascribe as great charm to hh the amir of bokhara he pass through peshawar and associate himself to the second summer caravan that go to kabul the merchant be pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellow bring good-fortune the two then be beyond the border i would have pray for they but that night a real king die in europe and demand a obituary notice \* \* \* \* \* the wheel of the world swing through the same phase again and again summer pass and winter thereafter and come and pass again the daily paper continue and i with it and upon the third summer there fall a hot night a night-issue and a strained wait for something to be telegraph from the other side of the world exactly as have happen before a few great man have die in the past two year the machine work with more clatter and some of the tree in the office garden be a few foot taller but that be all the difference i pass over to the press-room and go through just such a scene as i have already describe the nervous tension be stronger than it have be two year before and i feel the heat more acutely at three o'clock i cry print off and turn to go when there creep to my chair what be leave of a man he be bent into a circle he head be sink between he shoulder and he move he foot one over the other like a bear i could hardly see whether he walk or crawl -- this rag-wrapped whining cripple who address I by name cry that he be come back can you give I a drink he whimper for the lord 's sake give I a drink i go back to the office the man follow with groan of pain and i turn up the lamp do not you know I he gasp drop into a chair and he turn he draw face surmount by a shock of gray hair to the light i look at he intently once before have i see eyebrow that meet over the nose in a inch-broad black band but for the life of I i could not tell where i do not know you i say hand he the whiskey what can i do for you he take a gulp of the spirit raw and shiver in spite of the suffocating heat i have come back he repeat and i be the king of kafiristan -- I and dravot -- crown king we be in this office we settle it -- you set there and give we the book i be peachey -- peachey taliaferro carnehan and you have be set here ever since -- o lord i be more than a little astonished and express my feeling accordingly it be true say carnehan with a dry cackle nurse he foot which be wrap in rag true as gospel king we be with crown upon we head -- I and dravot -- poor dan -- oh poor poor dan that would never take advice not though i begged of he take the whiskey i say and take you own time tell I all you can recollect of everything from begin to end you get across the border on you camel dravot dress as a mad priest and you he servant do you remember that i be not mad -- yet but i shall be that way soon of course i remember keep look at I or maybe my word will go all to piece keep look at I in my eye and do not say anything i lean forward and look into he face as steadily as i could he drop one hand upon the table and i grasp it by the wrist it be twist like a bird 's claw and upon the back be a ragged red diamond-shaped scar no do not look there look at _ I _ say carnehan that come afterwards but for the lord 's sake do not distrack I we leave with that caravan I and dravot play all sort of antic to amuse the people we be with dravot use to make we laugh in the evening when all the people be cook they dinner -- cook they dinner and -- what do they do then they light little fire with spark that go into dravot 's beard and we all laugh -- fit to die little red fire they be go into dravot 's big red beard -- so funny he eye leave mine and he smile foolishly you go as far as jagdallak with that caravan i say at a venture after you have light those fire to jagdallak where you turn off to try to get into kafiristan no we do not neither what be you talk about we turn off before jagdallak because we hear the road be good but they be not good enough for we two camel -- mine and dravot 's when we leave the caravan dravot take off all he clothes and mine too and say we would be heathen because the kafir do not allow mohammedan to talk to they so we dress betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravot i never see yet nor expect to see again he burn half he beard and sling a sheep-skin over he shoulder and shave he head into pattern he shave mine too and make I wear outrageous thing to look like a heathen that be in a most mountaineous country and we camel could not go along any more because of the mountain they be tall and black and coming home i see they fight like wild goat -- there be lot of goat in kafiristan and these mountain they never keep still no more than the goat always fight they be and do not let you sleep at night take some more whiskey i say very slowly what do you and daniel dravot do when the camel could go no further because of the rough road that lead into kafiristan what do which do there be a party call peachey taliaferro carnehan that be with dravot shall i tell you about he he die out there in the cold slap from the bridge fall old peachey turn and twist in the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amir -- no they be two for three ha ` penny those whirligig or i be much mistaken and woeful sore -- and then these camel be no use and peachey say to dravot -- ` for the lord 's sake let 's get out of this before we head be chop off ' and with that they kill the camel all among the mountain not have anything in particular to eat but first they take off the box with the gun and the ammunition till two man come along drive four mule dravot up and dance in front of they singing -- ` sell I four mule ' say the first man -- ` if you be rich enough to buy you be rich enough to rob ' but before ever he could put he hand to he knife dravot break he neck over he knee and the other party run away so carnehan load the mule with the rifle that be take off the camel and together we start forward into those bitter cold mountaineous part and never a road broader than the back of you hand he pause for a moment while i ask he if he could remember the nature of the country through which he have journey i be tell you as straight as i can but my head be not as good as it might be they drive nail through it to make I hear better how dravot die the country be mountaineous and the mule be most contrary and the inhabitant be disperse and solitary they go up and up and down and down and that other party carnehan be implore of dravot not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bring down the tremenjus avalanche but dravot say that if a king could not sing it be not worth be king and whack the mule over the rump and never take no heed for ten cold day we come to a big level valley all among the mountain and the mule be near dead so we kill they not have anything in special for they or we to eat we sit upon the box and play odd and even with the cartridge that be jolt out then ten man with bow and arrow run down that valley chasing twenty man with bow and arrow and the row be tremenjus they be fair man -- fairer than you or I -- with yellow hair and remarkable well build say dravot unpack the gun -- ` this be the beginning of the business we 'll fight for the ten man ' and with that he fire two rifle at the twenty man and drop one of they at two hundred yard from the rock where he be sit the other man begin to run but carnehan and dravot sit on the box pick they off at all range up and down the valley then we go up to the ten man that have run across the snow too and they fire a footy little arrow at we dravot he shoot above they head and they all fall down flat then he walk over they and kick they and then he lift they up and shake hand all round to make they friendly like he call they and give they the box to carry and wave he hand for all the world as though he be king already they take the box and he across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood on the top where there be half a dozen big stone idol dravot he go to the biggest -- a fellow they call imbra -- and lay a rifle and a cartridge at he foot rub he nose respectful with he own nose pat he on the head and salute in front of it he turn round to the man and nod he head and say -- ` that be all right i be in the know too and all these old jim-jam be my friend ' then he open he mouth and point down it and when the first man bring he food he say -- ` no ' and when the second man bring he food he say -- ` no ' but when one of the old priest and the boss of the village bring he food he say -- ` yes ' very haughty and eat it slow that be how we come to we first village without any trouble just as though we have tumble from the sky but we tumble from one of those damned rope-bridge you see and -- you could not expect a man to laugh much after that take some more whiskey and go on i say that be the first village you come into how do you get to be king i be not king say carnehan dravot he be the king and a handsome man he look with the gold crown on he head and all he and the other party stay in that village and every morning dravot sit by the side of old imbra and the people come and worship that be dravot 's order then a lot of man come into the valley and carnehan and dravot pick they off with the rifle before they know where they be and run down into the valley and up again the other side and find another village same as the first one and the people all fall down flat on they face and dravot say -- ` now what be the trouble between you two village ' and the people point to a woman as fair as you or I that be carry off and dravot take she back to the first village and count up the dead -- eight there be for each dead man dravot pour a little milk on the ground and wave he arm like a whirligig and ` that be all right ' say he then he and carnehan take the big boss of each village by the arm and walk they down into the valley and show they how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and give each a sod of turf from both side of the line then all the people come down and shout like the devil and all and dravot say -- ` go and dig the land and be fruitful and multiply ' which they do though they do not understand then we ask the name of thing in they lingo -- bread and water and fire and idol and such and dravot lead the priest of each village up to the idol and say he must sit there and judge the people and if anything go wrong he be to be shoot next week they be all turn up the land in the valley as quiet as bee and much prettier and the priest hear all the complaint and tell dravot in dumb show what it be about ` that be just the begin ' say dravot ` they think we be god ' he and carnehan pick out twenty good man and show they how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line and they be very pleased to do so and clever to see the hang of it then he take out he pipe and he baccy-pouch and leave one at one village and one at the other and off we two go to see what be to be do in the next valley that be all rock and there be a little village there and carnehan say -- ` send 'em to the old valley to plant ' and take 'em there and give 'em some land that be not take before they be a poor lot and we blood 'em with a kid before let 'em into the new kingdom that be to impress the people and then they settle down quiet and carnehan go back to dravot who have get into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous there be no people there and the army get afraid so dravot shoot one of they and go on till he find some people in a village and the army explain that unless the people want to be kill they have better not shoot they little matchlock for they have matchlock we make friend with the priest and i stay there alone with two of the army teach the man how to drill and a thunder big chief come across the snow with kettle-drum and horn twang because he hear there be a new god kick about carnehan sight for the brown of the man half a mile across the snow and wing one of they then he send a message to the chief that unless he wish to be kill he must come and shake hand with I and leave he arm behind the chief come alone first and carnehan shake hand with he and whirl he arm about same as dravot use and very much surprised that chief be and stroke my eyebrow then carnehan go alone to the chief and ask he in dumb show if he have a enemy he hate ' i have ' say the chief so carnehan weed out the pick of he man and set the two of the army to show they drill and at the end of two week the man can maneuver about as well as volunteer so he march with the chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain and the chief 's man rush into a village and take it we three martini firing into the brown of the enemy so we take that village too and i give the chief a rag from my coat and say ` occupy till i come ' which be scriptural by way of a reminder when I and the army be eighteen hundred yard away i drop a bullet near he stand on the snow and all the people fall flat on they face then i send a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or by sea at the risk of throw the creature out of train i interrupted -- how could you write a letter up yonder the letter -- oh -- the letter keep look at I between the eye please it be a string-talk letter that we would learn the way of it from a blind beggar in the punjab i remember that there have once come to the office a blind man with a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wind round the twig accord to some cipher of he own he could after the lapse of day or hour repeat the sentence which he have reel up he have reduce the alphabet to eleven primitive sound and try to teach I he method but i could not understand i send that letter to dravot say carnehan and tell he to come back because this kingdom be grow too big for I to handle and then i strike for the first valley to see how the priest be work they call the village we take along with the chief bashkaus and the first village we take er-heb the priest at er-heb be do all right but they have a lot of pend case about land to show I and some man from another village have be firing arrow at night i go out and look for that village and fire four round at it from a thousand yard that use all the cartridge i care to spend and i wait for dravot who have be away two or three month and i keep my people quiet one morning i hear the devil 's own noise of drum and horn and dan dravot march down the hill with he army and a tail of hundred of man and which be the most amazing a great gold crown on he head ` my gord carnehan ' say daniel ` this be a tremenjus business and we have get the whole country as far as it be worth have i be the son of alexander by queen semirami and you be my younger brother and a god too it be the biggest thing we have ever see i have be march and fight for six week with the army and every footy little village for fifty mile have come in rejoiceful and more than that i have get the key of the whole show as you 'll see and i have get a crown for you i tell 'em to make two of 'em at a place call shu where the gold lie in the rock like suet in mutton gold i have see and turquoise i have kick out of the cliff and there be garnet in the sand of the river and here be a chunk of amber that a man bring I call up all the priest and here take you crown ' one of the man open a black hair bag and i slip the crown on it be too small and too heavy but i wear it for the glory hammer gold it be -- five pound weight like a hoop of a barrel ` peachey ' say dravot ` we do not want to fight no more the craft 's the trick so help I ' and he bring forward that same chief that i leave at bashkaus -- billy fish we call he afterwards because he be so like billy fish that drive the big tank-engine at mach on the bolan in the old day ` shake hand with he ' say dravot and i shake hand and nearly drop for billy fish give I the grip i say nothing but try he with the fellow craft grip he answer all right and i try the master 's grip but that be a slip ' a fellow craft he be ' i say to dan ` do he know the word ' -- ` he do ' say dan ` and all the priest know it be a miracle the chief and the priest can work a fellow craft lodge in a way that be very like ours and they have cut the mark on the rock but they do not know the third degree and they have come to find out it be gord 's truth i have know these long year that the afghan know up to the fellow craft degree but this be a miracle a god and a grand-master of the craft be i and a lodge in the third degree i will open and we 'll raise the head priest and the chief of the village ' ` it be against all the law ' i say ` hold a lodge without warrant from any one and you know we never hold office in any lodge ' ` it be a master-stroke o ' policy ' say dravot ` it mean run the country as easy as a four-wheeled bogie on a down grade we can not stop to inquire now or they 'll turn against we i have forty chief at my heel and pass and raise accord to they merit they shall be billet these man on the village and see that we run up a lodge of some kind the temple of imbra will do for the lodge-room the woman must make apron as you show they i 'll hold a levee of chief to-night and lodge to-morrow ' i be fair run off my leg but i be not such a fool as not to see what a pull this craft business give we i show the priest ' family how to make apron of the degree but for dravot 's apron the blue border and mark be make of turquoise lump on white hide not cloth we take a great square stone in the temple for the master 's chair and little stone for the officer ' chair and paint the black pavement with white square and do what we could to make thing regular at the levee which be hold that night on the hillside with big bonfire dravot give out that he and I be god and son of alexander and past grand-master in the craft and be come to make kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet and specially obey we then the chief come round to shake hand and they be so hairy and white and fair it be just shake hand with old friend we give they name accord as they be like man we have know in indium -- billy fish holly dilworth pikky kergan that be bazar-master when i be at mhow and so on and so on _ the _ most amazing miracle be at lodge next night one of the old priest be watch we continuous and i feel uneasy for i know we would have to fudge the ritual and i do not know what the man know the old priest be a stranger come in from beyond the village of bashkaus the minute dravot put on the master 's apron that the girl have make for he the priest fetch a whoop and a howl and try to overturn the stone that dravot be sit on ` it be all up now ' i say ` that come of meddle with the craft without warrant ' dravot never wink a eye not when ten priest take and tilted over the grand-master 's chair -- which be to say the stone of imbra the priest begin rub the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he show all the other priest the master 's mark same as be on dravot 's apron cut into the stone not even the priest of the temple of imbra know it be there the old chap fall flat on he face at dravot 's foot and kiss 'em ` luck again ' say dravot across the lodge to I ` they say it be the missing mark that no one could understand the why of we be more than safe now ' then he bang the butt of he gun for a gavel and say : ` by virtue of the authority vest in I by my own right hand and the help of peachey i declare myself grand-master of all freemasonry in kafiristan in this the mother lodge o ' the country and king of kafiristan equally with peachey ' at that he put on he crown and i put on mine -- i be do senior warden -- and we open the lodge in most ample form it be a amazing miracle the priest move in lodge through the first two degree almost without tell as if the memory be come back to they after that peachey and dravot raise such as be worthy -- high priest and chief of far-off village billy fish be the first and i can tell you we scare the soul out of he it be not in any way accord to ritual but it serve we turn we do not raise more than ten of the biggest man because we do not want to make the degree common and they be clamor to be raise ` in another six month ' say dravot ` we 'll hold another communication and see how you be work ' then he ask they about they village and learn that they be fight one against the other and be sick and tired of it and when they be not do that they be fight with the mohammedan ` you can fight those when they come into we country ' say dravot ` tell off every tenth man of you tribe for a frontier guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drill nobody be go to be shoot or spear any more so long as he do well and i know that you will not cheat I because you be white people -- son of alexander -- and not like common black mohammedan you be _ my _ people and by god ' say he run off into english at the end -- ` i 'll make a damned fine nation of you or i 'll die in the make ' i can not tell all we do for the next six month because dravot do a lot i could not see the hang of and he learn they lingo in a way i never could my work be to help the people plough and now and again go out with some of the army and see what the other village be do and make 'em throw rope-bridge across the ravine which cut up the country horrid dravot be very kind to I but when he walk up and down in the pine wood pull that bloody red beard of he with both fist i know he be think plan i could not advise about and i just wait for order but dravot never show I disrespect before the people they be afraid of I and the army but they love dan he be the best of friend with the priest and the chief but any one could come across the hill with a complaint and dravot would hear he out fair and call four priest together and say what be to be do he use to call in billy fish from bashkaus and pikky kergan from shu and a old chief we call kafuzelum -- it be like enough to he real name -- and hold council with 'em when there be any fight to be do in small village that be he council of war and the four priest of bashkaus shu khawak and madora be he privy council between the lot of 'em they send I with forty man and twenty rifle and sixty man carry turquoise into the ghorband country to buy those hand-made martini rifle that come out of the amir 's workshop at kabul from one of the amir 's heratus regiment that would have sell the very tooth out of they mouth for turquoise i stay in ghorband a month and give the governor there the pick of my basket for hush-money and bribe the colonel of the regiment some more and between the two and the tribes-people we get more than a hundred hand-made martini a hundred good kohat jezail that 'll throw to six hundred yard and forty man-load of very bad ammunition for the rifle i come back with what i have and distribute 'em among the man that the chief send in to I to drill dravot be too busy to attend to those thing but the old army that we first make help I and we turn out five hundred man that could drill and two hundred that know how to hold arm pretty straight even those cork-screwed hand-made gun be a miracle to they dravot talk big about powder-shop and factory walk up and down in the pine wood when the winter be come on ' i will not make a nation ' say he ` i 'll make a empire these man be not nigger they be english look at they eye -- look at they mouth look at the way they stand up they sit on chair in they own house they be the lose tribe or something like it and they have grow to be english i 'll take a census in the spring if the priest do not get frighten there must be a fair two million of 'em in these hill the village be full o ' little child two million people -- two hundred and fifty thousand fight man -- and all english they only want the rifle and a little drilling two hundred and fifty thousand man ready to cut in on russium 's right flank when she try for indium peachey man ' he say chew he beard in great hunk ` we shall be emperor -- emperor of the earth rajah brooke will be a suckling to we i 'll treat with the viceroy on equal term i 'll ask he to send I twelve pick english -- twelve that i know of -- to help we govern a bit there be mackray sergeant-pensioner at segowlus -- many 's the good dinner he be give I and he wife a pair of trousers there be donkin the warder of tounghoo jail

lodge for what i have do as grand-master that -- and all the snider that 'll be throw out when the native troops in indium take up the martini they 'll be worn smooth but they 'll do for fight in these hill twelve english a hundred thousand snider run through the amir 's country in dribblet -- i would be content with twenty thousand in one year -- and we would be a empire when everything be shipshape i would hand over the crown -- this crown i be wear now -- to queen victorium on my knee and she would say : rise up sir daniel dravot oh it be big it be big i tell you but there be so much to be do in every place -- bashkaus khawak shu and everywhere else ' ` what be it ' i say ` there be no more man come in to be drill this autumn look at those fat black cloud they be bring the snow '

proper ' i remember something like that in the bible but if after see we as long as they have they still believe we be god it be not for I to undeceive they ' a god can do anything ' say i ` if the king be fond of a girl he 'll not let she die ' -- ` she 'll have to ' say billy fish ` there be all sort of god and devil in these mountain and now and again a girl marry one of they and be not see any more besides you two know the mark cut in the stone only the god know that we think you be man till you show the sign of the master ' i wish then that we have explain about the loss of the genuine secret of a master-mason at the first go-off but i say nothing all that night there be a blowing of horn in a little dark temple half-way down the hill and i hear a girl cry fit to die one of the priest tell we that she be be prepare to marry the king ` i 'll have no nonsense of that kind ' say dan ' i do not want to interfere with you custom but i 'll take my own wife ' -- ` the girl 's a little bit afraid ' say the priest ` she think she be go to die and they be a-heartening of she up down in the temple ' ` hearten she very tender then ' say dravot ` or i 'll hearten you with the butt of a gun so you 'll never want to be hearten again ' he lick he lip do dan and stay up walk about more than half the night thinking of the wife that he be go to get in the morning i be not by any means comfortable for i know that dealings with a woman in foreign part though you be a crown king twenty time over could not but be risky i get up very early in the morning while dravot be asleep and i see the priest talk together in whisper and the chief talk together too and they look at I out of the corner of they eye ` what be up fish ' i say to the bashkaus man who be wrap up in he fur and look splendid to behold ' i can not rightly say ' say he ` but if you can make the king drop all this nonsense about marriage you 'll be do he and I and yourself a great service ' ` that i do believe ' say i ` but sure you know billy as well as I have fight against and for we that the king and I be nothing more than two of the finest man that god almighty ever make nothing more i do assure you ' ` that may be ' say billy fish ` and yet i should be sorry if it be ' he sink he head upon he great fur cloak for a minute and think ` king ' say he ` be you man or god or devil i 'll stick by you to-day i have twenty of my man with I and they will follow I we 'll go to bashkai until the storm blow over ' a little snow have fall in the night and everything be white except the greasy fat cloud

billy fish here say that there will be a row ' ' a row among my people ' say dravot ` not much peachey you be a fool not to get a wife too where 's the girl ' say he with a voice as loud as the bray of a jackass ` call up all the chief and priest and let the emperor see if he wife suit he ' there be no need to call any one they be all there lean on they gun and spear round the clearing in the center of the pine wood a lot of priest go down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the horn blow fit to wake the dead billy fish saunter round and get as close to daniel as he could and behind he stand he twenty man with matchlock not a man of they under six foot i be next to dravot and behind I be twenty man of the regular army up come the girl and a strap wench she be cover with silver and turquoise but white as death and look back every minute at the priest ` she 'll do ' say dan look she over ` what be to be afraid of lass come and kiss I ' he put he arm round she she shut she eye give a bit of a squeak and down go she face in the side of dan 's flaming red beard ` the slut 's bitten I ' say he clap he hand to he neck and sure enough he hand be red with blood billy fish and two of he matchlock-men catch hold of dan by the shoulder and drag he into the bashkaus lot while the priest howl in they lingo -- ` neither god nor devil but a man ' i be all take aback for a priest cut at I in front and the army behind begin firing into the bashkaus man ` god a ` mighty ' say dan ` what be the meaning o ' this ' ` come back come away ' say billy fish ` ruin and mutiny be the matter we 'll break for bashkaus if we can ' i try to give some sort of order to my man -- the man o ' the regular army -- but it be no use so i fire into the brown of 'em with a english martini and drill three beggar in a line the valley be full of shout howling creature and every soul be shriek ` not a god nor a devil but only a man ' the bashkaus troops stick to billy fish all they be worth but they matchlock be not half as good as the kabul breech-loader and four of they drop dan be bellow like a bull for he be very wrathy and billy fish have a hard job to prevent he run out at the crowd ` we can not stand ' say billy fish ` make a run for it down the valley the whole place be against we ' the matchlock-men run and we go down the valley in spite of dravot he be swearing horrible and cry out he be a king the priest roll great stone on we and the regular army fire hard and there be not more than six man not count dan billy fish and I that come down to the bottom of the valley alive then they stop firing and the horn in the temple blow again ` come away -- for gord 's sake come away ' say billy fish ` they 'll send runner out to all the village before ever we get to bashkai i can protect you there but i can not do anything now ' my own notion be that dan begin to go mad in he head from that hour he stare up and down like a stuck pig then he be all for walk back alone and kill the priest with he bare hand which he could have do ` a emperor be i ' say daniel ` and next year i shall be a knight of the queen ' ` all right dan ' say i ` but come along now while

he take a second look at I he 'll say i look like a coney island chorus girl but what could i do -- oh what could i do with a dollar and eighty-seven cent at 7 o'clock the coffee be make and the frying-pan be on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chop jim be never late delium double the fob chain in she hand and sit on the corner of the table near the door that he always enter then she hear he step on the stair away down on the first flight and she turn white for just a moment she have a habit of say little silent prayer about the simplest everyday thing and now she whisper : please god make he think i be still pretty the door open and jim step in and close it he look thin and very serious poor fellow he be only twenty-two -- and to be burden with a family he need a new

dollar a week or a million a year -- what be the difference a mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer the magus bring valuable gift but that be not among they this dark assertion will be illuminate later on jim draw a package from he overcoat pocket and throw it upon the table do not make any mistake dell he say about I i do not think there be anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make I like my girl any less but if you 'll unwrap that package you may see why you have I go a while at first white finger and nimble tear at the string and paper and
