the vestry when we remember the beauty of the carve work which have thus be destroy and the elaborate skill which have be bestow on its execution we sympathy be deeply awaken for its fate indeed the most listless admirer of art as well as the antiquarian devotee have just cause to lament this accident especially as the taste and labor of we time fall far short of the olden glory of architecture

article of considerable graphic interest under the above title it be write by one bear within a stone 's throw of the castle and _ nus fallor _ by the author of the picturesque description of virginia water in the magazine for September last as the whole article be much too long for we space we have abridge it take care to retain the most characteristic portion of the writer 's very please reminiscence : -- my earliest recollection of windsor be exceedingly delightful i be bear within a stone 's throw of the castle-gate and my whole boyhood be pass in the most unrestrained enjoyment of the venerable and beautiful object by which i be surround as if they have be my own peculiar and proper inheritance the king and he family live in a plain barrack-looking lodge at he castle foot which in its external appearance and its interior arrangement exactly correspond with the humble taste and the quiet domestic habit of george iii the whole range of the castle its terrace and its park be place dedicate to the especial pleasure of a school-boy the park what a glory be that for cricket and kite-flying no one molest we the beautiful plain immediately under the eastern terrace be call the bowling green -- and truly it be as level as the smoothest of those appendage to suburban inn we take excellent care that the grass should not grow too fast beneath we foot no one molest we the king indeed would sometimes stand alone for half a hour to see the boy at cricket and heartily would he laugh when the wicket of some confident urchin go down at the first ball but we do not heed he majesty he be a quiet good-humoured gentleman in a long blue coat whose face be as familiar to we as that of we writing-master and many a time have that gracious gentleman bid we good morning when we be hunting for mushroom in the early dew and have cross he path as he be return from he dairy to he eight o'clock breakfast every one know that most respectable and amiable of country squire call he majesty and truly there be no inequality in the matter for he majesty know every one i have now no recollection of have when a child see the king with any of the appendage of royalty except when he go to town once a week to hold a levee and then ten dragoon ride before and ten after he carriage and the tradesman in the street through which he pass duly stand at they door to make the most profound reverence as in duty bind when they monarch look every inch a king but the bow be less profound and the wonderment none at all when twice a week as be he wont during the summer month he majesty with all he family and a considerable bevy of ancient maid of honor and half-pay general walk through the town or ride at a slow pace in a open carriage to the windsor theater which be then in the high-street reader it be impossible that you can form a idea of the smallness of that theater unless you have by chance live in a country town when the assembly-room of the head inn have be fit up with the aid of brown paper and ochre for the exhibition of some hero of the sock and buskin vulgarly call stroller at the old windsor theater she majesty 's apothecary in the lower box might have almost feel she pulse across the pit my knowledge of the drama commence at the early age of seven year amidst this royal fellowship in fun and most loyally do i laugh when he majesty lean back in he capacious arm-chair in the stage-box shake the house with he genuine peal of hearty merriment well do i remember the whole course of these royal play-going the theater be of a inconvenient form with very sharp angle at the junction of the center with the side the stage-box and the whole of the left or op side of the lower tier be appropriate to royalty the house would fill at about half-past six at seven precisely mr thornton the manager make he entrance backwards through a little door into the stage-box with a plate candlestick in each hand bow with all the grace that he gout would permit the six fiddle strike up god save the king the audience rise the king nod round and take he seat next the stage the queen curtsy and take she arm-chair also the satin bill of they majesty and the princess be then duly display -- and the dingy green curtain draw up the performance be invariably either a comedy and farce or more frequently three farce with a plentiful interlarding of comic song quick suett and mr mattock be the reign favorite and about 1800 elliston and fawcett become occasional star but quick and suett be the king 's especial delight when lovegold in the miser drawl out a pin a day 's a groat a year the laugh of the royal circle be somewhat loud but when dicky gossip exhibit in he vocation and accompany the burden of he song dicky gossip dicky gossip be the man with the blast of he powder-puff the cachinnation be loud and long and the god prolong the chorus of laughter till the echo die away in the royal box at the end of the third act coffee be hand round to the court circle and precisely at eleven the performance finish -- and the flambeau gleam through the dimly-lighted street of windsor as the happy family return to they tranquil home there be occasionally a good deal of merriment go forward at windsor in these olden day i have a dim recollection of have dance in the little garden which be once the moat of the round tower and which washington irving have be please to imagine exist in the time of jame i of scotland i have a perfect remembrance of a fête at frogmore about the beginning of the present century where there be a dutch fair -- and haymake very agreeably perform in white kid glove by the belle of the town -- and the buck-basket scene of the merry wife of windsor represent by fawcett and mr mattock and i think mr gibb under the colonnade of the house in the open day -- and variegated lamp -- and transparency -- and tea serve out in tent with a magnificent scramble for the bread and butter there be great good humor and freedom on all these occasion and if the grass be damp and the young lady catch cold and the sandwich be scarce and the gentleman go home hungry -- i be sure these little drawback be not to be imputed to the royal entertainer who delight to see they neighbor and dependant happy and joyous a few year pass over my head and the scene be somewhat change the king and he family migrate from they little lodge into the old and spacious castle this be about 1804 the lath and plaster of sir william chamber be abandon to the equerry and chance visiter of the court and the low room and dark passage that have scarcely be tenant since the day of anne be make tolerably habitable by the aid of diligent upholstery upon the whole the change be not one which conduce to comfort and i have hear that the princess weep when they quit they snug boudoir in the queen 's lodge windsor castle as it be be a sad patchwork affair the late king and he family have live at windsor nearly thirty year before it occur to he to inhabit he own castle the period at which he take possession be one of extraordinary excitement it be the period of the threaten invasion of england by napoleon when as be the case with france upon the manifesto of the duke of brunswick the land bristle the doings at windsor be certainly more than commonly interesting at that period and i be just of a age to understand something of they meaning and partake the excitement Sunday be especially a glorious day and the description of one Sunday will furnish a adequate picture of these of two or three year at nine o'clock the sound of martial music be hear in the street the blues and the stafford militia then do duty at windsor and though the one have see no service since minden and most undeservedly bear the stigma of a past generation and the other be compose of man who have never face any danger but the ignition of a coal-pit -- they be each a remarkably fine body of soldier and the king do well to countenance they of the former regiment george iii have a troop of he own and he delight to wear the regimental of a captain of the blues and well do he burly form become the cock hat and heavy jack-boot which be the fashion of that fine corps in 1805 at nine o'clock as i have say of a Sunday morning the noise of trumpet and of drum be hear in the street of windsor for the regiment parade in the castle quadrangle the troops occupy the whole square at about ten the king appear with he family he pass round the line while the salute be perform and many a rapid word of inquiry have he to offer to the colonel who accompany he not always do he wait for a answer -- but that be after the fashion of royalty in general he pass onward towards st george 's chapel but the military pomp do not end in what be call the upper quadrangle in the lower ward at a very humble distance from the regular troops be draw up a splendid body of man clepe the windsor volunteer and most gracious be the nod of royalty to the well-known draper and hatter and bookseller who have the honor to hold commission in that distinguished regiment the salutation however be short and onward go the cortege for the chapel bell be toll
