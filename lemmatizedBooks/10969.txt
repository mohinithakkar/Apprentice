produce by juliet sutherland greg chapman and pg distribute proofreader -lrb- transcriber 's note : the spelling and punctuation inconsistency of the original have be retain in this etext -rrb- ski-running by katharine furse gbe rrc with map and four illustration from photograph 1924 preface so many excellent book have be write about ski-ing that it be perhaps presumptuous on my part to think that there be room for another mr vivien caulfeild in he how to ski and ski-ing turn as well as mr arnold lunn in he ski-ing for beginner cross country ski-ing and alpine ski-ing have cover all the ground of the technique discover up to date what future discovery and invention may be make require new book no one know as yet have it not be for the help and coaching these two exponent of ski-ing have give to I personally i should never have be able to enjoy the sport to the extent i do now because i should probably have be content to continue run across country fall whenever i want to stop and use a kick turn at the end of my traverse they enthusiasm and example give I new idea of the standard i want to attain and they unfailing kindness and advice help I to get nearer to it than i could otherwise have do the standard still lie away up out of reach as age undoubtedly tell against the ski-runner and the perfect christianium in deep soft snow round tree grow close together on a steep slope must be do in heaven rather than on earth by people who be nearer fifty than forty much experience of coaching beginner convince I that there be still room for a book such as i hope to make this -- a book contain only the simple answer to question put to I during the last three year when i have be responsible for run the ski-ing in various centre the object of such coaching be to raise the standard of british ski-ing and it be satisfactory to realize that other nation include the swiss already marvel at the fair average of we runner this be specially remarkable when it be remember that most british runner can only afford a bare fortnight or three week ' winter holiday in the alp and that they be not always in training when they arrive ski-ing be a sport which exercise every nerve and muscle as well as lung as be soon discover during the first 100 foot climb or the first fall in deep snow on the nursery slope in addition to my conviction that there be room for another book for beginner my love of the alp which have be my home for the greater part of my life also induce I to try to show something of the real object of ski-ing namely get to the silent place which can only be reach on ski realize something of the strength and immensity of nature at she grimmest profit by the wonderful atmosphere of the mountain to say nothing of the beauty of a alpine view on a fine day the greatest pity be that most british winter holiday-maker can only go out for christmas this be admittedly the worst time from the point of view of weather at low altitude rain often fall early in January turn the snow into slush and reduce the ski-er to despair after the 15th January the weather be usually better and in February the day be longer and finer the best time of all for a alpine holiday be usually February and early march my advice to novice who be not tie by christmas holiday be to come out about the 20th January when the hotel be less crowd the day longer the snow more certain and all the condition more favourable some of my own best ski-ing day have be late in march when the crocus and gentian be already open to the sun on the southern slope and a soldanellum might be find along some tiny stream few experience can equal a spring day among the alp when the wealth of flower begin to show in the valley while mass of good snow still lie on the northern slope or on the ridge above 6000 foot early start be necessary these day as the sun blaze after 11 be but nothing can equal the bodily comfort and well-being enjoy at midday lunch at the top of some peak or pass bask in the blaze and imagine the run down cool slope no ski-runner who have not be out in late February or march realize the joy and comfort of late ski-ing the hotel will remain open as long as client stay to make it worth while and all the mid-winter amenity will be keep up if they be want in recommend place and equipment i intend boldly to confine myself to the place i have be to and to the equipment i have use or of which i have have report from people i trust this be a somewhat risky determination as there be great competition among the various centre and business firm which cater for ski-runner my reason be that the endless advertisement must be extremely confuse to the novice who do not know what to believe and who may sometimes be let down by a glowing description of some place or gear which prove to be quite unsuitable the old hand will find nothing new in this book not even controversy about the nomenclature of turn or as to which foot should carry the weight in a christianium my own view of ski-ing turn be that they be a means to a end and not a end in themselves and that the ski-runner who be content to spend week on the nursery slope perfect one turn have waste almost week when he might be enjoy what ski enable one to reach among the mountain above at the same time every beginner should be content to devote two or three of he first day to the nursery slope learn the element of good ski-ing before dash off on a excursion as i know from painful experience there be much to unlearn in what one have pick up by the light of nature scramble down a run crash and sit on one 's ski may be great fun the first day but be tiring and humiliating as time go on it be infinitely preferable to learn the knack of ski-ing tidily and thereby keep dry and in a few day run well enough thoroughly to enjoy a day out with its slow climb to the top of some peak or pass and then the slide down under control this be where test be so valuable most people undoubtedly enjoy competition and if the passing of the turn be make a necessary qualification for the time run of the 3rd class test most beginner will determine to learn they and then to try the run and have successfully pass that wear a badge badge-hunting like pot-hunting may not be a very worthy object in itself but if it encourage people to become proficient in a beautiful sport let we give we weakness of character free play and achieve the result it lead to the test of the federated ski club of great britain have do more to raise the standard of we run than anything else imaginable the beginner be wise who choose a center where the ski-ing be well organize and where he can be certain of get coaching as well as excursion suit to he standard as nothing be lonelier than go to a place where he be dependent on he own initiative neither be anything more irksome to the good runner than to be ask to admit a stranger to he party who may keep he back and spoil he run this will be further allude to in the chapter on etiquette and if a beginner wish to be popular i advise he strongly to adhere to the law a strict code have be adopt mainly as a result of the suffering from pertinacious runner who put they standard higher than be admit by other where the ski-ing be organize test sort different individual into they different standard and run be plan accordingly so that the novice be not over-strained and the experienced runner be not hinder by too big a party the beginner should also choose a center where there be a railway to help he a great deal of precious time and energy may be waste in a short holiday when all climbing have to be do on ski the first run be tire enough without the additional fatigue of climb and go up in a funicular or railway open up number of run which would be far too energetic for most people who be not in training contents preface history of ski-ing cost of a ski-ing holiday in winter ski-ing centre clothing equipment care of equipment the element of ski-ing etiquette snow and light fall test guide and ski instructor map and find the way avalanche accident the attraction of ski-ing summer ski-ing appendix : regulation of the british ski test index list of illustration from photograph by e gyger adelboden switzerland achievement map of switzerland the uphill track powder snow spring ski-running history of ski-ing very little be know of the early history of ski-ing doctor henry hoek in he book der schi give a very interesting chapter trace the use of ski back to the earliest record he think that ski be use by central asian race thousand of year bc and long before they be use in europe accord to he book the word schus be derive from the gothic skaidan the german scheiden latin scindere and so on all these word mean split or divide and might be use to describe the split wood of which ski be make or they action in divide or separate the snow through which they pass doctor hoek further say that early record show how ski-ing be a sport practice by knight and he quote rognwald of orkney -lrb- 1159 ad -rrb- who state that he could run on ski the swedish bishop magnus write in 1533 of the way in which the norwegian use ski for traverse country when hunting during the swedish and norwegian war in 1808 the norwegian army include 2000 ski runner but the use of ski do not seem to have come into warfare again until the great war of 1914-1918 when the swiss austrian and italian all use they on the alpine frontier the modern and fully record use of ski begin about 1843 when the sport become really popular in norway and a ski race be run at tromso in 1861 a ski club be found and in 1863 a exhibition be hold there the swede also take up ski-ing as a sport at about this time but ski do not seem to have penetrate into central europe until after 1870 when a french doctor try they at chamounix in 1871 the first introduction of ski into switzerland which i have be able to trace be by the monk of st bernard who obtain some pair from norway in 1883 thinking that they might be useful in they work of mercy rescue pedestrian who be in difficulty on the pass about 1887 colonel napier come to davo bring with he a norwegian man-servant and a pair of ski mythical tale be tell of the way this man slide down the slope from châlet to hotel carry a tea tray on he shoulder i have only a vague recollection of see he perform but when colonel napier leave davo the same year he give the ski to I to play with they be very similar to modern ski but have a rigid binding make of sealskin with no means of tighten or loosen it not know better i use to try to run in gouty or rubber snow-boot which slip about inside the binding so that i have absolutely no control this do not make much difference as i know nothing of the art and only use the ski as a freak on day off from toboggan i know nothing of wax and when the ski stick they stick and i think it a poor game when they slide i sit down and i think it a poorer game it never enter my head that i could traverse across any slope and so i always go straight down and only by a fluke do i ever stand then tobia branger who be a great sportsman and keep a sport shop at davo import several pair of ski and practice the art himself about this time sir arthur conan doyle and mr and mr hugh dobson take up the game and we spend many hour practise on the slope behind davo dorf the richardson brother who have be to norway come to davo about 1893 bring with they knowledge of the sport and soon gather round they a keen lot of disciple the davo english ski club be form and from now on ski-ing spread rapidly throughout switzerland in the meantime ski club be also be form in the black forest and other part of germany as well as in austrium doctor nansen in he book about greenland describe the use of ski for arctic exploration and he account fire a great many more people to try the game i advise anyone who wish to know more of the development of ski run to read doctor hoek 's book der schi publish in 1922 as he give a long account of the first form of club as well as the gradual adoption of ski as a means to winter climbing and further a useful list of the literature on the subject after the first beginning in 1899 the swiss become energetic and enthusiastic runner the child could be see on barrel stave with a pair of old boot nail to the center into which they slip they foot with they own boot on it be not a particularly graceful game in those day runner arm themselves with pole some 8 foot long on which they lean heavily when run downhill this school soon give way to the more modern school which prove that the carrying of two stick be better than one only a great many book on the technique of ski-ing follow each other fast and furiously -- zdarsky and lilienfeld caulfeild and lunn roget hoeg and other all contribute to the controversy on technique now there be innumerable ski club with they own year-book and the sport be so well launch not only in europe but also in australia new zealand east africa and america and elsewhere throughout the world that there be but little chance of its ever again die out the british ski club include the ski club of great britain the british ski association the alpine ski club and the lady ' ski club these be federate in one council and work harmoniously together for the furtherance of british ski-ing this be a very incomplete history but i feel that it be better to limit it to a few date and to await the publishing of a more extensive history of ski-ing in english than now exist cost of a ski-ing holiday in winter the expense of a winter holiday differ accord to the place choose the hotel and the organization to whose care you commit yourself if any any figure i quote be approximate and be subject to change owe to fluctuation in exchange etc if you go to a large hotel with all its luxury you will pay anything from # 1 a day upward and this may not include sport tax etc the smaller hotel will probably make arrangement for pension at about 16 franc or even 14 franc or less per day but may not be very comfortable and comfort be important in winter it be particularly necessary that the hotel should be well heat as the dry of ski-ing clothes be a very important point as i say in my preface the beginner will be wise who choose a center where the sport be highly organize and where he will be certain to find coaching and arrangement make for test and run as well as a railway or funicular to help with uphill work only in such a place can he learn enough ski-ing in a short time to enable he to begin to enjoy tour before he return home panting to come out again and continue the experience one joy of ski-ing be that you usually begin again where you leave off and have not to relearn what you learn the winter before have live in the alp off and on for forty-six year and have see all sort of different way of run thing i realize at mürren where i first learn to ski properly four year ago how much the beginner profit by go to such a center otherwise he may waste infinite time in ski-ing without skill and with only half the enjoyment it be not only at mürren that the coaching be give though mr arnold lunn 's system of help everyone originate there pontresina provide it also and kloster and other place as well but it seem to I that mürren be the mother of up-to-date british ski-ing the cost of a fortnight at a good hotel come to about # 15 include sport tax afternoon tea and heat the journey about # 7 return 2nd-class or # 9 1st-class in addition this can be reduce by travel 3rd class in england and switzerland where at any rate it be quite possible to travel 3rd class on any mountain railway in addition to the expense of pension at a hotel and of the journey at least # 5 will probably be require for local railway fare subscription to entertainment fund bath gratuity hire of ski lesson guide etc # 30 ought to cover a fortnight and # 35 three week and a good deal less can be reckon if a smaller hotel be choose most of the sport hotel will now quote a inclusive price per day to which at least 10 per cent should be add to the estimate for gratuity to servant this be the recognize scale at which gratuity be give by most people though they might often amount to more when any special service have be render local railway fare on mountain railway be high because of the great expense of keep they open but most of these railway offer special sport ticket either for a definite period as a season ticket or for a certain number of journey for instance on the muotta muraigl funicular railway above pontresina 24 ticket single journey can be obtain for the sum of fr 50 while the ordinary single fare be frs 475 or more than twice the reduce fare the cost of equipment must be add to the estimate but this need not be very great as ski-ing boot and glove be the only item which can not usually be use at home by man -- trousers or breeches be a additional cost for woman people sometimes complain that a swiss winter holiday be very costly but i believe it can compare favourably with a golfing holiday at home ski-ing be the cheapest possible sport if runner be content to foot it uphill instead of use railway or sledge during the month of February and march special low term can probably be obtain in the hotel as they be anxious to prolong they season and will do anything they can afford to induce british sportsman to come out then February and the first half of march be the best time from every point of view so that no one who can take he holiday then and who do not want all the gaiety of the social side will regret go during these month in old day before the war this be fully appreciate and the season use to last three month instead of a short six week as it do now ski-ing centre in this chapter i propose only to describe such of the larger swiss place as i know personally or by reputation there be a great many smaller place where equally good or even better ski-ing may be find but as my book be mean mainly for beginner it seem preferable to adhere to the advice give in the preface and for I to mention only such centre as provide comfort in the hotel and good coaching and organization of tour as well as facility for play other game most people when they go to the alp for they first winter visit wish to try all the different sport in order to see which they like best and there seem to I to be no question but that the all-round sportsman get the most out of he holiday there may be day when ski-ing be not possible or when a few hour on the rink or toboggan run offer a relief to a stale ski runner it be usually only the really keen enthusiast of some year ' standing who can spend the whole day waxing or oil he ski or pore over a map planning future run when choose a place the first objective be a good supply of snow this do not seem to depend entirely on height though there be more likelihood of find it above 4000 foot than below that height above 5000 foot there be less chance of thaw and rain -- the bugbear of all winter sportsman who can only go out for the christmas holiday i have know a winter when snow have lie in one district at 5000 foot and not at 6000 foot in another but this be exceptional the higher you go the more hope you have of snow as a rule and also of frost which be so necessary to keep the snow in good condition the centre i recommend be mainly arrange in group geographically take the canton of graubunden or the grison first because it be the country i love best have spend most of my early life there the height be take from murray 's handbook kloster 3970 foot above the sea this seem to I to be one of the very best winter sport centre it be a small village with two large and a few small hotel it usually have good snow and be protect from wind there be plenty of sun but north slope provide good run near the village as well as on the parsenn the rhaetische railway help runner to get the maximum of downhill run for the minimum of climb especially open up the whole parsenn district to those who want a long day 's tour with only some 1-1\/2 hour ' climb the nursery slope be good and there be plenty of open ground near the hotel for practice the ski-ing be well organize by the local club and there be 1st-class ski instructor as well as certificated guide the rink be well keep and the kloster run of old renown be maintain in good condition for toboggan or bob there be quite a good ski map to be obtain locally but the ordnance map should be use as well ski can be hire locally davo 5015 foot above the sea be one of the first place at which winter sport begin and it still offer almost everything desire by the ski runner the fact that davo be much visit by invalid deter a great many people from go there for fear of infection as a matter of fact they be probably a good deal safer there than in some other place where there may be a few invalid but where the same precaution regard disinfection may not be take two or three hotel be keep open for sport people only and at these the life be just the same as in all the other well-known centre davo be within very easy reach by the rhaetische railway of all the parsenn run the side valley fluelum dischma and sertig all offer innumerable good run to the energetic runner who do not object to climb and there be endless nursery slope it be one of the few place whence tour can still be plan over almost unlimited snow-field when a track be a rare sight except on the few ordinary short run or on the parsenn the local club organize the ski-ing and good ski instructor and guide be available the rink be excellent and the schatzalp and kloster run be maintain for bob and toboggan there be a good ski map show all the run round davo but the ordnance map should be use as well ski can be hire locally arosa 5643 foot above the sea be say to be excellent for ski-ing but i do not know it well there be no railway to help runner much invalid go there as well as to davo but the same precaution be take as at davo there be rink and a very good run for bob and toboggan lenzerheide about 4500 foot above the sea have a fine reputation for easy ski-ing there be no railway to help it and all uphill work have to be do on ski i have never be there in winter-time but know that a great many runner speak well of lenzerheide the ski-ing be organize and good instructor and guide be available there be probably a good rink but of this i have no personal knowledge in the engadine -lrb- 1 -rrb- valley which be also part of graubunden the follow centre can be recommend pontresina 5916 foot above the sea the nursery slope be very extensive and offer short run to the beginner the muotta muraigl funicular convey runner up some 2000 foot when after a easy climb of one hour a really good run may be obtain back to pontresina the rhaetische and bernina railway open up a large number of good run in the engadine valley and also up the bernina and morteratsch district open wood-running as well as glacier-running under safe condition can be enjoy near home and pontresina be undoubtedly one of the best place for people who want to perfect they cross-country run under different condition there be no short afternoon run end in the village but the railway enable people to enjoy all the tour of the upper engadine the longer tour such as those over the kesch glacier to bergün or davo be unequalled so far as i know have spend two winter at pontresina i can recommend it from intimate knowledge but only for the real beginner or for the expert who want amusing run it be not the place for ski-er who only want a short run between lunch and tea first-class guide and good instructor be available the ski-ing be organize and plenty of coaching be give to member of the public school alpine sport club excellent rink and short bobbing and toboggan run be maintain a useful guide describe all the run in the upper engadine can be obtain locally ski can be hire locally st moritz 6037 foot above the sea celerina 5750 samaden 5669 be all serve by the rhaetische and bernina railway and have the same ski-ing facility as pontresina they rink and toboggan run be well maintain those at st moritz be of course among the best in switzerland good guide and ski instructor be available but so far as i know ski-ing be not in any way organize for beginner in these place ski can be hire locally zuoz 5617 foot above the sea be also a good ski-ing center further down the inn valley there be only two or three hotel and the village be quite unspoilt it provide the most wonderful open south slope for ski-ing and north slope be also within reach across the valley zuoz lie almost at the foot of the climb for the kesch run and also tap the country further down the inn valley behind schul so far as i know the ski-ing be not organize in any way but guide be available there be rink but zuoz be still one of the old-fashioned place life would be quiet there campfer about 5850 foot above the sea and sils-marium and silvaplana about 5950 foot above the sea lie further up the inn valley beyond st moritz no railway exist to help ski runner and the slope be somewhat steep and apt to be precipitous except in the fex thal south of sils-marium which have lovely snow-field campfer and silvaplana tap the country lie behind the julier pass but as no railway help here the tour entail a lot of climb and a drive on the way home maloja 5935 foot above the sea lie at the upper end of the inn valley never have be there in winter i can not describe it during that season it be a beautiful place in summer and may open up a good deal of country which be not much track as there be no village and only one large and two small hotel the post road run zigzag down into italy and be say to provide a very fine bob or toboggan run a rink be keep open now that maloja be be open as a winter center every amenity for a winter holiday will probably be offer the bernese oberland be also one of the best ski-ing district in switzerland mr a lunn have produce a very helpful guide to all the ski-ing tour and also with the help of herr gurtner a first-class ski-ing map use the ordnance map as its basis so that only one map need be carry mürren 5368 foot above the sea seem to I to be one of the very best centre for beginner as they receive so much help and there be number of short run aid by the allmendhubel funicular which run up some 700 foot above the village from the top of this several short run end in the village or on the berner oberland railway which bring the tired novice home without much effort the berner oberland and the wengern alp railway also enable people to get the best of the scheidegg run down to wengen or grindelwald the ski-ing be very highly organize at mürren and beginner receive a great deal of help and encouragement there be guide and instructor the rink and bob run be admittedly among the best in switzerland ski can be hire locally wengen 4187 foot above the sea be a lovely place with the most beautiful view of the jungfrau it face south but provide two or three nice home run which remain in good condition except for the track of innumerable runner the wengern alp railway be usually open to the scheidegg though after a very heavy snow-fall it may take a few day to clear this enable people to enjoy all the run down to grindelwald return to wengen by train the ski-ing be organize and there be good guide and instructor rink and a most amusing toboggan run provide for off-day ski can be hire locally grindelwald 3468 foot above the sea be too well-known as a summer resort to need much description here its main fault in winter be that the sun disappear behind a mountain for about a hour and a half in the middle of the day this ensure perfect ice on the rink and do not much affect the ski runner who can climb beyond the shadow for lunch i can not resist mention my good friend frau wolther 's tea-shop as one of the great attraction at grindelwald draw many a ski runner over the scheidegg from mürren and wengen frau wolther 's unfailing welcome and hospitality be a great joy at the end of a hot wet run and the fact that a change of clothes can be send round by train to she care be a great comfort to those come from afar there be plenty of short ski run above grindelwald and the scheidegg railway be keep open as far as alpiglen to help with the climb on a long day 's tour there be good guide to be have some of whom be probably ski instructor the rink be first-class and both bob and toboggan run be keep up ski can be hire locally lauterbrunnen about 3000 foot above the sea people who know switzerland well may wonder why i include lauterbrunnen in my list but i have often wonder equally why no one make it a center for ski-ing though the sun may not shine there for long hour the fact that it lie at the junction of the berner oberland railway the mürren funicular and the wengern alp railway seem to I to make it a very possible ski-ing center there be good hotel and the herr gurtner whose home lauterbrunnen be may be depend upon as two of the best ski runner in switzerland and two of the most active pusher of ski-ing to do they utmost to help any british runner who decide to try lauterbrunnen all the mürren wengen and grindelwald run be within easy reach of lauterbrunnen and if the railway will sell special ticket the cost of the journey should not be prohibitive to my mind the fact that one could stop at lauterbrunnen after a day over the scheidegg would be a great comfort as the last journey up to mürren or wengen be apt to be tiresome after a long run if often repeat in any case it seem to I that runner might do worse than write to herr gurtner at lauterbrunnen and ask for particulars at any rate for the christmas holiday when most of the popular village be very full and the hotel rate be high good guide be available at lauterbrunnen kandersteg 3835 foot above the sea i have never be there except in summer when i know it well one great attraction about kandersteg be that it can be reach by a through train from calais or boulogne from the ski-ing point of view i think kandersteg might be disappointing to the runner who hope for short run there be excellent nursery slope and the loetschberg railway probably open up quite a lot of country guide be obtainable rink and toboggan run be maintain adelboden 4450 foot above the sea be say to be a excellent ski-ing center but i do not know it personally have only just be up there in summer time there be no railway to help so that all climbing have to be do on ski it be within reach of very good tour throughout the lower bernese mountain the british championship be hold there in 1923 which show that the ski-ing be organize and good guide be no doubt obtainable adelboden be a well-known winter sport center the rink and toboggan run be probably excellent but never have see they i can not vouch for they ski can be hire locally saanenmoser 4209 foot above the sea lie at the top of the low pass between the simman valley above zweizimme and the sarine valley run down to gstaad and chateau d'oex there be only the one sport hotel and no village it be a most charming place within reach of ski-ing in all direction among the lower bernese mountain the montreux oberland railway run down both side of the pass help a little by carry ski runner home after some long excursion but all uphill work have to be do on ski the slope be gradual and the saanenmoser run be perfect for people who have learn the element of ski-ing in some active place and who then want to gain confidence by free running over easy country the ski-ing be not organize when i be at saanenmoser in 1921 and neither guide nor ski instructor be obtainable there be only a tiny rink and no toboggan or bob run ski can be hire at gstaad gstaad about 3800 foot above the sea lie below saanenmoser and be a large village with number of hotel the ski-ing be very much the same as at saanenmoser and the railway serve the same purpose only help runner a little i have never stay at gstaad but have hear it well speak of as a winter sport center offer all the usual attraction ski can be hire locally i believe and guide be obtainable \* \* \* \* \* the rhone valley offer a few centre which i do not know in winter among those i have hear most about the follow be outstanding villar 4000 foot above the sea be reach by a railway from bex it lie on slope face south and i gather that the ski-ing there be somewhat limit the rink be say to be good and the usual winter attraction be offer montana 5000 foot above the sea be reach by a funicular railway from sierre like villar it also lie on slope face almost south but there seem to be good ski-ing among the mountain behind morgin in addition to the above i would mention morgin which i do not know personally but of which i have hear a good deal morgin be 4406 foot above the sea and be particularly well-known for its rink which seem to be first-class the ski-ing be say to be good but not extensive there be no railway diableret 3849 foot above the sea in a valley go from aigle among the mountain to the east might be a good center for ski-ing but i only know it in summer so far as i have hear it offer the usual attraction in winter but there be no railway to help much in other district of switzerland the follow place should be mention although i have never be to they in winter time engelberg 3343 foot above the sea in the stan valley near luzern be often well speak of as a winter center though it be liable to thaw and shortage of snow from what i know of it in summer time i should think that most of the surround slope be too steep and precipitous to allow of much free running but the titli group probably provide some open country and there be a short funicular above the village there be excellent hotel and all the usual attraction be offer andermatt 4738 foot above the sea lie in the gothard valley above the tunnel and be easily reach in winter by express train stop at goeschinen whence a short mountain railway run up to andermatt i have only be there in summer and from what i saw should imagine that andermatt be subject to a great deal of wind the slope all look somewhat steep and be bare of forest so that they might be somewhat dangerous on account of avalanche there be no railway to help ski runner but andermatt might offer quite a lot of good run to experienced people i know nothing of the other attraction for the all-round winter sportsman but have little doubt that andermatt which be a go-ahead place do all it can to satisfy they there be of course innumerable other place which may be good ski-ing centre not only in switzerland but also in germany austrium and the italian tyrol the jura mountain and place such as splugen and schul in graubunden might open up new district there be much new country to explore and i have only pick out for notice the few place to which i have be myself or of which i have hear from people i trust my description may not always be appreciate by people who have special affection for any one center but i have only try to put forward my own impression for the guidance of any beginner who may feel in a quandary as to what place to choose so much depend on weather condition : if there be plenty of snow and if the sun shine almost every place be delightful if on the other hand a thaw settle in or fog descend on the mountain or a blizzard blow the snow about or worst of all if rain fall reduce the snow to slush nobody will be satisfied anywhere luckily for ski runner even a few inch of wet snow will provide practice so that they suffer less than other winter sportsman when the weather be unfavourable one thing can invariably be depend upon in switzerland namely a warm welcome from the hotel and every endeavor make to ensure the comfort and enjoyment of they client no country in the world lay itself out more for the satisfaction of its visitor and no holiday can beat a winter holiday among the alp when the condition be favourable and the sportsman determine to enjoy themselves footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : there be apt to be a certain amount of wind in the whole engadine but its height counterbalance this by usually ensure that there be not a thaw even at christmas time -rrb- clothing clothing should be light smooth warm loose and when button up it should leave no gap it be better to wear several thin warm garment than one thick one for the simple reason that go uphill one want to peel to the minimum sit on top of a mountain or ridge in a wind one want to pile on everything one possess and go downhill one want a medium amount all of which will button up so that the snow can not penetrate inside ordinary country clothes will usually suffice for the first season especially if they be of smooth material which will shake off the snow man usually wear smooth wool or cotton gaberdene coat and trousers and a peaked guide 's cap they trousers either tuck inside the upper of they boot and should be sufficiently long to do so without pull out in a strained turn or fall or they may be button round outside the boot or fold and tie on with norwegian puttee or swank breeches and stocking may be worn but long puttee should be avoid as they constrict the muscle and stop the circulation thus tend to frost-bite which be a serious danger at high altitude sweater unless wear under a coat when practise or run downhill be quite unsuitable as the snow get into the stitch and then melt and the sweater become a sponge and often stretch till it be more like a woman 's coat-frock than anything it be before a ski-ing suit should be well provide with pocket all of which should have flap to button over and keep the snow out also to keep the contents in money and other thing carry loose be apt to fall out in a downhill fall once this winter when get up from a fall i see what look like a useful leather boot-lace lie in the snow i pick it up and find it be the bootlace attach to two stop-watch which i have be use for a test as one can not tie one 's money up with a boot-lace it be wise to carry it safely and cheat the goatherd who may surely make a profitable live out of the various treasure lose by ski-er which appear on the slope after the snow melt woman need very much the same sort of clothing as man either trousers or breeches whichever they prefer these should be make to measure in order to fit well and be wear with brace to pull they up thick boy ' stocking should be worn to pull up over the breeches if woman would only realize how sloppy they nether garment sometimes look and how really horrid breeches look hang loose over silk stocking indoors they would surely be more careful to study and copy a man 's neat leg before they venture into man 's apparel one sometimes see woman 's coat make with innumerable fancy button or tab as decoration these only add to the weight which no one would want to carry and also look out of place so do fur trim ski-ing clothes can not be too simple elaboration be easily obtain by bright-coloured glove scarf or swank coat should be make with a belt which can be buckle tight before the descent a sit fall in soft snow be apt to provide the runner with a good dose of snow inside the coat for the same reason breeches and trousers should be cut somewhat high above the waist woman need just as many pocket as man and i strongly advise two large side pocket and two smaller breast pocket outside the coat as well as two inside breast pocket -- all with flap to button over a feel hat be now usually worn by woman ski runner who find the brim a comfort on sunny day while it also protect the eye when ski-ing through a blizzard incidentally it help to prevent snow from go down the neck in a head-first fall a chin-strap may be require for fast run boot be perhaps the most important part of a ski runner 's outfit they must be water-proof and large enough to hold two pair of sock in addition to stocking the sole must be so stout that they will not buckle or bend under the instep when the ski binding be tight heel must be low and should be slightly groove at the back to hold the binding i have no hesitation in say that most of the ski-ing boot sell in england prove to be unsatisfactory such firm as lillywhite and fortnum & mason which make a study of suitable equipment may be trust and almost every swiss bootmaker now sell trustworthy boot for ski-ing i always buy my own boot from och who have shop at geneva montreux zürich and st moritz they can be rely on for at least two or three long season if one be careful to oil the upper with boot oil occasionally and never to oil the sole except with linseed oil which be say to harden they on the whole however the sole be safest leave untouched boot should never be dry on a radiator or by a fire personally i like hook rather than eyelet and i find that leather boot-lace last longer than other there be much discussion as to whether ski boot should have nail in the sole or not they tend to wear away the aluminium or linoleum plate fix to the ski under the foot but on the other hand they be almost indispensable when ski be carry across a hard steep slope or down a icy path it seem to I that it be positively dangerous to go any real ski tour with unnailed boot unless crampon or spike to fit on to the heel be carry new plate can easily be fit to the ski when nail have wear through they but nothing can help the ski-er down a steep icy path or across a hard frozen slope on smooth sole unless he carry special contrivance to fix to he boot people be now try crepe rubber sole but they be not solid enough to bear the strain of tight binding unless fix to the usual thick leather sole when the whole become too thick for comfort my experience for several winter with beginner be that the sole of most english boot buckle as soon as they be subject to the tight pull of a leather binding few thing be more irritating to a beginner than to find that he binding will not hold on he boot over and over again in a run down he ski come off and he delay he party by have to stop and put it on again still it will not hold even though he tie it on with string then he realize that he boot be buckle the sole arch up under the instep and the binding become loose slip off the heel there be no cure for this and the only solution be to use a toe binding such as the new bb or a solid binding such as the ellessen or lilienfeld instead of a heel binding as most hire ski have the huitfeldt heel bind it be essential to ensure that boot be of the very best glove be another very important item of clothing they should be waterproof this be easy to say but very difficult to obtain the rub of the stick on the palm of the hand tend to sodden almost any material snow also get inside during a fall and then of course even the waterproof glove come home wet the best glove be paw make of thick horse-hide and line with wool they should have long gauntlet wide enough to pull up over the sleeve and they should be join by a string go round behind the neck under the coat collar long enough to allow of free use of the hand and this string should have another string join it across the chest it be often necessary to slip off a glove and if they be not safely hung round the neck they fall in the snow which promptly run inside or they may be drop and lose sock be a matter for individual choice some people like goat 's - hair sock which have many of the quality or disquality of a hair shirt they be prickly and therefore perfect as a counter-irritant under very cold condition but far too irritating for ordinary wear i be much amuse in a london shop last winter when i hear a ski-ing expert advise a lady not to buy those repulsive goat 's - hair sock when she have buy what he advise i say i have come especially to buy a repulsive pair of sock he immediately explain that he have advise the lady not to get they because they only have two pair leave and he do not want to sell they he let I have a pair and the only time i wear they i think with amusement of he advice and explanation the lady be undoubtedly well out of they and i hope never to use they again some people swear by they so all taste must be allow for it seem to I better to wear two thin pair of sock in addition to stocking rather than one pair of thick sock if these seem to fill the toe of the boot too much the toe part of one pair of sock can be cut off the remainder be worn as a anklet swank or norwegian puttee may be use to tie the sock above or over the boot so as to prevent the snow from get inside or shooting anklet may also be use grant that they be large enough to go over the wide upper of a ski boot as well as the sock footgear for ski-ing be not elegant but as every one wear the same nobody need feel shy it be another reason for buying in switzerland ski boot of the right size buy in a london shop look so gargantuan that people will often insist on have a smaller pair than be really useful when the time come to wear they spare clothing should invariably be carry on any run beyond the nursery slope as in case of a accident and delay in fetch help a runner who be hurt may be badly frost-bitten this of course only apply to high place during the month of December January and early February when the thermometer may often register 32 ° of frost or more after the sun go down when choose equipment it be wise therefore to remember spare clothing which should include a cardigan or jersey a dry pair of woollen glove a dry pair of sock or stocking a warm cap of some sort to cover the ear and a scarf all these should be choose for a combination of warmth and lightness a wind-jacket be often recommend some people carry a thin silk or oil silk or even chamois leather or paper waistcoat to put on under they coat when a wind blow this be not necessary for any but long tour in midwinter a very useful sail-cloth coat specially make for ski-ing can be buy in most swiss sports-shop and be excellent the great thing to remember about clothing for ski-ing be that climb uphill you will probably get very hot and perspire freely to stop in a bite wind in this condition without put on spare clothing be obviously risky it be difficult to ski freely in heavy thick clothes so that everything should be warm and loose and make of wool except perhaps the wind-jacket or the swiss coat which can be worn over a sweater cotton or linen underclothing will probably soon be discard but this be a personal matter and need not be deal with here equipment the minimum amount of equipment should be purchase before go out the swiss shop be just as well provide with ski-ing necessity as the british and it be expensive to take out heavy luggage most swiss hotel will gladly store ski or gear of any kind through the summer and these can be post or forward by rail to any place the runner choose for the follow season clothing have be deal with in a former chapter here i propose to describe the equipment which i know from experience to be useful ski can be buy in england or in switzerland one or two english firm such as lillywhite which really take pain to obtain the best possible quality of goods may be trust to provide norwegian ski but there be also several maker of good ski in switzerland ski should be make either of hickory or ash other wood such as birch and walnut have be try but these do not appear to make as satisfactory ski as hickory or ash hickory be heavy so that the beginner will do well to get ash ski in the first instance they average length should be the height of the runner with he arm extend above he head the tip of the ski when stand upright be in the palm of he hand and he finger just able to bend over it when the novice become more proficient he may like to try longer or shorter ski but the average length be best to begin with good maker such as bjornsted in bern or staub at zurich may be trust to make they ski right proportionately and the buyer need not worry about they width or depth so long as the length be right there be a great deal of difference in the line of a ski as there be in a boat flat one be ugly compare with those which hump along the center but they be also lighter it seem to I wise for the beginner to hire he first ski rather than to buy they most of the sport shop in the different centre be very oblige and will allow they client to try two or three pair of ski in order to experience the difference between they they should not curve up too abruptly in front and they should be about one inch apart in the center when lay flat one against the other this spring add greatly to the comfort of run and should be maintain by the ski have a block of wood between they when put away for the summer or even when lay by for two or three day the question of binding be a very serious one broadly there be three different type : -lrb- 1 -rrb- toe binding by which only the toe of the boot be attach to the ski -lrb- 2 -rrb- solid binding with a sole attach to the ski -lrb- 3 -rrb- leather heel binding -lrb- 1 -rrb- i have try two form of toe binding -- the bb and the bbb and give they up for the follow reason firstly i think it a dangerous binding there be practically no give at all so that in a bad fall when the foot be twist under one if the ski do not move the leg have to give way and may be break i think surgeon agree that there be more accident as a result of wear a bb binding than any other -- so that it seem to I much better to start with another type of binding and then go into the bb later if prefer another drawback be that as the whole pivotal pressure in a turn be bear by the toe iron when a bb binding be wear the toe iron be always be force open not only that but the spring on the ski which hold the hook on the boot be so strong that it tend to pull the boot through the toe iron so that gradually the boot get longer and more pointed and the spring no longer hold all this criticism may be due to prejudice on my part but i have try the bb with enthusiasm and only give it up because i be convince that a heel binding be more satisfactory since i try it two or three new form of toe binding have be put on the market the simplest of which seem to I to be the davo form which be merely a strap fix to the ski with a iron loop at the end to fit into the hook on the boot and a ordinary huitfeldt spring buckle to fix it firmly -lrb- 2 -rrb- solid binding the commonest form of these be the ellesen lilienfeld and bilgerus but as i have never try any of they i can say nothing about they -lrb- 3 -rrb- heel binding there be two main form of these -- the lap thong and the huitfeldt the lap thong be merely a long strap of raw hide or leather a loop be draw through the hole under the toe iron the long end be take round the heel and through the loop then back round the heel and through a slit in the other or short end the long end be then carry under the foot and round the instep and finally tie off with a knot this have be improve upon by a ring and buckle be add to save slit the leather or knot the end the huitfeldt binding be a thick double-leather strap which buckle round the whole foot and have a strong spring to pull it taut when the binding have be slip on to the heel this be the usual binding on hire ski i have try both these binding and now wear a scheer binding which be a combination of the two -- the long lap thong with buckle and also a spring similar to the one tighten a huitfeldt bind the chief drawback to a lap binding be that it take time to put on so that finger get very cold and clumsy when fitting it before a run down from a height the trouble about a huitfeldt binding be that it be thick and clumsy and the buckle stick out so that they catch in the snow when run the scheer binding avoid these drawback it be put on just as easily as a huitfeldt and the thin thong lie so closely along the boot that there be nothing to catch in the snow it be very easily lengthen or shorten when the leather contract or stretch and this be also a great comfort this binding be new may not yet be obtainable everywhere but it be well worth try to get the huitfeldt and scheer binding both tend to give a little in a strained fall so that the foot slip round and the leg be usually save toe iron pass through the ski under the toe and come up either side to hold the foot in place they should be carefully fit and with a view to this the boot should be leave overnight with the sport shop and the ski fetch next day the boot should lie quite straight along the ski if the toe iron do not fit properly the boot will be cock-eye on the ski and too much free play may take place i have often see beginner take advantage of this to stick they heel out and off the ski into the snow to help they uphill or to act as a brake downhill they will rue it downhill however as the foot should be firmly hold on the ski or control will be impossible toe iron be sometimes make of very soft metal these be usually attach to ski hire out by the sport shop in order that they may be easily fit to the many different shaped foot of the hirer when get toe iron fit to one 's own ski it be wise to ask for strong one as the soft iron give too freely to the pivotal action of the foot in turn and tend to be constantly open and become loose cast-iron toe iron be often use in conjunction with toe binding in order to avoid the difficulty of the iron be force open by the boot be pull through by the spring these iron have one great fault they have to be screw on to the ski and be very cold under the foot this may be consider imagination but i believe it to be true in which case it may be prejudice the toe iron be join over the toe by a leather toe-strap pull through and buckle the iron should be so high that this strap do not press at all on the boot or restrict the free play of the toe the whole binding should be so fitted that it be possible to kneel down on one 's ski foot plate be nail on the ski under the foot these be usually make of linoleum or aluminium i prefer a thick plain aluminium plate and find that the snow do not stick to it when the ski have be choose stick have to be provide a pair of stick should be use one be carry in each hand they be usually make of hazel or bamboo the latter be light but tend to split i always use hazel which be cheaper and very satisfactory stick should be so long that they reach to just above the waist and should not be very heavy though strong stick be necessary for all real tour they should have pad leather knob at the top as these prevent the stick from slip out of the hand and be drop during a run as well as save the hand from blister when the stick be much use in practise lift stem or jump turn wooden knob be often use but these tend to get coat with ice which wet the glove and be uncomfortable a leather or webbing thong be pass through the stick or nail under the knob as a loop to hang they up by but should never be put round the wrist except for uphill work as the wrist might easily be break in a bad fall if the stick be attach to it my great idea be to get rid of my stick in a fall as i once impale my leg on the spike of my stick in a somersault i be thankful that the spike be a short one and not one of the newfangled aluminium spike which would have penetrate much further and might easily have do damage to the bone only a short spike be necessary -- just long enough to go into crusted snow and hold the disc round the bottom of stick should be large about seven inch in diameter and they should be loose so that they will lie flat with the ski when pack i prefer they put on with a thong which pass through the stick and be cross backwards and forwards across the disc allow of plenty of free play in the disc by this mean the thong do not cut where it pass through the stick disc be often make almost solid and then fix to the stick with a iron hasp which be apt to snap or to split the stick stick hire out with ski usually have small disc and no knob and most beginner will soon wish to possess they own pair which only cost about twelve franc a word of advice here keep you stick in you bedroom even in the best ski-ing circle stick sometimes disappear -- and once you own stick go you be tempt to take anybody else 's and so the mischief go on the rucksack be a very important item of equipment it should be waterproof and large even if you do not intend to carry much nothing be more uncomfortable than a small full rucksack perch like a football on one 's back by the time a packed lunch and a cardigan as well as some spare gear be stuff into the sack it swell two outside pocket and one large inside division be indispensable keep wax scraper string etc in one outside pocket ready to hand map in the other leather shoulder strap be the best as they do not cut the shoulder in the same way as webbing i once hunt a great many london shop in vain for a rucksack with leather shoulder strap they all have thin webbing which soon turn into a wisp and hurt the muscle of the shoulder the leather strap should finish on a ring at the top which should be attach to the top of the rucksack by a leather tab firmly sew on this be a much safer system than run the string which pull up the top of the sack through the shoulder strap at the back because the pull on the string chafe it and gradually cut through it some experienced runner prefer the bergan rucksack on a aluminium frame it be unquestionably heavier than the ordinary sack but the frame rest on the hip help to distribute the weight and it be say to be less tire to carry another joy about it be that the frame keep the sack off the back so that there be a air space and the usual poultice effect of a ordinary rucksack be avoid there be many different type of rucksack to be have in switzerland they should be waterproof and as the waterproof material be very expensive now a good serviceable sack cost at least fr 1700 to 2500 the better rucksack have strap fix outside for carry one 's coat or possibly sealskin -lrb- sohm skin should be carry inside the sack -rrb- i advise people to carry the various contents of they sack in different bag or tie up in handkerchief this may sound old-maidish but it be a trick i learn from swiss climber and i be very thankful anyone who have hurriedly search he sack for some particular bit of gear know the sort of haystack which result while if first-aid equipment sealskin spare binding emergency ration mend outfit etc be all carry in separate differently color bundle inside the sack endless time be save this be particularly worth consider in a blizzard when finger be cold and nothing can be find skin be use for climb uphill on tour they consist of long strip of sealskin which be attach to the run surface of the ski the hair lie towards the back of the ski catch in the snow and prevent the ski from slip backwards which be a great help and saving of energy the ski can be keep in good slip condition with oil or wax and when the skin be take off at the top of a run very little further preparation be necessary there be two form of sealskin : -lrb- 1 -rrb- sohm skin which be attach to the ski with wax -lrb- 2 -rrb- those make up on canvas with strap to fix they to the ski the latter can usually be hire by the day for about fr 300 from the local sport shop and cost about fr 2000 to buy most runner now use the sohm skin the great gain be that one can run downhill almost as well when they be still on so that on a tour with one or two short descent _ en route _ the ski may be leave on wax be of many kind and some runner not content with what they buy prefer to mix they own the wax most use in switzerland be skiolin both hard and soft sohm ' with red yellow or green label and parafine i have find that hard skiolin iron into the run surface of the ski with a hot iron provide a good surface sohm ' wax be a climb wax be apt to stick to some kind of snow and if sohm ' skin have be use it be wise to scrape all this wax off before the run down and to polish the ski with parafine wax if it need a finish on hard snow this be not necessary some wax be use as climb wax instead of skin but as different sort be need for different type of snow they complicate life almost more than be worth while a very good permanent surface on ski be obtain by oil they repeatedly with linseed oil allow they to dry thoroughly between each coat of oil this be a somewhat lengthy process and a impossible one if the ski be in daily use but it be much the best method at the beginning or end of the season the best sohm ' skin be dark gray or black and they cost about fr 25 the leather surface should be carefully wax with green label sohm ' wax before start on a expedition the wax should be very thinly spread and it be wise to get this job do at leisure overnight and to lay the skin together with they wax surface touch and to keep they in a warm room but not near a heater or stove when start on a excursion wear the skin wind round you body under you coat so that they remain warm and supple until require then wax the run surface of the ski with yellow label sohm ' wax as sparingly as possible it should be spread smoothly and without lump when put on the skin lay they along the ski from the tip towards the back and run you thumb down the line of the center groove in the ski while you press the skin on evenly over the whole ski new skin be apt to shrink after use so it be better not to cut the strap which slip over the tip of the ski the best plan be to make a second slit in this strap and slip it on and then if the skin be still too long turn the end part up over the ski at the back sticking it on with wax then when the skin have be use for two or three day it be easier to decide what length the strap should be have put you skin on lay the ski flat on the snow so that the skin will freeze on sealskin must never be dry by a heater or stove as the heat shrivel they and they be ruin when not in use they can be keep roll up in a bag and should be carry in the rucksack rather than hang on outside frozen skin be very difficult to attach a scraper should invariably be carry when ski-ing even on the nursery slope these be make of aluminium and the best type have a groove which will fit into the groove of the ski and scrape this as well as the flat surface as ice be apt to adhere there also some runner carry attach to they belt a norwegian hunting knife in its case this be excellent for scrape the ski and for any purpose for which a strong knife may be want but it always seem to I that it would be a nasty thing to fall on a strong ordinary knife should invariably be carry the swiss military knife be the best possible as it seem to include practically everything necessary a really good one cost about fr 1200 or fr 1400 though inferior steel may be have for a great deal less it should have a ring and be attach to the belt dark spectacles or goggles should be include in equipment a mend outfit be often need and at least one member of every party go on tour should carry something with which to mend broken ski there be many pattern of spare ski tip on the market all of which may be useful in certain circumstance but i have no doubt that the wooden ski tip be the best it be just a ordinary front part of a ski about two foot long and plane off so that it will lie close to the broken ski this be fix on by metal clamp which be make on purpose and can be buy in most winter sport shop hole at different interval fitting the clamp which should be put on lengthwise may be bore beforehand in the ski tip in order to save time when the tip may be need on tour the gimlet supply with the clamp be usually a poor one and i always carry a spare gimlet a little larger than be necessary as it be difficult to make the hole in exactly the right place in a broken ski cold and clumsy hand have always to be reckon with when ski-ing the clamp be somewhat roughly make be apt to break so that one should carry at least five pair in put they on take care not to drop the little square nut off the bolt into powder snow as it sink at once and may be irretrievably lose other make of spare ski tip include one make of cast aluminium produce by lillywhite who will probably improve upon it as at present it seem to I to be too flat the method of fix it be however a good one the swiss sport shop also keep light tip make of tin and copper which be affix by various method but they be usually too short and thin to be more than a makeshift if a ski be break near the front the wooden ski tip when properly adjust enable one to run any distance quite comfortably and even permit of turn it be clumsy to carry except in a bergan rucksack a long narrow pocket might be sewn diagonally across the back of a ordinary rucksack in which to carry it but i be afraid it would be uncomfortable i try such a pocket vertically and find it quite intolerable and even dangerous in some fall mend outfit must also include a spare binding and a toe strap as well as some string and cord wire and two or three leather boot-lace the best spare binding to carry be a lap thong as it be easier to push through than a huitfeldt unless a thin single strap be carry for the front part of the latter in any case a bit of wire facilitate the pull through of the thong or strap a inexperienced runner who have not use a lap thong should try fitting one at home before depend on it in emergency as it be a little tricky to put on at first runner go any distance on tour should carry some sort of first-aid equipment it need not be elaborate but should include bandage a clean dress -lrb- a first field dress be the best and most compact -rrb- iodine and adhesive plaster and some vaseline or boracic ointment even a scratch will go on bleeding on a cold day and be very tiresome accident be miraculously few and far between in ski-ing consider the fall and the large number of people who ski but they happen occasionally and it be as well to be prepare the list of gear could be prolong to any extent as what to carry in my rucksack become a enthralling hobby everyone will eventually decide what he think he ought to have in order to come home with a free conscience after any eventuality another runner have suggest my add a pair of small pincers a pocket tool outfit match or fusee a electric torch scissors weight have to be consider as the more the ski runner carry the greater the effort but there be undoubtedly great satisfaction in feeling that one have everything which might be helpful in any emergency if three or four runner be go together the whole gear can be distribute among they but this make it more necessary than ever for the party to keep together as a spare ski tip or similar luxury be no use at the bottom of a run when the accident be near the top even if one do not need all the gear oneself it seem better to be prepare to help other people who be in difficulty the following list show firstly what i think every runner go several mile beyond home ought to carry and secondly what a great many runner carry in addition : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a strong knife with corkscrew leather punch tin opener etc -lrb- 2 -rrb- a ski tip gimlet and mend outfit -lrb- 3 -rrb- wire -lrb- 4 -rrb- string and cord -lrb- 5 -rrb- spare binding and toe strap -lrb- 6 -rrb- dark yellow glass -lrb- triplex be safest -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- siren or strong whistle -lrb- 8 -rrb- emergency ration of some sort such as chocolate raisin date -lrb- 9 -rrb- spare clothing include cardigan or sweater dry glove dry sock scarf cap to cover ear -lrb- 10 -rrb- first-aid equipment -lrb- 11 -rrb- map -lrb- 12 -rrb- wax and scraper some runner carry all these thing and the follow besides : match lantern -lrb- folding -rrb- or electric torch aneroid compass pincers hammer brandy thermos with some hot drink a great many people will laugh at I for suggest all this gear but i do so out of experience when one have ski-ed some year with a good many people one look back with amusement to the number of time when one have be ask to provide any of the above people go out without spare clothing food first-aid equipment repair outfit something happen and they at once look round to see where they can borrow now borrow be not part of the game and every runner should be independent it be easy when go on tour to divide up the gear so that every member of the party carry he share it be not necessary for each member to carry the whole of what i have show let each carry enough to feel self-reliant and let the party carry enough not only for they own need but also for any other runner in distress whom they may come across ski-ing should be a unselfish sport at a certain center one winter word be bring in at about 330 pm by a member of a party of three that one of he companion be lie in the forest about a mile away with a badly broken leg three runner dash off from the nursery slope with the man who bring the news to show they the way i post a friend to watch where they enter the wood while two other strong runner fetch clothing and hot drink in a thermos somebody else call up the rettung chef and the doctor all this help be mobilize within a hour meanwhile the man be lie in the snow in the wood with a badly broken lower leg the sun have set and the temperature very low not one of the party have any spare clothing or gear of any sort a sensible man who have be one of the first three to go off from the slope tell I afterwards that if hot drink and clothing have not come soon he be convince that the man would have die as it be he be nearly unconscious and he pulse have nearly stop dark come on and the doctor and the ambulance sledge do not arrive instead of go the way the other have disappear they try a route they think easier and take too high a line in the forest the tree muffle sound and though both party be shout and whistle they hear nothing till at about 630 pm one of the watcher hear a runner near and go off after he in the dark and luckily find he this man be scout for the doctor and sledge and finally bring they to the scene of the accident at 7 pm by this time some one or two of the watcher have go home nearly frozen leave all possible clothing on the injured man three other stay and rub he without intermission which probably save he life and limb the doctor have bring a splint which he put on by light of a electric torch and the man be take to the station and send off at once to the hospital now all this happen within a mile of home where help be handy such accident happen several mile from home may have far more serious consequence and every ski runner who scoff at the precaution of people more fussy than themselves may very likely have the life or limb of someone else on they mind when have they be a little more fussy they might have save it not only that the selfish runner who travel light may well be a serious burden to other and risk they safety and comfort through he own foolhardiness ski-ing be a game which sort people out and where the character of people like sailor who know what it be to face the element show up well against the civilian whose greatest risk in life at home be cross a street at a busy hour people may ski for year without get hurt and the experienced runner probably hurt himself less than the beginner yet it be the experienced runner who carry the gear the beginner it be who usually scoff and take risk not only to himself but to the people who have to go out to look for he when he be benighted or hurt care of equipment ski call for a good deal of attention if one take the game seriously people who only come out for a fortnight and who hire any pair of ski which they treat as they would the floor of a omnibus have no appreciation of how much attention ski need if they be to be really dependable in all sort of snow new ski should be well-oiled with two or three coat of linseed oil which should dry between each coat i think hickory need the oil just as much as ash but some people disagree with this the oil hardly go beyond the surface of the wood and soon rub off on hard snow but it preserve the wood as well as give a slip surface so long as it last newly oil ski when dry need very little further attention for a few day as they will run well over all sort of snow when there be no time to oil because the ski be in daily use wax can be iron in most good sport hotel now provide a bench with a electric iron in a special heated and light room where the ski-runner can work happily after tea or on a snowy day if no such room be provide it should be clamour for because the waxing of ski be a much more difficult job without it the patent iron para be helpful where no electric iron be provide para be a oblong perforated metal box with a handle which screw in a lump of meta -lrb- solid spirit fuel -rrb- be light and put inside and the iron become hot and be rub up and down the ski while wax be press against it and dribble on to the wood almost any wax can be iron in but i think the hard black skiolin be best for the purpose be careful to wax the groove as well as the flat surface of the ski when ski be put away for the summer the upper as well as the run surface should be oil or re-varnish in order to preserve the wood leather binding may be well oil with special boot oil to keep they supple ski should never be keep in a hot place as they be apt to warp but they should be keep dry when put away boot should never be dry by a fire or on a heater but should be store in a cool place they need occasional oiling of the upper with some sort of boot oil dubbin may also be use and be good for fill place such as between the sole and the upper the sole should never be oil except perhaps with linseed oil which harden the leather i think the wisest plan be to leave the sole dry but if snow ball on they they can be wax with ski wax this be often specially necessary on the heel if boot be put outside the bedroom every night the porter will oil they automatically in most good hotel sealskin should be wrap up in newspaper and store in a cool place when put away moth will ruin they if leave open and heat crumple they make they useless a friend tell I that when she seal ski -lrb- webbing one -rrb- be ruin by be put near a fire she recover they by soak they in salad oil she be certainly use they quite happily afterwards the element of ski-ing this book do not profess to be in any way a textbook of the technique of ski-ing as state in the preface my only idea in write it be to provide a answer to a good many question which have be ask I every year anyone who deal with a great many people know that there be always some fifty stock question which can quite easily be answer by fifty stock answer what i say in this chapter about the first run will be the barest element of ski run beginner should obtain either arnold lunn 's book or those of vivien caulfield and concentrate on the theory of turn i have know two or three novice who though they have never even see ski before by dint of study the technique in theory before they come out be able immediately to apply it in practice most beginner find however that the moment the ski start slide all theory be throw to the wind instinct of self-preservation prevail and they sit down kind friend look on say that be because you be lean backwards you must lean forwards off they start again carry out the advice they ski stick for some reason and down they go head foremost -- the most difficult fall of all to get up from and the most aggravating the great thing be not to do too much the first two day after come out the height affect people more than they realize at first and great energy due to the brace air be often follow by great lassitude most people be not in training and ski-ing try the lung nerve and muscle of the fittest as the whole system seem to be bring into play a few hour ' practice on the nursery slope be usually enough for the first two or three day and if at the end of the week the beginner seem to be fall more than when he first begin half or even a whole day off ski will produce wonderful result in better balance and general fitness have choose ski and ensure that the toe iron and binding fit you go out to some gentle slope of about 10 ° with soft snow if possible set you ski at right angle to or across the fall of the slope before put they on because ski be quite apt to go off alone if point down hill it be as well to realize this from the first and to adopt the habit of prevent it in the way i suggest because many a run have be ruin by a ski descend alone to the valley below leave its owner to get home as best he can on one leg even if it only go down some 100 or 200 foot the friend who go after it and bring it back often have a good deal to say and you be lucky if the ski have not strike a rock or tree and get break in its independent run it be no good get angry on these occasion i once watch a boy on a distant slope who have be oblige to descend some hundred of foot after one of he ski when he get hold of it in a temper he start beat it with he stick and continue do so till the stick nearly break while on the subject of runaway ski i may as well warn you also against a runaway rucksack i put mine down at my foot on a steep hard-crusted slope while i take off my coat one day and the rucksack start slide slowly down below we the party be make up of beginner and we have rope on we ski instead of skin so that no one could catch it up till it stop about 200 foot below we to add insult to injury at the same time somebody drop a 50-ct bit at the same moment and this dance off down into the valley race the rucksack and beat it hollow but to return to the start the ski be safely lie across the slope and you be go to put they on put on the lower one first never forget this because it will often prevent a runaway ski if the slope be very steep and hard you should stick the other ski upright in the snow above you in order that it may remain well in hand while you put on the first you will probably find it impossible to put on you ski with glove on if you lay these on the snow they will undoubtedly get snow inside they the safest place to put they be one on each stick stick upright on either side of you or tuck they into you belt or pocket when you have you ski and glove on and everything else be hermetically seal you be ready to start slide or traverse slowly across the slope before go straight down it this will give you time to get the feeling of ski which be clumsy at first slide one foot forward then the other but do not lift they now try a kick turn and come back across the slope to the top and face straight downhill keep you ski closely side by side one foot lead by about twelve inch and push yourself off with you stick try to imagine that the ski be only a move staircase and that all you have to do be to stand upright on they and let they do the rest if you slope be only 10 ° and there be nothing steeper below you the ski will not do much indeed in deep snow they may refuse to move at all in which case try push yourself along with you stick the great thing be always to want to run faster than you be go and therefore only to choose slope where you feel that you can keep up as fast as the ski go it be a mistake to start immediately down such a steep slope that the ski run away with you at the same time it be also a mistake not to increase the angle of you slope as soon as you can compete with it stand upright press the knee together and try to feel that there be a spring in you knee let one or other foot lead so that if the ski stop the front foot take you weight and prevent you plunge forwards and if the ski suddenly plunge forward the back foot be equally ready to take the weight and prevent you from sit down whatever you do avoid the hideous doubled-up position of a runner who bend at waist and knee with foot parallel and far apart look like a note of interrogation and leave what we call tram-line track by he track shall a ski-er be judge look back and see the line you have leave if you two foot have leave two track with more than six inch apart in soft snow you must not be contented in a good track the two foot should leave one track but some binding make this impossible so that unless you be wear a toe binding you need not worry about a gap of two or three inch between you foot this only apply to soft snow run on hard or crusty snow it be almost impossible and also dangerous to keep the foot together when you have begin to feel at home on ski go off to a much steeper slope and try traverse choose a slope which have flattish ground below so that you have a easy out-run and nothing to make you nervous remember for you comfort that if you go across a slope lead with the upper foot and with most of you weight on the lower foot -- stand upright and if anything lean a little outwards away from the slope you can traverse across almost any slope without difficulty so long as it be not too steep for the snow to bear you weight without slip itself nothing be more comforting to a beginner than to realize this it take away the feeling of giddiness and give confidence but it need learning and should be practice at once the first tendency of ski on a steepish slope be to point more and more downhill till finally have intimidate the beginner into allow they to go they own way they plunge straight down and the beginner collapse to counteract this put more weight on the heel and less on the toe while traverse this will push the back part of the ski down and the front part uphill across the slope and if do sufficiently the ski will stop and you have begin to get some feeling of control when traverse standing upright the inner edge of you ski will bite into the snow try lean inwards as you will do by instinct and you will find you foot slip away down the slope and you will gracefully recline full length against it it be exactly the same when walk across a steep grass slope in summer most of the slip be due to lean towards instead of away from the slope as you get more confidence in you run try lifting one ski off the ground as you slide along or even take off one ski and try run on the other lift a ski will often save a fall for instance if the ski get cross just lift the upper one and put it down beside the other again while run it be perfectly easy and yet i have know people who after week of practice dare not lift a ski off the ground while move only because they have never try it as routine practice whatever you do by way of practice do it first on one foot and then on the other or you will become a right or left-footed ski-er and it will take age for you to feel equal confidence in either foot this apply especially to turn beginner will often go on practise a turn on the right foot till they can do it and then have to re-learn it completely on the left foot straight run downhill be mainly a question of confidence and balance as say before it be better at first to avoid straight run down a steep slope because the ski may go so fast that the beginner be quite incapable of keep up with they and a fall at very high speed be somewhat upset and may temporarily shake you nerve choose a low gradient of about 12 ° or 15 ° where you can see the out-run which should be on to level ground or even a gentle rise so that the ski gradually pull up of they own accord soft snow be the easiest and confidence may soon be win in this stand upright or bend the knee but do not bend at the waist you should feel as though on spring and you want you weight should be well forward over you foot so that you can keep up with the ski stand in tube or bus face the way you be go and not hold on to anything be very good practice at home you will notice that a bus conductor usually give with the movement of the bus so that he be prepare for whatever it do so with ski-ing look ahead and see what the ground be like and then suit you balance to what be likely to occur as the ground rise or fall this soon become automatic but it need think out at first when the snow be hard practice side slip because it will help you out of many difficulty and once you know the feeling of it you will find that it replace the downhill side-stepping which be so slow on hard snow it be possible to go down broadside on by merely stand on one 's ski and turn one 's outer or lower ankle outwards and one 's inner or upper ankle towards the other so that the ski be lie flat on the snow instead of the edge bite into it push off with you stick from the slope above you and weight you heel or you toe accord to whether the ski be sink in front or behind have confidence keep upright lean away from the slope and let you ski slide and do not blame I if you suddenly slide into a soft patch of snow which stop the ski dead and you fall head downward this be all in the day 's work if the surface of the snow be uniformly hard you will slip down without difficulty seriously side slip be a huge help and should be learn at once mr caulfield give first-class instruction which be easy to follow in detail when go uphill never try to climb steeper than be easy if the ski be slip back you be go too steep and should turn off and traverse instead no time be save by too steep a climb the man who go easily get to the top first while the other clamber up almost on all fours get hot and exhaust and have gain nothing if i be lead a elementary run uphill i can soon pick out the experienced runner by the line they take and the pace at which they climb the puffing panting stumble people who forge ahead herring-boning or turn they ankle over they ski so as to get a grip with they boot be not include in my experienced runner another hint for uphill work be that when traverse a slope the ski should be edge so that the inner edge of the ski bite into the slope a ski with its whole surface flatten to the slope be bind to slip especially on hard snow by stand upright as you go uphill and keep the ankle straight the ski will be edge in the right way a quick way of get up a steep slope be side-stepping as you stand with you ski horizontal across the slope lift the upper foot and place it on the slope a few inch higher then lift the lower foot and place it beside the upper you will soon be able to do this while advance across you traverse at the same time but it be hard work and should only be use for short climb side-stepping be a very good way of climb but should be avoid when descend except when approach a narrow gap in a fence or cross a stream where the approach be steep i have know a party almost benighted by a beginner who have discover the joy of side-stepping and propose to descend some 1000 foot by this safe method instead of slide in the proper way allow eight inch to each side-step how many hour would it take to descend 1000 foot a further hint which may be useful for uphill work if the ski be slightly lift at every push forward they tend to stick instead of slide back always stand upright when climb and keep the weight well on the heel people tend to bend forward and this add greatly to the effort and the ski be more likely to slip back on long climb sealskin be usually use on the ski the hair lie towards the rear stick into the snow and prevent the back slip while when the ski push forward they lie flat and offer no resistance the best uphill track be the one which keep go at the same angle every good walker know how tire it be to go up and down across country when gully have to be cross it be disappointing have get up a certain height to lose all that be gain by go down again so it be even more with ski-ing when uphill work be really more arduous than walk mr caulfield give a very helpful description of a good uphill track and ski tend to teach the beginner how to keep the angle as they slip so easily downward the moment the uphill direction be alter when go uphill make up you mind what point you want to reach in the distance and what line will take you to it most easily and then go for it steadily keep the same angle all the way so far as be possible and choose you place for turn very carefully before you reach they follow a experienced leader teach a great deal about the art of set a uphill track and the criticism of the rest of the party follow when the leader lose height soon make one want to avoid comment etiquette in organize ski-ing centre a perfectly good code of etiquette be grow up as the result of experience so many novice pour out on to the slope with no knowledge of the game that notice be even post on the board in the hotel give a few of the main point of the law one such notice run as follow : -lrb- 1 -rrb- ensure that you take you own ski stick etc when you start out it be wise to mark stick and they be safest keep in bedroom -lrb- 2 -rrb- never join a private party unless invite -lrb- 3 -rrb- only join the advertised tour the test for which you have pass -lrb- 4 -rrb- the slower mover have the right of way the faster mover must avoid he never call fore achtung etc -lrb- 5 -rrb- always offer help to anyone in difficulty -lrb- 6 -rrb- keep with you party they might waste a lot of time look for you while you run home because you think they pace too slow -lrb- 7 -rrb- never desert a runner who for any reason be unable to keep up with a party -lrb- 8 -rrb- carry you own gear include spare clothing ski-ing necessaries etc -lrb- 9 -rrb- avoid step on the ski of another runner this caution be especially necessary for uphill work -lrb- 10 -rrb- remember that wherever you leave a track other may follow therefore only choose safe slope the snow be liable to slip on slope of 25 ° or more so that these be dangerous ski-ing be a sport which can be make dangerous for other if individual do not carry out the usual etiquette it may seem extraordinary that people should need warn not to join a private party unless invite but it be sadly true one day as i be start off on a long run a stranger come up to I and ask if she might join we i consult the guide and he say he already have as many in the party as he could take charge of i tell the lady this and say i be sorry that we could not accept she companionship she at once reply cheerily oh then i will follow you nothing could prevent she from do this switzerland be a free country and there be a right of way anywhere over the mountain in winter we start off and she follow from that moment of course we automatically become responsible for she because one of the law be that you never desert a runner who be alone she be a very poor performer and fall a great deal so that for the whole six or seven mile ' run we be keep wait for she of course we be under no real obligation to look after she but have we leave she and anything have happen to she we could never again have hold up we head as ski-er on another occasion a runner make a formal complaint to I about a lady who join he party in this case it be a experienced runner who have presumably learn the law and who might have read the notice on the board first of all she say may i go with you and the somewhat cold answer be that the party be complete then she follow ask question about the route etc at every opportunity of course she have finally to be adopt and take along much to the boredom of the party which be a private one where the ski-ing be organize test be run and tour arrange for the different standard this do not apply so much to 2nd or 1st-class runner who of course prefer to make up they own party but at any rate these be protect from have the less experienced runner with they except by invitation by these mean the organize tour only take runner up to the standard advertised and no one need feel compunction at leave member of they party behind in the village because they know that the elementary runner will also get a chance of a run yet even under these arrangement i have find a beginner sit huddle in a corner of the railway carriage when we have start before dawn for a big tour where be you off to i say thinking he be out with a guide with you party be the reply what could i do it be not easy to turn a person out of a train at 545 be on a cold morning i say weakly do you not see the notice which say this be a run for 3rd-class runner only he say yes but i think i could keep up so there he be and we take he through and though he be very slow uphill and keep we all back in this case he run down without delay we people often put they own capacity higher than do the people they want to run with and it be very difficult to be tactful again most people would not think it necessary to warn runner against desert they party yet they often do and it be not usually the beginner who be the culprit here perhaps he can not run quick enough to get away i shall always remember a run in charge of a tour when i be with a lot of novice another experienced runner accompany I officially to help i choose what i think the easiest way to start and he want to try another route at the top and go off say he would join we below a wood when we reach the part where i think we should rejoin i wait and shout but he do not appear so we go on to another post where we have lunch and then i begin to get anxious as this runner never turn up anything might have happen to he he might have go over a rock or into a tree or even only be tie up in one of those tangled fall when it be practically impossible to extricate oneself it be no good we try to look for he then so after about two hour ' delay i take my party down to the valley and the first person who meet we in the village be we lose companion he chaff we for be so late as he have run down very quickly and have have he tea age ago no party go beyond the nursery slope should consist of fewer than three one to go for help in case of need the other to stay with the third runner who may need help needless to say people who know the mountain well go off alone with impunity when i ask one of these lonely runner what would happen if he hurt himself and be benighted he tell I he always carry sufficient morphia to put he out of he agony in case of need this be no doubt all right from he point of view but what of the people who might go out to look for he among the infinite possible run with ski track in every direction no sport runner would ever refuse help to a lame duck though pretty bad case of selfishness have be record there be one point which do not always strike people and that be the danger of cut a track over a difficult place beginner will usually follow a track instead of work by they map for instance on the muotta muraigl run at pontresina if once a rash runner cut a track straight across from the restaurant to the valley crowd will probably follow it though they may be warn against it this be a very dangerous slope under certain condition as be show this winter when a runner go along its top be carry down to the bottom of the valley by the avalanche he start i have one track leave on my conscience when a few of we go down what might have be a dangerous place under different condition to those we find luckily it be not a way most people would have wish to follow as it apparently lead nowhere and hardly look attractive the slower mover always have the right of way when ski-ing so that no runner ought to shout to those ahead of he to get out of he way needless to say this do not apply to a runner out of control who may be dash unwillingly into someone in front of he when for both they sake a friendly warning be advisable it be the business of every ski-er to avoid obstacle and the slower mover may be look on as such in just the same way as a rock or a tree i be amuse one day at pontresina when a crowd of we be go up the village street and meet a lady on ski be hold back as she go downhill by two friend on either side of she it be the first time i have ever think of someone go down hill be the slower mover in relation to those climb nursery slope be for the practice of turn and the individual who use they for straight run while a lot of people be practise be abhor the same apply to jump on the nursery slope these be so easily make where other people be not practise that it be selfish to come plunge down into a crowd of devotee to turn when the nursery slope be empty it be great fun to practice straight run down they and no one will object one jolly thing about ski runner be that they seldom ridicule one another or laugh at fall in any but a friendly way there be great rivalry and daring to greater effort but ill-natured ridicule be seldom hear perhaps this be due to the fact that most people who live in glass house do not throw stone everybody who try to improve he ski-ing be bind to fall and it be better not to set the fashion of laugh at other in difficulty there will always be some people who like to look on at test as free entertainment without tax but if they could hear the comment on they behavior and probably on they own lack of prowess they would soon give up the habit anyone who be really keen to get on and who will go on practise and accept advice may be sure of sympathy and help ski-ing with all its danger and need for combined effort seem to bring out the best of people and to produce the very best spirit of goodwill and tolerance go uphill in soft snow every strong member should take a turn at cut the track it be often heavy work and a energetic leader may not like to ask for help the best plan be to work by time the leader fall out at the end of he shift and let the party pass he till he take he position at the rear and the second man become the leader and so on people who be wise will avoid step on the ski of the man ahead this be often difficult as instinct make one want to go faster than the person ahead just as a wheeler in a tandem will usually try to catch up the leader the easiest way to avoid overlap be to keep step push forward the right foot when the man ahead push forward he right foot and then the leave this give a rhythm to the uphill work which also seem to minimize effort anyone who have experience the irritation cause by he ski be constantly touch by the runner behind while plod uphill will learn to spare another the same nuisance when run straight down a steep slope make sure that there be no one ahead whom you might run into and no one below on either side who might traverse across the slope you propose to run down this be especially necessary in a gap between tree another member of you party might be among the tree below and suddenly come out into the open traverse to the other side when straight run at any speed only the best ski runner can turn suddenly to avoid a difficulty and a nasty collision may occur if care be not exercise when a crowd of people be take they ski by train a great deal of trouble may be avoid in get the mass of ski out of the train if these be tie neatly together a pair of ski tie near the tip and behind the binding be easy to handle while a pair of ski put together by slip one through the toe-strap of the other be a great nuisance ski pile together soon become very like a heap of spillikin if not carefully handle and a good deal of damage may be do to they as well as delay to the train if ski-er be careless in this small matter another good plan be for the ski-er to form themselves into a queue and to hand out all the ski along the line till they can be easily distribute where there be space the beginner be apt to hunt anxiously for he own pair which may be at the bottom of the pile and while he pull and tug with but little success other people be wait in vain for a chance to get they ski out this be especially the case on funicular railway where space be very limit in the station different nationality travel together add considerably to the confusion and the railway official be usually thankful to anyone who will take charge and get a line form and the ski hand out tidily these hint may seem unnecessary to a great many people but no matter i have have so much of my own time waste by this sort of tiresome lack of sense that i venture to suggest a means of save time and temper for other ski runner should remember that sledge and pedestrian have the right of way on a road all the field be open to the ski runner and he should not monopolize a road in most part of switzerland there be a law by which everyone have right of way everywhere where the snow lie -- so long as it be not enclose ground this be bring home to my family rather vividly when we live at davo by a shooting gallery be set up on we land in front of we house we have no power to prevent it and there it remain for the winter at the same time ski runner should respect the property of other people and here i would like to make two appeal to british runner firstly that we will do we best to avoid damaging young tree -lrb- old tree can probably look after themselves where the ski-er be concern as they be usually stronger than he be -rrb- secondly that we should treat the inhabitant of the country with as much courtesy as possible the peasant over whose land we run make very little out of the tourist business and have other thing to think about rather than sport he be usually courteous and friendly and always ready to help we when in difficulty let we return he hospitality be treat he with courtesy school teacher have tell I that they have great difficulty in persuade the child to greet foreigner because these so seldom respond yet few thing be more pleasant than the friendly grüsse or grüss gott or leb wohl with which one be greet by the people of the country we can answer in english if we do not know how to answer in german but do let we answer and thereby prove ourselves as friendly as we host another matter which be not always understand by beginner on the snow field be that when a alpine club or local ski club hut be use a fee should be pay to the fund which support the hut these hut be expensive to build and they upkeep be a great tax on the club british runner can either join the local club when they can use the hut by day for nothing or they can pay the advertised fee for whatever use they make of they a notice be always post in the hut show the various charge but when no one be there to collect the money it be leave to the honor of the guest to pay it a money-box can be find in all hut within switzerland proper but as these box be not safe from marauder near the frontier the ski runner have to send the money in by post at the boval hut for instance above the morteratsch glacier a supply of money order form will be find hang near a door all the leader of the party have to do be to collect the money from he member take one of the form and pay the money into any post office whence it be send to the hq of the club hut should invariably be leave tidy this also be a matter of honor the door be unlock always in order that people who may need hospitality in case of distress can find shelter blanket can be borrow wood be usually provide for firing and there may even be a reserve of food all of which should be respect before the party leave blanket should be fold shutter should be shut snow sweep out and debris bury outside or what can be use as fuel put away tidily in the kitchen then the door should be shut carefully and the hut leave the better rather than the worse off for have give hospitality snow and light full description of the different type of snow which must be negotiate by the ski-runner will be find in mr arnold lunn 's book alpine ski-ing it be only necessary for I therefore to describe the four main type namely soft hard crust and sticky snow soft snow in winter be the new powder snow which be to be find after a fall or on north slope where sun and wind have not spoil it it be the ideal snow for the luxurious runner especially two day after it have fall when it have settle down and a hard frost have convert it into crystal powder a run through crystallize snow which tinkle as the ski cut through it be beyond description even a bad runner will find that he can do marvel as the snow seem literally to help he in all he experiment i have know a day when a blinding blizzard have start blow the snow into my face and i have run fast along the bottom of a valley with my eye shut the ski keep to the lowest line and run safely and steadily through this powder snow at a low gradient it be not suggest that blind running should be indulge in as a rule and i only quote this case to show how helpful be good powder snow the telemark be the usual turn in soft snow christianium and jump turn can also be use by people who be proficient and strong but they require both skill and strength soft snow be usually find on north slope or at the bottom of shady valley or even behind any ridge which protect it from the sun or wind also among tree which shelter it track ruin it in time so that it be usually wise to sidle off the track and try new snow beside it luckily for the experienced runner most beginner usually behave rather like sheep prefer track to explore on they own the result be that perfect snow can often be find alongside the beaten track and when this get spoil it be only necessary to go a little further afield in order to get a good run then as more and more people beat down the track it become hard and very amusing running can be have there hard snow be of two type -- a beaten track or a hard crust where the sun have melt the surface and the frost at night have freeze it so that it will bear the weight of the ski-runner when this be really solid enough to allow of side-slipping and stem or christianium turn it be very trustworthy and easy to negotiate at first however it intimidate the beginner because it be very fast as time go on and he become accustomed to the skid and rattle of hard snow he will find that he horror turn into pleasure because he can trust it the nursery slope become hard after two or three day and will provide useful experience for cope with such snow on a run the lift stem and christianium be the best turn on hard snow a telemark be apt to skid too much crust be the bugbear of all runner and be out and away the most difficult to tackle it may be hard and then with nothing apparent on the surface to warn you the ski break through and catch in the crust and down you go when crust be about let someone else lead and then profit by he experience there be many form of crust all of which may be meet on the same run and when wind have be at work there may be crust on north slope and not on south after rain too when the surface have be soak and a frost follow crust will be find everywhere sticky snow be usually due to the effect of the sun or to fohn wind or thaw it be easily cope with by proper waxing of the run surface but the sudden sticking of the ski which have be run well over wet snow in the open when they get into cold powder snow under tree or in shadow be very disconcert the same be apt to happen when people have dry they ski in the sun by stick they on end while lunch the sun not only dry they but warm they so that if the first run after lunch be in shadow and the snow be cold the ski stick because the warm surface melt the snow which immediately freeze again and adhere to the ski so that they come to a absolute standstill the only way to avoid sticking be to keep the run surface of the ski in good condition by oil they thoroughly and to carry one or two different type of wax for use accord to circumstance the great thing be to get practice on all type of snow and never to mind it look upon crust as a joke and learn jump turn which be the only safe turn for any but the strongest runner some of these can accomplish a telemark or stem-turn or even a christianium on every sort of snow but most people be content with the jump turn on crust the great trouble of this turn be that it be very tiring when a heavy rucksack be carry but knack and good use of the stick will help it light be a great factor in ski-ing on a fine day when visibility be good it be easy to distinguish between the rise and fall of country ahead and therefore to be prepare for decrease or increase in speed some day when the sky be cloud it be practically impossible to tell what be come this difficulty be increase in a narrow valley when the reflection of the slope on either side make the whole surface look identical color glass may help a little but it be better to run slowly and to take no risk on these occasion track help immensely as they give the eye something to follow rock and tree also help anything that break the surface of the snow and show up the gradient ahead fall fall -- what a word when i first thought of write this book it strike I that the best selling title would be ski-ing without fall but then i remember that i could never look a beginner in the face again if know that he have read my book i see he fall besides which a ski runner who never fall be probably but a poor exponent of the sport when you begin to run comfortably and can do the turn at low speed fall show that you be still try to learn more of the game it be only by try new thing that a runner become really proficient and you be almost certain to fall constantly as you learn there be art in fall on ski as well as in run and turn fall loose let yourself go never try to save yourself when once you find the fall be inevitable and get rid of you stick you will have the most amazing fall on ski and nobody will listen to you description of they because they be just as eager to describe they own the surprising thing be how little people hurt themselves -- knee and ankle go most the strain on the knee and ankle be very great in some fall but if you let yourself go and relax you muscle as you fall you will find that even ankle and knee survive as a rule i once see a really good runner turn three somersault while nose-driving down a steep slope at high speed in soft snow and all the damage do be two hat-pin snap moral do not wear hat-pins people be so tangle up sometimes that they do not know whether the ski tip stick out of the snow belong to they right or left foot and they have to dig with they stick before they can extricate themselves and sometimes the result of a fall be so intricate that the runner could never extricate himself but need the help of a friend who will undo a binding so as to free he the most curious fall i ever saw be when a man run down a steep slope among tree run into a fir tree on the upper side where the snow be lie well up the trunk he then fall head downward into the hole below the tree where the snow have not penetrate and he ski be catch in the branch there he hang have he be alone i doubt whether he would ever have succeed in get free as it be we undo a binding quickly and no damage be do not only be there art in fall but there be a technique of get up before attempt to get up arrange you ski so that they be ready to stand on suppose they be cross below you on a steep slope lie on the slope raise the ski in the air uncross they set they parallel across the slope below you face the way you want to go and get up this fall be sometimes use as a turn and may be very useful though not consider the best possible form if do intentionally never attempt to get up on to ski face downhill they will only go off with you the moment you begin to rise and then down you flop again if you fall head downward down a slope you still have to get you ski parallel across the slope below you before you can stand up and the only thing to be do be to turn a somersault uncross you ski in the air if they be cross and get they below you and then stand up all of which be extremely easy but it be very necessary to ensure that clothes be so make that the powder snow can not slip into crevice while you be gambol in this fashion the first thing i do before get up from a fall be to put up my hand and let the snow shake out of my glove gauntlet if you be so tangle up in a fall that it be almost impossible to get out just undo a binding slip off a ski and get up easily with a free foot to stand on and if you see anyone else so tangle up that he do not begin to get up immediately hurry to he assistance because he ankle or knee may be in a very strained position and he may be thankful to you for undoing a binding and release he it be in these fall that the leather heel binding so often prove better than a rigid toe bind the leather will ease a little or slip and allow the foot to turn a fraction of a inch so that the strain be not maintain long enough to cause real damage fall be often half the fun of ski-ing and every runner who be try something new will sometimes fall in the endeavor so never lose hope however much you fall if you have be run rather well and then get a day when you do nothing but only mean that you be stale and that you muscle and nerve need a rest this be where the all-round winter sportsman gain he can spend a day on the rink or curling or tobogganing and not feel that he have waste time never scoff at people because they fall a first-class runner be suppose to be able to run at high speed use turn without fall so he will probably if he intend to but no first-class runner worth he salt would always run like this he will always be try something more difficult turn at higher speed or in difficult snow and consequently he will often be see to fall and the beginner who scoff be merely vote a ignoramus here again a runner will be judge by he track look carefully at the place where he run and try to make out what turn he be try and what the snow be like and why he fall you can learn a great deal from other people 's track fall in deep snow be always a little more risky than on hard snow because there be greater strain on muscle and ligament on hard snow you get many a bump and scratch but the result be less lasting than a tear ligament have get up safely from you fall look on the snow and see what you have drop before start off again even pocket with flap may allow of leakage it be wise to tie you rucksack firmly with a strap round you waist because if it be loose anything heavy inside may give you a nasty bump on the head as you fall test there be three british ski test under the federal council of british ski club in addition to these different centre and local club often set a elementary test for beginner in order that these may be sort into various standard for expedition hitherto the elementary test have usually be a run down a certain distance within a time set by the judge this be not a altogether satisfactory test as the beginner who go straight down sit on he ski may get through while another who conscientiously try to run standing fall the whole time and fail style might be judge and the sit candidate disqualify but when as often happen some seventy or eighty people enter for a elementary test the judge have they hand full enough with start and time apart from watch individual run critically as in the 2nd-class test a better way therefore be to flag a line which must be follow provide traverse across slope which soon catch out the sit novice beginner usually hate traverse because they dislike the look of a steep slope and do not know how to prevent the instinctive point straight downward of the ski they do not realize yet that if they would stand upright on they ski while traverse and lead with the upper foot while they put they weight on the lower foot and keep they whole weight somewhat on they heel they will traverse quite easily at a gentle angle the elementary test ought to be so plan as to force this type of run another way of run a elementary test be for a judge to lead at a steady easy pace for a hour 's cross-country run include both up and downhill as well as level running and obstacle the test would be time a ample margin be allow beyond the judge 's time all those who finish within the time would pass this would probably not be nearly so popular a test with the candidate as the short downhill run but it would be a far better test of they capacity for tour the british ski test consist of the 1st 2nd and 3rd-class test the regulation for which will be find in the ski year book which can be obtain from the hon secretary federal council of british ski club essex court temple london ec they can also be obtain from any official representative of one of the british club in switzerland and be print as a appendix at the end of this book in the 3rd class test which be the first and which have to be pass before the runner can go up for he 2nd class there be three part part -lrb- a -rrb- be a climb of 1500 foot in not more than 1-1\/2 hour and a run down 1500 foot in a time set by the judge the time may not be less than seven or more than twenty minute it should not be more than 12 minute under good condition man must carry rucksack weigh not less than 6 lb and woman 3 lb sealskin may be use for the climb part -lrb- b -rrb- consist of four consecutive lift stem-turn on a slope of 15 ° to 20 ° and part -lrb- c -rrb- four consecutive telemark turn on a slope of the same gradient part -lrb- b -rrb- and -lrb- c -rrb- be often use as a qualify test before part -lrb- a -rrb- be run in order to limit the entry for part -lrb- a -rrb- which may otherwise be a very difficult test to run when a large field enter for it candidate who enter for this test should really take pain to ensure that they binding fit they boot and that they have everything necessary for a run as well as be up to the standard speaking as a judge of four year ' standing who have run innumerable test i may say that it be pitiable to see the number of casual people who will come up for a test without read the regulation and without be in any way prepare for a 1500 ft climb few thing be more disagreeable than have to disqualify a candidate who turn up without a rucksack or more miserable than have to shepherd down beginner who be wear out by a run for which they be quite out of train the one comfort be that a candidate who be pertinacious and courageous enough to face this test five or six time without pass and go in again be almost sure to pass in the end for the judge 's sake however i strongly urge such a candidate to time himself over similar run with he friend and to persist in this until he prove that he be up to 3rd-class standard when he will be a very welcome candidate in the test itself a course be easily find by use a aneroid or it may also be work off the ordnance map any ordinary watch with a second hand will suffice for the timing of one 's own run some people may think that i be a little harsh in my reason for suggest that beginner should not enter for the run part of the 3rd-class test so lightheartedly it be really for they own sake as much as for that of the judge 's failure be very discouraging and i have know people 's nerve quite upset by one of these run they have try to race down and have take really nasty toss in they rush while the fatigue of constant fall and get up out of deep snow become more and more out of breath in the anxiety to compete be very bad for they run i have often want to hide my head in shame when come home after such a test with a lot of worn-out people wet through who have fail and yet such be life that many with the first breath after they finish exhaust will ask when the next test take place in order that they may compete again such a candidate really do one 's heart good test have probably do more than anything else to improve the standard of british run we all have a liking for competition and here be we chance have succeed in pass the 3rd-class test we can wear a badge and then we have to ski better in order to prove worthy of it and presently we see no reason against qualify for the 2nd-class test before go home after all the turn only have to be do on a steeper slope the run can be put off till next winter and pass the moment we come out they say the 1st-class standard be rise higher and higher as british ski runner become more proficient the runner who pass a year or two ago now hesitate to wear the gold badge because he often realize that he speed and turn be not good enough for what be now require judge of the british ski test may be find in most well-known centre but as there be very few 1st-class people the test for this class be usually run in one or two district only guide and ski instructor swiss guide be certificate by the swiss alpine club and be the only people permit by law to guide party among the higher mountain a tariff exist in every district show the fee which these guide must charge in addition to the fee the client usually give a gratuity and also pay for the guide 's accommodation and provision on the tour a percentage may be add for number greater than those provide for in the tariff while on a really difficult tour the guide will probably refuse to take more than two or three runner unless a second guide or porter be engage the certificate guide wear a badge issue by the swiss alpine club and any man wear this may be depend upon to be a good fellow a careful guide and a philosopher and friend most of they can now ski well though a few of the older one may not be very proficient in technique and may be stick rider when on tour with a guide he be responsible for the safety of the party and every member should do he best to help he by carry out any instruction he may give for they greater safety this be not always appreciate by people who do not know the alp and they unwritten law and the guide complain somewhat bitterly that they be often put in very difficult position for instance on one occasion when a party be cross a avalanche slope the guide ask they to go singly at interval of 20 metre so that if anyone be carry away the other would not be involve and could go to he rescue one of the party be overhear say : oh he be only try to prove how careful he be in order to get a higher tip and they be careless in they carry out of the instruction in any case it be discourteous not to do what the guide prescribe and he be put in a very false position as he be hold responsible ski instructor belong to a different category unless they be also certificate guide which be often the case in some canton such as graubünden the instructor have to pass a examination show they capacity to ski and also to teach many of they be perfectly beautiful runner but they should not be press to conduct tour where glacier work or rock climbing be involve they be not examine for this and they hold no credentials and if a accident occur everyone be blame there be a great many other run they be allow to lead and they will set as good a course as anyone would wish for before engage a guide or a instructor on the recommendation of the concierge get some expert advice as to who be the best the secretary of the local ski club would advise or some good runner in the neighborhood in some part of switzerland the guide and instructor have take to tout for client they hang about the hotel and try to induce the unwary to engage they and to go for tour for which they be often not fit the better swiss guide be the first to want the public to discourage this type of behavior as it be do a lot of harm to they good name when a guide be engage treat he as a friend and trust he they be usually a most obliging and reliable set of man who will do everything in they power for they client such as carry food and spare clothing wax ski attach skin and even make term in inn and cook the food in hut when on tour they knowledge of the mountain and they experience be well worth probe and they will usually talk willingly when kindly deal with they be quick judge of character and if the younger one be sometimes a little inclined to take advantage of the people who do not treat they suitably only those people themselves can be blame the old-fashioned guide be never familiar though they be very friendly and will always do they best for the entertainment of they party they should not be pet and flatter neither should they be treat as inferior a happy medium be easily find which be what the guide will prefer because in he heart of heart he have the whole of the swiss characteristic -- great dignity independence and respect for wise people on a long and dangerous tour the safety of the party may ultimately depend upon the trust and confidence place in the guide in charge and by he in he client and this should be remember in all negotiation these man often have to risk they life for the sake of the people who employ they and they staunch unselfishness be a fine example of human endeavor for the benefit of other they fee may appear to be high but when everything be take into consideration include the shortness of they winter and summer season it be soon realize that the fee be not exorbitant map and find the way every ski runner go across country should carry a map even on a short run a great deal can be learn from a map which will prove useful later on a longer run both time and risk can be save by people who run by they map and who know how to avoid dangerous place and how to take advantage of narrow safe opening there be different type of map to be have in switzerland the best be the official ordnance map publish by the eidg landestopographie at bern the mountain district be produce at a scale of 1 centimetre in 50000 centimetre or 2 centimetre in one kilometre and large or small sheet can be buy almost everywhere the gradient be clearly show by contour line the equidistance be 30 metre or roughly 100 foot the dot contour line when height be mark some every 8 or 10 ordinary contour line this differ accord to the edition cliff and rock be show gray while glacier contour line be blue some district such as the bernese oberland have produce this map with red line show all the ski run in other place they also provide ski-ing map but on a different scale and not as good as the ordnance map all map be best when mount on linen as the weather they receive on a run may reduce a paper map to pulp or rag it be easy to work out the distance of run or the gradient of slope from the large scale ordnance map 1 in 50000 metre mean that 1 centimetre on the map equal a run of 50000 metre 2 centimetre equal a kilometre or 100000 metre 8 kilometre equal five english mile therefore if a centimetre measure be carry the distance be soon ascertain with a minimum of arithmetic throughout this chapter i have take the mathematical or map gradient and not the engineer 's gradient the latter be generally use i understand to measure the gradient of road railway etc to avoid confusion when ski-ing the gradient be usually name by the angle of the slope the gradient of slope be show by the contour line the drop between each be 30 metre or approximately 100 foot the table on p 92 be get out by commander merriman rn and have prove very useful to I in set test as well as in judge whether slope be comparatively safe from avalanche or not a slope show eight 30-metre contour line in one centimetre work out roughly at 27 ° which be a steeper slope than most people care to take straight run over unknown country anything steeper than this be apt to avalanche in certain condition though a 30 ° slope should usually be safe -lrb- a 25 ° slope may be dangerous under some condition -rrb- a comfortable slope be 5 contour line in 1 centimetre or a gradient of 17 ° take english measurement as in commander merriman 's scale 16 contour line in one inch on the map the beginner will probably content himself with slope where 10 contour line be show in one inch or a gradient of about 13 ° rough table of gradient assume 30 metre contour to be equal to 100 foot contour -lrb- actually this be 984 foot -rrb- natural scale 1 : 50000 -------------------------------------------- drop per inch | average angle | gradient on map | of slope |

29 ° 56 ' | 17 2500 ' | 30 ° 58 ' | 16 -------------------------------------------- up till now i have only be describe the official ordnance map there be several other map which may also be useful the dufor map be good for direction and lie of country but they scale be 1 in 100000 they be not much help for actual run the local ski tour map be useful to show where the usual tour go but can not always be trust for gradient or cliff and rock the pontresina map for instance though show a equidistance of 30 metre as in the ordnance map really have 50 metre contour line which might be a terrible snare to the unwary who would confidently run towards a slope think it be about 20 ° and find that it be nearer 35 ° or a avalanche slope in a case like this the ordnance map must be use for actual run while the ski tour map be use to show the line to be follow in some district such as the bernese oberland the ordnance map have be use for the local ski tour map and the tour show on it in red this be a great saving of weight and money for the runner who then only have one map to carry most ski map show dangerous avalanche slope the local summer map publish in most tourist centre in switzerland be not much use to the ski runner because it show walk which may be along slope or down cliff which be perfectly safe in summer and very dangerous in winter i strongly advise all beginner who be bite by the joy of ski-ing to buy at any rate the small local sheet of the ordnance map which usually only cost fr 130 or roughly 1 and to study it carefully notice the contour line on the well-known nursery slope and gradually realize the gradient represent by the different width between they let he also notice the difference between a hill and a hole on the map this be easily recognize either by the thin blue line of a stream emerge from a lake or by compare the nearest height show on the dot line or some marked point contour be often puzzling to a beginner in map reading but knowledge of what they represent may save a party from a weary climb back up a place they have gaily ski-ed down think they could get through but find a impossible slope or fall of rock which force they to retrace they step before go on tour even with a guide it be wise to study the map with a view to know where a alpine hut can be find in case of need or where a hay châlet could offer shelter when once the ski runner have begin to appreciate the fun and interest of run by a map he will never leave it behind and he will be able to enjoy all sort of run he would never know of if he be content with the sheep habit of follow track the greatest fun of ski-ing be in find one 's own way and this one can never hope to do without a map the follow scale of comparative height in metre and foot may be of use in estimate the height of point which the ski runner wish to reach : 10 metre equal 33 foot -lrb- approximately -rrb- 50 164 100 328 250 820 500 1640 1000 3281 2000 6562 3000 9843 a compass be of course useful when run by map but as precipice be apt to get in the way when run straight for any give point a compass can not be trust alone in the case of fog it be very difficult to avoid difficulty and point on the map can only be identify by the use of a aneroid as well as a compass set the aneroid at the point you start from and check you height by this as you climb or descend refer constantly to the map to ensure that you be run on the right line it be wise to practice this on clear day in order to get accustom to run by map compass and aneroid as the weather also affect the aneroid it should be constantly reset at known level all this may sound very confusing and most beginner will probably prefer to take a guide who know he country well rather than trust to elementary map-reading knowledge in unknown country most runner who go on tour will find run much more interesting however if instead of follow a guide blindly they also watch the map or get a knowledge of what be good or bad country to run over there be sometimes case also when the party must necessarily divide and a amateur may have to take the lead over unknown country avalanche much have be write on this subject mr arnold lunn in the alp tell some extraordinary story about these monster of the mountain my father john addington symond in we life in the swiss highland also describe they there be a very interesting article by monsieur f krahnstoever in the swiss ski club year-book for 1923 on the subject of avalanche in relation to ski-ing they be a everlasting nightmare to ski runner in high place and beginner should at once take care to learn all they can of snow-craft in order in so far as possible to realize what be safe and what be dangerous the steepness of slope and the condition of snow as well as the direction of wind be all factor affect avalanche any slope whose gradient be more than 15 ° may be dangerous under certain condition but it may be generally accept that most long slope under 25 ° be comparatively safe so long as they have not much steeper slope immediately above or below they new snow be always apt to slip before it have have time to settle down snow blow by wind into a cornice or overhang lip at the top of a slope or on a cliff may topple down and start a avalanche wet snow after rain or a warm föhn wind become heavy and begin to slide a very dangerous condition be new soft snow lie on a slope cover with old hard snow tree or rock stick up through the snow make such slope safer as they tend to prevent the snow from begin to slip this be why the forestry law of switzerland be so strict in some district the owner of a forest may not cut a tree unless it have be approve by the government forester this be to ensure that the forest be maintain as a protection for the village in the valley below beginner should never go on a tour without first ascertain that the route they propose to follow be a safe one and if there be the slightest doubt owe to weather condition they should put it off for a day or two some run be perfectly safe when the snow have settle and a sharp frost have bind it but they may become dangerous again when a thaw set in a föhn wind be blow or rain have fall the ski runner himself may start a avalanche on a slope where the snow would lie safely if he do not pass along it the cutting of he track break the continuity of the snow may set it go either above or below he and he will be carry away with it wherever there seem to be the slightest risk of avalanche the party should separate and proceed in single file at about 20-yard interval then if a runner be carry away the other will be able to go to he assistance in some case however even this be not sufficient protection as the whole slope may go at once in old day before the railway have tunnel through the pass we be drive over the fluelum above davo on we way to italy in march we be in the post consist of some 20 one-horse sledge and have just leave the hospiz when we meet the up-coming post also consist of a number of one-horse sledge it take some time to pass as the track be narrow and the horse flounder in the deep snow when pass each other after we have get by and be continue on we way down to süs we turn along a outstanding buttress of cliff and see that some two mile of steep slope ahead have avalanch the whole surface of the snow have slip to the bottom of the valley and if either of the diligence have be on this slope when it happen horse sledge and all would have be carry away this experience fix avalanche danger very firmly in my mind and have also see several large avalanche fall as well as the immense amount of damage do to forest and châlets by these insuperable monster i have never wish to risk get into a large one myself even a small avalanche be very overwhelming and a beginner who have feel its effect soon realize what it may mean choose a _ very _ short steep slope on a day when the snow be slip and try to get it go once it move and entangle you leg and ski you will feel the extraordinary helplessness which result this be one of we game when i be a child without ski it be possible to float on top of a baby avalanche and to enjoy it but with ski on the foot soon become entangled and helplessness result the first thing to do when a avalanche start and no escape be possible be to get the ski binding undo and the foot free then swim with arm and leg and try to keep on top if bury keep one arm over nose and mouth so as to keep air space and push the other arm up point the ski stick through to the open so that it may show you whereabouts this be easy to describe but probably not so easy to carry out if the occasion arise one of the first book on ski-running advise people to carry some 60 metre of red tape and to let this trail behind they when cross dangerous ground then if overwhelm by a avalanche the red thread can be pick up by the search party and the victim may quickly be dig out i have never meet anyone who have carry out this suggestion and do not want the extra weight of red tape in my rucksack but it make one think and realize how much other experienced runner have think also the follow precaution would seem to I to be better : never ski along or above or below a dangerous-looking slope under doubtful condition never go for a tour without make sure beforehand that the route you propose to follow be a safe one always carry out any instruction you guide or the experienced leader of you party may give if you have any sudden doubt about the safety of the slope you be on make quickly for the nearest rock stick up if there be tree near get among they as quickly and quietly as you can if the snow begin to slip and you see no chance of ski-ing quickly away from the dangerous place get you ski off this be where toe binding may be safer than heel binding as they come off quicker never follow a track across a slope about which you be doubtful think hopefully that the runner who cut it know more than yourself never cut a track across a dangerous place at you own risk if there be the slightest chance of misleading another runner into danger later remember that though you yourself may be on a safe slope the slope above or below you may be so steep that the snow may slip off by itself and you slope may be involve this apply equally to run along the bottom of a valley the slope on either side may be dangerous and if the snow slip you will be bury there be so many perfectly safe run that it be folly to risk be kill by a avalanche when it can easily be avoid by a little forethought and common sense even if you do not mind the risk yourself think not only of you people wait below but also of the people who have to come and look for you body there have be several case where the search party have be overwhelm by a second avalanche while digging for people carry away by the first January and march be probably the most dangerous month from the avalanche point of view in January the fresh snow be apt to slide before it have settle a few day after a new snowfall most of the avalanche will have come down and the ordinary run will be safe again but every snowfall entail the same risk there be some slope where the snow will never stay in February but unless a föhn wind or rain make the snow heavy most slope be pretty safe below a gradient of 25 ° in march when the thaw begin more avalanche will fall these usually come down well-known track and can easily be avoid for this reason this chapter may appear to be somewhat intimidating but it be better to be safe than sorry very few experienced ski runner get into avalanche and if ordinary precaution be take and the advice of expert follow beginner need have no fear the ski-ing map usually show the more dangerous place but every runner should keep he own eye open and learn all he can of snow-craft in order to be able to explore new country as he become proficient accident some people will think that i lay too much stress on the danger of ski-ing consider the thousand of people who ski every winter and the extraordinarily small number of accident i admit that i have exaggerate the danger but i do so quite deliberately because it be only by realize risk that they can be avoid and my experience prove to I that the average town-bred man and woman boy and girl have very little appreciation of life live up against nature they set out so lightheartedly and often so fool-hardily on a expedition without tell anyone where they propose to go or when they expect to be home and without have provide themselves with the extra equipment which may prove to be very necessary before the day be finish while write this book i have constantly have in mind ski-ing centre above 5000 foot whence tour be make among the glacier and at high level where the cold may be a danger during the month of January and February much of what i have say of the necessity of carry spare clothing in good quantity do not apply so much to place below 5000 foot unless high tour be undertake but wherever people ski there be a possibility of accident due to fall and though these be seldom serious they need attention when someone be really lame by knee or ankle ski-ing become very difficult except to the expert who can ski mainly on one foot and walk through the deep snow sink at every step be a agony so that some form of stretcher become necessary two or better still four ski tie together side by side form a excellent sledge which will travel straight downhill every easily it practically refuse to traverse a slope so that the case have to be slipped straight down to the bottom of the slope and along the valley or level below ski usually have hole through the flat part of the tip in front a piece of strong wire should be thread through these care be take that the ski lie parallel they whole length and that the tip be not draw together too much a stick must be tie to the wire and the ski tip to keep they in position and to take the pull when the sledge be draw along if there be tree about a branch can be cut to serve this purpose if not a ski stick must be cut in half and use it should not project beyond the ski on either side or it will catch in the snow the other half of the ski stick or another branch must be tie across the ski by the toe iron to keep the ski parallel there also and to give solidity to the sledge people sometimes tie a strap or string round the ski include they run surface forget that this will soon cut through with the friction of the snow to finish the sledge put some fir branch on it the bushy part of which will make it more comfortable to lie on the thick wood of the branch part should point towards the front of the ski and be fix there if branch be not available rucksack can be use for the injure person to lie on he will probably be more comfortable go downhill if he can be lay head-first downward on the sledge to draw the sledge along join a lap thong or sealskin or rope or puttee to the outer ski tip and also to the end of the stick across they in order to prevent this from pull these ski forward too much it be well to tie a string to the inner ski tip also and join they to the pull rope another rope or thong should be attach to the stick and center toe iron so that this can be hold from behind to prevent the sledge travel too fast downhill experienced runner will be able to travel on ski while get this sledge down but beginner will do well to wade on foot especially the rear man who have to control the speed neither the pull nor control rope should be attach to the body of the person hold it because a sudden jerk may pull he over and the sledge be stop suddenly with a jar to the person hurt most club hut be provide with excellent ambulance sledge which may be use and which should be conscientiously return to the rettungschef of the locality there be a rettungschef in every mountainous district whose duty it be to help with accident when these be report to he he arrange to send out guide and porter with a ambulance sledge to the assistance of any party in trouble if therefore you accident be a serious one and you be far from home the wisest plan may be to send one or two of the best runner down to the nearest village for help while the remainder stay with the injure person for this reason it be always unwise to go out with fewer than three in a party five or six be a better number on a long day 's run remember the people wait at home and when you have make arrangement for help to go to you party ring up you friend and tell they what have happen and what you have arrange have often see the anxiety of relation and friend when they party come home late i know how important this be even if you be only delay for some small reason such as a train be late it be kind to ring up and this be easily do as there be telephone in almost every village while on this subject i would again like to urge that before go off on a expedition of any length the concierge and someone should be tell in write the destination the route and the hour anticipate for return then if the party do not turn up and no news come through a search party can be send out with some hope of find they within a reasonable time time be very important in January and February when the weather be cold as people can be badly frost-bitten if benighted search party be expensive luxury as it be risky work for the guide who deserve to be well pay for it i have only once follow a rettungschef with he five assistant and they ambulance sledge and shall never forget the pace at which they lantern go ahead of we dance like a will-of-the-wisp a runner have come home at 5 pm with news that one of the party have hurt he knee some four mile from home this runner have already wisely ring up the rettungschef from the first house he come to and a party of guide be be collect i decide to go out with some friend in case the accident be a serious one and we could bring the remainder of the party home and so save the guide that duty they be all beginner who be benighted we follow the lantern and see it stop and know the guide have reach the people in trouble when we catch up they already have the patient look like a mummy roll up in blanket in a canvas bag on the sledge i could hear he choke over the brandy which be be pour down he throat he have only hurt he knee but he friend who be all real novice have have a wear time get he down the way in which the guide handle the job fill I with admiration and confidence when they find we be ready to herd the party home they shoot off with they sledge and the lantern soon become a speck of light in the distance again i also have a lantern that night and find it delightful to ski by but doubt whether anyone else profit much by its light except as a guide to direction when a person be hurt and helpless at a high level in winter cold be the most immediate danger and all spare clothing should be pile on he and he limb should be rub to prevent frost-bite when he can not be move a fire might well be light if below tree level where wood be available because though the lighting of fire be forbid in the swiss forest a breach of the law would surely be overlook in case of danger to life the heat of the fire would help to keep the patient warm while its light would act as a beacon to the search party the follow be the code of signal in use among the alp : _ the alpine signal of distress _ -- -lrb- a -rrb- by day -- the wave of anything -lrb- a flag or stick with a article of clothing attach -rrb- six time in a minute repeat after a interval of one minute without signal -lrb- b -rrb- by night -- a light flash six time a minute repeat after a interval of one minute without signal -lrb- c -rrb- by sound -- six sharp call or whistle in the minute repeat after a interval of one minute without signal _ the answer call _ -- -lrb- d -rrb- anything wave a light flash a sharp call or whistle three time in the minute repeat after a interval of one minute without signal if a ski runner do not remember the exact signal any regular signal repeat a definite number of time in a minute with a minute 's interval should prove sufficient similarly if you hear a signal repeat at short regular interval you should always suspect a call for help a ordinary whistle be hardly loud enough for the sound to carry any distance and a siren might be better newspaper could be use for a flare if the party do not possess a lantern or electric torch but it would not last long finally may i suggest that everyone who take up ski-ing seriously and who carry gear to be use in emergency should be proficient in the use of such gear and not wait till it be need to find out how to fit it to experiment in make a ambulance sledge while a injure person lie beside you and when you finger be cold and people be buzz round you with suggestion which may or may not be better than you own idea be a bad plan it be wiser to have make the experiment at home and to have get someone to drag you down a hill on the result and then you will know something about it a new game for the nursery slope and what fun for the spectator who already think all skier mad i would like to add at the end of this chapter on accident that during the many year i have enjoy ski-ing and with the hundred of beginner i have help i have never meet with a single really serious accident one or two knee and ankle twist and now and then a cut or severe bruise have be among the worst case i have come across the attraction of ski-ing though some runner be content merely to enjoy the actual practice of ski-ing with all the difficulty to be overcome and the various turn to be perfect the greater proportion probably ski mainly on account of the exhilaration obtain the freedom enjoy and the wonderful beauty of the place reach the amazing thing be that ski be not use sooner among the alp they have already in less than thirty year entirely alter the life of the young people in far-away village who use to be practically shut up during the winter month but who can now ski from one place to another on sunday and holiday enjoy the companionship of they friend and widen they outlook by mix with stranger this will probably have a very good effect on the population of the high alp who will be less inclined to leave they home in order to get away from the monotony of the long winter so much be this appreciate that ski-ing be now part of the school curriculum in some district often take the place of gymnastics during the winter it be amusing to watch the class of child out on the nursery slope with they teacher while we foreign woman ski-runner be provide with elaborate costume include breeches or trousers the little swiss girl ski in frock and cotton pinafore without cap or hat and often without glove lead by they teacher they wearily climb up the slope and then come the mad career home to the midday meal twenty or thirty little girl all dash down together practise turn as they go or make as straight down as they dare in they effort to outpace they rival the boy carry the sport still further and most local ski-jumping competition start with a demonstration by the boy who often do not look more than 10 or 12 year old and who go over the big jump as straight as they elder and usually a good deal more gaily as they have not begin to appreciate the danger the smaller boy line the side of the jump and pour out at the word of the judge on to the steep landing-slope like a lot of little goblin jump on they ski horizontally to flatten away any track or hole make by a jumper who have fail to jump perfectly little chap of seven or eight run through the wood on these occasion swank they turn through the tree and put most grown-up runner to shame by they nimbleness at pontresina one winter i be much amuse by one of these small child wear a british third-class test badge which he must have pick up i ask he where he get it but he hurry away for fear i would claim it and he christiania through the big tree make I very envious many of the child ski to school and back get endless practice all through the winter month may i here appeal to british runner who may have old ski even broken one to throw away to offer they to the local branch of the swiss ski club as there be a organization which mend they or cut they down for lending or give to the school child who be too poor to provide themselves with ski when the beginner have learn the element of straight running and turn and begin to go off among the mountain the real interest of ski-ing be begin with the slow climb up in single file first of all through wood and then out on to the open slope this be usually a silent game as breath be need for the climb and it be dull work keep up a conversation with the back ahead sometimes as one inadvertently step on the ski ahead a gruff word be fling back and the trespasser be wise who stop pretend to attend to he binding or to look at the view -- the view be usually worth look at too as there be usually something to see if it be not a distant view of the great alp or of the valley below it be of tree or rock which if examine carefully usually show some sign of life i remember be snub by a ardent ski-er because i ventured to ask what be those black bird who want to know about bird when he be ski-ing be the answer i do want to know and i find out that they be alpine chough and i still want to know when i see the inhabitant of the mountain or they track most of the wild animal use old ski track as highway now even find it worth while to follow the zigzag of a uphill traverse fox hare and roe deer all use they the roe deer ' foot show so much tinier than the chamoix who leave a deep rough track as they usually run in each other 's footstep the hare 's track when run be two hole abreast and then two single one the fox run rather like a dog the squirrel hop two foot at a time often leave a slight ruffle on the snow as he swish he tail among the cembra tree in the engadine the snow may be sprinkle with the nut out of the cone they be delicious eating be very like the italian stone pine nut or pinellus and they attract the squirrel as much as they do the nutcracker bird marten and pole cat leave distinct footmark weasel also and these be easily recognize as they usually start from a hole under a bush or a rock one day when a party of we be silently traverse a slope above mürren a tiny brown ball come roll down which when pick up prove to be the warm dead body of a mouse look up we see a weasel peer out of he hole anxious as to the fate of he dinner a mouse 's track also usually start from a tiny hole and the two foot go abreast while the tail leave a line all the way we nearly always see chamoix and roe deer when ski-ing in the wood at pontresina as it be a protected area and they be not shoot and therefore become very tame the chamoix be drive down into the wood in search of the lichen which hang like a beard from the branch of the cembra tree on muotta celerina this winter we see four chamoix below we in the wood without a word we guide caspar gra dash down the slope after they and very nearly catch one round the neck as they be surprised and know there be a precipice beyond the scrub below they they could not make up they mind which way to go the roe deer scrape away the snow below the tree in search of alpenrose or bear berry leave or dry blade of grass they suffer more than the chamoix after a heavy snowfall because they be not so strong and can not scamper through it at the beginning of this season kloster have a snowfall of some two metre and the roe deer be drive down to the village where the peasant feed they in stable till the weather improve four be catch on the railway have get on to the line at a cross and be unable to spring out over the high bank of snow ibex be be let loose in order to re-establish they where they be exterminate a few year ago they can usually be see through the telescope at bernina hauser above pontresina and also opposite mürren the ibex or steinbock be use as the coat of arm of the canton of graubünden and be familiar to ski runner as the badge of the local ski club of zuoz in the engadine after some controversy eagle be be encourage to increase have be almost exterminate we see a beauty sailing over the muotta muraigl valley one day there be even talk of try to get bear back but the peasant obstruct this as they be so destructive to sheep as a child at davo i see three bear bring in dead by hunter and remember with pride mix with disgust tasting a bear 's paw a peasant tell I of how as a boy he look after the village sheep near the silvretta glacier and of a bear who use to come and kill a sheep and then bury it in the ice for future eating ski runner shudder at the idea of meet a bear while on a run but they need not worry as the bear roll up and sleep through the winter so that unless the ski-er take a unusually heavy fall into the bear 's hole he would be safe enough on the surface besides which it be say that a bear can not traverse down a slope so that the ski-er could easily get away unless the bear roll to the bottom and then run along and wait for he as there be no bear in switzerland now perhaps it be waste of time to start a controversy about the best turn with which to circumvent a bear cow be much more dangerous i be pursue down the village street at pontresina by a playful cow who have be take to the pump to drink she put down she head and stick up she tail and i waste no time in push away from she another animal which hibernate through the winter be the marmot and i often think of they sound asleep under the snow as i pass along the slope of some high valley they be say to have breathing hole but i have never see they unless this be the explanation of some hole which puzzle I on the schiltgrat above mürren i be traverse uphill a long way ahead of my party and notice some isolate hole in the snow very like ski stick hole but with no ski track near as i pass a gray hen fly out of one of the hole and look back i see several black cock and gray hen fly away it be more likely that they have make they own hole to shelter in rather than that these be marmot hole ptarmigan often greet one on the higher ridge and sometimes a capercailzie will get up with a noise which be very apt to upset one the chough be persistent follower of a ski-ing party fly over one 's head and chirrup for lunch when at last we stop and take we nosebag out of we rucksack they perch on a cliff near and wait till we move on when they immediately fly down to see what we have leave for they i have see a paper lunch-bag which they be unable to tear absolutely surround by a circle of they footmark some eight foot in diameter how they must have worry it and each other in they endeavor to get at the contents at mürren a pair of raven also accompany the ski-er they take they perch high up and watch the many luncheon party croak now and then to remind we of they wish to share we slice of beef and sausage these packed lunch be usually so plentiful that the chough and the raven get a goodly feed the tidy ski-er who bury all he paper and orange peel and other debris will often find next day that the whole thing have be dig up by a fox at many of the alpine hut the snow-finch have adopt the habit of the sparrow and be often so tame that he will almost take crumb from one 's hand another bird i love among the alp be the dipper or water ouzel ski-ing along the snow bank of the river i have often watch he hop down into the water and run along the bottom pick up whatever he food be among the pebble surely most ski runner can spare time to watch all these little people whose rights to the snow field be even greater than they own very little vegetation show in winter but it be wonderful what a lot one can find if one look carefully and it certainly make ski-ing more interesting to I if i can recognize the tree plant and seed a very fair estimate can be make of the different height by notice what grow corn stop at 2000 to 3000 foot though a little rye may be grow up to 5000 foot in sunny place fruit tree and beech tree stop at about 4000 foot there be one beech tree above davo about 5500 foot above the sea but it have never succeed in top the huge boulder which shelter it from the north the silver fir be healthy at 4000 foot but be seldom find much above that level while the spruce or fir go up to 7000 foot and do best there larch seem to thrive best at about 5000-6000 foot but may be see almost as high as the top of the bernina pass on the south side face italy the cembra pine like a great cedar be the finest tree in the alp and do best at 6000 foot to 7000 foot it be also call the arollum pine because of the forest near that place in the upper engadine almost all the forest be of cembra and there be one splendid old tree know as the giant tree near upper tree level on muotta celerina another group of veteran grow just below the little scheidegg on the grindelwald side many of these tree be say to be 600 or 700 year old and they wood be much use for panelling in graubünden it be recognize by the big dark knot the panel be usually form of board reverse so that the knot form a symmetrical pattern larch be also use and be very red while sycamore go to the making of table and chair in the bündner stübli good example of the modern use of these wood may be see in the hotel vereina and silvretta at kloster while the museum at zurich contain beautiful old panelled room from different district creep down steep avalanche slope above 5000 foot we find _ pinus montana _ whose long branch form a tangle in which to catch one 's ski tip below 5000 foot this pine will sometimes grow almost upright but never attain much height alder may also be a trap for ski on a avalanche slope where it creep downhill and provide a very slippery surface for the snow i remember shoot down such a slope about 100 foot when the snow slip with I in a safe place along the river the alder grow into quite a fine tree and if its catkin be pick at christmas and be bring into the warm house they soon blossom out and spread they green pollen over everything rather a nice way of bring a reminder of spring into one 's winter holiday birch and mountain ash grow happily up to 6000 foot on sheltered slope but after 6000 foot there be no deciduous tree except the tiny creep willow bury deep under the snow juniper be the most ubiquitous shrub to be find it seem to I you get its various type at sea level in italy and on the top of mountain up to 8000 foot when it poke up through the snow beside the alpine rise or _ rhododendron ferrugineum _ on the top of ridge when the snow be blow away all sort of treasure may be recognize the creep azalea with its wee evergreen leave which no one thinking of the garden azalea at home would recognize as belong to the same family little primula and saxifrage shelter in crack in the rock with nothing but bunch of brown leaf to show they up _ polygulum chamaebuxi _ or bastard box almost always in flower on a sunny patch even in midwinter on the lower slope gentian or anemone plant with they bud wait to open when the soft wind or rain of spring call to they _ erica carnea _ with its whitish bud wait for spring to color they one of the earliest of the flower or the seed of _ gentiana lutea _ or _ asclepedium _ or _ purpurea _ and of aconite or monkshood on they strong stem stand high above the snow one winter when at 4000 foot we have no snow at christmas we go flower hunting instead of ski-ing and find thirty different sort of flower out but this be exceptional and by no means satisfy to the ski runner who have come out for the sport he love and not on botany intent later when the snow begin to melt on south slope in march the mass of purple and white crocus open to the sun nothing in the whole world can equal the mass of these crocus they push up as the miracle of spring impatiently thrust through the snow melting hole for themselves the soldanella do the same but not till late in march and with they come gentian and the whole glory of the alpine spring have begin by this time the ski-er have to oil and put away he ski or climb to the glacier and higher snow field a wonderful experience alternate between spring and winter as he change he level summer ski-ing the only experience of summer ski-ing which i have have be on the jungfrau joch about 11900 foot above the sea the berner oberland and jungfrau railway carry one up from interlaken to the joch where there be a excellent new hotel offering every possible comfort good ski-ing can be have on the glacier and i be surprise that more people do not come out for practice during the summer the two great draw-back to this ski-ing be firstly the expense and secondly the difficulty of breathe the expense be unavoidable because the carriage of building material food etc to such a height must necessarily entail high price glacier ski-ing except on the snow-field near the joch also usually necessitate the employment of guide but these snow-field be so extensive and so safe that a week could be spend in practise without a guide after the first night on the joch the feeling of breathlessness be reduce and so long as all climb be do slowly no bad effect need be expect by people in good health and condition the jungfrau joch can be reach from london in twenty-six hour and keen runner could enjoy a week or a fortnight of amusing ski-ing on snow which lend itself particularly well to the practice of all turn the jungfrau joch branch of the swiss ski club hold a annual meet on the joch in the month of July which be well attend by runner and jumper from all part of switzerland first-class guide and ski instructor can be find at the joch people who would prefer not to sleep at so great a height could stay at the scheidegg or eiger gletscher at both of which place hotel exist in view of the shortness of winter holiday it seem a pity that more enthusiast do not profit by the chance of practise which the jungfrau joch railway offer in summer time i have twice spend two day up there and have enjoy they immensely the snow be very different to anything i ever meet in winter but also very easy and fill I with confidence in July and August the crevasse show clearly and need not inspire anxiety in anyone except after a new fall of snow which may hide the smaller one temporarily again there must be several square mile of perfectly safe ski-ing on the glacier behind the joch which provide nursery slope just as good as anything find in winter the gradient vary but it be easy to find stretch of 10 ° to 30 ° unbroken by crevasse anyone come out to ski on the glacier in summer time should bring with they they own ski or arrange to hire these at some winter sport center in the valley they should also be provide with all the ski-ing equipment they may need a few pair of ski be keep for hire purpose on the jungfrau joch but they be not very good one and it would be better not to depend on they regulation of the british ski test as approve by the federal council of british ski club 1923 general regulation 1 the british standard ski test have be draw up by the federal council of british ski club hereinafter refer to as the council _ the council represent the follow club which be name in the order of they foundation : the davo ski club the ski club of great britain the alpine ski club the british ski association and the lady ' ski club _ 2 the british standard ski test be of two kind : cross country ski-ing test and jump test there be three test of each kind a first class test a second class test and a third class test 3 the test be open to all ski-runner without payment but successful candidate will only receive a certificate and badge if they be member or prospective member of one of the club represent on the council a candidate who have be propose and second for a constituent club and who have pay a year 's subscription and whose election be pend will be deem a prospective member for the purpose of this rule the follow sum will be payable for the badge these sum may be pay through the member ' club or direct to the hon secretary of the council first class badge 35 second class badge 3 third class badge 2 4 in switzerland franc will be accept instead of shilling in payment of badge 5 certificate and badge will be award to any person who have pass the cross country ski-ing test : first class a gold badge second class a silver badge third class a bronze badge certificate will be issue to those who have pass the corresponding jump test and these certificate will entitle the holder to receive a jump badge when the council authorize the issue of new badge 6 application for the badge accompany by a certificate sign by two judge shall be make either to the local representative of the club or to the hon secretary of the council kr swan esq 1 essex court temple within three month of the passing of the test 7 certificate holder will alone be recognize as have pass the test _ no certificate will be recognize as valid unless issue to a member of one of the constituent club of the council _ a list of those certify as have pass any of the test will be issue periodically by the council 8 _ judge _ -- no candidate can be judge for any test nor for any part of a test unless two qualify judge be present no candidate can be pass for any part of a test except by be judge formally and know that he be be judge 9 the judge be appoint by the council the appointment be for the season only judge and emergency judge must be of british nationality 10 the council also appoint a emergency committee any one of whom shall have the power to appoint temporary judge for the season only to act with a judge elect by the council such temporary judge shall only be qualify to judge such test as they have themselves pass the appointment of a emergency judge will not be recognize by the council unless the appointment be notify to the secretary of the council cross country ski-ing test general instruction to judge the following definition may be take as apply to the three test : _ stem turn _ -- for the purpose of these test judge must insist that candidate shall adopt that type of stem turn know as the lift stem turn that be to say the stem turn which be finish by lift round the inside ski _ telemark _ -- in the telemark the back ski should drop behind and the bend of the back ski should not be ahead of the ankle of the lead foot and should not be allow to come forward till the turn be complete candidate who start the turn with a mixture of ordinary stem should not be pass _ christiania _ -- the christianium may be do _ either _ by separate the point of the ski and complete by bring they parallel -- the so-called open christianium _ or _ by keep the ski parallel throughout and jerk they round the jerk christianium _ or _ by a very slight stem the ski be immediately bring parallel after the turn have start the so-called close or stem christianium in every case the essence of the christianium be that the swing should be rapid and that the preliminary stem or diverge of the ski should be as slight as possible a turn start by pronounced stem and complete as a christianium should not be pass _ continuous turn _ be sometimes know as downhill turn they be use to connect one tack with another and differ from stop or uphill turn in that the turn be make away from the hill instead of up towards the hill candidate must not stop between two continuous turn _ hard snow _ -- for the purpose of these test any well-beaten down practice slope from which all trace of soft snow have disappear may be consider as hard snow hard crust superficially soften by the sun can not be consider as hard snow _ soft snow _ -- for the purpose of these test a deep layer of powder snow rest on hard crust or hard crust superficially soften by the sun but not breakable may be consider as soft snow _ form _ -- the judge must consider the form of the runner as well as he speed and steadiness the distinguish mark of good form be a easy balance without dependence on the stick -lrb- see below -rrb- a erect position except on steep slope and a narrow single spoor in soft snow _ use of the stick _ -- candidate should carry stick throughout these test but the stick should not be use to reduce speed nor to help out a turn on the other hand a candidate may be allow a prod with a single stick at the end of a turn provide that he be carry a stick in each hand or in the event of the candidate use a single stick that this stick be only hold in one of he hand _ he must not put both he stick together nor hold a single stick in he two hand during any of these test unless expressly direct to do so by the judge _ the third class test -lrb- cross country -rrb- the third class test consist of three part which may be pass on different day and before different judge part -lrb- a -rrb- -- _ the ascent of 1500 foot in not more than 1 hour 30 minute and the descent of the same distance within a time which shall be decide by the judge this time shall not be less than 7 minute nor more than 20 minute and shall not exceed 12 minute unless sanction by a second class judge or member of the emergency committee who be present and judge _ part -lrb- b -rrb- -- _ four continuous lift stem turn on a slope of hard snow or hard snow cover by a shallow layer of soft snow the angle of the slope to be between 15-20 degree _ part -lrb- c -rrb- -- _ four continuous telemark in soft snow on a slope of similar gradient _ instruction to judge 1 the course select for part -lrb- a -rrb- should include at least 200 foot of moderately difficult ground course such as the lauberhorn at wengen which be a unbroken descent of 1500 foot that a good runner could take straight should not be choose no part of the course should be along a road 2 throughout the test candidate must carry rucksack which should weigh about six lb for man and three lb for lady the ski must not be remove during the test except to clean or repair they 3 the judge should if possible appoint two time-keeper during the descent not more than six candidate must be judge in one batch 4 not more than three attempt at part -lrb- b -rrb- and not more than three attempt at part -lrb- c -rrb- be allow on the same day 5 the attention of the judge be direct to the general instruction the gradient on which third class candidate be expect to do they turn be gentle as the intention be to secure that candidate should master the proper method so as to be able later to make real use of the turn on steep slope judge be therefore urge to insist that the stem turn and telemark be do correctly and in good style each turn should be short well define and not a mere change of direction qualify test for the second class -lrb- cross country -rrb- no candidate may enter for part -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- b -rrb- and -lrb- c -rrb- of the second class test until he have pass the qualify test and no candidate may enter for the qualify test until he have pass the third class test the qualify test consist of three part which may be pass on different day and before different judge but which must all be pass in the same season part -lrb- a -rrb- -- _ four continuous lift stem turn on a slope of hard snow at a angle of 25-30 degree _ part -lrb- b -rrb- -- _ four continuous telemark turn on a slope of soft snow at a angle of 25-30 degree _ part -lrb- c -rrb- -- _ christianium swing to a standstill -lrb- right and leave -rrb- from a direct descent at a fair speed _ instruction to judge 1 not more than three attempt at any one part should be allow on the same day 2 the christiania should be do on the level or on a gentle slope after a descent from a steep slope as a stop christianium be more difficult on the level than on the slope 3 the judge must require a considerably higher standard of steadiness and certainty than in the third class test the object of the third class test be to ensure that candidate learn the correct method of make the turn the object of the second class test be to ensure that candidate can make practical use of these turn on moderately steep slope the second class test -lrb- cross country -rrb- the second class test consist of three part which must all be pass in the same season and should if possible be judge by the same judge part -lrb- a -rrb- -- _ a descent of not less than 2500 foot mainly on soft snow the course select should provide opportunity for straight run on reasonably steep slope _ part -lrb- b -rrb- -- _ a descent of not less than 1000 foot on hard snow such as unbreakable crust or snow which have be thoroughly beat down _ part -lrb- c -rrb- -- _ a descent of at least 500 foot of woodrunn dense enough to prevent straight running but not too dense to prevent continuous turn _ 1 a second class runner may be define as a runner who can run at a good speed on hard or soft snow of unvarying quality and who be above all thoroughly steady on he turn a runner who run recklessly without judgment and who show little power of select a safe line should not be pass even if he take slope straight at the expense of frequent fall _ the second class test be in the main a test of steady controlled ski-ing at a good but not at a race speed _ 2 candidate must not use they stick to control speed nor to help out a turn except under very exceptional circumstance and with the express permission of the judge the judge must however satisfy themselves that the candidate understand the use of the stick and could in emergency where speed be vital increase they speed and steadiness on difficult snow by the use of the stick qualify test for the first class -lrb- cross country -rrb- no candidate may enter for part -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- b -rrb- and -lrb- c -rrb- of the first class test until he have pass the qualify test that entitle he to be judge for the first class test and no candidate may enter for this qualify test until he have pass the second class test the qualify test consist of five part which may be judge on different day and before different judge but which must all be pass in the same season part -lrb- a -rrb- -- _ four continuous lift stem turn on a slope of hard snow at a angle of not less than 30 degree _ part -lrb- b -rrb- -- _ four continuous telemark turn on a slope of soft snow at a angle of not less than 30 _ part -lrb- c -rrb- -- _ four consecutive jump-turn to connect downhill tack on a slope of breakable crust at a angle of about 30 degree _ part -lrb- d -rrb-
