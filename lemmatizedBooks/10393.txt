produce by ted garvin dave morgan and pg distribute proofreader make the house a home by edgar a guest 1922 _ here be we story page by page happy youth and middle-age smile and tear-drop weal and woe such as all who live must know -- here it be all write down not for glory or renown but the hope when we be go those who bravely follow on meeting care and pain and grief will not falter in belief _ make the house a home we have be build a home for the last fifteen year but it begin to look now as though it will not be finish for many year to come this be not because the contractor be slow or the material scarce or because we keep change we mind rather it be because it take year to build a home whereas a house can be build in a few month mother and i start this home-building job on June 28th 1906 i be twenty-five year of age and she -- well it be sufficient for the purpose of this record to say that she be a few year younger i be just close my career as police reporter for the detroit free press when we be marry up to a few month before we wedding my hour have be from three o'clock in the afternoon until three o'clock in the morning every day of the week except Friday those be not fit hour for a married man -- especially a young married man so it be fortunate for I that my managing editor think i might have possibility as a special writer and relieved I from night duty it be then we begin to plan the home we should build it be to be a hall of contentment and the abide place of joy and beauty and it be all go to be do on the splendid salary of twenty-eight dollar a week that sum do not sound like much now but to we in January 1906 it be independence the foundation of we first home be something less than five hundred dollar out of which be also to come the extravagance of a two-week ' honeymoon trip fortunately for all of we life do not break its sad news in advance dream be free and in they flight of fancy young folk may be as extravagant as they wish there may be breaker ahead and trial day of discouragement and despair but life tell we nothing of they to spoil we dream we know the sort of home we want but we be willing to begin humbly this be not because we be averse to start at the top both mother and i have then and have now a fondness for the best thing of life we should have like a grand piano and a self-making ice box and a servant and a automobile right off but less than five hundred dollar capital and twenty-eight dollar a week salary do not provide those thing what we _ could _ have would be a comfortable flat and some nice furniture we have pay cash for all we could and buy the remainder of the necessary thing on time we have find a wonderful brand-new flat which we could rent for twenty-five dollar a month it have hardwood floor steam heat two big bedroom a fine living room with a gas grate a hot-water heater for the bath and everything modern and convenient to-day the landlord would ask ninety dollar a month for that place and tell you he be lose money at that with the rent pay we should have eighty-seven dollar a month leave to live on the grocery bill at that time would not run more than twenty dollar a month telephone gas and electric light would not exceed ten dollar a month the milkman and the paper boy would take but little and in winter time a ton of coal per month would be sufficient oh we should have plenty of money and could easily afford to pledge twenty dollar a month to pay for necessary furniture it will be notice that into we dream come no physician no dentist no expense bob up from unexpected source not a single bill collector call at the front door of we dream castle to ask for money which we do not have if older and wiser head suggest the possibility of danger we produce we plan on paper and ask they from whence could trouble come to-day we understand the depth of the kindly smile which we protest always evoke they be let the dreamer dream at last the furniture be buy on the installment plan and the new flat be be put in order it call for a few more piece of furniture than we have figure on and the debt in consequence be greater but that mean merely a few month more to make payment it be fine furniture too of course it have long since cease to serve we but never in this world shall that dining set be duplicate for perfection of finish and loveliness of design that first oak dining table will linger in we memory for life the one we now have cost more than all the money we spend for all the furniture with which we begin housekeeping and yet figure accord to the joy it have bring to we it be poor in comparison and so it be too with the mahogany settee upholster in green plush and the beveled glass dresser and the living-room chair we use to make evening trip over to that flat merely for the joy of admire these thing -- we thing the first we have ever possess then come the night of June 27th we have both look forward to that wonderful honeymoon trip up the lake to mackinac island and tomorrow we be to start but right then i be sure that both mother and i wish we might call it off it seem so foolish to go away from such a beautiful flat and such lovely furniture the honeymoon trip last two week and one day at mackinac island i find mother in tear what the matter i ask i want to go home she say i know i be silly and foolish but i want to get back to we own house and we own furniture and arrange we wedding present and hang the curtain and put that set of haviland china in the cabinet so back we come to begin we home-building in earnest the rent and the furniture installment come due regularly just as we have expect so do the gas and electric light and telephone bill but somehow or other we dream figure and the actual reality do not balance there never be a month when there be as much left of we eighty-seven dollar as we have figure there should have be for one thing i be take ill that bring the doctor into the house and since then we have always have he to reckon with and to settle with then there be a insurance policy to keep up in we dream day the possibility of my die sometime have never enter we head but now it be a awful reality and that quarterly premium develop a distressing habit of fall due at the most inopportune time just when we think we should have at least twenty dollar for ourselves in would come the little yellow slip inform we that the thirty day ' grace expire on the fifth but the home-of-our-own be still in we dream we be happy but we be go to be still happier if ever we could get rid of those furniture installment we could start save for the kind of home we want then one evening mother whisper the happiest message a wife ever tell a husband we be no longer to live merely for ourselves there be to be another soon who should bind we closer together and fill we life with gladness but -- and many a night we sit for hour and plan and talk and wonder -- _ how _ be we to meet the expense there be nothing in the savings bank and much be need there mother have cherish for year she idea for she baby 's outfit they would cost money and i would be no miserly father either my child should have the best of everything somehow it be up to I to get it somehow to if only that furniture be pay for then a curious event occur i owe little bill amount to about twenty-one dollar this sum include the gas electric light and telephone bill on which a add sum be charge if unpaid before the tenth of the month i have no money to meet they i be worry and discourage to borrow that sum would have be easy but to pay it back would have be difficult that very morning into the office come the press agent of a local theater accompany by mr henry dixey the well-known actor mr dixey want two lyric for song he have the idea which he wish express in rhyme and wonder whether or not i would attempt they i promise he that i would and on the spot he hand I twenty-five dollar in cash to bind the bargain if those song prove successful i should have more the way out have be provide from mr dixey 's point of view those song be not a success but from mine they be for they bridge I over a chasm i have think i could not leap i never hear from that pair of song afterward but neither mother nor i will ever forget the day they be write it mean more than the mere pay of bill too it teach we to have faith -- faith in ourselves and faith in the future there be always a way out of the difficulty even though we can not see or guess what that way be to be it will be provide since then we have go together through many dark day and cruel hurt and bitter disappointment but always to come out stronger for the test the next few month be devote to preparation for the baby and we financial reckoning have to be readjust i have to find way of make a little more money i be not after much money but i must have more all i have to sell be what i could write where be a quick market for a poor newspaper man 's wares my experience with mr dixey turn I to the vaudeville stage i could write playlet i think so while mother be busy sew at night i devoted myself to write and at last the first sketch be finish at the temple theater that week be the popular character actor william h thompson to he i show the manuscript of the sketch which be call the matchmaker mr thompson take it on Tuesday and on Friday he send word that he wish to see I into he dressing-room i go almost afraid to face he it be a bully little sketch say he as i sit on he trunk and i would like to buy it from you i can not pay as much as i should like but if you care to let I have it i 'll give you two hundred and fifty dollar -- one hundred and fifty dollar now and the remain hundred next week i try to appear indifferent but the heart of I be almost burst with excitement it mean that the furniture bill be as good as pay and there would be money in the bank for the first time since we be marry the deal be make and i leave the theater with the largest sum of money i have ever make all at once later someone say to I that i be foolish to sell that sketch outright for so little money foolish say i that two hundred and fifty dollar look bigger to I than the promise of a thousand some day in the future once more the way out have be provide and then come the baby -- a glorious little girl -- and the home have begin to be worth-while there be a new charm to the wall and hall the oak table and the green plush settee take on a new glory i be the usual proud father with add variation of my own one of my pet illusion be that none save mother and I be to be trust to hold we little one when other _ would _ take she i stand guard to catch she if in some careless moment they should let she fall as she grow older my collar become finger-marked where she little hand have touch they we have picture on we wall of course and trinket on the mantelpiece and a large glass mirror which have be one of we wedding gift these thing have become commonplace to we -- until the baby begin to notice they night after night i would take she in my arm and show she the sheep in one of the picture and talk to she about they and she would coo delightedly the trinket on the mantelpiece become dearer to we because she love to handle they the home be be sanctify by she presence we have come into a new realm of happiness but a home can not be build always on happiness we be to learn that through bitter experience we have see white crepe on other door without ever think that some day it might flutter on we own we have witness sorrow but have never suffer it we home have welcome many a gay and smile visitor but there be a grim and sinister one to come against whom no door can be bar after thirteen month of perfect happiness its planning and dream the baby be take from we the blow fall without warn i leave home that morning with mother and the baby wave they usual farewell to I from the window early that afternoon contrary to my usual custom i decide to go home in advance of my regular time i have no reason for do this aside from a strange unwillingness to continue at work i recall later that i clean up my desk and put away a number of thing as though i be go away for some time i never before have do that and nothing have occur which might make I think i should not be back at my desk as usual when i reach home the baby be suffer from a slight fever and mother already have call the doctor in he diagnose it as only a slight disturbance during dinner i think baby 's breathing be not as regular as it should be and i summon the doctor immediately she condition grow rapidly worse and a second physician be call but it be not in human skill to save she at eleven o'clock that night she be take from we it be needless to dwell here upon the agony of that first dark time through which we pass that such a blow could leave loveliness in its path and add a touch of beauty to we dwelling place seem unbelievable at the time yet to-day we first baby still live with we as wonderful as she be in those glad thirteen month she have not grow older as have we but smile that same sweet baby smile of hers upon we as of old we can talk of she now bravely and proudly and we have come to understand that it be a privilege to have have she even for those brief thirteen month to have joy in common be the dream of man and wife we have suppose that love be base on mutual _ happiness _ and mother and i have be happy together we have be walk arm in arm under blue sky and we know how much we mean to each other but just how much we _ need _ each other neither of we really know -- until we have to share a common sorrow to be partner in a sacred memory be a divine bond to be partner in a little mound in one of god 's silent garden be the closest relationship which man and woman can know on this earth we life have be happy before now they have be make beautiful so it be with the home it begin to mean more to we as we begin each to mean more to the other the bedroom in which we baby fall asleep seem glorified of course there be the lonely day and week and month when everything we touch or see bring back the memory of she i come home many a evening to find on mother 's face the mark of tear and i know she have be live over by herself the sorrow of it all i learn how much braver the woman have to be than the man i could go into town where there be the contagion of good cheer and where my work absorb my thought and help to shut out grief but not so with mother she must live day by day and hour by hour amid the scene of she anguish no matter where she turn something remind she of the joy we have know and lose even the striking clock call back to she mind the hour when something should have be do for the baby i _ must _ have another little girl she sob night after night i _ must _ have another little girl and once more the way out be provide we hear of a little girl who be to be put out for adoption she be of good but unfortunate parent we propose to adopt she i have hear many argument against adopt child but i have never hear a good one even the infant doom to die could enrich if only for a few week the life of a childless couple and they would be happier for the rest of they day in the knowledge that they have try to do something worthy in this world and have make comfortable the brief life of a little one what if the child should turn out wrong i hear often from the lip of man and woman what of that i reply you can at least be happy in the thought that you have try to do something for another to childless couple everywhere i would say with all the force i can employ _ adopt a baby _ if you would make glorious the home you be build if you would fill its room with laughter and contentment if you would make you house more than a place in which to eat and sleep if you would fill it with happy memory and come yourselve into a closer and more perfect union adopt a baby then in a year or two adopt another he who spend money on a little child be invest it to real purpose and the dividend it pay in pride and happiness and contentment be beyond computation marjorie come to we when she be three year old she bubble over with mirth and laughter and soothe the ache in we heart she fill the little niche and comer of we life with she sweetness and become not only ours in name but ours also in love and its actuality there be those who suggest that we be too young to adopt a child they tell we that the other child would undoubtedly be send to we as time go on i have neither the space here nor the inclination to list the imaginary difficulty outline to we as the possibility of adoption but mother and i talk it all over one evening and we decide that we need marjorie and marjorie need we as to the financial side of the question i smile i never hear of anyone go to the poorhouse or into bankruptcy i say because of the money spend on a child i fancy i can pay the bill that settle it the next evening when i come home down the stairway lead to we flat come the cry hello daddy from one of the sweetest little face i have ever see and from that day until god need she more and call she home that hello daddy greet I and make every care worth while the little home have begin to grow in beauty once more that first shop tour for marjorie stand out as a epoch in we life i be not of the right sex to describe it marjorie come to we with only such clothing as a poor mother could provide she must be outfit anew from head to toe and she be the next evening when she greet I she be the proud possessor of more lovely thing than she have ever know before but beautiful as the little face appear to I then more beautiful be the look in mother 's face there have come into she eye a look of happiness which have be absent for many month i learn then and i state it now as a positive fact that a woman 's greatest happiness come from dress a little girl mother may like pretty clothes for themselves but to put pretty thing on a little girl be a infinitely greater pleasure more than once mother go down-town for something for herself -- only to return without it but with something for marjorie we pledge to ourselves at the very begin that we would make marjorie ours not only to ourselves but to other we friend be ask never to refer in she presence to the fact that she be adopt as far as we be concern it be dismiss from we mind she be three year old when she be bear to we and from then on we be she father and she mother to many who know she and love she this article will be the first intimation they ever have receive that marjorie be not we own flesh and blood it be she pride and boast that she be like she mother but have she father 's eye both she mother and i have smile hundred of time as people meet she for the first time would say anyone would know she belong to you she look exactly like you marjorie make a difference in we way of live a second-story flat comfortable though it be be not a good place to bring up a little girl more than ever we need a home of we own but to need and to provide be two different proposition we need a back yard but back yard be expensive and though newspaperman may make good husband they seldom make good money one evening mother announce to I that she have see the house we ought to have it have just be complete have everything in it she heart have wish for and could be buy for forty-two hundred dollar the price be just forty-two hundred dollar more than i have all i do have be the wish to own a home of my own but four year of we married life have go and i be no nearer the first payment on a house than when we begin as man and wife however i investigate and find that i could get this particular house by pay five hundred dollar down and agree to pay thirty-five a month on the balance i could swing thirty-five a month but the five hundred be a high barrier then i make my first wise business move i go to julius haass president of the wayne county and home savings bank who always have be my friend and explain to he my difficulty he loan I that five hundred dollar for the first payment -- i to pay it back twenty-five dollar monthly -- and the house be ours we have become land owner overnight my income have increase of course but so have my liability the first few year of that new house tax we ingenuity more than once we spend now and then not money which we have but money which we be _ go to get _ but it be buy happiness if ever a couple have find real happiness in this world we find it under the roof of that leicester court home there nearly all that have bring joy and peace and contentment into we life be bear to we it be from there i begin to progress it be there my publisher find I and it be there little bud be bear to we we be out of it now we leave it for a big reason but we drive by it often just to see it for it be still ours in the precious memory of the year we spend within its wall still in the begin it be just a house it have no association and no history it have be build to sell the people who pay for its construction see in its grow wall and rooftree only the few hundred dollar they hope to gain it be leave to we to change that _ house _ into a _ home it sound preachy i know to say that all building depend for they real beauty upon the spirit of the people who inhabit they but it be true as the week and month slip by the new house begin to soften and mellow under mother 's gentle touch the living-room assume a air of comfort my book now have a real corner of they own the guest-chamber -- or rather the little spare-room -- already have entertain its transient tenant and as we friend come and go the wall catch something from they all to remind we of they presence i take to garden the grounds be small but they be large enough to teach I the joy of a intimate friendship with grow thing to-day in my somewhat larger garden i have more than one hundred and fifty rosebush and twenty or thirty peony clump and i know they name and they habit the garden have become a part of the home it be not yet the garden i dream of nor even the garden which i think it will be next year but it be the place where play divide the ground with beauty what bud do not require for a baseball diamond the rose possess early one morning in July bud come to we immediately the character of that front bedroom be change it be no longer just we bedroom it be the room where bud be bear of all the room in all the house of all the world there be none so gloriously treasured in the memory of man and woman as those wherein they child have come to birth i have have many fine thing happen to I : friend have bear I high on kindly shoulder out of the depths of they generous heart they have give I honor which i have not deserve i have more than once come home proud in the possession of some new joy or of some task accomplish but i have never know and never shall know a thrill of happiness to equal that which follow good old doctor gordon 's brief announcement : it be a boy it be a boy all that day and the next i fairly shout it to friend and stranger to marjorie 's sweetness and to the radiant loveliness of the little baby which be ours for so brief a time have be add the strength and roguishness of a boy the next five year see the wall of we home change in character finger mark and hammer mark begin to appear when bud have reach the stage where he could walk calamity begin to follow in he trail once he tug at a table cover and the open bottle of ink fall upon the rug there be a great splotch of ink forever to be visible to all who enter that living-room yet even that black stain become in time a part of we we grow even to boast of it we point it out to new acquaintance as the place where bud spill the ink it be a evidence of he health and he natural tendency it prove to all the world that in bud we have a real boy a honest-to-goodness boy who could spill ink -- and _ would _ if you do not keep a close watch on he then come the toy period of we development the once tidy house become a place where angel would have fear to tread in the dark building block and train of car and fire engine and a rock horse be everywhere to trip the foot of the unwary mother scold about it at time and i fear i myself have mutter harsh thing when late at night i have enter the house only to stumble against the tin side of a express wagon but i have come to see that toy in a house be its real adornment there be no pleasanter sight within the front door of any man 's castle than the strew and disorder evidence that child there abide the house seem unfurnished without they this chaos still exist in we house to-day mother say i encourage it perhaps i do i know that i dread the come day when the home shall become neat and orderly and silent and precise what be more i live in horror of the day when i shall have to sit down to a meal and not send a certain little fellow away from the table to wash he hand that have become a part of the ceremonial of my life when the evening come that he will appear for dinner clean and immaculate he shirt button properly and he hair nicely brush perhaps mother will be proud of he but as for I there will be a lump in my throat -- for i shall know that he have grow up financially we be progress we have a little more to do with as mother express it but sorrow and grief and anxiety be not through with we we be not to be one hundred per cent happy no one ever be marjorie be stricken with typhoid fever and for fourteen week we fight that battle see she sink almost into the very arm of death and watch she pale and waste body day by day until at last the fever break and she be spare to we another bedroom assume a new meaning to we both we know it as it be in the dark hour of night we see the morning sun break through its window it be the first room i visit in the morning and the last i go to every night come home i never stop in hall or living-room but hurry straight to she all there be in that home then be marjorie 's room we live we life within it and gradually she strength return and we be happy again but only for a brief time early the follow summer i be call home by doctor johnson when i reach there he meet I at the front door smile as though to reassure I you and bud be go to get out say he marjorie have scarlet fever bud have already be send to he aunt florence 's i be to gather what clothing i should need for six week and depart if i have be fond of that home before i grow fonder of it as the day go by i think i never know how much i value it until i be shut out from it i could see mother and marjorie through the window but i be not to enter and i grow hungry for a sight of the wall with they finger mark and of the ink spot on the rug we have be six year in the building of that home somehow a part of we have be weave into every nook and corner of it but marjorie be not thrive she cheek be pale and slightly flush the removal of tonsil do not help follow a visit to my dentist perhaps a tooth be spread poison through she system he look at she and after a few minute take I alone into he private office i be sorry eddie he say i be afraid it be not tooth you have a long hard fight to make -- if it be what i think it be tuberculosis have enter we home it have come by way of typhoid and scarlet fever the specialist confirm doctor oakman 's suspicion and we battle begin the little home could serve we no longer it be not the place for such a fight for life as we be to make marjorie must have a wide-open sleep porch and the house lack that nor could one be build upon it and so we find we present home it be for sale at a price i think then i should never be able to pay we could have it by make a down payment of seventy-five hundred dollar the balance to be cover by a mortgage but i neither have that much nor owned security for even a small fraction of it but i do have a friend : a rich but generous friend i tell he what i want and he seem more grieve at my burden than concern with my request he talk only of marjorie and she chance he put he arm about my shoulder and i know he be with I what do you need he ask seventy-five hundred dollar in cash he smile have a lawyer examine the abstract to the property and if it be all right come back to I in two day i be back the title to the house be clear he smile again and hand I he check for the amount with not a scratch of the paper between we i suggest something of that sort to he the important thing be to get the house he say when that be do and you have the deed to it and the papers all fix up you come back and we 'll fix up we little matter and that be how it be do so into we present home we move we have a bigger and a better and a costlier dwelling place we be climb upward but we be also begin once more with just a house just a house -- but found on a mighty purpose it be to become home to we even more dearly love than the one we be leave for four year it have grow in we affection hope have be ours we have live and laugh and sing and progress but we have also weep and grieve twice the doctor have say we be to conquer then come last spring and the end of hope week after week marjorie see the sunbeam filter through the window of she open porch near by a pair of robin build they nest she watch they and know they and name they we plan great thing together and great journey we should make that they be not to be she never know and then she fall asleep she little life have fulfil its mission she have bring joy and beauty and faith into we heart she have comfort we in we hour of loneliness and despair she have be the little cheerful builder of we home -- and perhaps god need she she continue to sleep for three day only for those three day she sun porch be a bower of rose on memorial day mother and i stand once more together beside a little mound where god have lead we late that afternoon we return to the home to which marjorie have take we it have grow more lovely with the beauty which have be ours because of she \* \* \* \* \* the home be not yet complete we still cherish we dream of what it be to be we would change this and that but after all what the home be to be be not within we power to say we hope to go forward together build and change and improve it to-morrow shall see something that be not there yesterday but through sun and shade through trial and through day
