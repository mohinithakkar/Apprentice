' as unfashionable and even dangerous in the circuit of wilke 's mob but that i be convince be you smallest consideration the nature of mr murray 's business and especially he consignment to distant land render it necessary for he to give long credit while the expense and the risk of bring out new book add a fresh strain on he resource in these circumstance he feel the need of fresh capital and apply to he friend mr william kerr surveyor of the general post office for scotland for a loan mr kerr respond in a kindly letter though he could not lend much at the time he send mr murray # 150 lest

with here thou may ` st believe that i set about it with a perfect zeal not lessen from the consideration of the trouble thou hast on my account and the favor i so constantly receive from thee nor certainly that my good friend dr langhorne be not altogether out of the question none of the trade here will transport book at they own risque this be not a reading but a hard-drinking city 200 or 250 be as many as a bookseller except it be a extraordinary work indeed ever throw off at a impression mr murray not only publish the work of other but become a author himself he write two letter in the _ morning chronicle _ in defense of he old friend colonel -lrb- afterwards sir -rrb- robert gordon who have be censure for put a officer under arrest during the siege of broach in which gordon have lead the attack the colonel 's brother gordon of gordonstown write to murray say whether you succeed or not you two letter be admirably write and you have obtain great merit and reputation for the gallant stand you have make for you friend the colonel himself write -lrb- August 201774 -rrb- : i can not sufficiently thank you my dear sir for the extraordinary zeal activity and warmth of friendship with which you so strenuously support and defend my cause and my honor as a soldier when attack so injuriously by colonel stuart especially when he be so powerfully support up to this time mr murray 's success have be very moderate he have bring out some successful work but money come in slowly and he chief difficulty be the want of capital he be therefore under the necessity of refuse to publish work which might have do something to establish he reputation at this juncture ie in 1771 a uncle die leave a fortune of # 17000 of which mr murray be entitle to a fourth share on the strength of this he friend mr kerr advance to he a further sum of # 500 the additional capital be put into the business but even then he prosperity do not advance with rapid stride and in 1777 we find he write to he

of partnership mr murray have see the first representation of column 's comedy of john bull at covent garden theater and be so fascinate by its union of wit sentiment and humor that the day after its

edinburgh this connection have a considerable influence upon murray 's future fortune constable who be about four year older than murray be a man of great ability full of spirit and enterprise he be by nature generous liberal and far-seeing the high price which he give for the best kind of literary work draw the best author round he and he raise the publishing trade of scotland to a height that it have never before reach and make edinburgh a great center of learning and literature in 1800 he commence the _ farmer 's magazine _ and in the following year acquire the property of the _ scot

in the publishing world in the year follow the first issue of the _ review _ constable take into partnership alexander gibson hunter eldest son of david hunter of blackness a forfarshire laird the new partner bring a considerable amount of capital into the firm at a time when capital be greatly need in that grow concern he duty be to take charge of the ledger and account department though he never take much interest in he work but prefer to call in the help of a clever arithmetical clerk it be unnecessary to speak of the foundation of the _ edinburgh review _ it appear at the right time and be mainly support by the talent of jeffrey brougham sydney smith franci horner dr thoma brown lord murray and other distinguished writer the first number immediately attract public attention mr joseph mawman be the london agent but some dissatisfaction have arise with respect to he management the london sale be transfer to the messr longman with one half share in the property of the work during the partnership of murray and highley they have occasional business transaction with constable of edinburgh shortly after the partnership be dissolve in march 1803 murray write as follow to mr constable : _ April _ 25 1803 i have several work in the press which i should be willing to consign to you management in edinburgh but that i presume you have already sufficient business upon you hand and that you would not find mine worth attend to if so i wish that you would tell I of some vigorous young bookseller like myself just start into business upon whose probity punctuality and exertion you think i might rely and i would instantly open a correspondence with he and in return it will give I much pleasure to do any civil office for you in london i should be happy if any arrangement could be make wherein we might prove of reciprocal advantage and be you from you superabundance to pick I out any work of merit of which you would either make I the publisher in london or in which you would allow I to become a partner i dare say the occasion would arise wherein i could return the compliment and you would have the satisfaction of know that you book be in the hand of one who have not yet so much business as to cause he to neglect any part of it mr constable 's answer be favourable in October 1804 mr murray at the instance of constable take as he apprentice charle hunter the younger brother of a gibson hunter constable 's partner the apprenticeship be to be for four or seven year at the option of charle hunter these negotiation between the firm and they increase interchange of book show that they be gradually draw nearer to each other until they correspondence become quite friendly and even intimate walter scott be now make he appearance as a author constable have publish he sir tristram in may 1804 and he lay of the last minstrel in January 1805 large number of these work be forward to london and sell by mr murray at the end of 1805 difference arise between the constable and longman firm as to the periodical work in which they be interested the editor and proprietor of the _ edinburgh review _ be of opinion that the interest of the longman in two other work of a similar character -- the _ annual review _ and the _ eclectic _ -- tend to lessen they exertion on behalf of the _ edinburgh _ it be a matter that might easily have be arrange but the correspondent be man of hot temper and with pen in they hand they send sting letter from london to edinburgh and from edinburgh to london ree longman 's partner be as bitter in word on the one side as hunter constable 's partner be on the other at length a deadly breach take place and it be resolve in edinburgh that the publication of the _ edinburgh review _ should be transfer to john murray fleet street alexander gibson hunter constable 's partner write to mr murray to tell of the rupture and to propose a closer alliance with he mr murray reply : _ john murray to mr ag hunter December 7 1805 _ with regard to the important communication of you last letter i confess the surprise with which i read it be not without some mixture of regret the extensive connection betwixt you house and longman 's can not be sever at once without mutual inconvenience and perhaps mutual disadvantage you share of which a more protracted dismemberment might have prevent from what i have occasion to observe i do not conceive that you concern together would ever again move with a cordiality that would render they lasting but still i imagine that mutual interest and forbearance would allow they to subside into that indifference which without animosity or mischief would leave either party at liberty to enter upon such new arrangement as offer to they separate advantage i do not however doubt but that all thing have be properly consider and perhaps finally settle for the best but time the only arbitrator in these case must decide in you propose engagement with mr davy you will become better acquaint with a man of great natural talent and thoroughly verse in business which he regulate by the most honorable principle as for myself you will find I exceedingly assiduous in promote you view into which i shall enter with feeling higher than those of mere interest indeed link as we house be at present we have a natural tendency to mutual good understanding which will both prevent and soften those asperity in business which might otherwise enlarge into disagreement country order -lrb- refer to constable & co 's ` general order ' -rrb- be a branch of business which i have ever totally decline as incompatible with my more serious plan as a publisher but _ you _ commission i shall undertake with pleasure and the punctuality with which i have attempt to execute _ you first order _ you will i hope consider as a specimen of my disposition to give you satisfaction in every transaction in which we may hereafter be mutually engage it be a great chance for a young man enter life with a moderate amount of capital to be virtually offer a intimate connection with one of the principal publish house of the day it be one of those chance which take at the flood lead on to fortune but there be also the question of honor and mr murray notwithstanding he desire for open out a splendid new connection in business would do nothing inconsistent with the strictest honor he be most unwilling to thrust himself in between constable and longman instead therefore of jump at constable 's advantageous offer he feeling induce he to promote a reconciliation between the party and he continue to enjoin forbearance on the part of both firm so that they might carry on they business transaction as before copy of the correspondence between constable and the longman be submit to referee -lrb- murray and davy -rrb- and the following be mr murray 's reply address to messr constable & co : _ john murray to messr constable & co _ _ December _ 14 1805 gentleman mr hunter 's oblige letter to I arrive this morning that which he enclose with yours to he brother last night charle give I to read the contents be very flattering indeed i can not but agree with mr h that he brother have display very honorable feeling upon hearing of the probable separation of you house and that of messr longman & co mr longman be the first who mention this to he and indeed from the manner in which charle related he conversation upon the affair i could not but feel renew sensation of regret at the unpleasant termination of a correspondence which have it be conduct upon mr longman 's own feeling would have bear i think a very different aspect longman speak of you both with kindness and mildly complain that he have perceive a want of confidence on you part ever since he junction with messr hurst & orme he confess that the correspondence be too harsh for he to support any longer but he add _ if we must part let we part like friend _ i be certain from what charle report to I that mr l and i think mr r -lrb- ree -rrb- be hurt by this sudden disunion recollect how serious every dispute become upon paper when a man write a thousand asperity merely to show or support he superior ability thing that would not have be speak or perhaps even think of in conversation be state and horribly magnify _ upon paper _ consider how many dispute have arise in the world in which both party be so violent in what they believe to be the support of truth and which to the public and indeed to themselves a few year afterwards appear unwise because the occasion or cause of it be not worth contend about consider that you be all of you man who can depend upon each other 's probity and honor and where these essential be not want surely in mere matter of business the rest may be palliate by mutual bearance and forbearance besides you be so connect by various publication you common property and some of they such as will remain so until the termination of you life that you can not effect a entire disunion and must therefore be subject to eternal vexation and regret which will embitter every transaction and settlement between you you know moreover that it be one of the misfortune of we nature that dispute be always the most bitter in proportion to former intimacy and how much dissatisfaction will it occasion if either of you be desirous in a year or two of renew that intimacy which you be now so anxious to dissolve -- to say nothing of you relative utility to each other -- a circumstance which be never properly estimate except when the want of the means remind we of what we have be at such pain to deprive ourselves pause my dear sir whilst to choose be yet in you power show yourselve superior to common prejudice and by a immediate exercise of you acknowledged pre-eminence of intellect suffer arrangement to be make for a accommodation and for a renewal of that connexion which have heretofore be productive of honor and profit i be sure i have to apologize for have venture to say so much to man so much my superior in sense and knowledge of the world and they own interest but sometimes the meanest bystander may perceive disadvantage in the movement of the most skilful player you will not i be sure attribute anything which i have say to a insensibility to the immediate advantage which will arise to myself from a determination opposite to that which i have take the liberty of suggest it arise from a very different feeling i should be very little worthy of you great confidence and attention to my interest upon this occasion if i do not state freely the result of my humble consideration of this matter and have do so i do assure you that if the arrangement which you now propose be carry into effect i will apply the most arduous attention to you interest to which i will turn the channel of my own thought and business which i be proud to say be rise in proportion to the industry and honorable principle which have be use in its establishment i be every day add to a most respectable circle of literary connexion and i hope a few month after the settlement of you present affair to offer share to you of work in which you will feel it advantageous to engage besides as i have at present no particular bias no enormous work of my own which would need all my care i be better qualify to attend to any that you may commit to my charge and be young my business may be form with a disposition as it be towards yours and thus grow up with it we be more likely to form a durable connexion than can be expect with person whose view be imperceptibly but incessantly diverge from each other should you be determine -- _ irrevocably _ determine -lrb- but consider -rrb- upon the disunion with messr longman i will just observe that when person have be intimate they have discover each other 's vulnerable point it therefore show no great talent to direct at they shaft of resentment it be easy both to write and to say ill-natured harsh and cut thing of each other but remember that this power be _ mutual _ and in proportion to the poignancy of the wound which you would inflict will be you own feeling when it be return it be therefore a maxim which i lay down soon after a separation which i _ have _ never to say or do to my late colleague what he could say or do against I in return i know that i have the personal superiority but what he own ingenuity could not suggest other could write for he i must apologise again for have be so tedious but i be sure that the same friendliness on you part which have produce these hasty but well-meant expostulation will excuse they after this i trust it be unnecessary for I to state with how much sincerity i be dear sir you faithful friend john murray ten day after this letter be write mr murray send a copy of it to messr longman & co and write : _ john murray to messr longman & co _ _ December _ 24 1805 gentleman the enclosed letter will show that i be not ignorant that a misunderstanding prevail betwixt you house and that of messr constable & co with the cause however i be as yet unacquainted though i have attempt but in vain to obviate a disunion which i most sincerely regret whatever arrangement with regard to myself may take place in consequence will have arise from circumstance which it be not in my power to prevent and they will not therefore be suffer to interfere in any way with those friendly disposition which will continue i trust to obtain between you and gentleman you obedient servant j murray but the split be not to be avoid it appear however that by the contract enter into by constable with longman in 1803 the latter have acquire a legal right preclude the publication of the _ edinburgh review _ by another publisher without they express assent such assent be not give and the london publication of the _ edinburgh _ continue in longman 's hand for a time but all the other work of constable be at once transfer to mr murray mr constable invite murray to come to edinburgh to renew they personal friendship the foundation of which have be lay during mr murray 's visit to edinburgh in the previous year and now that they union be likely to be much closer he desire to repeat the visit mr murray have another and so far as regard he personal happiness a much more important object in view this arise out of the affection which he have begin to entertain for miss elliot daughter of the late charle elliot publisher with whom mr murray 's father have be in such constant correspondence the affection be mutual and it seem probable that the attachment would ripen into a marriage now that he reputation as a publisher be become established mr murray grow more particular as to the guise of the book which he issue he employ the best maker of paper the best printer and the best book-binder he attend to the size and tone of the paper and quality of the type the accuracy of the printing and the excellence of the illustration all this involve a great deal of correspondence we find he letter to the head of department full of detail as to the turn-out of he book everything from the begin to the end of the issue of a work -- the first inspection of the m the consultation with confidential friend as to its fitness for publication the form in which it be to appear the correction of the proof the binding title and final advertisement -- engage he closest attention besides the elegant appearance of he book he also aim at raise the standard of the literature which he publish he have to criticize as well as to select to make suggestion as to improvement where the manuscript be regard with favor and finally to launch the book at the right time and under the best possible auspices it might almost be say of the publisher as it be of the poet that he be bear not make and mr murray appear from the begin to the end of he career to have be a bear publisher in August 1806 during the slack season in london mr murray make he promise visit to edinburgh he be warmly receive by constable and hunter and enjoy they hospitality for some day after business matter have be dispose of he be take in hand by hunter the junior partner and lead off by he to enjoy the perilous hospitality of the forfarshire laird those have be call the day of heroic drinking intemperance prevail to a enormous extent it be a time of greater licentiousness perhaps in all the capital of europe and this northern one among the rest than have be know for a long period man of the best education and social position drink like the scandinavian barbarian of olden time tavern-drinking now almost unknown among the educate and professional class of edinburgh be then carry by all rank to a dreadful excess murray be conduct by hunter to he father 's house of eskmount in forfarshire where he be most cordially receive and in accordance with the custom of the time the hospitality include invitation to drinking bout at the neighbouring house a unenviable notoriety in this respect attach to william maule -lrb- create baron panmure 1831 -rrb- he be the second son of the eighth earl of dalhousie but on succeed through he grandmother to the estate of the earl of panmure he have assume the name of maule in lieu of that of ramsay much against he will murray be compel to take part in some of these riotous festivity with the rollick hard-drinking forfarshire laird and doubtless he be not sorry to make he escape at length uninjured if not unscathed and to return to more congenial society in edinburgh he attachment to miss elliot end in a engagement in the course of he correspondence with miss elliot 's trustee mr murray give a statement of he actual financial position at the time : when i say he write that my capital in business amount to five thousand pound i mean it to be understand that if i quitted business to-morrow the whole of my property be sell even disadvantageously it would leave a balance in my favor free from debt or any incumbrance of the sum above specify but you will observe that continue it as i shall do in business i know it to be far more considerable and productive i will hope that it have not be think uncandid in I if i do not earlier specify the amount of my circumstance for i consider that i have do this in the most delicate and satisfactory way when i take the liberty of refer you to mr constable to whom i consequently disclose my affair and whose knowledge of my connexion in business might i think have operate more pleasingly to miss elliot 's friend than any communication from myself the correspondence with miss elliot go on and at length it be arrange that mr murray should proceed to edinburgh for the marriage he go by mail in the month of February a tremendous snowstorm set in on he journey north from a village near doncaster he write to constable : the horse be twice blow quite round unable to face the horrid blast of cold wind the like of which i have never know before there be at the same time a terrible fall of snow which completely obscure everything that could be see from the coach window the snow become of great depth and six strong horse could scarcely pull we through we be four hour behind time from doncaster he go to durham in a postchaise and push onward he at last reach edinburgh after six day ' stormy travel while at edinburgh mr murray reside with mr sand one of the late charle elliot 's trustee the marriage take place on march 6 1807 and the newly marry pair at once start for kelso in spite of the road be still very bad and obstruct by snow near blackshield the horse fall down and roll over and over the postboy 's leg be break and the carriage be sadly damage a neighbouring blacksmith be call to the rescue and after a hour and a half the carriage be sufficiently repair to be able to proceed a fresh pair of horse be obtain at the next stage and the married couple reach kelso in safety they remain there a few day wait for mr elliot who be to follow they and on she arrival they set out at once for the south the intimacy which exist between mr murray and mr d'israelus will be observe from the fact that the latter be select as one of the marriage trustee a few day after the arrival of the married pair in london they be invite to dine with mr d'israelus and he friend mr alexander hunter whom mr murray have invite to stay with he during he visit to london thus describe the event : dress and go along with the clan murray to dine at mr d'israelus 's where we have a most sumptuous banquet and a very large party in honor of the newly marry folk there be a very beautiful woman there mr turner wife of sharon turner the anglo-saxon historian who i be tell be one of the godwin school if they be all as beautiful accomplished and agreeable as this lady they must be a deuced dangerous set indeed and i should not choose to trust myself amongst they we male part of the company consist mostly of literary man -- cumberland turner d'israeli basevus prince hoare and cervetto the truly celebrated violoncello player turner be the most able and agreeable of the whole by far cumberland the most talkative and eccentric perhaps have a good sprinkling of learning and humor in he conversation and anecdote from have live so long amongst the eminent man of he day such as johnson foote garrick and such like but he conversation be sadly disgust from he tone of irony and detraction convey in a cunning sort of way and direct constantly against the _ edinburgh review _ walter scott -lrb- who be a ` poor ignorant boy and no poet ' and never write a five-feet line in he life -rrb- and such other d -- d stuff chapter iv marmion -- constable and ballantyne -- the edinburgh review mr murray be twenty-nine year old at the time of he marriage that he be full of contentment as well as hope at this time may be infer from he letter to constable three week after he marriage : _ john murray to mr constable _ _ march 27 1807 _ i declare to you that i be every day more content with my lot neither my wife nor i have any disposition for company or go out and you may rest assure that i shall devote all my attention to business and that you concern will not be less the object of my regard merely because you have raise mine so high every moment my dear constable i feel more grateful to you and i trust that you will over find I you faithful friend -- jm some of the most important event in murray 's career occur during the first year of he married life chief among they may perhaps be mention he part share in the publication of marmion -lrb- in February 1808 -rrb- -- which bring he into intimate connection with walter scott -- and he appointment for a time as publisher in london of the _ edinburgh review _ for he be thus bring into direct personal contact with those force which ultimately lead to the chief literary enterprise of he life -- the publication of the _ quarterly review _ mr scott call upon mr murray in london shortly after the return of the latter from he marriage in edinburgh mr scott call upon I on Tuesday and we converse for a hour he appear very anxious that ` marmion ' should be publish by the king 's birthday he say he wish it to be ready by that time for very particular reason and yet he allow that the poem be not complete and that he be yet undetermined if he shall make he hero happy or otherwise the other important event to which allusion have be make be the transfer to mr murray of part of the london agency for the _ edinburgh review _ at the beginning of 1806 murray sell 1000 copy of the _ review _ on the day of its publication and the circulation be steadily increase constable propose to transfer the entire london publication to murray but the longman protest under the term of they exist agreement in April 1807 they employ as they attorney mr sharon turner one of murray 's staunchest ally turner inform he through a common friend of he have be retain by the longman but murray say he could not in any way feel hurt at so proper and indispensable a pursuit of he profession the opinion of counsel be in favor of the messr longman 's contention and of they undisputable rights to one-half of the _ edinburgh review _ so long as it continue to be publish under that title longman & co accordingly obtain a injunction to prevent the publication of the _ edinburgh review _ by any other publisher in london without they express consent matter be bring to a crisis by the follow letter write by the editor mr franci jeffrey to messr constable & co : _ June 1 _ 1807 gentleman i believe you understand already that neither i nor any of the original and regular writer in the _ review _ will ever contribute a syllable to a work belong to bookseller it be proper however to announce this to you distinctly that you may have no fear of hardship or disappointment in the event of mr longman succeed in he claim to the property of this work if that claim be not speedily reject or abandon it be we fixed resolution to withdraw entirely from the _ edinburgh review _ to publish to all the world that the conductor and writer of the former number have no sort of connection with those that may afterwards appear and probably to give notice of we intention to establish a new work of a similar nature under a different title i have the honor to be gentleman you very obedient servant f jeffrey a copy of this letter be at once forward to messr longman constable in he communication accompany it assure the publisher that in the event of the editor and contributor to the _ edinburgh review _ withdraw from the publication and establish a new periodical the exist _ review _ would soon be of no value either to proprietor or publisher and request to be inform whether they would not be dispose to transfer they interest in the property and if so on what consideration constable add : we be apprehensive that the editor will not postpone for many day longer that public notification of they secession which we can not help anticipate as the death-blow of the publication jeffrey 's decision seem to have settle the matter messr longman agree to accept # 1000 for they claim of property in the title and future publication of the _ edinburgh review _ the injunction be remove and the london publication of the _ review _ be forthwith transfer to john murray 32 fleet street under whose auspices no 22 accordingly appear thus far all have go on smoothly but a little cloud at first no bigger than a man 's hand make its appearance and it grow and grow until it throw a dark shadow over the friendship of constable and murray and eventually lead to they complete separation this be the system of persistent drawing of accommodation bill renewal of bill and promissory note constable begin to draw heavily upon murray in April 1807 and the promissory note go on accumulate until they constitute a mighty mass of paper money murray 's banker caution he against the practice but repeat expostulation be of no use against the impetuous need of constable & co only two month after the transfer of the publication of the _ review _ to mr murray we find he write to dear constable as follow : _ john murray to mr archd constable _ _ October 1 1807 _ i should not have allow myself time to write to you to-day be not the occasion very urgent you people have so often of late omit to give you timely notice of the day when my acceptance fall due that i have suffer a inconvenience too great for I to have express to you have it not occur so often that it be impossible for I to undergo the anxiety which it occasion a bill of yours for # 200 be due yesterday and i have be oblige to supply the means for pay it without any notice for preparation i beg of you to insist upon this be regulate as i be sure you must desire it to be so that i may receive the cash for you bill two day at least before they be due mr murray then give a list of debt of he own -lrb- include some of constable 's -rrb- amount to # 1073 which he have to pay in the follow week from a cash account make out by mr murray on October 3 it appear that the bill transaction with constable have become enormous they amount to not less than # 10000 the correspondence continue in the same strain and it soon become evident that this state of thing could not be allow to continue reconciliation take place from time to time but interruption again occur mostly arise from the same source -- a perpetual flood of bill and promissory note from one side and the other -- until murray find it necessary to put a end to it peremptorily towards the end of 1808 messr constable establish at no 10 ludgate street a london house for the sale of the _ edinburgh review _ and the other work in which they be concern under the title of constable hunter park & hunter this doubtless tend to widen the breach between constable and murray though it leave the latter free to enter into arrangement for establish a review of he own a object which he have already contemplate there be many book in which the two house have a joint interest and therefore they relation could not be altogether discontinue marmion be come out in successive edition but the correspondence between the publisher grow cooler and cooler and constable have constant need to delay payment and renew bill mr murray have also considerable bill transaction with ballantyne & co of edinburgh jame and john ballantyne have be schoolfellow of walter scott at kelso and the acquaintance there form be afterwards renew jame ballantyne establish the _ kelso mail _ in 1796 but at the recommendation of scott for whom he have print a collection of ballad he remove to edinburgh in 1802 there he print the border minstrelsy for scott who assist he with money ballantyne be in frequent and intimate correspondence with murray from the year 1806 and have print for he hogg 's ettrick shepherd and other work it be at this time that scott commit the great error of he life he professional income be about # 1000 a year and with the profit of he work he might have build abbotsford and live in comfort and luxury but in 1805 he sacrifice everything by enter into partnership with jame ballantyne and embarking in he printing concern almost the whole of the capital which he possess he be bind to the firm for twenty year and during that time he produce he greatest work it be true that but for the difficulty in which he be latterly immerse we might never have know the noble courage with which he meet and rise superior to misfortune in 1808 a scheme of great magnitude be under contemplation by murray and the ballantyne it be a uniform edition of the british novelist begin with de foe and end with the novelist at the close of last century with biographical preface and illustrative note by walter scott a list of the novel write in the hand of john murray include thirty-six british besides eighteen foreign author the collection could not have be complete in less than two hundred volume the scheme if it do not originate with walter scott have at least he cordial support mr murray not unreasonably fear the cost of carry such a undertaking to completion it could not have amount to less than twenty thousand pound yet the ballantyne urge he on they furnish statement of the cost of printing and paper for each volume it really strike I say jame ballantyne the more i think of and examine it to be the happiest speculation that have ever be think of this undertaking eventually fall through only the work of de foe be print by the messr ballantyne and publish by mr murray the attention of the latter become absorb by a subject of much greater importance to he -- the establishment of the _ quarterly review _ this for a time throw most of he other scheme into the shade chapter v origin of the quarterly review the publication of a tory review be not the result of a sudden inspiration the scheme have long be ponder over mr canning have impress upon mr pitt the importance of secure the newspaper press then almost entirely whiggish or revolutionary on the side of he administration to combat in some measure the democratic principle then in full swing mr canning with other start in November 1797 the _ anti-jacobin or weekly examiner _ the _ anti-jacobin _ cease to be publish in 1798 when canning have be appoint under-secretary of state for foreign affair find he time fully occupy by the business of he department as well as by he parliamentary duty and could no longer take part in that clever publication four year later in October 1802 the first number of the _ edinburgh review _ be publish it appear at the right time and as the first quarterly organ of the higher criticism evidently hit the mark at which it aim it be conduct by some of the cleverest literary young man in edinburgh -- jeffrey brougham sydney smith franci horner dr thoma brown and other though walter scott be not a founder of the _ review _ he be a frequent contributor in its early day the criticism be rude and want in delicate insight for the most part too dictatorial and often unfair thus jeffrey could never appreciate the merit of wordsworth southey and coleridge this will never do be the commencement of he review of wordsworth 's noblest poem jeffrey boast that he have crush the ` excursion ' he might as well say observe southey that he could crush skiddaw ignorance also seem to have pervade the article write by brougham in the second number of the _ edinburgh _ on dr thoma young 's discovery of the true principle of interference in the undulatory theory of light sir john herschell a more competent authority say of young 's discovery that it be sufficient of itself to have place its author in the highest rank of scientific immortality the situation seem to mr murray to warrant the following letter : _ john murray to the right hon george canning _ _ September 25 1807 _ sir i venture to address you upon a subject that be not perhaps undeserve of one moment of you attention there be a work entitle the _ edinburgh review _ write with such unquestionable talent that it have already attain a extent of circulation not equal by any similar publication the principle of this work be however so radically bad that i have be lead to consider the effect that such sentiment so generally diffuse be likely to produce and to think that some means equally popular ought to be adopt to counteract they dangerous tendency but the publication in question be conduct with so much ability and be sanction with such high and decisive authority by the party of whose opinion it be the organ that there be little hope of produce against it any effectual opposition unless it arise from you sir and you friend should you sir think the idea worthy of encouragement i should with equal pride and willingness engage my arduous exertion to promote its success but as my object be nothing short of produce a work of the greatest talent and importance i shall entertain it no longer if it be not so fortunate as to obtain the high patronage which i have thus take the liberty to solicit permit I sir to add that the person who address you be no adventurer but a man of some property and inherit a business that have be establish for nearly a century i therefore trust that my application will be attribute to its proper motive and that you goodness will at least pardon its obtrusion i have the honor to be sir you must humble and obedient servant john murray so far as can be ascertain mr canning do not answer this letter in write but a communication be shortly after open with he through mr stratford canning whose acquaintance mr murray have make through the publication of the miniature refer to in a precede chapter mr canning be still act as secretary of state for foreign affair and be necessarily cautious but mr stratford can he cousin be not bind by any such official restraint in January 1808 he introduce mr gifford to mr murray and the starting of the propose new periodical be the subject of many consultation between they walter scott still continue to write for the _ edinburgh _ notwithstanding the difference of opinion which exist between himself and the editor as to political question he be rather proud of the _ review _ inasmuch as it be a outgrowth of scottish literature scott even endeavor to enlist new contributor for the purpose of strengthen the _ review _ he write to robert southey in 1807 invite he to contribute to the _ edinburgh _ the honorarium be to be ten guinea per sheet of sixteen page this be a very tempting invitation to southey as he be by no means rich at the time and the pay be more than he receive for he contribution to the _ annual register _ but he reply to scott as follow : _ mr southey to mr scott _ _ December 1807 _ i have scarcely one opinion in common with it -lrb- the _ edinburgh review _ -rrb- upon any subject whatever of any merit i might insert there would aid and abet opinion hostile to my own and thus identify I with a system which i thoroughly disapprove this be not say hastily the emolument to be derive from write at ten guinea a sheet scotch measure instead of seven pound for the _ annual _ would be considerable the pecuniary advantage result from the different manner in which my future work would be handle -lrb- by the _ review _ -rrb- probably still more so but my moral feeling must not be compromise to jeffrey as a individual i shall ever be ready to show every kind of individual courtesy but of judge jeffrey of the _ edinburgh review _ i must ever think and speak as of a bad politician a worse moralist and a critic in matter of taste equally incompetent and unjust -lrb- footnote : the life and correspondence of robert southey iii pp 124-5 -rrb- walter scott before long be lead to entertain the same opinion of the _ edinburgh review _ as southey a severe and unjust review of marmion by jeffrey appear in 1808 accuse scott of a mercenary spirit in write for money -lrb- though jeffrey himself be write for money in the same article -rrb- and further irritating scott by assert that he have neglect scottish feeling and scottish character constable write scott to he brother thoma in November 1808 or rather that bear he partner -lrb- mr hunter -rrb- have behave by I of late not very civilly and i owe jeffrey a flap with a foxtail on account of he review of ` marmion ' and thus doth the whirligig of time bring about my revenge murray too be greatly annoy by the review of marmion scott he use to say may forgive but he can never forget this treatment and to quote the word of mr lockhart : when he read the article on ` marmion ' and another on foreign politics in the same number of the _ edinburgh review _ murray say to himself ` walter scott have feeling both as a gentleman and a tory which these people must now have wound the alliance between he and the whole clique of the _ edinburgh review _ be now shake ' and as far at least as the political part of the affair be concerned john murray 's sagacity be not at fault mr murray at once take advantage of this open to draw closer the bond between himself and ballantyne for he well know who be the lead spirit in the firm and show himself desirous of obtain the london agency of the publishing business which as he rightly discern would soon be start in connection with the canongate press and in opposition to constable the large increase of work which murray be prepare to place in the hand of the printer induce ballantyne to invite he to come as far as ferrybridge in yorkshire for a personal conference at this interview various new project be discuss -- among they the propose novelist ' library -- and from the information which he then obtain as to scott 's personal feeling and literary project murray consider himself justified in at once proceed to ashestiel in order to lay before scott himself in a personal interview he great scheme for the new review he arrive there about the middle of October 1808 and be hospitably welcome and entertain he state he plan mention the propose editor of the review the probable contributor and earnestly invite the assistance of scott himself during murray 's visit to ashestiel no 26 of the _ edinburgh review _ arrive it contain a article entitle don cevallo on the occupation of spain it be long suppose that the article be write by brougham but it have since be ascertain that jeffrey himself be the author of it this article give great offence to the friend of rational liberty and limited monarchy in this country scott forthwith write to constable : the _ edinburgh review have _ become such as to render it impossible for I to become a contributor to it _ now _ it be such as i can no longer continue to receive or read it the list of the then subscriber say mr cadell to mr lockhart exhibit in a indignant dash of constable 's pen opposite mr scott 's name the word ` stopt ' mr murray never forget he visit to ashestiel scott be kindness itself mr scott be equally cordial and hospitable richard heber be there at the time and the three go out daily to explore the scenery of the neighborhood they visit melrose abbey the tweed and dryburgh abbey not very remote from melrose where scott be himself to lie they ascend the eildon hill scott on he sheltie often stop by the way to point out to murray and heber who be on foot some broad meadow or heather-clad ground as a spot where some legend hold its seat or some notable deed have be achieve during the war of the border scott thus convert the barren hillside into a region of interest and delight from the top of the eildon he point out the scene of some twenty battle very soon after he return to london murray address the following letter to mr scott : _ john murray to mr scott _ _ October _ 26 1808 dear sir although the pressure of business since my return to london have prevent I write to you sooner yet my thought have i assure you be almost completely employ upon the important subject of the conversation with which you honor I during the time i be experience the oblige hospitality of mr scott and yourself at ashestiel then after a reference to the novelist ' library mention in the last chapter the letter continue : i have see mr william gifford hint distantly at a review he admit the most imperious necessity for one and that too in a way that lead I to think that he have have very important communication upon the subject i feel more than ever confident that the higher power be exceedingly desirous for the establishment of some counteract publication and it will i suspect remain only for you appearance in london to urge some very formidable plan into activity this letter be cross in transit by the following : _ mr scott to john murray _ ashestiel by selkirk _ October _ 30 1808 dear sir since i have the pleasure of see you i have the satisfaction to find that mr gifford have accept the task of editing the intended review this be communicate to I by the lord advocate who at the same time request I to write mr gifford on the subject i have do so at great length point out whatever occur to I on the facility or difficulty of the work in general as well as on the editorial department offering at the same time all the assistance in my power to set matter upon a good footing and to keep they so i presume he will have my letter by the time this reach you and that he will communicate with you fully upon the detail i be as certain as of my existence that the plan will answer provide sufficient attention be use in procure and select article of merit what scott thought of murray 's visit to ashestiel may be infer from he letter to he political confidant george elli of which as it have already appear in scott 's life it be only necessary to give extract here : _ mr scott to mr george elli _ _ November _ 2 1808 dear elli we have equally to we joy and surprise a fly visit from heber about three week ago he staid but three day but between old story and new we make they very merry in they passage during he stay john murray the bookseller in fleet street who have more real knowledge of what concern he business than any of he brethren -- at least than any of they that i know -- come to canvass a most important plan of which i be now in dern privacie to give you the outline i have most strongly recommend to we lord advocate -lrb- the right hon jc colquhoun -rrb- to think of some counter measure against the _ edinburgh review _ which politically speak be do incalculable damage i do not mean this in a party way the present ministry be not all i could wish they for -lrb- canning except -rrb- i doubt there be among they too much _ self-seeking _ but they political principle be sound english principle and compare to the greedy and inefficient horde which precede they they be angel of light and purity it be obvious however that they want defender both in and out of door pitt 's love and fear glue many friend to he and now he be fall those tough co-mixture melt then after a reference to the large circulation -lrb- 9000 -rrb- and mischievous politics of the _ edinburgh review _ he proceed : now i think there be balm in gilead for all this and that the cure lie in institute such a review in london as should be conduct totally independent of booksel influence on a plan as liberal as that of the _ edinburgh _ its literature as well support and its principle english and constitutional accordingly i have be give to understand that mr william gifford be willing to become the conductor of such a work and i have write to he at the lord advocate 's desire a very voluminous letter on the subject now should this plan succeed you must hang you birding-piece on its hook take down you old anti-jacobin armor and remember you swashing blow it be not that i think this project review ought to be exclusively or principally political this would in my opinion absolutely counteract its purpose which i think should be to offer to those who love they country and to those whom we would wish to love it a periodical work of criticism conduct with equal talent but upon sounder principle be not this very possible in point of learn you englishman have ten time we scholarship and as for talent and genius be not abana and pharpar river of damascus better than any of the river in israel have we not yourself and you cousin the rose malthus matthia gifford heber and he brother can i not procure you a score of blue-cap who would rather write for we than for the _ edinburgh review _ if they get as much pay by it a good plot good friend and full of expectation -- a excellent plot very good friend heber 's fear be lest we should fail in procure regular steady contributor but i know so much of the interior discipline of review as to have no apprehension of that provide we be once set a-going by a few dashing number there would be no fear of enlist regular contributor but the amateur must bestir themselves in the first instance from the government we should be entitle to expect confidential communication as to point of fact -lrb- so far as fit to be make public -rrb- in we political disquisition with this advantage we good cause and st george to boot we may at least divide the field with we formidable competitor who after all be much better at cut than parry and whose uninterrupted triumph have as much unfitted they for resist a serious attack as it have do buonaparte for the spanish war jeffrey be to be sure a man of the most uncommon versatility of talent but what then general howe be a gallant commander there be other as gallant as he think of all this and let I hear from you very soon on the subject canning be i have good reason to know very anxious about the plan i mention it to robert dunda who be here with he lady for a few day on a pilgrimage to melrose and he highly approve of it though no literary man he be judicious _ clair-voyant _ and uncommonly sound-headed like he father lord melville with the exception i have mention the thing continue a secret ever yours walter scott _ mr scott to john murray _ _ November _ 2 1808 i transmit my letter to mr gifford through the lord advocate and leave it open that mr canning might read it if he think it worth while i have a letter from the advocate highly approve my view so i suppose you will very soon hear from mr gifford specifically on the subject it be a matter of immense consequence that something shall be set about and that without delay the point on which i chiefly insist with mr gifford be that the review should be independent both as to bookselling and ministerial influence -- mean that we be not to be advocate of party through thick and thin but to maintain constitutional principle moreover i state as essential that the literary part of the work should be as sedulously attend to as the political because it be by means of that alone that the work can acquire any firm and extend reputation moreover yet i submit that each contributor should draw money for he article be he rank what it may this general rule have be of great use to the _ edinburgh review _ of term i say nothing except that you view on the subject seem to I highly liberal i do not add further particulars because i dare say mr gifford will show you the letter which be a very long one believe I my dear sir with sincere regard you faithful humble servant walter scott in a subsequent letter to mr elli scott again indicate what he consider should be the proper management of the propose review let I touch he say a string of much delicacy -- the political character of the review it appear to I that this should be of a liberal and enlarged nature rest upon principle -- indulgent and conciliatory as far as possible upon mere party question but stern in detect and expose all attempt to sap we constitutional fabric religion be another slippery station here also i would endeavor to be as impartial as the subject will admit of the truth be there be policy as well as morality in keep we sword clear as well as sharp and not forget the gentleman in the critic the public appetite be soon gorge with any particular style the common review before the appearance of the _ edinburgh _ have become extremely mawkish and unless when prompt by the malice of the bookseller or reviewer give a dawdle maudlin sort of applause to everything that reach even mediocrity the _ edinburgh _ folk squeeze into they sauce plenty of acid and be popular from novelty as well as from merit the minor review and other periodical publication have _ outrd _ the matter still further and give we all abuse and no talent this therefore we have to trust to that decent lively and reflect criticism teaching man not to abuse book but to read and to judge they will have the effect of novelty upon a public wearied with universal effort at blackguard and indiscriminate satire i have a long and very sensible letter -lrb- footnote : give below under date November 15 1808 -rrb- from john murray the bookseller in which he touch upon this point very neatly scott be most assiduous in he preparation for the first number he write to he brother thoma scott ask he to contribute a article to charle kirkpatrick sharpe of christ church oxford to mr morritt of rokeby park yorkshire and to robert southey of keswick ask they for contribution to mr sharpe he say : the heber be engage item roger southey moore -lrb- anacreon -rrb- and other whose reputation jeffrey have murder and who be rise to cry woe upon he like the ghost in ` king richard ' scott 's letter to gilford the intended editor be full of excellent advice it be date edinburgh October 25 1808 we quote from it several important passage : john murray of fleet street say scott a young bookseller of capital and enterprise and with more good sense and propriety of sentiment than fall to the share of most of the trade make I a visit at ashestiel a few week ago and as i find he have have some communication with you upon the subject i do not hesitate to communicate my sentiment to he on this and some other point of the plan and i think he idea be most liberal and satisfactory the office of editor be of such importance that have you not be please to undertake it i fear the plan would have fall wholly to the ground the full power of control must of course be vest in the editor for select curtail and correct the contribution to the review but this be not all for as he be the person immediately responsible to the bookseller that the work -lrb- amount to a certain number of page more or less -rrb- shall be before the public at a certain time it will be the editor 's duty to consider in due turn the article of which each number ought to consist and to take measure for procure they from the person best qualify to write upon such and such subject but this be sometimes so troublesome that i foresee with pleasure you will soon be oblige to abandon you resolution of write nothing yourself at the same time if you will accept of my service as a sort of jackal or lion 's provider i will do all in my power to assist in this troublesome department of editorial duty but there be still something behind and that of the last consequence one great resource to which the _ edinburgh _ editor turn himself and by which he give popularity even to the duller article of he _ review _ be accept contribution from person of inferior power of write provide they understand the book to which they criticism relate and as such be often of stupefying mediocrity he render they palatable by throw in a handful of spice namely any lively paragraph or entertaining illustration that occur to he in read they over by this sort of veneer he convert without loss of time or hindrance to business article which in they original state might hang in the market into such goods as be not likely to disgrace those among which they be place this seem to be a point in which a editor 's assistance be of the last consequence for those who possess the knowledge necessary to review book of research or abstruse disquisition be very often unable to put the criticism into a readable much more a pleasant and captivating form and as they science can not be attain ` for the nonce ' the only remedy be to supply they deficiency and give they lucubration a more popular turn there be one opportunity possess by you in a particular degree -- that of access to the best source of political information it would not certainly be advisable that the work should assume especially at the outset a profess political character on the contrary the article on science and miscellaneous literature ought to be of such a quality as might fairly challenge competition with the best of we contemporary but as the real reason of institute the publication be the disgusting and deleterious doctrine with which the most popular of we review disgrace its page it be essential to consider how this warfare should be manage on this ground i hope it be not too much to expect from those who have the power of assist we that they should on topic of great national interest furnish the reviewer through the medium of they editor with accurate view of point of fact so far as they be fit to be make public this be the most delicate and yet most essential part of we scheme on the one hand it be certainly not to be understand that we be to be hold down to advocate upon all occasion the cause of administration such a dereliction of independence would render we entirely useless for the purpose we mean to serve on the other hand nothing will render the work more interesting than the public learning not from any vaunt of ours but from they own observation that we have access to early and accurate information on point of fact the _ edinburgh review _ have profit much by the pain which the opposition party have take to possess the writer of all the information they could give they on public matter let I repeat that you my dear sir from enjoy the confidence of mr canning and other person in power may easily obtain the confidential information necessary to give credit to the work and communicate it to such as you may think proper to employ in lay it before the public mr scott further proceed in he letter to mr gifford to discuss the mode and time of publication the choice of subject the person to be employ as contributor and the name of the propose review thus thoroughly identify himself with it let we force he say for a number or two consist of volunteer or amateur and when we have acquire some reputation we shall soon levy and discipline we force of the line after all the matter be become very serious -- eight or nine thousand copy of the _ edinburgh review _ be regularly distribute merely because there be no other respectable and independent publication of the kind in this city -lrb- edinburgh -rrb- where there be not one whig out of twenty man who read the work many hundred be sell and how long the generality of reader will continue to dislike politics so artfully mingle with information and amusement be worthy of deep consideration but it be not yet too late to stand in the breach the first number ought if possible to be out in January and if it can burst among they like a bomb without previous notice the effect will be more striking of those who might be intrust in the first instance you be a much better judge than i be i think i can command the assistance of a friend or two here particularly william erskine the lord advocate 's brother-in-law and my most intimate friend in london you have malthus george elli the rose _ cum pluribus alii _ richard heber be with I when murray come to my farm and know he zeal for the good cause i let he into we counsel in mr frere we have the hope of a potent ally the rev reginald heber would be a excellent coadjutor and when i come to town i will sound matthia as strict secrecy would of course be observe the diffidence of many might be overcome for scholar you can be at no loss while oxford stand where it do and i think there will be no deficiency in the scientific article thus instruct gifford proceed to rally he force there be no want of contributor some come invite some come unsought but as the matter be still a secret the editor endeavor to secure contribution through he personal friend for instance he call upon mr roger to request he to secure the help of moore i must confess say roger to moore i hear of the new quarterly with pleasure as i think it might correct a evil we have long lament together gifford wish much for contributor and be exceedingly anxious that you should assist he as often as you can afford time all this in _ confidence _ of course as the secret be not my own gifford also endeavor to secure the assistance of southey through he friend mr grosvenor bedford southey be request to write for the first number a article on the affair of spain this however he decline to do but promise to send a article on the subject of missionary let not gifford he write to bedford in reply to he letter suppose I a troublesome man to deal with pertinacious about trifle or stand upon punctilio of authorship no grosvenor i be a quiet patient easy-going hack of the mule breed regular as clockwork in my pace sure-footed bear the burden which be lay on I and only obstinate in choose my own path if gifford could see I by this fireside where like nicodemus one candle suffice I in a large room he would see a man in a coat ` still more threadbare than he own ' when he write he ` imitation ' work hard and get little -- a bare maintenance and hardly that write poem and history for posterity with he whole heart and soul one daily progressive in learn not so learn as he be poor not so poor as proud not so proud as happy _ mr jame ballantyne to john murray _ _ October _ 28 1808 well you have of course hear from mr scott of the progress of the ` great plan ' canning bite at the hook eagerly a review term by mr jeffrey _ a tickler _ be to appear of dryden in this no of the _ edinburgh _ by the lord they will rue it you know scott 's present feeling excite by the review of ` marmion ' what will they be when that of dryden appear it be some time however before arrangement could be finally make for bring out the first number of the _ quarterly _ scott could not as yet pay he intended visit to london and after wait for about a month murray send he the follow letter give he further opinion as to the scope and object of the propose review : _ john murray to mr scott _ _ November _ 15 1808 dear sir i have be desirous of write to you for nearly a week past as i never feel more the want of a personal conversation i will endeavor however to explain myself to you and will rely on you confidence and indulgence for secrecy and attention in what i have to communicate i have before tell you that the idea of a new review have be revolve in my mind for nearly two year and that more than twelve month ago i address mr canning on the subject the propriety if not the necessity of establish a journal upon principle opposite to those of the _ edinburgh review _ have occur to many man more enlighten than myself and i believe the same reason have prevent other as it have do myself from attempt it namely the immense difficulty of obtain talent of sufficient magnitude to render success even _ doubtful _ by degree my plan have gradually float up to this height but there exist at least a equal difficulty yet -- that peculiar talent in a editor of render we other great resource advantageous to the best possible degree this i think may be accomplish but it must be effect by you arduous assistance at least for a little time we friend mr gifford whose writings show he to be both a man of learning and wit have live too little in the world lately to have obtain that delicacy and tact whereby he can feel at one instant and habitually whatever may gratify public desire and excite public attention and curiosity but this you know to be a lead feature in the talent of mr jeffrey and he friend and that without the most happy choice of subject as well as the ability to treat they well -- catch the manners live as they rise -- the _ edinburgh review _ could not have attain the success it have do and no other review however preponderate in solid merit will obtain sufficient attention without they enter the field too as we shall do against a army command by the most skilful general it will not do for we to leave any of we best officer behind as a reserve for they would be of no use if we be defeat at first we must enter with we most able commander at once and we shall then acquire confidence if not reputation and increase in number as we proceed we first number must contain the most valuable and striking information in politics and the most interesting article of general literature and science write by we most able friend if we plan appear to be so advantageous to the minister whose measure to a certain extent we intend to justify to support to recommend and assist that they have promise they support when might that support be so advantageously give either for they own interest or ours as at the commencement when we be most weak and have the most arduous onset to make and when we do and must stand most in need of help if we first number be not write with the greatest ability upon the most interesting topic it will not excite public attention no man even the friend of the principle we adopt will leave the sprightly page of the _ edinburgh review _ to read a dull detail of staid morality or dissertation on subject whose interest have long flee i do not say this from any even the smallest doubt of we have all that we desire in these respects in we power but because i be apprehensive that without you assistance it will not be draw into action and my reason for this fear i will thus submit to you you mention in you letter to mr gifford that we review should open with a grand article on spain -- mean a display of the political feeling of the people and the probable result of this important contest i suggest to mr gifford that mr frere should be write to which he say be easy and that he think he would do it for frere could not only give the fact upon the subject but could write they better than any other person but have in my project give the name of southey as a person who might assist occasionally in a number or two hence i find at we next interview that mr gifford who do not know mr southey have speak to a friend to ask mr s to write the article upon spain it be true that mr southey know a great deal about spain and on another occasion would have give a good article upon the subject but at present _ he _ be not the kind of knowledge which we want and it be moreover trust we secret to a stranger who have by the way a directly opposite bias in politics mr gifford also tell I with very great stress that among the article he have submit to you be -lrb- one on -rrb- hodgson 's translation of juvenal which at no time could be a very interesting article for we and have be publish more than six month ago would probably be a very stupid one then you must observe that it would necessarily involve a comparison with mr gifford 's own translation which must of course be praise and thus show a _ individual _ feeling -- the least spark of which in we early number would both betray and ruin we he talk of review _ himself _ a late translation of persius for -lrb- _ entre nous _ -rrb- a similar reason he have himself nearly complete a translation which will be publish in a few month in what i have say upon this most exceedingly delicate point and which i again submit to you most honorable confidence i have no other object but just to show you without reserve how we stand and to exemplify what i set out with -- that without skilful and judicious management we shall totally mistake the road to the accomplishment of the arduous task which we have undertake and involve the cause and every individual in not merely defeat but disgrace i must at the same time observe that mr gifford be the most obliging and well-meaning man alive and that he be perfectly ready to be instruct in those point of which he seclusion render he ignorant and all that i wish and mean be that we should strive to open clearly the view which be so obvious to we -- that we first number must be a most brilliant one in every respect and to effect this we must avail ourselves of any valuable political information we can command those person who have the most interest in support the review must be call upon immediately for they strenuous personal help the fact must be obvious to you -- that if mr canning mr frere mr scott mr elli and mr gifford with they immediate and true friend will exert themselves heartily in every respect so as to produce with secrecy only _ one _ remarkably attractive number they further labor would be comparatively light with such a number in we hand we might select and obtain every other help that we require and then the person name would only be call upon for they information fact hint advice and occasional article but without this -- without produce a number that shall at least equal if not excel the best of the _ edinburgh review _ it be better not to be attempt we should do more harm to we cause by a unsuccessful attempt and the reputation of the _ edinburgh review _ would be increase inversely to we fruitless opposition with respect to booksel interference with the review i be equally convince with yourself of its total incompatibility with a really respectable and valuable critical journal i assure you that nothing can be more distant from my view which be confine to the ardor which i feel for the cause and principle which it will be we object to support and the honor of professional reputation which would obviously result to the publisher of so important a work it be silly to suppress that i shall not be sorry to derive from it as much profit as i can satisfactorily enjoy consistent with the liberal scale upon which it be my first desire to act towards every writer and friend concern in the work respect the term upon which the editor shall be place at first i have propose and it appear to be satisfactory to mr gifford that he shall receive either previous to or immediately after the publication of each number the sum of 160 guinea which he be to distribute as he think proper without any question or interference on my part and that in addition to this he shall receive from I the sum of # 200 annually merely as the editor this sir be much more than i can flatter myself with the return of for the first year at least but it be my intention that he salary shall ever increase proportionately to the success of the work under he management the editor have a most arduous office to perform and the success of the publication must depend in a great measure upon he activity i be dear sir you obliged and faithful servant john murray it will be observe from this letter that mr murray be aware that besides skilful editing sound and practical business management be necessary to render the new review a success the way in which he inform mr scott about gifford 's propose review of juvenal and persius show that he fully comprehend the situation and the danger which would beset a editor like gifford who live for the most part amongst he book and be to a large extent seclude from the active world on the same day scott be write to murray : _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ November _ 15 1808 dear sir i receive two day ago a letter from mr gifford highly approve of the particulars of the plan which i have sketch for the _ review _ but there be two point to be consider in the first place i can not be in town as i propose for the commissioner under the judicial bill to whom i be to act as clerk have resolve that they final sitting shall be hold _ here _ so that i have now no chance of be in london before spring this be very unlucky as mr gifford propose to wait for my arrival in town to set the great machine a-going i shall write to he that this be impossible and that i wish he would with you assistance and that of he other friend make up a list of the work which the first number be to contain and consider what be the extent of the aid he will require from the north the other circumstance be that mr gifford plead the state of he health and he retired habit as sequestrate he from the world and render he less capable of active exertion and in the kindest and most polite manner he express he hope that he should receive very extensive assistance and support from I without which he be pleased to say he would utterly despair of success now between ourselves -lrb- for this be strictly confidential -rrb- i be rather alarm at this prospect i be willing and anxiously so to do all in my power to serve the work but my dear sir you know how many of we very ablest hand be engage in the _ edinburgh review _ and what a dismal work it will be to wring assistance from the few whose indolence have leave they neutral i can to be sure work like a horse myself but then i have two heavy work on my hand already namely somer and swift constable have lately very nearly relinquish the latter work and i now heartily wish it have never commence but two volume be nearly print so i conclude it will now go on if this work have not stand in the way i should have like beaumont and fletcher much better it would not have require half the research and occupy much less time i plainly see that accord to mr gifford 's view i should have almost all the trouble of a co-editor both in collect and revise the article which be to come from scotland as well as in supply all deficiency from my own store these consideration can not however operate upon the first number so pray send I a list of book and perhaps you may send some on a venture you know the department i have in the _ edinburgh review _ i will sound southey agreeable to mr gifford 's wish on the spanish affair the last number of the _ edinburgh review _ have give disgust beyond measure owe to the tone of the article on cevallo ' _ expos _ subscriber be fall off like withered leaf i retire my name among other after explain the reason both to mr jeffrey and mr constable so that there never be such a opening for a new _ review _ i shall be glad to hear what you think on the subject of term for my northern troops will not move without pay but there be no hurry about fix this point as most of the writer in the first number will be more or less indifferent on the subject for my own share i care not what the condition be unless the labor expect from I be to occupy a considerable portion of time in which case they might become a object while we be on this subject i may as well mention that as you incur so large a outlay in the case of the novel i would not only be happy that my remuneration should depend on the profit of the work but i also think i could command a few hundred to assist in carry it on by the way i see note on don quixote advertise this be a plan i have for enrich we collection have many reference by I for the purpose i shall be sorry if i be powerfully anticipate perhaps the book would make a good article in the _ review _ can you get I gaytoun 's festivous note on don quixote i think we friend ballantyne be grow a inch taller on the subject of the romance believe I dear sir yours very truly walter scott gifford be much pleased with you personally _ john murray to mr scott _ _ November _ 19 1808 mr gifford have communicate to I a important piece of news he meet he friend lord teignmouth and learn from he that he and the wilberforce party have some idea of start a journal to oppose the _ edinburgh review _ that henry thornton and mr -lrb- zachary -rrb- macaulay be to be the conductor that they have meet and that some able man be mention upon sound lord t as to they give we they assistance he think this might be adopt in preference to they own plan it will happen fortunately that we intend open with a article on the missionary which as it will be write in opposition to the sentiment in the _ edinburgh review _ be very likely to gain that large body of which wilberforce be the head i have collect from every missionary society in london of which there be no less than five all they curious report proceedings and history which i know sydney smith never see and which i could only procure by personal application southey will give a complete view of the subject and if he will enter heartily into it and do it well it will be as much as he can do for the first number these transaction contain amidst a great deal of fanaticism the most curious information you can imagine upon the history literature topography and manners of nation and country of which we be otherwise totally ignorant if you have occasion to write to southey pray urge the vast importance of this subject and entreat he to give it all he ability i find that a new volume of burn ' -lrb- ` the relique ' -rrb- will be publish by the end of this month which will form the subject of another capital article under you hand i presume ` sir john carr -lrb- tour in scotland -rrb- ' will be another article which even you i fancy will like ` mr grant of laggan ' too and perhaps you friend mr cumberland 's ` john de lancaster ' be you not sufficiently well acquaint with miss -lrb- joanna -rrb- baillie both to confide in she and command she talent if so you will probably think of what may suit she and what may apply to she mr heber too would apply to he brother at you request and he friend coplestone who will also be write to by a friend of gifford 's scott be very desirous of enlist george canning among the contributor to the quarterly he write to he friend elli : _ mr scott to mr g elli _ as we start be of such immense consequence do not you think mr canning though unquestionably we atla might for a day find a hercule on whom to devolve the burden of the globe while he write for we a review i know what a audacious request this be but suppose he should as great statesman sometimes do take a political fit of the gout and absent himself from a large ministerial dinner which might give it he in good earnest -- dine at three on a chicken and pint of wine and lay the foundation of at least one good article let we but once get afloat and we labor be not worth talk about but till then all hand must work hard this suggestion be communicate by george elli to gifford the choose editor and on December 1 murray inform scott that the article on spain be proceed under mr canning 's immediate superintendence canning and gifford go down to mr elli 's house at sunninghill where the three remain together for four day during which time the article be hatch and complete on receive the celebrated declaration of westminster on the spanish war scott write to elli : tell mr canning that the old woman of scotland will defend the country with they distaff rather than that troops enough be not send to make good so noble a pledge be the thousand that have moulder away in petty conquest or lilliputian expedition unite to those we have now in that country what a band would sir john moore have under he jeffrey have offer term of pacification engage that no party politics should again appear in he _ review _ i tell he i think it be now too late and remind he that i have often point out to he the consequence of let he work become a party tool he say ` he do not fear for the consequence -- there be but four man he fear as opponent ' ` who be these ' ` yourself for one ' ` certainly you pay I a great compliment depend upon it i will endeavor to deserve it ' ` why you would not join against I ' ` yes i would if i see a proper opportunity : not against you personally but against you politics ' ` you be privileged to be violent ' ' i do not ask any privilege for undue violence but who be you other foeman ' ` george ellis and southey ' the other he do not name all this be in great good humor and next day i have a very affect note from he in answer to a invitation to dinner he have no suspicion of the _ review _ whatever in the meantime mr murray continue to look out for further contributor mr jame mill of the indium house in reply to a request for assistance write : you do I a great deal of honor in the solicitude you express to have I engage in lay the foundation stone of you new edifice which i hope will be both splendid and durable and it be no want of zeal or gratitude that delay I but this ponderous geography a porter 's or rather a horse 's load bear I down to a degree you can hardly conceive what i be now meditate from under it be to spare time to do well and leisurely the indian article -lrb- my favorite subject -rrb- for you next number besides i shall not reckon myself less a founder from its have be only the fault of my previous engagement that my first article for you appear only in the second number and not in the first part of you work another contributor whom mr murray be desirous to secure be mrs inchbald authoress of the simple story the application be make to she through one of murray 's intimate friend mr hoppner the artist she answer be as follow : _ mr inchbald to mr hoppner _ _ December _ 31 1808 my dear sir as i wholly rely upon you judgment for the excellency of the design in question i wish you to be better acquaint with my ability as a reviewer before i suffer my curiosity to be further gratify in respect to the plan of the work you have undertake or the name of those person who with yourself have do I the very great honor to require my assistance before i see you then and possess myself of you further confidence it be proper that i should acquaint you that there be only one department of a review for which i be in the least qualified and that one combine play and novel yet the very few novel i have read of later publication incapacitate I again for detect plagiary or for make such comparison as proper criticism may demand you will perhaps be surprise when i tell you that i be not only wholly unacquainted with the book you have mention to I but that i never hear of it before if it be in french there will be another insurmountable difficulty for though i read french and have translate some french comedy yet i be not so perfectly acquaint with the language as to dare to write remark upon a french author if madame cottin 's malvina be in english you wish it speedily review and can possibly have any doubt of the truth of my present report please to send it I and whatever may be the contents i will immediately essay my ability on the work or immediately return it as a hopeless case yours very faithfully e inchbald on further consideration however mr inchbald modestly decline to become a contributor notwithstanding she great merit as a author she have the extremest diffidence in she own ability _ mr inchbald to john murray _ the more i reflect on the importance of the contribution intend for this work the more i be convince of my own inability to become a contributor the production in question must i be convinced be of a certain quality that will demand far more acquaintance with book and much more general knowledge than it have ever be my good fortune to attain under these circumstance find myself upon mature consideration wholly inadequate to the task propose i beg you will accept of this apology as a truth and present it to mr hoppner on the first opportunity and assure he that it have be solely my reluctance to yield up the honor he intend I which have tempt I for a instant to be undecided in my reply to he overture -- i be sir with sincere acknowledgment for the politeness of you letter to I e inchbald and here the correspondence drop it be now difficult to understand the profound secrecy with which the projection of the new review be carry on until within a fortnight of the day of its publication in these modern time widespread advertisement announce the advent of a new periodical whereas then both publisher and editor enjoin the utmost secrecy upon all with whom they be in correspondence still the day of publication be very near when the _ quarterly _ be accord to scott to burst like a bomb among the whig of edinburgh the only explanation of the secrecy of the preliminary arrangement be that probably down to the last it be difficult to ascertain whether enough material could be accumulate to form a sufficiently good number before the first _ quarterly review _ be launch into the world chapter vi the quarterly launch while mr gifford be marshal he force and prepare for the issue of the first number of the _ quarterly _ mr murray be correspond with jame ballantyne of edinburgh as to the work they be jointly engage in bring out and also with respect to the northern agency of the new _ review _ a arrangement be make between they that they should meet at boroughbridge in yorkshire at the beginning of January 1809 for the purpose of concoct they plan ballantyne propose to leave edinburgh on January 5 and murray be to set out from london on the same day both make for boroughbridge a few day before ballantyne leave edinburgh he write to murray : i shall not let a living soul know of my intended journey entire secrecy seem necessary at present i dine yesterday _ tte--tte _ with mr scott and have a great deal of highly important conversation with he he show I a letter bid a final farewell to the house of constable it be mid-winter and there be increase indication of a heavy storm brewing notwithstanding the severity of the weather however both determine to set out for they place of meeting in yorkshire two day before ballantyne leave edinburgh he write as follow : _ mr ballantyne to john murray _ _ January _ 4 1809 dear murray it be blow the devil 's weather here but no matter -- if the mail go i go i shall travel by the mail and shall instantly on arrive go to the crown hope to find you and a imperial dinner by the bye you have better on you arrival take place north and south for the follow day in four or five hour after you receive this i expect to shake you princely paw thine jb scott also send a note by the hand of ballantyne to tell of he complete rupture with constable owe to mr hunter 's extreme incivility as a result of these negotiation the ballantyne be appoint publisher of the new review in edinburgh and with a view to a more central position they take premise in south hanover street scott write with reference to this : _ mr scott to john murray _ _ February _ 1809 i enclose the promise swift and be now i think personally out of you debt though i will endeavor to stop up gap if i do not receive the contribution i expect from other be i in the neighborhood of you shop in london i could soon run up half a sheet of trifling article with a page or two to each but that be impossible here for lack of material when the ballantyne open shop you must take care to have they supply with food for such a stop-gap sort of criticism i think we will never again feel the pressure we have have for this number the harvest have literally be great and the labourer few yours truly ws _ mr jame ballantyne to john murray _ _ January _ 27 1809 i see or hear of nothing but good about the _ review _ mr scott be at this moment busy with two article besides the one he have send in conversation a few day since i hear a gentleman ask he ` pray sir do you think the _ quarterly review _ will be equal to the _ edinburgh _ ' he answer be ' i will not be quite sure of the first number because of course there be difficulty attend the commencement of every work which time and habit can alone smooth away but i think the first number will be a good one and in the course of three or four _ i think we 'll sweat they _ ' the first number of the _ quarterly review _ be publish at the end of February 1809 like most first number it do not entirely realize the sanguine view of its promoter it do not burst like a thunder-clap on the read public nor do it give promise to its friend that a new political power have be bear into the world the general tone be more literary than political and though it contain much that be well worth read none of its article be of first-rate quality walter scott be the principal contributor and be keenly interested in its progress though he mind be ever teem with other new scheme the allusion in the follow letter to he publication of many unauthenticated book if unintentional seem little less than prophetic _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ February _ 25 1809 dear sir i see with pleasure that you will be out on the first yet i wish i could have see my article in proof for i seldom read over my thing in manuscript and always find infinite room for improvement at the printer 's expense i hope we hurry will not be such another time as to deprive I of the chance of do the best i can which depend greatly on my see the proof pray have the goodness to attend to this i have make for the ballantyne a little selection of poetry to be entitle english minstrelsy i also intend to arrange for they a first volume of english memoirs to be entitle -- secret history of the court of jame i to consist of : osborne 's traditional memoirs sir anthony welldon 's court and character of jame i heylin 's aulicus coquinaria sir edward peyton 's rise and fall of the house of stewart i will add a few explanatory note to these curious memoirs and hope to continue the collection as -lrb- thanks to my constant labor on somer -rrb- it cost I no expense and shall cost the proprietor none you may advertise the publication and ballantyne equally agreeable to he own wish and mine will let you choose you own share in they i have a commission for you in the way of art i have publish many unauthenticated book as you know and may probably bring forward many more now i wish to have it in my power to place on a few copy of each a decisive mark of appropriation i have choose for this purpose a device bear by a champion of my name in a tournament at stirl it be a gate and portcullis with the motto clausus tutus ero i have it engrave on a seal as you may remark on the enclosure but it be do in a most blackguard style now what i want be to have this same gateway and this same portcullis and this same motto of _ clausus tutus ero _ which be a anagram of _ walterus scotus _ -lrb- take two single _ u _ 's for the _ w _ -rrb- cut upon wood in the most elegant manner so as to make a small vignette capable of be apply to a few copy of every work which i either write or publish this fancy of make _ portcullis _ copy i have much at heart and trust to you to get it accomplish for I in the most elegant manner i do not mind the expense and perhaps mr westall might be dispose to make a sketch for I i be most anxious to see the _ review _ god grant we may lose no ground i tremble when i think of my own article of two of which i have but a indefinite recollection what would you think of a edition of the old english froissart say 500 in the small _ antique quarto _ a beautiful size of book the spelling must be bring to a uniformity the work copy -lrb- as i could not promise my beautiful copy to go to press -rrb- note add and illustration etc and inaccuracy correct i think johne would be drive into most deserve disgrace and i can get the use of a most curious m of the french froissart in the newbattle library probably the finest in existence after that of berlin i be a enthusiast about berner ' froissart and though i could not undertake the drudgery of prepare the whole for the press yet weber -lrb- footnote : henry weber scott 's amanuensis -rrb- would do it under my eye upon the most reasonable term i would revise every part relate to english history i have several other literary scheme but defer mention they till i come to london which i sincerely hope will be in the course of a month or six week i hear mr canning be anxious about we _ review _ constable say it be a scotch job i could not help quiz mr robert miller who ask I in a odd sort of way as i think why it be not out i say very indifferently i know nothing about it but hear a vague report that the edition be to be much enlarged on account of the expect demand i also inclose a few line to my brother and be dear sir very truly yours w scott it be universally agree here that cumberland be five hundred degree beneath contempt ballantyne scott 's partner and publisher of the _ review _ in edinburgh hasten to communicate to murray they joint view as to the success of the work _ mr ballantyne to john murray _ _ February _ 28 1809 my dear murray i receive the _ quarterly _ a hour ago before take it to mr scott i have just time to look into the article on burn and at the general aspect of the book it look uncommonly well the view of burn ' character be better than jeffrey 's it be write in a more congenial tone with more tender kindly feel though not perhaps write with such elaborate eloquence as jeffrey 's the thought be more original and the style equally powerful the two first article -lrb- and perhaps the rest be not inferior -rrb- will confer a name on the _ review _ but why do i trouble you with _ my _ opinion when i can give you mr scott 's he have just be read the spanish article beside I and he again and again interrupted himself with expression of the strongest admiration three day later ballantyne again write : i have now read ` spain ' ` burn ' ` woman ' ` curran ' ` cid ' ` carr ' ` missionary ' upon the whole i think these article most excellent mr scott be in high spirit but he say there be evident mark of haste in most of they with respect to he own article he much regret not to have have the opportunity of revise they he think the ` missionary ' very clever but he shake he head at ` sidney ' ` woman ' and ` public character ' we copy which we expect this morning have not make they appearance which have give we no small anxiety we be pant to hear the public voice depend upon it _ if _ we exertion be continue the thing will do would g be as active as scott and murray murray have plenty of adviser gifford say he have too many he friend sharon turner be ready with he criticism on no 1 he deplore the appearance of the article by scott on carr 's tour in scotland -lrb- footnote : scott himself have write to murray about this which he call a whisky-frisky article on June 30 i take the advantage of forwarding sir john 's _ review _ to send you back he letter under the same cover he be a incomparable goose but as he be innocent and good-natured i would not like it to be publicly know that the flagellation come from my hand secrecy therefore will oblige I -rrb- _ mr sharon turner to john murray _ i can not endure the idea of a individual be wound merely because he have write a book if as in the case of the author attack in the ` baviad ' the work censure be vitiate we literature -- or as in the case of moore 's poem corrupt we moral -- if they be denounce we religious principle or attack those political principle on which we government subsist -- let they be criticise without mercy the _ salus publica _ demand the sacrifice but to make a individual ridiculous merely because he have write a foolish if it be a harmless book be not i think justifiable on any moral principle i repeat my principle whatever tend to vitiate we literary taste we moral we religious or political principle may be fairly at the mercy of criticism so whatever tend to introduce false science false history indeed falsehood in any shape expose itself to the censor 's rod but harmless inoffensive work should be pass by where be the bravery of tread on a worm or crush a poor fly where the utility where the honor a edition of 4000 copy have be print this be soon exhaust and a second edition be call for mr scott be ample in he encouragement i think he write to murray a firm and stable sale will be settle here to the extent of 1000 or 1500 even for the next number i be quite pleased with my ten guinea a sheet for my labor in write and for additional exertion i will consider they as overpay by success in the cause especially while that success be doubtful ballantyne write to murray in march : constable i be tell have consult sir samuel romilly and mean after write a book against I to prosecute I for _ steal he plan _ somebody have certainly steal he brain the confederate continue to encourage each other and to incite to greater effort the procrastinating gifford the follow rather mysterious paragraph occur in a letter from scott to murray dated march 19 1809 i have find means to get at mr g and have procure a letter to be write to he which may possibly produce one to you sign rutherford or richardson or some such name and date from the north of england or if he do not write to you enquiry be to be make whether he would choose you should address he the secrecy to be observe in this business must be most profound even to ballantyne and all the world if you get article from he -lrb- which will and must draw attention -rrb- you must throw out a false scent for enquirer i believe this unfortunate man will soon be in london in reply mr murray write on march 24 to mr scott urge he to come to london and offer if there be no plea for charge you expense to government to undertake that the _ review _ shall pay they as far as one hundred guinea to this scott reply : _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ march _ 27 1809 i have only time to give a very short answer to you letter some very important business detain I here till Monday or Tuesday on the last of which day at farthest i will set off for town and will be with you of course at the end of the week as to my travel expense if government pay I good and well if they do not depend on it i will never take a farthing from you you have my good friend enough of expense to incur in forwarding this great and dubious undertaking and god forbid i should add so unreasonable a charge as you liberality point at i be very frank in money matter and always take my price when i think i can give money 's worth for money but this be quite extravagant and you must think no more of it should i want money for any purpose i will readily make _ you _ my banker and give you value in review john ballantyne 's last remittance continue to go off briskly the devil 's in you in london you do not know good writing when you get it all depend on we cut in before the next _ edinburgh _ when instead of follow they lead they shall follow ours mr scott be my fellow-traveller in virtue of a old promise i be dear sir yours truly walter scott _ April _ 4 at night i have be detain a day later than i intend but set off to-morrow at mid-day i believe i shall get _ frank _ so will have my generosity for nothing i hope to be in london on Monday in send out copy of the first number mr murray be not forgetful of one friend who have take a lead part in originate the _ review _ in 1808 mr stratford canning when only twenty year of age have be select to accompany mr adair on a special mission to constantinople the following year on mr adair be appoint hbm minister to the sublime porte stratford canning become secretary of legation mr murray write to he : _ john murray to mr stratford canning _ 32 fleet st london _ march _ 12 1809 dear sir it be with no small degree of pleasure that i send for the favor of you acceptance the first number of the _ quarterly review _ a work which owe its birth to you oblige countenance and introduction of I to mr gifford i flatter myself that upon the whole you will not be dissatisfy with we first attempt which be universally allow to be so very respectable have you be in london during its progress it would i be confident have be render more deserving of public attention the letter go on to ask for information on foreign work of importance or interest mr stratford canning reply : with regard to the comission which you have give I it be i fear completely out of my power to execute it literature neither reside at constantinople nor pass through it even be i able to obtain the publication of france and germany by way of vienna the road be so circuitous that you would have they later than other who contrive to smuggle they across the north sea every london newspaper that retail its daily sixpennyworth of false report publish the french the hamburgh the vienna the frankfort and other journal full as soon as we receive any of they here this be the case at all time at present it be much worse we be entirely insulate the russian block up the usual road through bucharest and the servian prevent the passage of courier through bosnium and in addition to these difficulty the present state of the continent must at least interrupt all literary work you will not i be sure look upon these as idle excuse thing may probably improve and i will not quit this country without commission some one here to send you anything that may be of use to so promise a publication as you _ review _ no sooner be one number publish than preparation be make for the next every periodical be a continuous work -- never end still begin new contributor must be gain new book review new view criticise mr murray be even more than the editor the backbone of the enterprise : he be indefatigable in solicit new writer for the _ quarterly _ and in find the book fit for review and the appropriate reviewer of the book sometimes the review be print before the editor be consult but everything pass under the notice of gifford and receive he emendation and final approval mr murray go so far as to invite leigh hunt to contribute a article on literature or poetry for the _ quarterly _ the reply come from john hunt leigh 's brother he say : _ mr john hunt to john murray _ my brother some day back request I to present to you he thanks for the polite note you favor he with on the subject of the _ review _ to which he should have be most willing to have contribute in the manner you propose do he not perceive that the political sentiment contain in it be in direct opposition to he own this be honest and it do not interfere with the personal intercourse of the publisher and the poet murray afterwards write to scott : hunt be most vilely wrong-headed in politics which he have allow to turn he away from the path of elegant criticism which might have lead he to eminence and respectability jame mill author of the history of british indium send a article for the second number but the sentiment and principle not be in accordance with those of the editor it be not at once accept on learn this he write to mr murray as follow : _ mr jame mill to john murray _ my dear sir i can have no objection in the world to you delay the article i have send you till it altogether suit you arrangement to make use of it besides this point a few word of explanation may not be altogether useless with regard to another i be half inclined to suspect that the objection of you editor go a little farther than you state if so i beg you will not hesitate a moment about what you be to do with it i write it solely with a view to oblige and to benefit _ you personally _ but with very little idea as i tell you at we first conversation on the subject that it would be in my power to be of any use to you as the view which i entertain respect what be good for we country be very different from the view entertain by the gentleman with whom in you project concern you tell I you be to be connect to convince you however of my good-will i be perfectly ready to give you a specimen and if it appear to be such as likely to give offence to you friend or not to harmonise with the general style of you work commit it to the flame without the smallest scruple be assure that it will not make the smallest difference in my sentiment towards you or render I in the smallest degree less disposed to lend you my aid -lrb- such as it be -rrb- on any other occasion when it may be better calculate to be of use to you yours very truly j mill gifford be not a man of business he be unpunctual the second number of the _ quarterly _ appear behind its time and the publisher feel himself under the necessity of expostulate with the editor _ john murray to mr gifford _ _ may _ 11 1809 dear mr gifford i begin to suspect that you be not aware of the complete misery which be occasion to I and the certain ruin which must attend the _ review _ by we unfortunate procrastination long before this every line of copy for the present number ought to have be in the hand of the printer yet the whole of the _ review _ be yet to print i know not what to do to facilitate you labor for the article which you have long have he scatter without attention and those which i venture to send to the printer undergo such retard correction that even by this mode we do not advance i entreat the favor of you exertion for the last five month my most imperative concern have yield to this without the hope of my anxiety or labor ceasing tantus miserere labori in my distress and with regret from john murray mr gifford 's reply be as follow : the delay and confusion which have arise must be attribute to a want of confidential communication in a word you have too many adviser and i too many master at last the second number of the _ quarterly _ appear at the end of may instead of at the middle of April the new contributor to this number be dr d'oyley the rev mr walpole and george canning who in conjunction with sharon turner contribute the last article on austrian state papers as soon as the second number be publish mr gifford whose health be hardly equal to the constant strain of prepare and editing the successive number hasten away as be he custom to the seaside he write to mr murray from ryde : _ mr gifford to john murray _ _ June _ 18 1809 i rejoice to hear of we success and feel very anxious to carry it further a fortnight 's complete abstraction from all sublunary care have do I much good and i be now ready to put on my spectacles and look about I hoppner be here and have be at death 's door the third day after he arrival he have a apoplectic fit from which blister etc have miraculously recover he this morning i receive a letter from mr erskine he speak very highly of the second number and of the austrian article which be think its chief attraction theology he say few people read or care about on this i wish to say a word seriously i be sorry that mr e have fall into that notion too general i fear in scotland but this be he own concern i differ with he totally however as to the few reader which such subject find for as far as my knowledge reach the reverse be the fact the strongest letter which i have receive since i come down in we favor point out the two serious article as masterly production and of decide superiority we have teach the truth i mention to the _ edinburgh review _ and in they last number they have also attempt to be serious and abstain from they flippant impiety it be not do with the best grace but it have do they credit i hear when you make up you parcel pray put in some small cheap ` horace ' which i can no more do without than parson adam _ ex _ ` aeschylus ' i have leave it somewhere on the road any common thing will do mr murray send gifford a splendid copy of horace in the next parcel of book and manuscript in he reply gifford expostulate why my dear sir will you do these thing thank he warmly for he gift mr george elli be as usual ready with he criticism differ from gifford he write : i confess that to my taste the long article on the new testament be very tedious and that the progress of socinianism be to my apprehension a bugbear which _ we _ have no immediate reason to be scare by but it may alarm some people and what i think a dull prose piece of orthodoxy may have its admirer and promote we sale even constable have a good word to say of it in a letter to he partner hunter then in london he say : i receive the _ quarterly review _ yesterday and immediately go and deliver it to mr jeffrey himself it really seem a respectable number but what then unless theirs improve and ours fall off it can not harm we i think i observe that no 1 and 2 extend to merely twenty-nine sheet so that in fact ours be still the cheaper of the two murray 's wait on you with it be one of the wisest thing i ever know he do : you will not be behindhand with he in civility no 3 of the _ quarterly _ be also late and be not publish until the end of August the contributor be behindhand a article be expect from canning on spain and the publication be postpone until this article have be receive print and correct the foundation of it be lay by george elli and it be complete by george canning of this article mr gifford write : in consequence of my importunity mr canning have exert himself and produce the best article that ever yet appear in any review although mr gifford be sometimes the subject of opprobrium because of he suppose severity we find that in many case he soften down the tone of the reviewer for instance in communicate to mr murray the first part of dr thomson 's article on the outline of mineralogy by kidd he observe : _ mr gifford to john murray _ it be very splenitick and very severe and much too wantonly so i hope however it be just some of the opprobrious language i shall soften for the eternal repetition of _ ignorance absurdity surprising _ etc be not wanted i be sorry to observe so much nationality in it let this be a secret between we for i will not have my private opinion go beyond yourself as for kidd he be a modest unassuming man and be not to be attack with stick and stone like a savage remember it be only the epithet which i mean to soften for as to the scientific part it shall not be meddle with he faithful correspondent mr elli write as to the quality of this third number of the _ quarterly _ he agree with mr murray that though profound it be most notoriously and unequivocally _ dull _ we must veto ponderous article they will simply sink we isaac d'israelus also tender he advice he be one of mr murray 's most intimate friend and could speak freely and honestly to he as to the prospects of the _ review _ he be at brighton prepare he third volume of the curiosity of literature _ mr i d'israeli to john murray _ i have buy the complete collection of memoirs write by individual of the french nation amount to sixty-five volume for fifteen guinea what can i say about the _ qr _ certainly nothing new it have not yet invade the country here it be totally unknown though as usual the _ ed rev _ be here but among private library i find it equally unknown it have yet its fortune to make you must appeal to the _ feeling _ of gifford have he none then can not you get a more active and vigilant editor but what can i say at this distance the disastrous finale of the austrian receive this morning be feel here as deadly buonaparte be a tremendous thaumaturgus i wish you have such a genius in the _ qr _ my son ben assure I you be in brighton he see you now he never lie -lrb- footnote : mr murray be in brighton at the time -rrb- thus press by he correspondent mr murray do he best to rescue the _ quarterly _ from failure though it bring he into prominent notice as a publisher it be not by any means pay its expense some think it doubtful whether the play be worth the candle yet murray be not a man to be drive back by comparative want of success he continue to enlist a band of competent contributor amongst these be some very eminent man : mr john barrow of the admiralty the rev reginald heber mr robert grant -lrb- afterwards sir robert the indian judge -rrb- mr stephen etc how mr barrow be induce to become a contributor be thus explain in he autobiography -lrb- footnote : autobiographical memoir of sir john barrow murray 1847 -rrb- one morning in the summer of the year 1809 mr canning look in upon I at the admiralty say he have often troubled I on business but he be now about to ask I a favor ' i believe you be acquaint with my friend william gifford ' ` by reputation ' i say ` but not personally ' ` then ' say he ' i must make you personally acquaint will you come and dine with I at gloucester lodge any day the sooner the more agreeable -- say to-morrow if you be disengage ' on accept he say ' i will send for gifford to meet you i know he will be too glad to come ' ` now ' he continue ` it be right i should tell you that in the _ review _ of which two number have appear under the name of the _ quarterly _ i be deeply both publicly and personally interested and have take a lead part with mr george ellis hookham frere walter scott rise southey and some other we object in that work be to counteract the _ virus _ scatter among he majesty 's subject through the page of the _ edinburgh review _ now i wish to enlist you in we corps not as a mere advise idler but as a efficient labourer in we friend gifford 's vineyard ' mr barrow modestly express a doubt as to he competence but in the sequel he tell we mr canning carry he point and i may add once for all that what with gifford 's eager and urgent demand and the exercise become habitual and not disagreeable i do not cease write for the _ quarterly review _ till i have supply no less rather more than 190 article the fourth number of the _ quarterly _ which be due in November be not publish until the end of December 1809 gifford 's excuse be the want of copy he write to mr murray : we must upon the publication of this number enter into some plan for ensure regularity although it appear late the fourth number be the best that have yet be issue it be more vary in its contents contain article by scott southey barrow and heber but the most important article be contribute by robert grant on the character of the late cj fox this be the first article in the _ quarterly _ accord to mr murray which excite general admiration concern which we find a memorandum in mr murray 's own copy and what be a important test it largely increase the demand for the _ review _ chapter vii constable and ballantyne during the year in which the _ quarterly _ be first give to the world the alliance between murray and the ballantyne be close and intimate : they correspondence be not confine to business matter but bear witness to warm personal friendship murray be able to place much printing work in they hand and amongst other book mr rundell 's cookery a valuable property which have now reach a very large circulation be print at the canongate press they exert themselves to promote the sale of one another 's publication and engage in various joint work such for example as grahame 's british georgic and scott 's english minstrelsy in the midst of all these transaction however there be not want symptom of financial difficulty which as in a previous instance be destine in time to cause a severance between murray and he edinburgh agent it be the old story -- draw bill for value _ not _ receive murray seriously warn the ballantyne of the risk they be run in trading beyond they capital jame ballantyne reply on march 30 1809 : _ mr jame ballantyne to john murray _ suffer I to notice one part of you letter respect which you will be happy to be put right we be by no means trade beyond we capital it require no professional knowledge to enable we to avoid so fatal a error as that for the few speculation we have enter into we means have be carefully calculate and be perfectly adequate yet at the close of the same letter refer to the british novelist -- a vast scheme to which mr murray have by no means pledge himself -- ballantyne continue : for this work permit I to state i have order a font of type cut expressly on purpose at a expense of near # 1000 and have engage a very large number of compositor for no other object on June 14 jame ballantyne write to murray : i can get no book out yet without interfere in the printing office with business previously engage for and that put I a little about for cash independent of _ this _ circumstance upon which we reckon a sum of # 1500 payable to we at 25th may yet wait some curse legal arrangement but which we trust to have very shortly -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- this be all preliminary to the enclosure which i hope will not be disagreeable to you and if not i will trust to they receipt _ accept _ by return of post mr murray reply on June 20 : i regret that i should be under the necessity of return you the two bill which you enclose unaccepted but have settle lately a very large amount with mr constable i have occasion to grant more bill than i think it proper to allow to be about at the same time this be not the last application for acceptance and it will be find that in the end it lead to a entire separation between the firm the ballantyne however be more sanguine than prudent in spite of mr murray 's warning that they be proceed too rapidly with the publication of new work they inform he that they have a gigantic scheme in hand -- the tale of the east translate by henry weber walter scott 's private secretary -- besides the edinburgh encyclopedia and the secret memoirs of the house of stewart they say that scott be interested in the tale of the east and in one of they hopeful letter they request mr murray to join in they speculation he answer be as follow : _ john murray to messr ballantyne & co _ _ October _ 31 1809 i regret that i can not accept a share in the ` edinburgh encyclopedia ' i be oblige to decline by motive of prudence i do not know anything of the agreement make by the proprietor except in the palpable mismanagement of a very exclusive and promising concern i be therefore fearful to risk my property in a affair so extremely unsuitable you distress I sadly by the announcement of have put the ` secret memoirs ' to press and that the paper for it be actually purchase six month ago how can you my good sir act in this way how can you imagine that a bookseller can afford to pay eternal advance upon almost every work in which he take a share with you and how can you continue to destroy every speculation by enter upon new one before the previous one be properly complete why with you influence will you not urge the completion of the ` minstrelsy ' why not go on with and complete the series of de foe for myself i really do not know what to do for when i see that you will complete nothing of you own i be unwillingly apprehensive of have any work of mine in you power what i thus write be in serious friendship for you i entreat you to let we complete what we have already in hand before we begin upon any other speculation you will have enough to do to sell those in which we be already engage as to you mode of exchange and so dispose of you share besides the universal obloquy which attend the practice in the mind of every respectable bookseller and the certain damnation which it invariably cause both to the book and the author as in the case of grahame if persist in it must end in serious loss to the bookseller if you can not give I you solemn promise not to exchange a copy of tasso i trust you will allow I to withdraw the small share which i propose to take for the least breath of this kind would blast the work and the author too -- a most worthy man upon whose account alone i engage in the speculation constable with whom murray have never entirely break have always look with jealousy at the operation of the house of ballantyne they firm have indeed be start in opposition to himself and it be not without a sort of gratification that he hear of they pecuniary difficulty and of the friction between they and murray scott 's lady of the lake have be announce for publication at the close of a letter to murray constable rather maliciously remark : _ January _ 20 1810 i have no particular anxiety about promulgate the folly -lrb- to say the least of it -rrb- of certain correspondent of yours in this quarter but if you will ask we friend mr miller if he have a letter from a shop nearly opposite the royal exchange the other day he will i dare say tell you of the contents i be mistaken if they game be not well up indeed i doubt much if they will survive the ` lady of the lake ' she will probably help to drown they a arrangement have be make with the ballantyne that in consideration of they be the sole agent for mr murray in scotland they should give he the opportunity of take share in any of they publication instead however of offer a share of the lady of the lake to mr murray accord to the understanding between the firm the ballantyne have already part with one fourth share of the work to mr miller of albemarle street london whose business be afterwards purchase by mr murray mr murray 's letter to ballantyne & co thus describe the arrangement : _ john murray to messr ballantyne & co _ _ march _ 26 1810 respect my _ review _ you appear to forget that you engagement be that i should be you sole agent here and that you be to publish nothing but what i be to have the offer of a share in you deviation from this must have lead I to conclude that you do not desire or expect to continue my agent any longer you can not suppose that my estimation of mr scott 's genius can have render I indifferent to my exclusion from a share in the ` lady of the lake ' i mention this as well to testify that i be not indifferent to this conduct in you as to point it out to you that if you mean to withhold from I that portion which you command of the advantage of we connexion you must surely mean to resign any that might arise from I the sole agency for my publication in edinburgh be worth to any man who understand he business # 300 a year but this require zealous activity and deference on one side and great confidence on both otherwise the connexion can not be advantageous or satisfactory to either party for this number of the _ review _ i have continue you name solely in it and propose to make you as before sole publisher in scotland but as you have yourself adopt the plan of draw upon I for the amount of each transaction you will do I the favor to consider what quantity you will need and upon you remit to I a note at six month for the amount i shall immediately ship the quantity for you _ mr jame ballantyne to john murray _ you agency hitherto have be productive of little or no advantage to we and the fault have not lie with we we have persist in offer you share of everything begin by we till we find the hopelessness of wait any return and in divide mr scott 's poem we find it we duty to give what share we have to part with to those by whom we be chiefly benefit both as bookseller and printer this letter be accompany with a heavy bill for print the work of de foe for mr murray a breach thus take place with the ballantyne the publisher of the _ quarterly _ be compel to look out for a new agent for scotland and meet with a thoroughly competent one in mr william blackwood the founder of the well-known publishing house in edinburgh to return to the progress of the _ quarterly _ the fifth number which be due in February 1810 but do not appear until the end of march contain many excellent article though as mr elli say some of they be contribute by good and steady but marvellously heavy friend yet he find it better than the _ edinburgh _ which on that occasion be reasonably dull it contain one article which become the foundation of a english classic that of southey on the life of nelson of this article murray write to its author : i wish it to be make such a book as shall become the heroic text of every midshipman in the navy and the association of nelson and southey will not i think be ungrateful to you if it be worth you attention in this way i be dispose to think that it will enable I to treble the sum i first offer as a slight remuneration mr murray write to mr scott -lrb- August 28 1810 -rrb- as to the appearance of the new number which do not appear till a month and a half after it be due remark on the fourth article this he say be a review of the ` daughter of isenberg a bavarian romance ' by mr gifford to whom the authoress -lrb- alicium t palmer -rrb- have the temerity to send three # 1 note gifford instead of send back the money with indignation as he at first propose review the romance and assume that the authoress have send he the money for charitable purpose _ mr gifford to miss at palmer _ we avocation leave we but little leisure for extra-official employment and in the present case she have inadvertently add to we difficulty by forbear to specify the precise object of she bounty we hesitate for some time between the foundling and lying-in hospital : in finally determine for the latter we humbly trust that we have not disappointed she expectation nor misapply she charity we publisher will transmit the proper receipt to she address one of the principal objection of mr murray to the manner in which mr gifford edit the _ quarterly _ be the war which he wage with the _ edinburgh _ this he hold be not the way in which a respectable periodical should be conduct it have a line of its own to pursue without attack its neighbor publish he say the best information the best science the best literature and leave the public to decide for themselves rely on this opinion he warn gifford and he friend against attack sydney smith and leslie and jeffrey because of they contribution to the _ edinburgh _ he think that such attack have only the effect of advertise the rival journal and render it of greater importance with reference to the article on sydney smith 's visitation sermon in no 5 mr george ellis privately write to mr murray : gifford though the best-tempered man alive be _ terribly _ severe with he pen but ss would suffer ten time more by be turn into ridicule -lrb- and never do man expose himself so much as he do in that sermon -rrb- than from be slash and cauterize in that manner the follow refer to a difference of opinion between mr murray and he editor mr gifford have resent some expression of he friend 's as savor of intimidation _ john murray to mr gifford _ _ September _ 25 1810 i entreat you to be assure that the term ` intimidation ' can never be apply to any part of my conduct towards you for whom i entertain the highest esteem and regard both as a writer and as a friend if i be over-anxious it be because i have let my hope of fame as a bookseller rest upon the establishment and celebrity of this journal my character as well with my professional brethren as with the public be at stake upon it for i would not be think silly by the one or a mere speculator by the other i have a very large business as you may conclude by the capital i have be able to throw into this one publication and yet my mind be so entirely engross my honor be so completely involve in this one thing that i neither eat drink nor sleep upon anything else i would rather it excel all other journal and i gain nothing by it than gain # 300 a year by it without trouble if it be think inferior to any other this sir be true meanwhile mr murray be become hard press for money to conduct he increase business require a large floating capital for long credit be the custom and besides he own requirement he have to bear the constant importunity of the ballantyne to renew they bill on July 25 1810 he write to they : this will be the last renewal of the bill -lrb- # 300 -rrb- when it become due you will have the goodness to provide for it it be however become impossible to continue deal with they and he gradually transfer he printing business to other firm we find he about this time order messr george ramsay & co edinburgh to print 8000 of the domestic cookery which be still have a large sale the constable also be press he for renewal of bill the correspondence of this date be full of remonstrance from murray against the financial unpunctuality of he edinburgh correspondent on march 21 1811 he write : with regard to myself i will engage in no new work of any kind and again on April 4 1811 : dear constable you know how much i have distressed myself by enter heedlessly upon too many engagement you must not urge I to involve myself in renew difficulty to return to the _ quarterly _ no 8 owing to the repeat delay in publication the circulation fall off from 5000 to 4000 and mr george elli have obviously reason when he write : hence i infer that _ punctuality _ be in we present situation we great and only desideratum accordingly increase effort be make to have the _ quarterly _ publish with greater punctuality though it be a considerable time before success in this respect be finally reach gifford prune and pare down to the last moment and often hold back the publication until a erasure or a correction could be finally insert no 9 due in February 1811 be not publish until march from this time southey become a almost constant contributor to the _ review _ he write with ease grace and rapidity and there be scarcely a number without one and sometimes two and even three article from he pen he prose style be charming -- clear masculine and to the point the public eagerly read he prose while he poetry remain unnoticed on the shelf the poet could not accept this view of he merit of the curse of kehama he write : i be perfectly aware that i be plant acorn while my contemporary be set turkey bean the oak will grow and though i may never sit under its shade my child will of the ` lady of the lake ' 25000 copy have be print of ` kehama ' 500 and if they sell in seven year i shall be surprised scott write a kindly notice of southey 's poem it be not he way to cut up he friend in a review he point out the beauty of the poem in order to invite purchaser and reader yet he private opinion to he friend george elli be this : _ mr scott to mr g elli _ i have run up a attempt on the ` curse of kehama ' for the _ quarterly _ : a strange thing it be -- the ` curse ' i mean -- and the critique be not as the blackguard say worth a damn but what i could i do which be to throw as much weight as possible upon the beautiful passage of which there be many and to slur over its absurdity of which there be not a few it be infinite pity for southey with genius almost to exuberance so much learning and real good feeling of poetry that with the true obstinacy of a foolish papa he _ will _ be most attach to the defect of he poetical offspring this say ` kehama ' afford cruel opening to the quizzer and i suppose will get it roundly in the _ edinburgh review _ i could have make a very different hand of it indeed have the order of the day be _ pour dchirer _ it be a good thing for southey that he could always depend upon he contribution to the _ quarterly _ for he daily maintenance for he could not at all rely upon the income from he poetry the failure of the _ edinburgh annual register _ publish by ballantyne lead to a diminution of southey 's income amounting to about # 400 a year he be thus lead to write more and more for the _ quarterly _ he reputation as well as he income rise higher from he writings there than from any of he other work in April 1812 he write to he friend mr wynn : _ mr southey to mr wynn _ by god 's blessing i may yet live to make all necessary provision myself my means be now improve every year i be up the hill of difficulty and shall very soon get rid of the burthen which have impede I in the ascent i have some arrangement with murray which be likely to prove more profitable than any former speculation hitherto i have be highly favor a healthy body a active mind and a cheerful heart be the three best boon nature can bestow and god be praise no man ever enjoy these more perfectly chapter viii murray and gifford -- rupture with constable -- prosperity of the quarterly a good understanding be now establish between mr murray and he editor and the _ quarterly _ go on improve and gradually increase in circulation though regular in the irregularity of its publication the subscriber seem to have become accustomed to the delay and when it do make its appearance it be read with eagerness and avidity the interest and variety of its contents and the skill of the editor in the arrangement of he material make up for many shortcoming murray and gifford be in constant communication and it be interesting to remember that the writer of the follow judicious criticism have be editor of the _ anti-jacobin _ before he be editor of the _ quarterly _ _ mr gifford to john murray _ _ may _ 17 1811 i have seldom be more pleased and vex at a time than with the perusal of the enclosed m it have wit it have ingenuity but both be absolutely lose in a negligence of composition which mortify I why will you young friend fling away talent which might so honourably distinguish he he might if be choose be the ornament of we _ review _ instead of create in one mingled regret and admiration it be utterly impossible to insert such a composition as the present there be expression which would not be bear and if as you say it will be send to jeffrey 's if i do not admit it however i may grieve i must submit to the alternative article of pure humor should be write with extraordinary attention a vulgar laugh be detestable i never see much merit in write rapidly you will believe I when i tell you that i have be present at the production of more genuine wit and humor than almost any person of my time and that it be revise and polish and arrange with a scrupulous care which overlook nothing i have not often see fairer promise of excellence in this department than in you correspondent but i tell you frankly that they will all be blighted and perish prematurely unless sedulously cultivate it be a poor ambition to raise a casual laugh in the unreflect the article do not appear in the _ quarterly _ and mr pillan the writer afterwards become a contributor to the _ edinburgh review _ in a letter of August 25 1811 we find gifford write to a correspondent : since the hour i be bear i never enjoy as far as i can recollect what you call _ health _ for a single day in November after discuss in a letter the article which be about to appear in the next _ review _ he conclude : i write in pain and must break off in the follow month mr murray no doubt in consideration of the start which he _ review _ have make send he a present of # 500 i thank you he answer -lrb- December 6 -rrb- very sincerely for you magnificent present but # 500 be a vast sum however you know you own business yet mr murray be by no means abound in wealth there be always those overdrawn bill from edinburgh to be meet and ballantyne and constable be both tug at he for accommodation at the same time the business arrangement with constable & co which save for the short interruption which have already be relate have extend over many year be now about to come to a end the follow refer to the purchase of mr miller 's stock and the removal of mr murray 's business to albemarle street _ john murray to mr constable _ albemarle st _ October _ 27 1812 i do not see any exist reason why we who have so long be so very intimate should now be place in a situation of negative hostility i be sure that we be well calculate to render to each other great service you be the best judge whether you interest be ever before so well attend to as by I the great connexion which i have for the last two year be mature in fleet street i be now go to bring into action here and it be not with any view to or with any reliance upon what miller have do but upon what i know i can do in such a situation that i have long make up my mind to move it be no sudden thing but one long mature and it be only from the accident of miller 's move that i have take he house so that the notion which i be tell you entertain respect my plan be totally outside the idea upon which it be form i repeat it be in my power to do you many service and certainly i have buy very largely of you and you never of I and you know very well that i will serve you heartily if i can deal with you confidentially a truce be for a time make between the firm but it prove hollow the never-ending imposition of accommodation bill send for acceptance have now reach a point beyond endurance have regard to murray 's credit the last letter from murray to constable & co be as follow : _ john murray to constable & co _ _ April 30 _ 1813 gentleman i do not answer the letter to which the enclosed allude because its impropriety in all respects render it impossible for I to do so without involve myself in a personal dispute which it be my anxious resolution to avoid : and because my determination be fully take to abide by what i tell you in my former letter to which alone i can or could have refer you you make a express proposition to I to which as you have deviate from it it be not my intention to accede the book may remain with I upon sale or return until you please to order they elsewhere and in the meantime i shall continue to avail myself of every opportunity to sell they i return therefore a account and bill with which i have nothing to do and desire to have a regular invoice i be gentleman yours truly j murray constable & co fire off a final shot on may 28 follow and the correspondence and business between the firm then terminate no 12 of the _ quarterly _ appear in December 1811 and perhaps the most interesting article in the number be that by canning and elli on trotter 's life of fox gifford write to murray about this article : i have not see canning yet but he be undoubtedly at work by this time pray take care that no one get a sight of the slip it will be a delightful article but say not a word till it come out a pamphlet have be publish by w landor dedicate to the president of the united state entitle remark upon memoirs of mr fox lately publish gifford be furious about it he write to murray : _ mr gifford to john murray _ i never read so rascally a thing as the dedication it be almost too bad for the eaton and other publisher of mad democratic book in the pamphlet itself there be many clever bit but there be no taste and little judgment he attack on private man be very bad those on mr c be too stupid to do much harm or indeed any the dedication be the most abject piece of business that i ever read it show landor to have a most rancorous and malicious heart nothing but a rooted hatred of he country could have make he dedicate he jacobinical book to the most contemptible wretch that ever creep into authority and whose only recommendation to he be he implacable enmity to he country i think you might write to southey but i would not on any account have you publish such a scoundrel address the only entire article ever contribute to the _ review _ by gifford himself be that which he write in conjunction with barron field on ford 's dramatic work it be a able paper but it contain a passage the publication of which occasioned gifford the deepest regret towards the conclusion of the article these word occur : the editor have polluted he page with the blasphemy of a poor maniac who it seem once publish some detach scene of the ` broken heart ' this refer to charle lamb who liken the transcendent scene -lrb- of the spartan boy and calantha -rrb- in imagination to calvary and the cross now gifford have never hear of the personal history of lamb nor of the occasional fit of lunacy to which he sister mary be subject and when the paragraph be bring to he notice by southey through murray it cause he unspeakable distress he at once write to southey -lrb- footnote : when the subject of a memoir of charle lamb by serjeant talfourd be under consideration southey write to a friend : i wish that i have look out for mr talfourd the letter which gifford write in reply to one in which i remonstrate with he upon he designation of lamb as a poor maniac the word be use in complete ignorance of they peculiar bearing and i believe nothing in the course of gifford 's life ever occasion he so much self-reproach he be a man with whom i have no literary sympathy perhaps there be nothing upon which we agree except great political question but i like he the better ever after for he conduct on this occasion -rrb- the follow letter : _ mr w gifford to mr southey _ _ February _ 13 1812 my dear sir i break off here to say that i have this moment receive you last letter to murray it have grieve and shock I beyond expression but my dear friend i be innocent so far as the intent go i call god to witness that in the whole course of my life i never hear one syllable of mr lamb or he family i know not that he ever have a sister or that he have parent live or that he or any person connect with he have ever manifest the slightest tendency to insanity in a word i declare to you _ in the most solemn manner _ that all i ever know or ever hear of mr lamb be merely he name have i be aware of one of the circumstance which you mention i would have lose my right arm sooner than have write what i have the truth be that i be shock at see he compare the suffering and death of a person who just continue to dance after the death of he lover be announce -lrb- for this be all he merit -rrb- to the pang of mount calvary and not choose to attribute it to folly because i reserve that charge for weber i unhappily in the present case ascribe it to madness for which i pray god to forgive I since the blow have fall heavily when i really think it would not be feel i consider lamb as a thoughtless scribbler who in circumstance of ease amuse himself by write on any subject why i think so i can not tell but it be the opinion i form to myself for i now regret to say i never make any inquiry upon the subject nor by any accident in the whole course of my life do i hear he mention beyond the name i remain my dear sir yours most sincerely w gifford it be unnecessary to describe in detail the further progress of the _ quarterly _ the venture be now fairly launch occasionally when some friction arise from the editorial pruning of southey 's article or when mr murray remonstrate with the exclusion or inclusion of some particular article mr gifford become depressed or complain this business begin to get too heavy for I and i must soon have do i fear such discouragement be only momentary gifford continue to edit the _ review _ for many year until and long after its complete success have become assure the follow extract from a letter of southey 's to he friend bedford describe very happily the position which mr murray have now attain murray offer I a thousand guinea for my intended poem in blank verse and beg it may not be a line longer than thomson 's season i rather think the poem will be a post obit and in that case twice that sum at least may be demand for it what he real feeling may be towards I i can not tell but he be a happy fellow living in the light of he own glory the _ review _ be the greatest of all work and it be all he own creation he print 10000 and fifty time ten thousand read its contents in the east and in the west joy be with he and he journal chapter ix lord byron 's work 1811 to 1814 the origin of mr murray 's connection with lord byron be as follow lord byron have make mr dalla -lrb- footnote : robert charle dalla -lrb- 1754-1824 -rrb- he sister marry captain george anson byron and she descendant now hold the title -rrb- a present of the m of the first two canto of childe harold and allow he to make arrangement for they publication mr dalla 's first intention be to offer they to the publisher of english bard and scotch reviewer but cawthorn do not rank sufficiently high among he brethren of the trade he be preclude from offer they to longman & co because of they refusal to publish the satire he then go to mr miller of albemarle street and leave the manuscript with he enjoin the strictest secrecy as to the author after a few day ' consideration miller decline to publish the poem principally because of the sceptical stanza which it contain and also because of its denunciation as a plunderer of he friend and patron the earl of elgin who be mention by name in the original manuscript of the poem after hear from dalla that miller have decline to publish childe harold lord byron write to he from reddish 's hotel : _ lord byron to mr miller _ _ July _ 30 1811 sir i be perfectly aware of the justice of you remark and be convince that if ever the poem be publish the same objection will be make in much stronger term but as it be intend to be a poem on _ ariosto 's plan _ that be to say on _ no plan _ at all and as be usual in similar case have a predilection for the worst passage i shall retain those part though i can not venture to defend they under these circumstance i regret that you decline the publication on my own account as i think the book would have do better in you hand the pecuniary part you know i have nothing to do with but i can perfectly conceive and indeed approve you reason and assure you my sensation be not _ archiepiscopal _ enough as yet to regret the rejection of my homily i be sir you very obedient humble servant byron next to these publisher proceed dalla in he recollection of the life of lord byron i wish to oblige mr murray who have then a shop opposite st dunstan 's church in fleet street both he and he father before he have publish for myself he have express to I he regret that i do not carry he the ` english bard and scotch reviewer ' but this be after its success i think he would have refuse it in its embryo state after lord byron 's arrival i have meet he and he say he wish i would obtain some work of he lordship 's for he i now have it in my power and i put ` childe harold 's pilgrimage ' into he hand tell he that lord byron have make I a present of it and that i expect he would make a very liberal arrangement with I for it he take some day to consider during which time he consult he literary adviser among whom no doubt be mr gifford who be editor of the _ quarterly review _ that mr gifford give a favourable opinion i afterwards learn from mr murray himself but the objection i have state stare he in the face and he be keep in suspense between the desire of possess a work of lord byron 's and the fear of a unsuccessful speculation we come to this conclusion : that he should print at he expense a handsome quarto edition the profit of which i should share equally with he and that the agreement for the copyright should depend upon the success of this edition when i tell this to lord byron he be highly pleased but still doubt the copyright be worth my acceptance promising however if the poem go through the edition to give I other poem to annex to ` childe harold ' mr murray have long desire to make lord byron 's acquaintance and now that mr dalla have arrange with he for the publication of the first two canto of childe harold he have many opportunity of see byron at he place of business the first time that he see he be when he call one day with mr hobhouse in fleet street he afterwards look in from time to time while the sheet be pass through the press fresh from the fencing room of angelo and jackson and use to amuse himself by renew he practice of carte et tierce with he walking-cane direct against the book-shelf while murray be read passage from the poem with occasional ejaculation of admiration on which byron would say you think that a good idea do you murray then he would fence and lunge with he walking-stick at some special book which he have pick out on the shelf before he as murray afterwards say i be often very glad to get rid of he a correspondence take place with regard to certain omission alteration and improvement which be strongly urge both by mr dalla and the publisher mr murray write as follow : _ john murray to lord byron _ _ September _ 4 1811 my lord a absence of some day pass in the country have prevent I from write earlier in answer to you oblige letter -lrb- footnote : these letter be give in moore 's life and letter of lord byron -rrb- i have now however the pleasure of send you under a separate cover the first proof sheet of you poem which be so good as to be entitle to all you care in render it perfect besides its general merit there be part which i be tempt to believe far excel anything that you have hitherto publish and it be therefore grievous indeed if you do not condescend to bestow upon it all the improvement of which you mind be so capable every correction already make be valuable and this circumstance render I more confident in solicit you further attention there be some expression concern spain and portugal which however just at the time they be conceive yet as they do not harmonise with the now prevalent feeling i be persuade would so greatly interfere with the popularity which the poem be in other respects certainly calculate to excite that in compassion to you publisher who do not presume to reason upon the subject otherwise than as a mere matter of business i hope you goodness will induce you to remove they and with they perhaps some religious sentiment which may deprive I of some customer amongst the orthodox could i flatter myself that these suggestion be not obtrusive i would hazard another -- that you would add the two promise canto and complete the poem it be cruel indeed not to perfect a work which contain so much that be excellent you fame my lord demand it you be raise a monument that will outlive you present feeling and it should therefore be construct in such a manner as to excite no other association than that of respect and admiration for you character and genius i trust that you will pardon the warmth of this address when i assure you that it arise in the greatest degree from a sincere regard for you best reputation with however some view to that portion of it which must attend the publisher of so beautiful a poem as you be capable of render in the ` romaunt of childe harold ' in compliance with the suggestion of the publisher byron altered and improve the stanza relate to elgin and wellington with respect to the religious or anti-religious sentiment byron write to murray : as for the ` orthodox ' let we hope they will buy on purpose to abuse -- you will forgive the one if they will do the other yet he do alter stanza viii and insert what moore call a magnificent stanza in place of one that be churlish and sneering and in all respects very much inferior byron then proceed to another point tell I fairly do you show the m to some of you corps i will have no trap for applause he write to mr murray at the same time forbid he to show the manuscript of childe harold to he aristarchus mr gifford though he have no objection to let it be see by any one else but it be too late mr gifford have already see the manuscript and pronounce a favourable opinion as to its great poetic merit byron be not satisfy with this assurance and seem in he next letter to be very angry he could not bear to have it think that he be endeavor to ensure a favourable review of he work in the _ quarterly _ to mr dalla he write -lrb- September 23 1811 -rrb- : i _ will _ be angry with murray it be a book-selling back-shop paternoster row paltry proceeding and if the experiment have turn out as it deserve i would have raise all fleet street and borrow the giant 's staff from st dunstan 's church to immolate the betrayer of trust i have write to he as he be never write to before by a author i 'll be swear and i hope you will amplify my wrath till it have a effect upon he byron at first object to allow the new poem to be publish with he name think that this would bring down upon he the enmity of he critic in the north as well as the venom of the southern scribbler whom he have enrage by he satire at last on mr murray 's strong representation he consent to allow he name to be publish on the title-page as the author even to the last however he doubt be great as to the probable success of the poem and he more than once talk of suppress it in October 1811 lord byron write from newstead abbey to he friend mr hodgson : -lrb- footnote : the rev franci hodgson be then reside at cambridge as fellow and tutor of king 's college he form a intimate friendship with byron who communicate with he freely as to he poetical as well as he religious difficulty hodgson afterwards become provost of eton -rrb- ` childe harold 's pilgrimage ' must wait till murray 's be finish he be make a tour in middlesex and be to return soon when high matter may be expect he want to have it in quarto which be a cursed unsaleable size but it be pestilent long and one must obey one 's publisher the whole of the sheet be print off in the follow month of January and the work be publish on march 1 1812 of the first edition only 500 copy demy quarto be print it be unnecessary to say with what applause the book be receive the impression it produce be as instantaneous as it prove to be lasting byron himself briefly describe the result of the publication in he memorandum : i awake one morning and find myself famous the publisher have already take pain to spread abroad the merit of the poem many of he friend have re-echo its praise the attention of the public be fix upon the work and in three day after its appearance the whole edition be dispose of when mr dalla go to see lord byron at he house in st jame 's street he find he load with letter from critic poet and author all lavish of they rapture a handsome new edition in octavo be propose to which he lordship agree eventually mr murray consent to give mr dalla # 600 for the copyright of the poem although mr gifford and other be of opinion that it might prove a bad bargain at that price there be however one exception namely mr roger who tell mr murray not to be dishearten for he might rely upon its turn out the most fortunate purchase he have ever make and so it prove three thousand copy of the second and third edition of the poem in octavo be print and these go off in rapid succession on the appearance of childe harold 's pilgrimage lord byron become a object of interest in the fashionable world of london he poem be the subject of conversation everywhere and many literary noble and royal personage desire to make he acquaintance in the month of June he be invite to a party at miss johnson 's at which he royal highness the prince regent be present as lord byron have not yet be to court it be not consider etiquette that he should appear before he royal highness he accordingly retire to another room but on the prince be inform that lord byron be in the house he express a desire to see he lord byron be send for and the follow be mr murray 's account of the conversation that take place _ john murray to mr scott _ _ June _ 27 1812 dear sir i can not refrain notwithstanding my fear of intrusion from mention to you a conversation which lord byron have with hrh the prince regent and of which you form the lead subject he be at a evening party at miss johnson 's this week when the prince hearing that lord byron be present express a desire to be introduce to he and for more than half a hour they converse on poetry and poet with which the prince display a intimacy and critical taste which at once surprised and delighted lord byron but the prince 's great delight be walter scott whose name and writings he dwell upon and recur to incessantly he prefer he far beyond any other poet of the time repeat several passage with fervor and criticize they faithfully he speak chiefly of the ` lay of the last minstrel ' which he express himself as admire most of the three poem he quote homer and even some of the obscurer greek poet and appear as lord byron suppose to have read more poetry than any prince in europe he pay of course many compliment to lord byron but the greatest be that he ought to be offend with lord b for that he have think it impossible for any poet to equal walter scott and that he have make he find himself mistaken lord byron call upon I merely to let off the rapture of the prince respect you think as he say that if i be likely to have occasion to write to you it might not be ungrateful for you to hear of he praise in reply scott write to mr murray as follow enclose a letter to lord byron which have already be publish in the life of both author : _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ July 2 _ 1812 my dear sir i have be very silent partly through pressure of business and partly from idleness and procrastination but it would be very ungracious to delay return my thanks for you kindness in transmit the very flattering particulars of the prince regent 's conversation with lord byron i trouble you with a few line to he lordship expressive of my thanks for he very handsome and gratifying communication and i hope he will not consider it as intrusive in a veteran author to pay my debt of gratitude for the high pleasure i have receive from the perusal of ` childe harold ' which be certainly the most original poem which we have have this many a day you oblige humble servant walter scott this episode lead to the opening of a agreeable correspondence between scott and byron and to a lasting friendship between the two poet the fit of inspiration be now on lord byron in may 1813 appear the giaour and in the midst of he correction of successive edition of it he write in four night he second turkish story zuleika afterwards know as the bride of abydo with respect to the business arrangement as to the two poem mr murray write to lord byron as follow : _

offer you the sum of one thousand guinea and i shall be happy if you perceive that my estimation of you talent in my character of a man of business be not much under my admiration of they as a man i do most heartily accept the offer of you portrait as the most noble mark of friendship with which you could in any way honor I i do assure you that i be truly proud of be distinguish as you publisher and that i shall ever continue you lordship 's faithful servant john murray with reference to the foregoing letter we read in lord byron 's diary : mr murray have offer I one thousand guinea for ` the

be sell within a month the corsair be lord byron 's next poem write with great vehemence literally strike off at a heat at the rate of about two hundred line a day -- a circumstance say moore that be perhaps wholly without a parallel in the history of genius the corsair be begin on the 18th and finish on the 31st of December 1813 a sudden impulse induce lord byron to present the copyright of this poem also to mr dalla with the single stipulation that he would offer it for publication to mr murray who eventually pay mr dalla five hundred guinea for the copyright and the work be publish in February 1814 the follow letter will give some idea of the reception it meet with _ john murray to lord byron _ _ February _ 3 1814 my lord i have be unwilling to write until i have something to say a occasion to which i do not always restrict myself i be most happy to tell you that you last poem _ be _ -- what mr southey 's be _ call _ -- _ a carman triumphale _ never in my recollection have any work since the letter of burke to the duke of bedford excite such a ferment -- a ferment which i be happy to say will subside into lasting fame i sell on the day of publication -- a thing perfectly unprecedented -- 10000 copy gifford do what i never know he do before -- he repeat several passage from memory the ode to napoleon bonaparte which appear in April 1814 be on the whole a failure it be know to be lord byron 's and its publication be seize upon by the press as the occasion for many bitter criticism mingle with personality against the writer 's genius and character he be cut to the

which have all the entertaining and lively feature of the ` amenity of literature ' i be just pack they up with a few other book for my hermitage at abbotsford where my present parlor be only 12 foot square and my book-press in lilliputian proportion poor andrew macdonald i know in day of yore and could have supply some curious anecdote respect he he die of a poet 's consumption viz want of food the present volume of ` somer ' -lrb- footnote : lord somer ' tract a new edition in 12 volume -rrb- will be out immediately with whom be i to correspond on this subject since the secession of will miller i shall be happy to hear you have succeed to he in this department as well as in albemarle street what have move miller to retire he be surely too young to have make a fortune and it be uncommon to quit a thrive trade i have have a packet half finish for gifford this many a day southey express himself as greatly interested in the calamity of author and propose to make it the subject of a article for the _ quarterly _ _ mr southey to john murray _ _ August _ 14 1812 i should like to enlarge a little upon the subject of literary property on which he have touch in my opinion with proper feeling certainly i be a party concerned i should like to say something upon the absurd purpose of the literary fund with its despicable ostentation of patronage and to build a sort of national academy in the air in the hope that canning might one day lay its foundation in a more solid manner -lrb- footnote : canning have he own opinion on the subject when the royal society of literature be about to be establish a application be make to he to join the committee he refuse for reason partly general partly personal he add i be really of opinion with dr johnson that the multitudinous personage call the public be after all the best patron of literature and learn man -rrb- and i could say something on the other side of the picture show that although literature in almost all case be the worst trade to which a man can possibly betake himself it be the best and wisest of all pursuit for those whose provision be already make and of all amusement for those who have leisure to amuse themselves it have long be my intention to leave behind I my own memoirs as a post-obit for my family -- a wise intention no doubt and one which it be not very prudent to procrastinate should this ever be complete it would exhibit a case directly in contrast to d'israelus 's view of the subject i choose literature for my own profession with every advantage of education it be true but under more disadvantage perhaps of any other kind than any of the person in he catalogue i have never repent the choice the usual censure ridicule and even calumny which it have draw on I never give I a moment 's pain but on the other hand literature have give I friend among the best and wisest and most celebrated of my contemporary it have give I distinction if i live twenty year longer i do not doubt that it will give I fortune and if it please god to take I before my family be provide for i doubt as little that in my name and in my work they will find a provision i want to give you a ` life of wesley ' the history of the dissenter must be finish by that time and it will afford I opportunity during the year 1813 the recklessness of the younger ballantyne combine with the formation of the incipient estate at abbotsford be weigh heavily on walter scott this lead to a fresh alliance with constable in which write scott i be sensible he have gain a great advantage but in accordance with the agreement constable in return for a share in scott 's new work be to relieve the ballantyne of some of they heavy stock and in may scott be enable for the first time these many week to lay my head on a quiet pillow but nothing could check john ballantyne i sometimes fear write scott to he that between the long date of you bill and the tardy settlement of the edinburgh trade some difficulty will occur even in June and July i always regard with deep anxiety how true this forecast prove to be be show by the follow letter : _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ July 5 _ 1813 i delay answer you

from the thame to visit she mother and friend in edinburgh she be accompany by she son john and she two daughter during she absence mr murray write to she two or three time a week and keep she _ au

leave I # 130 and the certain sale of 10000 more in the 8vo form mr canning call upon gifford yesterday and from they conversation i infer very favourably for my _ review _ we shall now take a decide tone in politics and we be all in one boat croker have go down to the prince regent at brighton where i ought to have be last night to have witness the rejoicing and splendor of the duke of clarence 's birthday but i be ever out of luck ' o indolence and indecision of mind if not in yourselve vice to how much exquisite misery do you frequently prepare the way ' have you come to this passage in ` waverley ' yet pray read ` waverley ' it be excellent on September 5 1814 mr murray communicate with mr murray as to the education of he son john then six-and-a-half year old : _ john murray to mr murray _ i be glad that you venture to say something about the child for it be only by such minutiae that i can judge of the manner in which they amuse or behave themselves i really do not see the least propriety in leave john at a age when the first impression be so deep and lasting to receive the rudiment and foundation of he education in scotland if learn english he native language mean anything it be not merely to read it correctly and understand it grammatically but to speak and pronounce it like the most polished native but how can you expect this to be effect even with the aid of the best teacher when everybody around he with whom he can practice he instruction speak in a totally different manner no i rather think it better that he should go to edinburgh after he have pass through the school here and when he be sixteen or seventeen he should certainly go to some school next spring and i most confidingly trust that you be unremitt in you duty to give he daily lesson of preparation or he may be so far behind child of he age when he do go to school that the derision he may meet there may destroy emulation all this however be matter for serious consideration and for future consultation in which you voice shall have its rightful influence mr murray be under the necessity of postpone he visit to france he go to brighton instead and spend a few pleasant day with mr d'israelus and he friend on September 24 mr murray have return to london inform he wife still at edinburgh of a extraordinary piece of news _ john murray to mr murray _ i be much surprised to learn from dalla whom i accidentally meet yesterday that lord byron be expect in town every hour i accordingly leave my card at he house with a notice that i would attend he as soon as he please and it please he to summon my attendance about seven in the evening he have come to town on business and regret that he would not be at newstead until a fortnight as he wish to have see I there on my way to scotland say he ` can you keep a secret ' ` certainly -- positively -- my wife 's out of town ' ` then -- i be go to be marry ' ` the devil i shall have no poem this winter then ' ` no ' ` who be the lady who be to do I this injury ' ` miss milbanke -- do you know she ' ` no my lord ' so here be news for you i fancy the lady be rich noble and beautiful but this shall be my day 's business to enquire about oh how he do curse poor lady c -- as the fiend who have interrupt all he project and who would do so now if possible i think he hint that she have manage to interrupt this connexion two year ago he think she be abroad and to he torment and astonishment he find she not only in england but in london he say he have write some small poem which he friend think beautiful particularly one of eight line he very best -- all of which i believe i be to have and moreover he give I permission to publish the octavo edition of ` lara ' with he name which secure i think # 700 to you and I so scott 's poem be announce -lrb- ` lord of the isle ' -rrb- and i be cut out i wish i have be in scotland six week ago and i might have come in for a share should i apply for one to he it would oblige I to be a partner with constable who be desperately in want of money he have apply to cadell & davy -lrb- the latter tell I in confidence -rrb- and they refuse at the beginning of October mr murray set out for edinburgh journey by nottingham for the purpose of visit newstead abbey the follow be mr murray 's account of he visit to newstead he letter be date matlock October 5 1814 : i get to newstead about 11 o'clock yesterday and find the steward my namesake and the butler wait for I the first who be good-looking and a respectable old man of about sixty-five year show I over the house and grounds which occupy two hour for i be anxious to examine everything but never be i more disappointed for my notion i suppose have be raise to the romantic i have surmise the possibly easy restoration of this once famous abbey the mere skeleton of which be now fast crumble to ruin lord byron 's immediate predecessor strip the whole place of all that be splendid and interesting and you may judge of what he must have do to the mansion when inform you that he convert the ground which use to be cover with the finest tree like a forest into a absolute desert not a tree be leave standing and the wood thus shamefully cut down be sell in one day for # 60000 the hall of entrance have about eighteen large niche which have be fill with statue and the side wall cover with family portrait and armor all these have be mercilessly tear down as well as the magnificent fireplace and sell all the beautiful painting which fill the gallery -- value at that day at # 80000 -- have disappear and the whole place be crumble into dust no sum short of # 100000 would make the place habitable lord byron 's few apartment contain some modern upholstery but serve only to show what ought to have be there they be now digging round the cloister for a traditionary cannon and in they progress about five day ago they discover a corpse in too decay a state to admit of removal i see the drinking-skull -lrb- footnote : when the father of the present mr murray be a student in edinburgh he write to he father -lrb- April 101827 -rrb- : i see yesterday at a jeweller 's shop in edinburgh a great curiosity no less than lord byron 's skull cup upon which he write the poem it be for sale the owner whose name i could not learn -lrb- it appear he do not wish it know -rrb- want # 200 for it -rrb- and the marble mausoleum erect over lord byron 's dog i come away with my heart ache and full of melancholy reflection -- produce a lowness of spirit which i do not get the better of until this morning when the most enchanting scenery i have ever behold have at length restore I i be far more surprised that lord byron should ever have live at newstead than that he should be incline to part with it for as there be no possibility of he be able by any reasonable amount of expense to reinstate it the place can present nothing but a perpetual memorial of the wickedness of he ancestor there be three or at most four domestic at board wages all that i be ask to taste be a piece of bread-and-butter as my foot be on the step of the chaise when about to enter it i be inform that he lordship have order that i should take as much game as i like what make the steward joe murray a interesting object to I be that the old man have see the abbey in all its vicissitude of greatness and degradation once it be full of unbounded hospitality and splendor and now it be simply miserable if this man have feeling -- of which by the way he betray no symptom -- he would possibly be miserable himself he have see three hundred of the first people in the county fill the gallery and see five hundred deer disport themselves in the beautiful park now cover with stunt offshoot of fell tree again i say it give I the heartache to witness all this ruin and i regret that my romantic picture have be destroy by the reality among the friend that welcome mr murray to edinburgh be mr william blackwood who then and for a long time after be closely connect with he in he business transaction blackwood be a native of edinburgh have serve he apprenticeship with messr bell & bradfute bookseller he be select by mundell & company to take charge of a branch of they extensive publishing business in glasgow he return to edinburgh and again enter the service of bell et bradfute but after a time go to london to master the secret of the old book trade under the well-known mr cuthill return to edinburgh he set up for himself in 1804 at the age of twenty-eight at a shop in south bridge street -- confine himself for the most part to old book he be a man of great energy and decision of character and he early education enable he to conduct he correspondence with a remarkable degree of precision and accuracy mr murray seem to have do business with he as far back as June 1807 and be in the habit of call upon blackwood who be about he own age whenever he visit edinburgh the two become intimate and correspond frequently and at last when murray withdraw from the ballantyne in August 1810 he transfer the whole of he scottish agency to the house of william blackwood in return for the publishing business send to he from london blackwood make murray he agent for any new work publish by he in edinburgh in this way murray become the london publisher for hogg 's new poem and the queen 's wake

could think of to offer you he be greatly please with the engraving of you portrait which i recollect to carry with I and during the whole dinner -- when all be admire the taste with which scott have fit up a sort of gothic cottage -- he express he anxious wish that you might honor he with a visit which i venture to assure he you would feel no less happy than certain in effect when you should go

little time will develop all these mystery i have not see ballantyne since and when i do see he i shall say very little indeed if there really be a disappointment in not be connect with scott 's new poem you should feel it much less than any man living -- have such a poet as lord byron although murray fail to obtain a interest in the lady of the lake he be offer and accept at scott 's desire a share in a new edition of don roderick chapter xi murray 's drawing-room -- byron and scott -- work publish in 1815 during mr murray 's absence in edinburgh the dwelling-house at 50 albemarle street

of hunt 's riminus publish by mr murray which be also the work of another writer but gifford never take any notice of these libellous attack upon he he hold that secrecy between himself and the

inglorious the number be actually print stitch and ready for distribution in June but it be think better to wait a little for fear of accident and especially for the purpose of use it instantly after

but mr murray entertain doubt as to the propriety of publish document so confidential and decline to purchase they for the sum propose the next day after he refusal he ascertain that prince lieven have give on behalf of he government not less than # 10000 for the letter emanate from the court of russium alone thus the public miss the perusal of a important series of international scandal in

gifford reply as follow : _ mr gifford to john murray _ i have for the first time look into ` pride and prejudice ' and it be really a very pretty thing no dark passage no secret chamber no wind-howling in long gallery no drop of blood upon a rusty dagger -- thing that should now be leave to lady ' maid and sentimental washerwoman in a later letter he say : _ September _ 29 1815 i have read ` pride and prejudice ' _ again _ -- ` tis very good -- wretchedly print and so pointed as to be almost unintelligible make no apology for send I anything to read or revise i be always happy to do either in the thought that it may be useful to you \* \* \* \* \* of 'em ma ' i have nothing but good to say i be sure of the writer before you mention she the m though plainly write have yet some indeed many little omission and a expression may now and then be amend in pass through the press i will readily undertake the revision miss austen 's two other novel northanger abbey and persuasion be also publish by murray but do not appear until after she death in 1818 the profit of the four novel which have be publish before she death do not amount to more than seven hundred pound mr murray also

be about to tell you that croker be so pleased with the idea of a caledonian article from you that he could not refrain from mention it to the prince regent who be very fond of the subject and he say he would be delighted and be really anxious about it now it occur to I as we _ edinburgh _ friend choose on many occasion to bring in the prince 's name to abuse it this might offer a equally fair opportunity of give he that praise which be so justly due to he knowledge of the history of he country i be with lord byron yesterday he enquire after you and bid I say how much he be indebted to you introduction of you poor irish friend maturin who have send he a tragedy which lord byron receive late in the evening and read through without be able to stop he be so delighted with it that he send it immediately to he fellow-manager the hon george lamb who late as it come to he could not go to bed without finish it the result be that they have lay it before the rest of the committee they or rather lord byron feel it he duty to the author to offer it himself to the manager of covent garden the poor fellow say in he letter that he hope of subsistence for he family for the next year rest upon what he can get for this play i express a desire of do something and lord byron then confess that he have send he fifty guinea i shall write to he tomorrow and i think if you could draw some case for he and exhibit he merit particularly if he play succeed i could induce croker and peel to interest themselves in he behalf and get he a living have you any fancy to dash off a article on 'em ma ' it want incident and romance do it not none of the author 's other novel have be notice and surely ` pride and prejudice ' merit high commendation scott immediately comply with murray 's request he do dash off a article on 'em ma ' which appear in no 27 of the _ quarterly _ in enclose he article to murray scott write as follow : _ mr scott to john murray _ _ January _ 19 1816 dear sir enclose be the article upon emma i have be spend my holiday in the country where besides constant labor in the field during all the hour of daylight the want of book have prevent my complete the highland article -lrb- the culloden papers which appear in next number -rrb- it will be off however by Tuesday 's post as i must take Sunday and Monday into the account of finish it it will be quite unnecessary to send proof of emma as mr gifford will correct all obvious error and abridge it where necessary _ January _ 25 1816 my article be so long that i fancy you will think yourself in the condition of the conjuror who after have a great deal of trouble in raise the devil could not get rid of he after he have once make he appearance but the highland be a immense field and it would have be much more easy for I to have make a sketch twice as long than to make it shorter there still want eight or nine page which you will receive by tomorrow 's or next day 's post but i fancy you will be glad to get on the article on the culloden papers which occupy fifty page of the _ review _ -lrb- no 28 -rrb- describe the clan of the highland they number manners and habit and give a summary history of the rebellion of '45 it be graphically and vigorously write and be consider one of scott 's best essay chapter xii various publication -- charle maturin -- st coleridge -- leigh hunt scott 's poor irish

become embarrassed he be compel to open a boarding-school with the view of assist the family unfortunately he become bind for a friend who deceive he and eventually he be oblige to sacrifice he interest in the school be thus drive to extremity he try to live by literature and produce the fatal revenge or the family of montorio the first of a series of romance in which he outdo mr radcliffe and monk lewi the fatal revenge be follow by the wild irish boy for which colburn give he # 80 and the milesian chief all full of horror and misty grandeur these work do not bring he in much money but in 1815 he determine to win the height of dramatic fame in he bertram or the castle of st aldebrand a tragedy he submit the drama to walter scott as from a obscure irishman tell he of he suffering as a author and the father of a family and implore he kind opinion scott reply in the most friendly manner give he much good advice speak of the work as grand and powerful the character be sketch with masterly enthusiasm and what be practically better send he # 50 as a token of he esteem and sympathy and as a temporary stop-gap until better time come round he moreover call the attention of lord byron then on the committee of management of drury lane theater to the play and he lordship strongly recommend a performance of it thanks to the splendid acting of kean it succeed and maturin realize about # 1000 bertram be publish by murray a circumstance which bring he into frequent communication with the unfortunate maturin the latter offer more play more novel and many article for the _ quarterly _ with reference to one of he article -- a review of sheil 's apostate -- gifford say a more potatoe-headed arrangement or rather derangement i have never see i have endeavor to bring some order out of the chaos there be a sort of wild eloquence in it that make it worth preserve maturin continue to press he literary work on murray who however though he relieve he by the gift of several large sum of money decline all further offer of publication save the tragedy of manuel _ john murray to lord byron _ _ march _ 15 1817 maturin 's new tragedy ` manuel ' appear on Saturday last and i be sorry to say that the opinion of mr gifford be establish by the impression make on the audience the first act very fine the rest exhibit a want of judgment not to be endure it be bring out with uncommon splendor and be well act kean 's character as a old man -- a warrior -- be new and well sustain for he have of course select it and profess to be -- and he act as if he be -- really pleased with it i have undertake to print the tragedy at my own expense and to give the poor author the whole of the profit in 1824 maturin die in dublin in extreme poverty the follow correspondence introduce another great name in english literature it be not improbable that it be southey who suggest to murray the employment of he brother-in-law samuel taylor coleridge from he thorough knowledge of german as the translator of goethe 's faust the follow be mr coleridge 's first letter to murray : _ mr coleridge to john murray _ josiah wade 's esq 2 queen 's square bristol _ -lrb- August _ 23 1814 -rrb- dear sir i have hear from my friend mr charle lamb writing by desire of mr robinson that you wish to have the justly-celebrated faust of goethe translate and that some one or other of my partial friend have induce you to consider I as the man most likely to execute the work adequately those except of course whose higher power -lrb- establish by the solid and satisfactory ordeal of the wide and rapid sale of they work -rrb- it might seem profanation to employ in any other manner than in the development of they own intellectual organization i return my thanks to the recommender whoever he be and no less to you for you flattering faith in the recommendation and thinking as i do that among many volume of praiseworthy german poem the louisa of voss and the faust of goethe be the two if not the only one that be emphatically _ original _ in they conception and characteristic of a new and peculiar sort of thinking and imagine i should not be averse from exert my best effort in a attempt to import whatever be importable of either or of both into we own language but let I not be suspect of a presumption of which i be not consciously guilty if i say that i feel two difficulty one arise from long disuse of versification add to what i know better than the most hostile critic could inform I of my comparative weakness and the other that _ any _ work in poetry strike I with more than common awe as propose for realization by myself because from long habit of meditation on language as the symbolic medium of the connection of think with thought and of thought as affect and modify by passion and emotion i should spend day in avoid what i deem fault though with the full preknowledge that they admission would not have offend perhaps three of all my reader and might be deem beauty by 300 -- if so many there be and this not out of any respect for the public -lrb- _ ie _ the person who might happen to purchase and look over the book -rrb- but from a hobby-horsical superstitious regard to my own feeling and sense of duty language be the sacred fire in this temple of humanity and the muse be its especial and vestal priestess though i can not prevent the vile drug and counterfeit frankincense which render its flame at once pitchy glowing and unsteady i would yet be no voluntary accomplice in the sacrilege with the commencement of a public commence the degradation of the good and the beautiful -- both fade and retire before the accidentally agreeable othello become a hollow lip-worship and the castle spectre or any more recent thing of froth noise and impermanence that may have overbillow it on the restless sea of curiosity be the _ true _ prayer of praise and admiration i think it right to state to you these opinion of mine that you might know that i think the translation of the faust a task demand -lrb- from _ I _ i mean -rrb- no ordinary effort -- and why this -- that it be painful very painful and even odious to I to attempt anything of a literary nature with any motive of _ pecuniary _ advantage but that i bow to the all-wise providence which have make I a _ poor _ man and therefore compel I by other duty inspiring feeling to bring _ even my intellect to the market _ and the finale be this i should like to attempt the translation if you will mention you term at once and irrevocably -lrb- for i be a idiot at bargaining and shrink from the very think -rrb- i will return a answer by the next post whether in my present circumstance i can or can not undertake it if i do i will do it immediately but i must have all goethe 's work which i can not procure in bristol for to give the faust without a preliminary critical essay would be worse than nothing as far as regard the public if you be to ask I as a friend whether i think it would suit _ the general taste _ i should reply that i can not calculate on caprice and accident -lrb- for instance some fashionable man or review happen to take it up favourably -rrb- but that otherwise my fear would be stronger than my hope man of genius will admire it of necessity those most who think deepest and most imaginatively the louisa would delight _ all _ of good heart i remain dear sir with due respect st coleridge to this letter mr murray reply as follow : _ john murray to mr coleridge _ _ August _ 29 1814 dear sir i feel greatly oblige by the favor of you attention to the request which i have solicit we friend mr robinson to make to you for the translation of goethe 's extraordinary drama of faust which i suspect that no one could do justice to besides yourself it will be the first attempt to render into classical english a german work of peculiar but certainly of unquestionable genius and you must allow that its effect upon the public must be doubtful i be desirous however of make the experiment and this i would not do under a less skilful agent than the one to whom i have apply i be no less anxious that you should receive as far as i think the thing can admit a fair remuneration and trust that you will not undertake it unless you feel disposed to execute the labor perfectly _ con amore _ and in a style of versification equal to remorse i venture to propose to you the sum of one hundred pound for the translation and the preliminary analysis with such passage translate as you may judge proper of the work of goethe with a copy of which i will have the pleasure of supply you as soon as i have you final determination the sum which i mention shall be pay to you in two month from the day on which you place the complete translation and analysis in my hand this will allow a reasonable time for you previous correction of the sheet through the press i shall be glad to hear from you by return of post if convenient as i propose to set out this week for the continent if this work succeed i be in hope that it will lead to many similar undertaking with sincere esteem i be dear sir you faithful servant j murray i should hope that it might not prove inconvenient to you to complete the whole for press in the course of November next mr coleridge reply as follow from the same address : _ mr coleridge to john murray _ _ August _ 31 1814 dear sir i have receive you letter consider the necessary labor and -lrb- from the questionable nature of the original work both as to its fair claim to fame -- the diction of the good and wise accord to unchanging principle -- and as to its chance for reputation as a accidental result of local and temporary taste -rrb- the risk of character on the part of the translator who will assuredly have to answer for any disappointment of the reader the term propose be humiliatingly low yet such as under modification i accede to i have receive testimonial from man not merely of genius accord to my belief but of the highest accredited reputation that my translation of wallenstein be in language and in metre superior to the original and the part most admire be substitution of my own on a principle of compensation yet the whole work go for waste-paper i be abuse -- nay my own remark in the preface be transfer to a review as the reviewer 's sentiment _ against _ I without even a hint that he have copy they from my own preface such be the fate of wallenstein and yet i dare appeal to any number of man of genius -- say for instance mr w scott mr southey mr wordsworth mr wilson mr sotheby sir g beaumont etc whether the wallenstein with all its defect -lrb- and it have grievous defect -rrb- be not worth all schiller 's other play put together but i wonder not it be _ too _ good and not good enough and the advice of the younger pliny : aim at please either _ all _ or _ the few _ be as prudentially good as it be philosophically accurate i write to mr longman before the work be publish and foretell its fate even to a detailed accuracy and advise he to put up with the loss from the purchase of the mss and of the translation as a much less evil than the publication i go so far as to declare that its success be in the state of public taste impossible that the enthusiastic admirer of the robber cabal and love etc would lay the blame on I and that he himself would suspect that if he have only light on _ another _ translator then etc everything take place as i have foretell even he own feeling -- so little do prophet gain from the fulfilment of they prophecy on the other hand though i know that execute as alone i can or dare do it -- that be to the utmost of my power -lrb- for which the intolerable pain nay the far greater toil and effort of do otherwise be a far safer pledge than any solicitude on my part concern the approbation of the public -rrb- the translation of so very difficult a work as the faustus will be most inadequately remunerate by the term you propose yet they very probably be the highest it may be worth you while to offer to _ I _ i say this as a philosopher for though i have now be much talk of and write of for evil and not for good but for suspect capability yet none of my work have ever sell the wallenstein go to the waste the remorse though act twenty time rest quietly on the shelf in the second edition with copy enough for seven year ' consumption or seven time seven i lose # 200 by the non-payment from forgetfulness and under various pretence by the friend -lrb- footnote : twenty-seven number of _ the friend _ be publish by coleridge at penrith in cumberland in 1809-10 but the periodical prove a failure principally from the irregularity of its appearance it be about this time that he be addict to opium-eating -rrb- and for my poem i _ do _ get from # 10 to # 15 and yet forsooth the _ quarterly review _ attack I for neglect and misuse my power i do not quarrel with the public -- all be as it must be -- but surely the public -lrb- if there be such a person -rrb- have no right to quarrel with _ I _ for not get into jail by publish what they will not read the faust you perhaps know be only a _ fragment _ whether goethe ever will finish it or whether it be ever he object to do so be quite unknown a large proportion of the work can not be render in blank verse but must be give in wild _ lyrical _ metre and mr lamb inform I that the baroness de stal have give a very unfavourable account of the work still however i will undertake it and that instantly so as to let you have the last sheet by the middle of November on the follow term : 1 that on the delivery of the last m sheet you remit 100 guinea to mr coleridge or mr robert southey at a bill of five week 2 that i or my widow or family may any time after two year from the first publication have the privilege of reprint it in any collection of all my poetical writings or of my work in general which set off with a life of I might perhaps be make profitable to my widow and 3rd that if -lrb- as i long ago meditate -rrb- i should re-model the whole give it a finale and be able to bring it thus re-written and re-cast on the stage it shall not be consider as a breach of the engagement between we i on my part promise that you shall for a equitable consideration have the copy of this new work either as a separate work or form a part of the same volume or both as circumstance may dictate to you when i say that i be confident that in this _ possible _ and not probable case i should not repeat or retain one fifth of the original you will perceive that i consult only my dread of appear to act amiss as it would be even more easy to compose the whole anew if these term suit you i will commence the task as soon as i receive goethe 's work from you if you could procure goethe 's late life of himself which extend but a short way or any german biographical work of the german live it would enable I to render the preliminary essay more entertaining respectfully dear sir st coleridge mr murray 's reply to this letter have not be preserve at all event nothing further be do by coleridge with respect to the translation of faust which be to be deplore as he exquisite and original melody of versification might have produce a translation almost as great as the original shortly after coleridge take up he residence with the gillman at highgate and he intercourse with murray recommence lord byron while on the managing committee of drury lane theater have be instrumental in get coleridge 's remorse play upon the stage as he entertain a great respect for its author he be now encouraging mr murray to publish other work by coleridge -- among other zapolya and christabel on April 12 1816 coleridge give the follow line to mr murray write in he own hand : -lrb- footnote : the song by glycine be first publish in zapolya : a christmas tale 1817 part ii act ii scene i it be set to music by w patten in 1836 and again with the title may song in 1879 by bh loehr -rrb- glycine : song a sunny shaft do i behold from sky to earth it slant and poi would therein a bird so bold -- sweet bird thou wert enchant he sink he rise he twinkle he troll would within that shaft of sunny mist : he eye of fire he beak of gold all else of amethyst and thus he sing : adieu adieu love 's dream prove seldom true sweet month of may we must away far far away today today in the follow month -lrb- may 8 1816 -rrb- mr coleridge offer mr murray he remorse for publication with a preface he also offer he poem of christabel still unfinished for the latter mr murray agree to give he seventy guinea until the other poem shall be complete when the copyright shall revert to the author and also # 20 for permission to publish the poem entitle kublum khan next month -lrb- June 6 -rrb- murray allow coleridge # 50 for a edition of zapolya : a christmas tale which be then in m and he also advance he another # 50 for a play which be still to be write zapolya be afterwards entrust to another publisher -lrb- rest fenner -rrb- and coleridge repay murray # 50 apparently -lrb- see _ letter _ of march 29 1817 -rrb- murray very kindly forewent repayment of the second advance of # 50 there be of course no obligation to excuse a just debt but the three issue of christabel have result in a net profit of a little over # 100 to the publisher _ mr coleridge to john murray _ highgate _ July _ 4 1816 i have often think that there might be set on foot a review of old book _ ie _ of all work important or remarkable the author of which be decease with a probability of a tolerable sale if only the original _ plan _ be a good one and if no article be admit but from man who understand and recognize the principle and rule of criticism which should form the first number i would not take the work chronologically but accord to the likeness or contrast of the _ kind _ of genius -- _ ex gr _ jeremy taylor milton -lrb- he prose work -rrb- and burke -- dante and milton -- scaliger and dr johnson secondly if especial attention be pay to all man who have produce or aid in produce any great revolution in the taste or opinion of a age as petrarch ulrich von hutten etc -lrb- here i will dare risk the charge of self-conceit by refer to my own parallel of voltaire and erasmus of luther and rousseau in the seventh number of the friend -rrb- lastly if proper care be take that in every number of the _ review _ there should be a fair proportion of positively _ amusing _ matter such as a review of paracelsus cardan old fuller a review of jest book trace the various metempsychosis of the same joke through all age and country a history of court fool for which a laborious german have furnish ample and highly interesting material foreign writer though alive not to be exclude if only they work be of established character in they own country and scarcely hear of much less translate in english literature jean paul richter would supply two or three delightful article any work which should fall in you way respect the jew since the destruction of the temple i should of course be glad to look through above all mezeray 's -lrb- no that be not the name i think -rrb- history of the jew that i _ must _ have i shall be impatient for the rest of mr frere 's sheet most unfeignedly can i declare that i be unable to decide whether the _ admiration _ which the _ excellence _ inspire or the wonder which the knowledge of the countless _ difficulty _ so happily overcome never cease to excite in my mind during the re-perusal and collation of they with the original greek be the greater i have not a moment 's hesitation in fix on mr frere as the man of the correctest and most genial taste among all we contemporary whom i have ever meet with personally or in they work should choice or chance lead you to sun and air yourself on highgate hill during any of you holiday excursion my worthy friend and he amiable and accomplished wife will be happy to see you we dine at four and drink tea at six yours dear sir respectfully st coleridge mr murray do not accept mr coleridge 's proposal to publish he work in a collect form or he article for the _ quarterly _ as appear from the follow letter : _ mr coleridge to john murray _ highgate _ march _ 26 1817 dear sir i can not be offend by you opinion that my talent be not adequate to the requisite of matter and manner for the _ quarterly review _ nor should i consider it as a disgrace to fall short of robert southey in any department of literature i owe however a honest gratification to the conversation between you and mr gillman for i read southey 's article on which mr gillman and i have it appear form very different opinion it be in my judgment a very masterly article -lrb- footnote : this must have be southey 's article on parliamentary reform in no 31 which though due in October 1816 be not publish until February 1817 -rrb- i would to heaven my dear sir that the opinion of southey walter scott lord byron mr frere and of man like these in learning and genius concern my comparative claim to be a man of letter be to be receive as the criterion instead of the wretched and in deed and in truth mystical jargon of the _ examiner _ and _ edinburgh review _ mr randall will be so good as to repay you the # 50 and i understand from mr gillman that you be willing to receive this as a settlement respect the zapolya the correction and addition to the two first book of the christabel may become of more value to you when the work be finish as i trust it will be in the course of the spring than they be at present and let it not be forget that while i have the utmost malignity of personal enmity to cry down the work with the exception of lord byron there be not

opinion of hunt as a critic but not as a politician write to walter scott in 1810 he say : _ john murray to mr scott _ have you get or see hunt 's critical essay prefix to a few novel that he edit lest you should not i send they hunt be most vilely wronghead in politics and have thereby be turn away from the path of elegant criticism which might have lead he to eminence and respectability hunt

through they common friend lord byron : _ john murray to lord byron _ _ December _ 27 1815 i wish you lordship to do I the favor to look at and to consider with you usual kindness the accompany note to mr leigh hunt respect he poem for which he request # 450 this would presuppose a sale of at least 10000 copy now if i may trust to my own experience in these matter i be by no means certain that the sale would do more than repay the expense of paper and print but the poem be peculiar and may be more successful than i imagine in which event the proposition which i have make to the author will secure to he all the advantage of such a result i trust that you will see in this a anxious desire to serve mr hunt although as a mere matter of business i can not avail myself of he offer i would have prefer call upon you today be i not confine by a temporary indisposition but i think you will not be displeased at a determination found upon the best judgment i can form of my own business i be really uneasy at you feeling in this affair but i think i may venture to assume that you know I sufficiently well to allow I to trust my decision entirely to you usual kindness _ john murray to mr leigh hunt _ _ December _ 27 1815 i have now read the m poem which you confide to I with particular attention and find that it differ so much from any that i have publish that i be fearful of venture upon the extensive speculation to which you estimate would carry it i therefore wish that you would propose its publication and purchase to such house as cadell longman baldwin mawman etc who be capable of become and likely to become purchaser and then should you not have find any arrangement to you mind i would undertake to print a edition of 500 or 750 copy as a trial at my own risk and give you one half of the profit after this edition the copyright shall be entirely you own property by this arrangement in case the work turn out a prize as it may do i mean that you should have every advantage of its success for its popularity once ascertain i be sure you will find no difficulty in procure purchaser even if you should be suspicious of my liberality from this specimen of fearfulness in the first instance i shall be most happy to assist you with any advice which my experience in these matter may render serviceable to you leigh hunt at once accept the offer after the poem be print and publish be press for money he wish to sell the copyright after a recitation of he pecuniary trouble hunt conclude a lengthy letter as follow : what i want to ask you then be simply this -- whether in the first instance you think well enough of the story of riminus to make you bargain with I for the copyright at once or in the second instance whether if you would rather wait a little as i myself would do i confess if it be convenient you have still enough hope of the work and enough reliance on myself personally to advance I # 450 on security to be repay in case you do not conclude the bargain or merge in the payment of the poem in case you do mr murray 's reply be not satisfactory as will be observe from the follow letter of leigh hunt : _ mr leigh hunt to john murray _ _ April _ 12 1816 dear sir i just write to say something which i have omit in my last and to add a word or two on the subject of a expression in you answer to it i mean the phrase plan of assistance i do not suppose that you have the slightest intention of mortifying I by that phrase but i should wish to impress upon you that i do not consider my application to you as come in the shape of what be ordinarily term a application for assistance circumstance have certainly compel I latterly to make request and resort to expedient which however proper in themselves i would not willingly have be acquaint with but i have very good prospects before I and you be mistaken -lrb- i beg you to read this in the best and most friendly tone you can present to yourself -rrb- if you have at all apprehend that i should be in the habit of apply to you for assistance or for anything whatsoever for which i do not conceive the work in question to be more than a security i can only say with regard to yourself that i be quite contented and ought to be so as long as you be sincere with I and treat I in the same gentlemanly tone very sincerely yours leigh hunt this negotiation be ultimately bring to a conclusion by mr hunt at mr murray 's suggestion dispose of the copyright of riminus to another publisher chapter xiii thoma campbell -- john cam hobhouse -- jw croker-jame hogg etc thomas campbell appear like a meteor as early as 1799 when in he twenty-second year he publish he pleasure of hope the world be take by surprise at the vigor of thought and richness of fancy display in the poem shortly after its publication campbell go to germany and see from the benedictine monastery of scottish monk at ratisbon a battle which be not as have often be say the battle of hohenlinden what he see however make a deep impression on he mind and on he return to scotland he publish the beautiful line begin on linden when the sun be low in 1801 he compose the exile of erin and ye mariner of england the battle of the baltic and lochiel 's warning follow and in 1803 he publish a edition of he poem to have compose such noble lyric be almost unprecedented in so young a man for he be only twenty-six year of age when he collect edition appear he be treat as a lion and become acquaint with walter scott and the lead man in edinburgh in December 1805 we find constable write to murray that longman & co have offer the young poet # 700 for a new volume of he poem one of the earliest result of the association of campbell with murray be a proposal to start a new magazine which murray have long contemplate this it will be observe be some year before the communication take place between walter scott and murray with respect to the starting of the _ quarterly _ the project magazine however drop out of sight and campbell revert to he propose life of the british poet with selection from they writings toward the close of the year he address the following letter to mr scott : _ mr t campbell to mr scott _ _ November 5 _ 1806 my dear scott a very excellent and gentlemanlike man -- albeit a bookseller -- murray of fleet street be willing to give for we joint life of the poet on the plan we propose to the trade a twelvemonth ago a thousand pound for my part i think the engagement very desirable and have no uneasiness on the subject except my fear that you may be too much engage to have to do with it as five hundred pound may not be to you the temptation that it appear to a poor devil like myself murray be the only gentleman except constable in the trade -- i may also perhaps except hood i have seldom see a pleasanter man to deal with we name be what murray principally want -- _ yours _ in particular i will not wish even in confidence to say anything ill of the london bookseller _ beyond they desert _ but i assure you that to compare this offer of murray 's with they usual offer it be magnanimous indeed the fall price of literature-which be get worse by the horrible complexion of the times-make I often rather gloomy at the life i be likely to lead scott enter into campbell 's agreement with kindness and promptitude and it be arrange under certain stipulation that the plan should have he zealous cooperation but as the number and importance of he literary engagement increase he decline to take a active part either in the magazine or the other undertaking i see campbell two day ago write murray to constable and he tell I that mr scott have decline and modestly ask if it would do by _ himself _ alone but this i decline in a way that do not leave we the less friend at length after many communication and much personal intercourse murray agree with campbell to bring out he work without the commanding name of walter scott and with the name of thoma campbell alone as editor of the selection from the british poet the arrangement seem to have be make towards the end of 1808 in January 1809 campbell write of he intention to devote a year exclusively to the work but the labor it involve be perhaps greater than he have anticipate it be he first important prose work and prose require continuous labor it can not like a piece of poetry be throw off at a heat while the fit be on campbell stop occasionally in the midst of he work to write poem among other he gertrude of wyome which confirm he poetical reputation murray send a copy of the volume to walter scott and request a review for the _ quarterly _ which be then in its first year what campbell thought of the review will appear from the follow letter : _ mr t campbell to john murray _ _ June 2 _ 1809 my dear murray i receive the review for which i thank you and beg leave through you to express my best acknowledgment to the unknown reviewer i do not by this mean to say that i think every one of he censure just on the contrary if i have a opportunity of personal conference with so candid and sensible a man i think i could in some degree acquit myself of a part of the fault he have find but altogether i be please with he manner and very proud of he approbation he review like a gentleman a christian and a scholar although the life of the poet have be promise within a year from January 1809 four year pass and the work be still far from completion in the meantime campbell undertake to give a course of eleven lecture on poetry at the royal institution for which he receive a hundred guinea he enrich he lecture with the remark and selection collect for the specimen for which the publisher have agree to pay a handsome sum the result be a momentary hesitation on the part of mr murray to risk the publication of the work on this say campbell 's biographer a correspondence ensue between the poet and the publisher which end to the satisfaction of both mr murray only request that mr campbell should proceed with greater alacrity in finish the long project work at length about the beginning of 1819 fourteen year after the project have be mention to walter scott and about ten year after the book should have appear accord to campbell 's original promise the essay and selection of english poetry be publish by mr murray the work be well receive the poet be duly pay for it and dr beattie campbell 's biographer say he find himself in the novel position of a man who have money to lay out at interest this statement must be receive with considerable deduction for as the correspondence show campbell 's pecuniary difficulty be by no means at a end it appear that besides the # 1000 which be double the sum originally propose to be pay to campbell for the selection mr murray in October 1819 pay he # 200 for book doubtless for those he have purchase for the collection and which he desire to retain we can not conclude this account of campbell 's deal with murray without refer to a often-quoted story which have for many year sail under false color it be thomas campbell who write now barabba be a publisher whether in a bible or otherwise be not authentically record and forward it to a friend but mr murray be not the publisher to whom it refer nor be lord byron as have be so frequently state the author of the joke the great burden of the correspondence entail by the _ quarterly review _ now fall on mr murray for gifford have become physically incapable of bear it like the creaking gate that hang long on its hinge gifford continue to live though painfully he become gradually better and in October 1816 mr murray present he with a chariot by means of which he might drive about and take exercise in the open air gifford answer : i have a thousand thanks to give you for the pain you have take about the carriage without which i should only have talk about it and die of a cold it come home yesterday and i go to fulham in it it be everything that i could wish neat easy and exceedingly comfortable among the other work publish by mr murray in 1816 may be mention the last reign of napoleon by mr john cam hobhouse afterwards lord broughton of this work the author write to mr murray : _ January _ 1816 i must have the liberty of cancel what sheet i please for a reason that i now tell you in the strictest confidence : the letter be to go to paris previously to publication and be to be read carefully through by a most intimate friend of mine who be entirely in the secret of the late imperial ministry and who will point out any statement as to fact in which he could from he _ knowledge _ make any necessary change the first edition publish without the author 's name be rapidly exhaust and hobhouse offer a second to murray propose at the same time to insert he name as author on the title-page if i do he say i shall present the book to lord byron in due form not for he talent as a poet but for he quality as a companion and a friend i should not write ` my dear byron ' _  la hunt _ -lrb- footnote : leigh hunt have dedicate he riminus to the noble poet address he as my dear byron -rrb- mr d'israelus also be busy with he inquiry into the literary and political character of jame the first he write to he publisher as follow : i be sorry to say every one to whom i have mention the subject revolt from it as a thing quite untenable and care nothing about ` jame ' this do not stop I from finish mr croker in the midst of he work at the admiralty he article for the _ quarterly _ and he other literary labor find time to write he story for child from the history of england in send the later story mr croker write to mr murray : _ the rt hon jw croker to john murray _ i send you seven story which with eleven you have before bring we down to richard iii and as i do not intend to come down beyond the revolution there remain nine story still i think you tell I that you give the first story to you little boy to read perhaps you or mr murray would be so kind as to make a mark over against such word as he may not have understand and to favor I with any criticism the child may have make for on this occasion i should prefer a critic of 6 year old to one of 60 thus john murray 's son john murray the third be early initiate into the career of read for the press when the book come out it achieve a great success and set the model for walter scott in he charming tale of a grandfather it may be mention that croker 's story for child be publish on the system of division of profit long after when mr murray be in correspondence with a author who wish he to pay a sum of money down before he have even see the manuscript the publisher recommend the author to publish he book on a division of profit in like manner as hallam milman mahon croker and other have do under this system he say i have be very successful for mr croker 's ` story from the history of england ' sell for 2_s _ _ 6d _ if i have offer the small sum of twenty guinea he would have think it liberal however i print it to divide profit and he have already receive from I the moiety of # 1400 you will perhaps be startle at my assertion for woeful experience convince I that not more than one publication in fifty have a sale sufficient to defray its expense the success of scott 's and still more of byron 's poem call into existence about this time a vast array of would-be poet male and female and from all rank and profession some write for fame some for money but all be agree on one point -- namely that if mr murray would undertake the publication of the poem the author ' fame be secure when in doubt about any manuscript he usually confer with croker campbell or gifford who always display the utmost kindness in help he with they opinion croker be usually short and pithy of one poem he say : trash -- the dullest stuff i ever read this be enough to ensure the condemnation of the manuscript campbell be more guard as when report on a poem entitle woman he write in my opinion though there be many excellent line in it the poem be not such as will warrant a great sum be speculate upon it but as it be short i think the public not the author or publisher will be in fault if it do not sell one edition of a poem send for he opinion gifford write : honestly the m be totally unfit for the press do not deceive yourself : this m be not the production of a male a man may write as great nonsense as a woman and even greater but a girl may pass through those execrable abode of ignorance call board school without learn whether the sun set in the east or in the west whereas a boy can hardly do this even at parson 's green jame hogg the ettrick shepherd be another of murray 's correspondent the publication of the queen 's wake in 1813 immediately bring hogg into connection with the lead author and publisher of the day hogg send a copy of the volume to lord byron he brother poet whose influence he desire to enlist on behalf of a work which hogg wish murray to publish the poem which the ettrick shepherd refer to be the pilgrim of the sun and the result of lord byron 's conversation with mr murray be that the latter undertake to publish hogg 's work the first letter from he to murray December 26 1814 begin : what the deuce have you make of my excellent poem that you be never publish it while i be starve for want of money and can not even afford a christmas goose to my friend to this and many similar enquiry mr murray reply on April 10 1815 : my dear friend i entreat you not to ascribe to inattention the delay which have occur in my answer to you kind and interesting letter much more i beg you not for a moment to entertain a doubt about the interest which i take in you writings or the exertion which i shall ever make to promote they sale and popularity they be sell every day i have forget to tell you that gifford tell I that he would receive with every disposition to favor it any critique which you like to send of new scottish work if i have be aware of it in time i certainly would have invite you remark on manner we article be not good and we praise be by no means adequate i allow but i suspect you very greatly overrate the novel meg merrily be worthy of shakespeare but all the rest of the novel might have be write by scott 's brother or any other body the next letter from the shepherd thanks murray for some timeous aid and ask a novel favor _ may _ 7 1815 i leave edinburgh on Thursday for my little farm on yarrow i will have a confused summer for i have as yet no home that i can dwell in but i hope by-and-by to have some fine fun there with you fishing in saint mary 's loch and the yarrow eating bull-trout singing song and drinking whisky this little possession be what i stand much in need of -- a habitation among my native hill be what of all the world i desire and if i have a little more money at command i would just be as happy a man as i know of but that be a article of which i be ever in want i wish you or mr murray would speer I out a good wife with a few thousand i dare say there be many a romantic girl about london who would think it a fine ploy to become a yarrow shepherdess believe I dear murray very sincerely yours jame hogg here for the present we come to a end of the shepherd 's letter but we shall find he turn up again and mr murray still continue he devoted friend and adviser chapter xiv lord byron 's dealings with mr murray -- continue _ on January 2 1815 lord byron be marry to miss milbanke and during the honeymoon while he be reside at seaham the residence

good action be to put to instant death a hundred of they priest whom he suspect of intrigue against he not aware of he summary justice they send a deputation to beg the life of these people on the

hour he ask lord ebrington of which party he be in politics the opposition the opposition then can you lordship tell I the reason why the opposition be so unpopular in england with something like presence of mind on so delicate a question lord ebrington instantly reply : because sir we always insist upon it that you would be successful in spain during the spring and summer of 1815 byron be a frequent visitor at albemarle street and in April as have be already record he first meet walter scott in murray 's drawing-room in march lord and lady byron take up they residence at 13 piccadilly terrace the follow letter be undated but be probably write in the autumn of 1815 _ john murray to lord byron _ my lord i pick up the other day some of napoleon 's own write paper all the remainder of which have be burn it have he portrait and eagle as you will perceive by hold a sheet to the light either of sun or candle : so i think i would take a little for you hope that you will just write I a

increase and demand immediate settlement he first thought be to part with he book though they do not form a very valuable collection he mention the matter to a book collector who confer with other dealer on the subject the circumstance come to the ear of mr murray he at once communicate with lord byron and forward he a cheque for # 1500 with the assurance that a equal sum should be at he service in the course of a few week offer at the same time to dispose of all the copyright of he poem for he lordship 's use lord byron could not fail to be affect by this generous offer and whilst return the cheque he write : _ November _ 14 1815 you present offer be a favor which i would accept from you if i accept such from any man the circumstance which induce I to part with my book though sufficiently be not _ immediately _ press i have make up my mind to this and there be a end have i be dispose to trespass upon you kindness in this way it would have be before now but i be not sorry to have a opportunity of decline it as it set my opinion of you and indeed of human nature in a different light from that in which i have be accustom to consider it meanwhile lord byron have complete he siege of corinth and parisina and send the packet contain they to mr murray they have be copy in the legible hand of lady byron on receive the poem mr murray write to lord byron as follow : _ john murray to lord byron _ _ December _ 1815 my lord i tear open the packet you send I and have find in it a pearl it be very interesting pathetic beautiful -- do you know i would almost say moral i be really write to you before the billow of the passion you excite have subside i have be most agreeably disappointed -lrb- a word i can not associate with the poem -rrb- at the story which -- what you hint to I and write -- have alarm I and i should not have read it aloud to my wife if my eye have not trace the delicate hand that transcribe it mr murray enclose to lord byron two note amount to a thousand guinea for the copyright of the poem but lord byron refuse the note declare that the sum be too great you offer he answer -lrb- January 3 1816 -rrb- be _ liberal _ in the extreme and much more than the poem can possibly be worth but i can not accept it and will not you be most welcome to they as addition to the collect volume without any demand or expectation on my part whatever i be very glad that the handwriting be a favourable omen of the _ morale _ of the piece but you must not trust to that as my copyist would write out anything i desire in all the ignorance of innocence -- i hope however in this instance with no great peril to either the money therefore which murray think the copyright of the siege of corinth and parisina be worth remain untouched in the publisher 's hand it be afterwards suggest by mr roger and sir jame mackintosh to lord byron that a portion of it -lrb- # 600 -rrb- might be apply to the relief of mr godwin the author of a enquiry into political justice who be then in difficulty and lord byron himself propose that the remainder should be divide between mr maturin and mr coleridge this proposal cause the deepest vexation to mr murray who make the follow remonstrance against such a proceeding _ john murray to lord byron _ albemarle street _ Monday _ 4 o'clock my lord i do not like to detain you this morning but i confess to you that i come away impressed with a belief that you have already reconsider this matter as it refer to I -- you lordship will pardon I if i can not avoid look upon it as a species of cruelty after what have pass to take from I so large a sum -- offer with no reference to the marketable value of the poem but out of personal friendship and gratitude alone -- to cast it away on the wanton and ungenerous interference of those who can not enter into you lordship 's feeling for I upon person who have so little claim upon you and whom those who so interested themselves might more decently and honestly enrich from they own fund than by endeavor to be liberal at the cost of another and by forcibly resume from I a sum which you have generously and nobly resign i be sure you will do I the justice to believe that i would strain every nerve in you service but it be actually heartbreaking to throw away my earnings on other i be no rich man abound like mr roger in superfluous thousand but work hard for independence and what would be the most grateful pleasure to I if likely to be useful to you personally become merely painful if it cause I to work for other for whom i can have no such feeling this be a most painful subject for I to address you upon and i be ill able to express my feeling about it i commit they entirely to you liberal construction with a reference to you knowledge of my character i have the honor to be etc john murray this letter be submit to gifford before it be despatch and he write : _ mr gifford to john murray _ i have make a scratch or two and the letter now express my genuine sentiment on the matter but should you not see roger it be evident that lord byron be a little awkward about this matter and he officious friend have get he into a most _ unlordly _ scrape from which they can only relieve he by tread back they step the more i consider they conduct the more i be astonish at they impudence a downright robbery be honorable to it if you see roger do not be shy to speak : he tremble at report and here be a evil one for he in the end lord byron be compel by the increase pressure of he debt to accept the sum offer by murray and use it for he own purpose it be not necessary here to touch upon the circumstance of lord byron 's separation from he wife suffice it to say that early in 1816 he determine to leave england and resolve as he have before contemplated do to sell off he book and furniture he commit the arrangement to mr murray through mr hanson he solicitor in bloomsbury square a few month before when lord byron be in strait for money mr hanson communicate with mr murray as follow : _ mr hanson to john murray _ _ November _ 23 1815 mr hanson 's compliment to mr murray he have see lord byron and he lordship have no objection

stand have much better be sell at once by public auction i wish to see you to-morrow to return you bill for they which thank heaven be neither due nor pay _ that _ part so far as _ you _ be concern be settle -lrb- which it can be and shall be when i see you tomorrow -rrb- i have no further delicacy about the matter this be about the tenth execution in as many month so i be pretty well hardened but it be fit i should pay the forfeit of my forefather ' extravagance as well as my own and whatever my fault may be i suppose they will be pretty well expiate in time -- or eternity a letter be next receive by mr murray 's solicitor mr turner from mr gunn to the following effect : _ mr gunn to mr turner _ _ march _ 16 1816 sir mr constable the plaintiff 's attorney have write to say he will

conversation with you friend buonaparte at st helena amusing but scarce worth send lord holland have just put forth a very improve edition of the life of lope de vega and inez de castro ' gifford 's ` ben jonson ' have put to death all former edition and be very much like at mr murray 's earnest request scott have consent to review the third canto of childe harold in the _ quarterly _ in forwarding the m he write as follow : _ mr scott to john murray _ edinburgh _ January _ 10 1817 my dear sir i have this day send under croker 's cover a review of lord byron 's last poem you know how high i hold he poetical reputation but besides one be naturally force upon so many point of delicate consideration that really i have begin and leave off several time and after all send the article to you with full power to cancel it if you think any part of it have the least chance of hurt he feeling you know he better than i do and you also know the public and be aware that to make any successful impression on they the critic must appear to speak with perfect freedom i trust i have not abuse this discretion i be sure i have not mean to do so and yet during lord byron 's absence and under the present circumstance i should feel more grieved than at anything that ever befall I if there should have slip from my pen anything capable of give he pain there be some thing in the critique which be necessarily and unavoidably personal and sure i be if he attend to it which be unlikely he will find advantage from do so i wish mr gifford and you would consider every word carefully if you think the general tenor be likely to make any impression on he if you think it likely to hurt he either in he feeling or with the public in god 's name fling the sheet in the fire and let they be as _ not write _ but if it appear i should wish he to get a early copy and that you would at the same time say i be the author at you opportunity no one can honor lord byron a genius more than i do and no one have so great a wish to love he personally though personally we have not the means of become very intimate in he family distress -lrb- deeply to be deprecate and in which probably he can yet be excuse -rrb- i still look to some moment of reflection when bad adviser -lrb- and except you be one i have hear of few whom i should call good -rrb- be distant from the side of one who be so much the child of feeling and emotion a opportunity be once afford I of interfere but thing appear to I to have go too far yet even after all i wish i have try it for lord byron always seem to give I credit for wish he sincerely well and know I to be superior to what commodore trunnion would call the trash of literary envy and petty rivalry lord byron 's opinion of the article form so necessary a complement to walter scott 's sympathetic criticism of the man and the poet that we make no excuse for reproduce it as convey in a letter to mr murray -lrb- march 3 1817 -rrb- in acknowledge the arrival of the article from the _ quarterly _ which i receive two day ago i can not express myself better than in the word of my sister augusta who -lrb- speaking of it -rrb- say that it be write in a spirit ` of the most feeling and kind nature ' it be however something more it seem to I -lrb- as far as the subject of it may be permit to judge -rrb- to be very well write as a composition and i think will do the journal no discredit because even those who condemn its partiality must praise its generosity the temptation to take another and a less favourable view of the question have be so great and numerous that what with public opinion politics etc he must be a gallant as well as a good man who have venture in that place and at this time to write such a article even anonymously such thing however be they own reward and i even flatter myself that the writer whoever he may be -lrb- and i have no guess -rrb- will not regret that the perusal of this have give I as much gratification as any composition of that nature could give and more than any have give -- and i have have a good many in my time of one kind or the other it be not the mere praise but there be a _ tact _ and a _ delicacy _ throughout not only with regard to I but to _ other _ which as it have not be observe _ elsewhere _ i have till now doubt whether it could be observe _ anywhere _ when i tell you lord byron write to moore a week later that walter scott be the author of the article in the _ quarterly _ you will agree with I that such a article be still more honorable to he than to myself we conclude this episode with the following passage from a letter from scott to murray : i be truly happy lord byron 's article meet you idea of what may make some impression on he mind in genius poetry have seldom have he equal and if he have act very wrong in some respects he have be no worse than half the man of he rank in london who have do the same and be not speak of because not worth be rail against lady byron also write to mr murray : i be incline to ask a question which i hope you will not decline answer if not contrary to you engagement who be the author of the review of childe harold in the _ quarterly

hand i would have have a wreath round the brow but the poet be afraid of be mistake for a king or a conqueror and he pride or modesty make he forbid the band however when the marble come to england i shall place a golden laurel round it in the ancient style and if it be think good enough suffix the follow inscription which may serve at least to tell the name of the portrait and allude to the excellence of the artist which very few lapidary inscription do ` in vain would flattery steal a wreath from fame and rome 's best sculptor only half succeed if england own no share in byron 's name

give it to master southey and he shall have more before i have do with he you may make what i say here as public as you please more particularly to southey whom i look upon -- and will say so publicly-to be a dirty lie rascal and will prove it in ink -- or in he blood if i do not believe he to be too much of a poet to risk it if he have forty review at he back as he have the _ quarterly _

southey _ whom i have never oblige in any sort of way or do he the remotest service should go about fib and calumniate be more than i readily comprehend do he think to put I down with he _ cant _ not be able to do it with he poetry we will try the question i have read he review of hunt where he have attack shelley in a oblique and shabby manner do he know what that review have do i will tell you it have _ sell _ a edition of the revolt of islam which otherwise nobody would have think of reading and few who read can understand i for one southey would have attack I too there if he dare further than by hint about hunt 's friend in general and some outcry about a epicurean system carry on by man of the most opposite habit and taste and opinion in life and poetry -lrb- i believe -rrb- that ever have they name in the same volume -- moore byron shelley hazlitt haydon leigh hunt lamb what resemblance do ye find among all or any of these man and how could any sort of system or plan be carry on or attempt amongst they however let mr southey look to himself since the wine be tap he shall drink it i get some book a few week ago -- many thanks amongst they be israeli 's new edition it be not fair in you to show he my copy of he former one with all the marginal note and nonsense make in greece when i be not two-and-twenty and which certainly be not mean for he perusal nor for that of he reader i have a great respect for israeli and he talent and have read he work over and over and over repeatedly and be amuse by they greatly and instruct often besides i hate give pain unless provoke and he be a author and must feel like he brethren and although he liberality repay my marginal flippancy with a compliment -- the highest compliment -- that do not reconcile I to myself -- nor to _ you _ it be a breach of confidence to do this without my leave i do not know a living man 's book i take up so often or lay down more reluctantly than israeli 's and i never will forgive you -- that be for many week if he have get out of humor i should have be less sorry but even then i should have be sorry but really he have heap he coal of fire so handsomely upon my head that they burn unquenchably you ask I of the two review -lrb- footnote : of childe harold in the _ quarterly _ and _ blackwood _ -rrb- -- i will tell you scott 's be the review of one poet on another -- he friend wilson 's the review of a poet too on another -- he _ idol _ for he like I better than he choose to avow to the public with all he eulogy i speak judge only from the article for i do not know he personally here be a long letter -- can you read it yours ever b in the course of September 1818 lord byron communicate to mr moore that he have finish the first canto of a poem in the style and manner of beppo it be call he say ` don juan ' and be mean to be a little quietly facetious upon everything but he add i doubt whether it be not -- at least so far as it have yet go -- too free for these very modest day in January 1819 lord byron request mr murray to print for private distribution fifty copy of don juan mr murray urge he to occupy himself with some great work worthy of he reputation this you have promise to gifford long ago and to hobhouse and kinnaird since lord byron however continue to write out he don juan and send the second canto in April 1819 together with the letter of julium to be insert in the first canto mr murray in acknowledge the receipt of the first and second canto be not so congratulatory as he have formerly be the verse contain no doubt some of the author 's finest poetry but he have some objection to suggest i think he say you may modify or substitute other word for the line on romilly whose death should save he but byron entertain a extreme detestation for romilly because he say he have be one of my assassin and have sacrifice he on he legal altar and the verse -lrb- footnote : st 16 first canto -rrb- be allow to stand over you history write murray of the plan of the progress of ` don juan ' be very entertaining but i be clear for send he to hell because he may favor we with a description of some of the character whom he find there mr murray suggest the removal of some offensive word in canto ii these he say lady may not read the shipwreck be a little too particular and out of proportion to the rest of the picture but if you do anything it must be do with extreme caution think of the effect of such seductive poetry it probably surpass in talent anything that you ever write tell I if you think seriously of complete this work or if you have sketch the story i be very sorry to have occasion you the trouble of write again the letter of julium but you be always very forgiving in such case the line in which the objectionable word appear be obliterate by lord byron from the follow letter we see that mr murray continue he remonstrance : _ john murray to lord byron _ _ may 3 _ 1819 i find that ` julium 's letter ' have be safely receive and be with the printer the whole remainder of the second canto will be send by Friday 's post the inquiry after its appearance be not a few pray use you most tasteful discretion so as to wrap up or leave out certain approximation to indelicacy mr dougla kinnaird who be entrust with the business portion of this transaction write to mr murray : _ mr dougla kinnaird to john murray _ _ June 7 _ 1819 my dear sir since i have the pleasure of see you i have receive from lord byron a letter in which he express himself as have leave to mr hobhouse and myself the sole and whole discretion and duty of settle with the publisher of the mss which be now in you hand the consideration to be give for they observe that you have advertise mazeppa i feel that it be my duty to request you will name a early day -- of course previous to you publishing that or any other part of the mss -- when we may meet and receive you offer of such term as you may deem proper for the purchase of the copyright of they the very liberal footing on which lord byron 's intercourse with you in you character of publisher of he lordship 's work have hitherto be place leave no doubt in my mind that we interview need be but very short and that the term you will propose will be meet by we assent the party meet and mr murray agree to give # 525 for mazeppa and # 1575 for the first and second canto of don juan with the ode to venice throw in in accordance with lord byron 's direction to he publisher to keep the anonymous canto i and ii of don juan appear in london in quarto in July 1819 without the name of either author publisher or bookseller the book be immediately pounce upon by the critic but it be unnecessary to quote they review as they be impartially give in the latest accredited edition of lord byron 's poem a few criticism from mr murray 's private correspondence may be give _ mr gifford to john murray _ ryde _ July _ 1 1819 lord b 's letter be shockingly amusing -lrb- footnote : probably that write in may print in the life -rrb- he must be mad but then there be method in he madness i dread however the end he be or rather might be the most extraordinary character of he age i have live to see three great man -- man to whom none come near in they respective province -- pitt nelson wellington morality and religion would have place we friend among they as the fourth boast of the time even a decent respect for the good opinion of mankind might have do much now but all be tend to displace he mr murray who be still in communication with mr blackwood find that he refuse to sell don juan because it contain personality which he regard as even more objectionable than those of which murray have complain in the _ magazine _ when the copyright of don juan be infringe by other publisher it become necessary to take step to protect it at law and mr sharon turner be consult on the subject a injunction be apply for in chancery and the course of the negotiation will be best ascertain from the follow letter : _ mr sharon turner to john murray _ _ October _ 21 1819 dear murray on don juan i have much apprehension i have from the beginning and therefore advise the separate assignment the counsel who be settle the bill also doubt if the chancellor will sustain the injunction i think when mr bell come to town it will be best to have a consultation with he on the subject the counsel mr loraine shall state to he he view on the subject and you shall hear what mr bell feel upon it shall i appoint the consultation the evil if not stop will be great it will circulate in a cheap form very extensively injure society wherever it spread yet one consideration strike I you could wish lord byron to write less objectionably you may also wish he to return you part of the # 1625 if the chancellor should dissolve the injunction on this ground that will show lord b that he must expect no more copyright money for such thing and that they be too bad for law to uphold will not this affect he mind and purify he pen it be true that to get this good result you must encounter the risk and expense of the injunction and of the argument upon it will you do this if i lay the case separately before three of we ablest counsel and they concur in as many opinion that it could not be support would this equally affect he lordship 's mind and also induce he to return you a adequate proportion of the purchase money perhaps nothing but the court treat he as it treat southey -lrb- footnote : in the case of wat tyler see murray 's letter to byron in precede chapter April 12 1817 -rrb- may sufficiently impress lord b after the consultation with bell you will better judge shall i get it appoint as soon as he come to town ever yours faithfully sharon turner mr bell give he opinion that the court would not afford protection to the book he admit however that he have not have time to study it the next letter relate to the opinion of mr shadwell afterwards vice-chancellor : _ mr sharon turner to john murray _ _ November _ 12 1819 dear murray i see mr shadwell to-day on don juan he have go through the book with more attention than mr bell have time to do he desire I to say that he do not think the chancellor would refuse a injunction or would overturn it if obtain yours most faithfully sharon turner in the event the injunction to restrain the publication of don juan by piratical publisher be grant towards the end of 1819 byron thought of return to england on November 8 he write to mr murray : if she -lrb- the countess guicciolus -rrb- and she husband make it up you will perhaps see I in england sooner than you expect if not i will retire with she to france or america change my name and lead a quiet provincial life if she get over this and i get over my tertian ague i will perhaps look in at albemarle street _ en passant _ to bolivar when mr hobhouse then live at ramsbury hear of byron 's intention to go to south america he write to mr murray as follow : to be sure it be impossible that lord b should seriously contemplate or if he do he must not expect we to encourage this mad scheme i do not know what in the world to say but presume some one have be talk nonsense to he let jim perry go to venezuela if he will -- he may edit he ` independent gazette ' amongst the independent themselves and reproduce he stale pun and politics without let or hindrance but we poet be too good for a planter -- too good to sit down before a fire make of mare 's leg to a dinner of beef without salt and bread it be the wildest of all he meditation -- pray tell he the plague and yellow jack and famine and free quarter besides a thousand other ill will stare he in the face no tooth-brush no corn-rubber no _ quarterly review _ in short plenty of all he abominate and nothing of all he love i shall write but you can tell fact which will be better than my argument byron 's half-formed intention be soon abandon and the countess guicciolus 's serious illness recall he to ravenna where he remain for the next year and a half hobhouse 's next letter to murray -lrb- January 1820 -rrb- in which he report bad news from ravenna -- a great pity indeed be dated _ newgate _ where he have be lodge in consequence of he pamphlet entitle a trifling mistake in thoma lord erskine 's recent pamphlet contain several very strong reflection on the house of common as then constitute during he imprisonment mr hobhouse be visit by mr murray and ugo foscolo as well as by many of he political friend lady caroline lamb also write to mr murray from brockett hall ask for information about byron and hobhouse _ lady caroline lamb to john murray _ you have never write to tell I about he now do you know the pain and agony this have give I you have not be so remiss if you could come here on Wednesday for one night i have a few people and a supper you could come by the mail in two hour much swifter than even in you swift carriage and i have one million of thing to say and ask also do tell I how that dear radical hob be and pray remember I to he i really hope you will be here at dinner or supper on Wednesday you bedroom shall be ready and you can be back in town before most people be up though i rise here at seven yours quite disturbed my mind for want of you tell I how he -lrb- byron -rrb- look what he say if he be grow fat if he be no uglier than he use to be if he be good-humoured or cross-grained put he brow down -- if he hair curl or be straight as somebody say if he have see hobhouse if he be go to stay long if you go to dover as you intend and a great deal more which if you have the smallest tact or aught else you would have write long ago for as to I i shall certainly not see he neither do i care he should know that i ever ask after he it be from mere curiosity i should like to hear all you can tell I about he pray come here immediately yours cl notwithstanding the remarkable sale of don juan murray hesitate about publish any more of the canto after the fifth canto be publish lord byron inform murray that it be hardly the beginning of the work that he intend to take don juan through the tour of europe put he through the divorce court and make he finish as anacharsis clootz in the french revolution besides be influence by he own feeling it be possible that the follow letter of mr croker may have induce mr murray to have nothing further to do with the work : _ mr croker to john murray _ munster house _ march _ 26 1820 _ a rainy Sunday _ dear murray i have to thank you for let I see you two new canto -lrb- the 3rd and 4th -rrb- which i return what sublimity what levity what boldness what tenderness what majesty what trifling what variety what _ tediousness _ -- for tedious to a strange degree it must be confess that whole passage be particularly the earlier stanza of the fourth canto i know no man of such general power of intellect as brougham yet i think _ he _ insufferably tedious and i fancy the reason to be that he have such _ facility _ of expression that he be never recall to a _ selection _ of he thought a more costive orator would be oblige to choose and a man of he talent could not fail to choose the best but the power of utter all and everything which pass across he mind tempt he to say all he go on without think -- i should rather say without pause he speech be poor from they richness and dull from they infinite variety a impediment in he speech would make he a perfect demosthene something of the same kind and with something of the same effect be lord byron 's wonderful fertility of thought and facility of expression and the protean style of don juan instead of checking -lrb- as the fetter of rhythm generally do -rrb- he natural activity not only give he wider limit to range in but even generate a more roving disposition i dare swear if the truth be know that he digression and repetition generate one another and that the happy jingle of some of he comical rhyme have lead he on to episode of which he never originally think and thus it be that with the most extraordinary merit _ merit of all kind _ these two canto have be to _ I _ in several point tedious and even obscure as to the principle all the world and you mr murray _ first of all _ have do this poem great injustice there be levity here and there more than good taste approve but nothing to make such a terrible rout about -- nothing so bad as tom jone nor within a hundred degree of count fathom the writer go on to remark that the personality in the poem be more to be deprecate than its imputed looseness of principle : i mean some expression of political and personal feeling which i believe he in fact never feel and throw in wantonly and _ de gaiet de coeur _ and which he would have omit advisedly and _ de bont de coeur _ if he have not be goad by indiscreet contradictory and urgent _ criticism _ which in some case be dark enough to be call _ calumny _ but these be blow over if not blow over and i can not but think that if mr gifford or some friend in whose taste and disinterestedness lord byron could rely be to point out to he the cruelty to individual the injury to the national character the offence to public taste and the injury to he own reputation of such passage as those about southey and waterloo and the british government and the head of that government i can not but hope and believe that these blemish in the first canto would be wipe away in the next edition and that some that occur in the two canto -lrb- which you send I -rrb- would never see the light what interest can lord byron have in be the poet of a party in politics in politics he can not be what he appear or rather what messr hobhouse and leigh hunt wish to make he appear a man of he birth a man of he taste a man of he talent a man of he habit can have nothing in common with such miserable creature as we now call _ radical _ of whom i know not that i can better express the illiterate and blind ignorance and vulgarity than by say that the best inform of they have probably never hear of lord byron no no lord byron may be indulgent to these jackal follower of he he may connive at they use of he name -- nay it be not to be deny that he have give they too too much countenance -- but he never can i should think now that he see not only the road but the rate they be go continue to take a part so contrary to all he own interest and feeling and to the feeling and interest of all the respectable part of he country but what be to be the end of all this rigmarole of mine to conclude this -- to advise you for you own sake as a tradesman for lord byron 's sake as a poet for the sake of good literature and good principle which ought to be unite to take such measure as you may be able to venture upon to get lord byron to revise these two canto and not to make another step in the odious path which hobhouse beckon he to pursue yours ever jw croker but byron would alter nothing more in he don juan he accept the correction of gifford in he tragedy but don juan be never submit to he hobhouse be occasionally apply to because he know lord byron 's handwriting but even he suggestion of alteration or correction of don juan be in most case decline and moreover about this time a slight coolness have spring up between he and byron when hobhouse be stand for westminster with sir franci burdett lord byron send a song about he in a letter to mr murray it run to the tune of my boy tammy o who be now the people 's man my boy hobby o yourself and burdett gentleman and blackguard hunt and cobby o when to the mob you make a speech my boy hobby o how do you keep without they reach the watch without you fobby o -lrb- footnote : the rest of the song be print in _ murray 's magazine _ no 3 -rrb- lord byron ask murray to show the song not only to some of he friend -- who get it by heart and have it print in the newspaper -- but also to hobhouse himself i know say he lordship that he will never forgive I but i really have no patience with he for let himself be put in quod by such a set of ragamuffin mr hobhouse however be angry with byron for he lampoon and with murray for show it to he friend he accordingly write the following letter which contain some interesting particulars of the whig club at cambridge in byron 's university day : _ mr hobhouse to john murray _ 2 hanover square _ November _ 1820 i have receive you letter and return to you lord byron 's i shall tell you very frankly because i think it much better to speak a little of a man to he face than to say a great deal about he behind he back that i think you have not treat I as i deserve nor as might have be expect from that friendly intercourse which have subsist between we for so many year have lord byron transmit to I a lampoon on you i should if i know myself at all either have put it into the fire without delivery or should have send it at once to you i should not have give it a circulation for the gratification of all the small wit at the great and little house where no treat be so agreeable as to find a man laughing at he friend in this case the whole coterie of the very shabbiest party that ever disgrace and divide a nation -- i mean the whig -- be i know chuckle over that silly charge make by mr lamb on the hustings and now confirm by lord byron of my have belong to a whig club at cambridge such a whig as i then be i be now i have no notion that the name imply selfishness and subserviency and desertion of the most important principle for the sake of the least important interest i have no notion that it imply anything more than a attachment to the principle the ascendency of which expel the stuart from the throne lord byron belong to this cambridge club and desire I to scratch out he name on account of the criticism in the _ edinburgh review _ on he early poem but exercise my discretion on the subject i do not erase he name but reconcile he to the say whig the member of the club be but few and with those who have any marked politics amongst they i continue to agree at this day they be but ten and you must know most of they -- mr w ponsonby mr george o'callaghan the duke of devonshire mr dominick browne mr henry pearce mr kinnaird lord tavistock lord ellenborough lord byron and myself i be not as lord byron say in the song the founder of this club -lrb- footnote : but when we at cambridge be my boy hobbie o if my memory do not err you found a whig clubbie o -rrb- on the contrary thinking myself of mighty importance in those day i recollect very well that some difficulty attend my consent to belong to the club and i have by I a letter from lord tavistock in which the distinction between be a whig _ party _ man and a revolution whig be strongly insist upon i have trouble you with this detail in consequence of lord byron 's charge which he who despise and defy and have lampoon the whig all round only invent out of wantonness and for the sake of annoying I -- and he have certainly succeed thanks to you circulate this filthy ballad as for he lordship 's vulgar notion about the _ mob _ they be very fit for the poet of the _ morning post _ and for nobody else nothing in the ballad annoy I but the charge about the cambridge club because nothing else have the semblance of truth and i own it have hurt I very much to find lord byron play into the hand of the holland house sycophant for whom he have himself the most sovereign contempt and whom in other day i myself have try to induce he to tolerate i shall say no more on this unpleasant subject except that by a letter which i have just receive from lord byron i think he be ashamed of he song i shall certainly speak as plainly to he as i have take the liberty to do to you on this matter he be very wanton and you very indiscreet but i trust neither one nor the other mean mischief and there be a end of it do not aggravate matter by tell how much i have be annoyed lord byron have send I a list of he new poem and some prose all of which he request I to prepare for the press for he the monied arrangement be to be make by mr kinnaird when you be ready for I the material may be send to I at this place where i have take up my abode for the season i remain very truly yours john cam hobhouse towards the end of 1820 lord byron write a long letter to mr murray on mr bowle 's stricture on the life and writings of pope it be a subject perhaps unworthy of he pen but be a ardent admirer of pope he think it he duty to bowl he -lrb- bowle -rrb- down i mean to lay about I say byron like a dragon till i make manure of bowle for the top of parnassus after some revision the first and second letter to bowle be publish and be well receive the tragedy of sardanapalus the last three act of which have be write in a fortnight be despatch to murray on may 30 1821 and be within a few week follow by the two foscarus : a historical tragedy -- which have be compose within a month -- and on September 10 by cain a mystery the three drama sardanapalus the two foscarus and cain a mystery be publish together in December 1821 and mr murray pay lord byron for they the sum of # 2710 cain be dedicate by he consent to sir walter scott who in write to mr murray describe it as a very grand and tremendous drama on its first appearance it be reprint in a cheap form by two bookseller under the impression that the court of chancery would not protect it and it therefore become necessary to take out a injunction to restrain these piratical publisher the case come before lord chancellor eldon on February 9 mr shadwell mr spence and sergeant copley be retain by mr murray and after considerable discussion the injunction be refuse the lord chancellor intimate that the publisher must establish he right to the publication at law and obtain the decision of a jury on which he would grant the injunction require this be do accordingly and the copyright in cain be thus secure on the death of allegra he natural daughter lord byron entrust to mr murray the painful duty of make arrangement for the burial of the remains in harrow church mr cunningham the clergyman of harrow write in answer to mr murray : _ rev jw cunningham to john murray _ _ August _ 20 1822 sir mr henry drury be so good as to communicate to I a request convey to you by lord byron respect the burial of a child in this church mr h drury will probably have also state to you my willingness to comply with the wish of lord byron will you forgive I however for so far trespassing upon you -lrb- though a stranger -rrb- as to suggest a inquiry whether it might not be practicable and desirable to fulfil for the _ present _ only a _ part _ of he lordship 's wish -- by bury the child and put up a tablet with simply its name upon the tablet and thus leave lord b more leisure to reflect upon the character of the inscription he may wish to be add it do seem to I that whatever he may wish in the moment of he distress about the loss of this child he will afterwards regret that he should have take pain to proclaim to the world what he will not i be sure consider as honorable to he name and if this be probable then it appear to I the office of a true friend not to suffer he to commit himself but to allow he mind a opportunity of calm deliberation i feel constrain to say that the inscription he propose will be feel by every man of refined taste to say nothing of sound moral to be a offence against taste and propriety my correspondence with he lordship have be so small that i can scarcely venture myself to urge these objection you perhaps will feel no such scruple i have see no person who do not concur in the propriety of state they i would entreat however that should you think it right to introduce my name into any statement make to lord byron you will not do it without assure he of my unwillingness to oppose the smallest obstacle to he wish or give the slightest pain to he mind the injury which in my judgment he be from day to day inflict upon society be no justification for measure of retaliation and unkindness you obedient and faithful servant jw cunningham no

wall of harrow church chapter xvi byron 's death and the destruction of he memoirs no attempt have here be make to present a strictly chronological record of mr murray 's life we have seek only so to group he correspondence as to lay before we reader the various episode which go to form the business life of a publisher in pursuance of this plan we now proceed to narrate the closing incident of he friendship with lord byron reserve to subsequent chapter the various other transaction in which he be engage during the later month of byron 's residence in italy this friendship have suffer some interruption due in part perhaps to question which have arise out of the publication of don juan and in part to the interference of the hunt with the activity arouse by he expedition to greece byron 's better nature reassert itself and he last letter to he publisher though already print in moore 's life can not be omit from these page : _ lord byron to john murray _ missolonghus _ February _ 25 1824 i have hear from mr dougla kinnaird that you state a report of a satire on mr gifford have arrive from italy _ say _ to be write by _ I _ but that _ you _ do not believe it i dare say you do not nor any body else i should think whoever assert that i be the author or abettor of anything of the kind on gifford lie in he throat i always regard he as my literary father and myself as he prodigal son if any such composition exist it be none of mine _ you _ know as well as anybody upon _ whom _ i have or have not write and _ you _ also know whether they do or do not deserve that same and so much for such matter you will perhaps be anxious to hear some news from this part of greece -lrb- which be the most liable to invasion -rrb- but you will hear enough through public and private channel

contest you will hear however more of public news from plenty of quarter : for i have little time to write believe I yours etc etc n bn the fierce lawlessness of the suliote have now rise to such a height that it become necessary for the safety of the european population to get rid of they altogether and by some sacrifice on the part of lord byron this object be at length effect the advance of a month 's pay by he and the discharge of they arrears by the government -lrb- the latter too with money lend for that purpose by the same universal paymaster -rrb- at length induce these rude warrior to depart from the town and with they vanish all hope of the expedition against lepanto byron die at missolonghus on April 19 1824 and when the body arrive in london murray on behalf of mr hobhouse

therefore answer now that the case will not be mention -lrb- as it have happen -rrb- by some person or other who know it the best thing to be do however by the executor and relative be to carry away the body and say as little about it as possible unless the subject be provoke by some injudicious parade about the remains perhaps the matter will draw little or no notice yours very truly j ireland the death of byron bring into immediate prominence the question of he autobiographical memoirs the m of which he have give to moore who be at that time he guest at la mira near venice in 1819 a short time before dinner write moore he leave the room and in a minute or two return carry in he hand a white-leather bag ` look here ' he say hold it up ` this would be worth something to murray though _

sister mr leigh to be do with exactly as she think proper moore be of opinion that those part of the manuscript should be destroy which be find objectionable but that those part should be retain which be not for he benefit and that of the public at the same time it must be remember that moore 's interest in the memoirs have now entirely cease for in consequence of the death of lord byron they have become mr murray 's absolute property in accordance with the term of he purchase but although mr murray have pay so large a sum for the manuscript and would probably have make a considerable profit by its publication he be nevertheless willing to have it destroy if it should be the deliberate opinion of he lordship 's friend and relative that such a step be desirable mr murray therefore put himself into communication with lord byron 's nearest friend and relation with respect to the disposal of the memoirs he suggestion be at first strongly oppose by some of they but he urge he objection to

propose to insert in he journal mr murray inform he that the account be so very erroneous that he desire he either to condense it down to the smallest compass or to omit it altogether mr jerdan however reply that the subject be of so much public interest that he could not refuse to state the particulars and the following be send to he prepare by mr murray : a general interest have be excite touch the fate of lord byron 's memoirs write by himself and report confuse and incorrect have get into circulation upon the subject it have be deem requisite to signify the real particulars the manuscript of these memoirs be purchase by mr murray in the year 1821 for the sum of two thousand guinea under certain stipulation which give he the right of publish they three month after he lordship 's demise when that event be authenticate the manuscript consequently remain at mr murray 's absolute disposal and a day or two after the melancholy intelligence reach london mr murray submit to the near connection of the family that the mss should be destroy in consequence of this five person variously concern in the matter be convene for discussion upon it as these memoirs be not calculate to augment the fame of the writer and as some passage be pen in a spirit which he better feeling since have virtually retract mr murray propose that they should be destroy consider it a duty to sacrifice every view of profit to the noble author by whose confidence and friendship he have be so long honor the result have be that notwithstanding some opposition he obtain the desire decision and the manuscript be forthwith commit to the flame mr murray be immediately reimburse in the purchase-money by mr moore although mr murray have previously renounce every claim to repayment the particulars of the transaction be more fully express in the follow letter write by mr murray to mr -lrb- afterwards sir -rrb- robert wilmot horton two day after the destruction of the manuscript it seem that mr moore have already make a representation to mr horton which be not quite correct -lrb- footnote : lord j russell 's memoirs etc of thoma moore iv p 188 -rrb- _ john murray to mr r wilmot horton _ albemarle street _ may _ 19 1824 dear sir on my return home last night i find you letter date the 17th call on I for a specific answer whether i acknowledge the accuracy of the statement of mr moore communicate in it however unpleasant it be to I you requisition of a specific answer oblige I to say that i can not by any means admit the accuracy of that statement and in order to explain to you how mr moore 's misapprehension may have arise and the ground upon which my assertion rest i feel it necessary to trouble you with a statement of all the circumstance of the case which will enable you to judge for yourself lord byron have make mr moore a present of he memoirs mr moore offer they for sale to messr longman & co who however decline to purchase they mr moore then make I a similar offer which i accept and in November 1821 a joint assignment of the memoirs be make to I by lord byron and mr moore with all legal technicality in consideration of a sum of 2000 guinea which on the execution of the agreement by mr moore i pay to he mr moore also covenant in consideration of the say sum to act as editor of the memoirs and to supply a account of the subsequent event of lord byron 's life etc some month after the execution of this assignment mr moore request I as a great personal favor to himself and to lord byron to enter into a second agreement by which i should resign the absolute property which i have in the memoirs and give mr moore and lord byron or any of they friend a power of redemption _ during the life of lord byron _ as the reason press upon I for this change be that they friend think there be some thing in the memoirs that might be injurious to both i do not hesitate to make this alteration at mr moore 's request and accordingly on the 6th day of may 1822 a second deed be execute state that whereas lord byron and mr moore be now incline to wish the say work not to be publish it be agree that if either of they shall _ during the life of the say lord byron _ repay the 2000 guinea to mr murray the latter shall redeliver the memoirs but that if the sum be not repay _ during the lifetime of lord byron _ mr murray shall be at full liberty to print and publish the say memoirs within three month -lrb- footnote : the word within three month be substitute for immediately at mr moore 's request -- and they appear in pencil in he own handwriting upon the original draft of the deed which be still in existence -rrb- after the death of the say lord byron i need hardly call you particular attention to the word carefully insert twice over in this agreement which limit its existence to the _ lifetime of lord byron _ the reason of such limitation be obvious and natural -- namely that although i consent to restore the work _ while lord byron should be alive _ to direct the ulterior disposal of it i would by no means consent to place it _ after he death _ at the disposal of any other person i must now observe that i have never be able to obtain possession of the original assignment which be my sole lien on this property although i have make repeat application to mr moore to put I into possession of the deed which be state to be in the hand of lord byron 's banker feeling i confess in some degree alarm at the withhold the deed and dissatisfy at mr moore 's inattention to my interest in this particular i write urgently to he in march 1823 to procure I the deed and at the same time express my wish that the second agreement should either be cancel or _ at once execute _ finding this application unavailing and become by the greater lapse of time still more doubtful as to what the intention of the party might be i in march 1824 repeat my demand to mr moore in a more peremptory manner and be in consequence at length put into possession of the original deed but not be at all satisfy with the course that have be pursue towards I i repeat to mr moore my uneasiness at the term on which i stand under the second agreement and renew my request to he that he would either cancel it or execute its provision by the immediate redemption of the work in order that i might exactly know what my rights in the property be he request time to consider this proposition in a day or two he call and tell I that he would adopt the latter alternative -- namely the redemption of the memoirs -- as he have find person who be ready to advance the money on _ he injure he life _ and he promise to conclude the business on the first day of he return to town by pay the money and give up the agreement mr moore do return to town but do not that i have hear of take any proceedings for insure he life he positively neither write nor call upon I as he have promise to do -lrb- though he be generally accustom to make mine one of he first house of call -rrb- -- nor do he take any other step that i be aware of to show that he have any recollection of the conversation which have pass between we previous to he leave town until _ the death of lord byron _ have _ ipso facto _ cancel the agreement in question and completely restore my absolute rights over the property of the memoirs you will therefore perceive that there be no verbal agreement in existence between mr moore and I at the time i make a verbal agreement with you to deliver the memoirs to be destroy mr moore might undoubtedly _ during lord byron 's life _ have obtain possession of the memoirs if he have please to do so he however neglect or delay to give effect to we verbal agreement which as well as the write instrument to which it related be cancel by the death of lord byron there be no reason whatsoever why i be not at that instant perfectly at liberty to dispose of the m as i think proper have i consider only my own interest as a tradesman i would have announce the work for immediate publication and i can not doubt that under all the circumstance the public curiosity about these memoirs would have give I a very considerable profit beyond the large sum i originally pay for they but you yourself be i think able to do I the justice of bear witness that i look at the case with no such feeling and that my regard for lord byron 's memory and my respect for he survive family make I more anxious that the memoirs should be immediately destroy since it be surmise that the publication might be injurious to the former and painful to the latter as i myself scrupulously refrain from look into the memoirs i can not from my own knowledge say whether such a opinion of the contents be correct or not it be enough for I that the friend of lord and lady byron unite in wish for they destruction why mr moore should have wish to preserve they i do not nor will i inquire but have satisfy myself that he have no right whatever in they i be happy in have a opportunity of make by a pecuniary sacrifice on my part some return for the honor and i must add the profit which i have derive from lord byron 's patronage and friendship you will also be able to bear witness that -- although i could not presume to impose a obligation on the friend of lord byron or mr moore by refuse to receive the repayment of the 2000 guinea advance by I -- yet i have determine on the destruction of the memoirs without any previous agreement for such repayment : -- and you know the memoirs be actually destroy without any stipulation on my part but even with a declaration that i have destroy my own private property -- and i therefore have no claim upon any party for remuneration i remain dear sir you faithful servant john murray after the burning of the manuscript sir walter scott write in he diary : it be a pity that nothing save the total destruction of byron 's memoirs would satisfy he executor but there be a reason -- _ premat nox alta _ shortly after the burning of the memoirs mr moore begin to meditate write a life of lord byron the longman look earnestly and anxiously to it as the great source of my means of repay they they money -lrb- footnote : moore 's memoirs iv 253 -rrb- mr moore could not as yet however proceed with the life as the most important letter of lord byron be those write to mr murray which be in he exclusive possession lord john russell also be against he write the life of byron if you write he write to moore write poetry or if you can find a good subject write prose but do not undertake to write the life of another reprobate -lrb- refer to moore 's life of sheridan -rrb- in short do anything but write the life of lord byron -lrb- footnote : moore 's memoirs v 51 -rrb- yet moore grievously want money and this opportunity present itself to he with irresistible force as a means of add to he resource at length he become reconcile to mr murray through the intercession of mr hobhouse moore inform the longman of the reconciliation and in a liberal and considerate manner they say to he do not let we stand in the way of any arrangement you may make it be we wish to see you free from debt and it would be only in this one work that we should be separate it be in this way that mr moore undertake to write for mr murray the life of lord byron mr murray agree to repay moore the 2000 guinea he have give for the burn memoirs and # 2000 extra for editing the letter and write the life and moore in he diary say that he consider this offer perfectly liberal nothing he add could be more frank gentleman-like and satisfactory than the manner in which this affair have be settle on all side chapter xvii scott 's novel -- blackwood and murray the account of mr murray 's dealings with lord byron have carry we considerably beyond the date at which we leave the history of he general business transaction and compel we to go back to the year 1814 when as be related in a previous chapter he have associate himself with william blackwood as he edinburgh agent blackwood like murray be anxious to have a share in the business of publish the work of walter scott -- especially the novel teem from the press by the author of ` waverley ' although constable and the ballantyne be necessarily admit to the knowledge of they authorship to the world at large they be anonymous and the author still remain unknown mr murray have indeed point out to mr canning that waverley be by walter scott but scott himself trail so many red herring across the path that publisher as well as the public be throw off the scent and both blackwood and murray continue to be at fault with respect to the authorship of the waverley novel in February 1816 ballantyne assure blackwood that in a very few week he would have something very important to propose on April 12 following blackwood address the following letter to murray most strictly confidential and it contain important proposal : _ mr w blackwood to john murray _ my dear murray some time ago i write to you that jame ballantyne have dine with I and from what then pass i expect that i would soon have something very important to communicate he have now fully explain himself to I with liberty to inform you of anything he have communicate this however he entreat of we to keep most strictly to ourselves trust to we honor that we will not breathe a syllable of it to the dearest friend we have he begin by tell I that he think he have it now in he power to show I how sensible he be of the service i have do he and how anxious he be to accomplish that union of interest which i have so long be endeavor to bring about till now he have only make profession now he would act he say that he be empower to offer I along with you a work of fiction in four volume such as waverley etc that he have read a considerable part of it and know the plan of the whole he could answer for its be a production of the very first class but that he be not at liberty to mention its title nor be he at liberty to ` give the author 's name i naturally ask he be it by the author of waverley he say it be to have no reference to any other work whatever and everyone would be at liberty to form they own conjecture as to the author he only request that whatever we might suppose from anything that might occur afterwards we should keep strictly to ourselves that we be to be the publisher the term he be empower by the author to offer for it be : 1 the author to receive one-half of the profit of each edition these profit to be ascertain by deduct the paper and printing from the proceeds of the book sell at sale price the publisher to be at the whole of the expense of advertising 2 the property of the book to be the publisher ' who be to print such edition as they choose 3 the only condition upon which the author would agree to these term be that the publisher should take # 600 of john ballantyne 's stock select from the list annex deduct 25 per cent from the affixed sale price 4 if these term be agree to the stock to the above amount to be immediately deliver and a bill grant at twelve month 5 that in the course of six or eight week jb expect to be able to put into my hand the first two volume print and that if on perusal we do not like the bargain we should be at liberty to give it up this he consider to be most unlikely but if it should be the case he would bind himself to repay or redeliver the bill on the book be return 6 that the edition consist of 2000 copy should be print and ready for delivery by the 1st of October next i have thus state to you as nearly as i can the substance of what pass i try in various way to learn something with regard to the author but he be quite impenetrable my own impression now be that it must be walter scott for no one else would think of burden we with such trash as john b 's wretched stock this be such a burden that i be puzzle not a little i endeavor every way i could to get he to propose other term but he tell I they could not be depart from in a single part and the other work have be take on the same condition and he know they would be greedily accept again in the same quarter consider the matter seriously and write to I as soon as you can after give it my consideration and make some calculation i confess i feel inclined to hazard the speculation but still i feel doubtful until i hear what you think of it do not let my opinion which may be erroneous influence you but judge for yourself from the very strong term in which ja b speak of the work i be sanguine enough to expect it will equal if not surpass any of the other i would not lay so much stress upon what he say if i be not assure that he great interest as well as mr scott 's be to stand in the very best way both with you and I they be anxious to get out of the clutch of constable and ballantyne be sensible of the favor i have do and may still do he by give so much employment besides what he may expect from you from constable he can expect nothing i have almost forget to mention that he assure I in the most solemn manner that we have get the first offer and he ardently hope we would accept of it if however we do not he trust to we honor that we would say nothing of it that the author of this work would likely write more and should we not take this we might have it in we power afterwards to do something with he provide we act with delicacy in the transaction as he have no doubt we would do i hope you will be able to write to I soon and as fully as you can if i have time tomorrow or i should rather say this day as it be now near one o'clock i will write you about other matter and if i have no letter from you will perhaps give you another scolding yours most truly w blackwood a long correspondence take place between blackwood and murray on ballantyne 's proposal blackwood be incline to accept notwithstanding the odd nature of the proposal in the firm belief that the heart 's desire of ballantyne be to get rid of constable he send murray a list of ballantyne 's stock from which the necessary value of book be to be select it appear however that there be one point on which blackwood have be mistaken and that be that the copyright of the new novel be not to be absolutely convey and that all that ballantyne mean or have authority to offer be a edition limit to six thousand copy of the propose work although murray consider it a blind bargain he be dispose to accept it as it might lead to something better blackwood accordingly communicate to ballantyne that he and murray accept he offer _ mr wm blackwood to john murray _ _ April _ 27 1816 everything be settle and on Tuesday ballantyne be to give a letter specify the whole term of the transaction he could not do it sooner he say as he have to consult the author this i think make it clear that it be walter scott who be at abbotsford just now what surprise I a good deal be jame ballantyne tell I that he brother john have go out there with constable and godwin -lrb- author of ` caleb william ' -rrb- whom scott be anxious to see they be really a strange set of people i be not over fond of all these mystery but they be a mysterious set of personage and we must manage with they in the best way that we can a letter follow from jame ballantyne to murray -lrb- may i 1816 -rrb- congratulating he upon conclude the bargain through blackwood and say : i have take the liberty of draw upon you at twelve month for # 300 for you share it will be a singularly great accommodation if you can return the bill in course of post although ballantyne have promise that the first edition of the propose work should be ready by October 1 1816 blackwood find that in June the printing of the work have not yet commence ballantyne say he have not yet get any part of the manuscript from the author but that he would press he again on the subject the controversy still continue as to the authorship of the waverley novel for these six month past write blackwood -lrb- June 6 1816 -rrb- there have be various rumor with regard to greenfield be the author of these novel but i never pay much attention to it the thing appear to I so very improbable but from what i have hear lately and from what you state i now begin to think that greenfield may probably be the author on the other hand mr mackenzie call upon blackwood and inform he that he be now quite convinced that thoma scott walter 's brother in canada write all the novel the secret however be keep for many year longer blackwood become quite provoke at the delay in proceed with the propose work _ mr wm blackwood to john murray _ _ June _ 21 1816 i begin to fear that sb and cy be a nest of -- there be neither faith nor truth in they in my last letter i mention to you that there be not the smallest appearance of the work be yet begin and there be as little still jame ballantyne shift this off he own shoulder by say that he can not help it now my own belief be that at the time he make such solemn promise to I that the first volume would be in my hand in a month he have not the smallest expectation of this be the case but he know that he would not have get we bill which he absolutely want without hold this out it be now seven week since the bill be grant and it be five week since i give he the list of book which be to be deliver i have apply to he again and again for they and on Tuesday last he man at length call on I to say that john ballantyne & co could not deliver fifty set of ` kerr 's voyage ' -- that they have only such quantity of particular odd volume of which he show I a list blackwood call upon ballantyne but he could not see he and instead of return blackwood 's visit he send a note of excuse next time they meet be at hollingworth 's hotel after which ballantyne send blackwood a letter beg for a loan of # 50 till next week but not a word of business in it next time they meet be at the same hotel when the two dine with robert miller _ mr wm blackwood to john murray _ after dinner i walk home with jb perhaps from the wine he have drunk he be very communicative and give I a great deal of very curious and interesting private history would you believe it that about six week ago -- at the very time we transaction be go on -- these worthy scott ballantyne & co conclude a transaction with constable for 10000 copy of this say ` history of scotland ' -lrb- which have be promise to blackwood and murray -rrb- in 4 vol and actually receive bill for the profit expect to be realize from this large number yet when i put jame ballantyne in mind on Tuesday of what he have formally propose by desire of mr scott and assure we we be positively to get the work and ask he if there be any truth in the rumor i have hear and even that you have hear about mr scott be about to publish a ` history of scotland ' with he name and further ask he if mr scott be now ready to make any arrangement with we about it -lrb- for it never occur to I that he could make arrangement with any one else -rrb- he solemnly assure I that he know nothing about it now after this what confidence can we have in anything that this man will say or profess i confess i be sadly mortify at my own credulousness john i always consider as no better than a swindler but jame i put some trust and confidence in you judge more accurately for you always say that ` he be a damned cunning fellow ' well there be every appearance of you be right but he cunning -lrb- as it never do -rrb- will not profit he within these three year i have give he nearly # 1400 for printing and in return have only receive empty profession make to be sure in the most dramatic manner trite as the say be honesty be always the best policy and if we live a little longer we shall see what will be the end of all they cunning never-ending labyrinth of plot and scheme constable be the proper person for they set a thief to catch a thief : jonathan wild will be fully a match for any of the hero of the ` beggar 's opera ' my blood boil when i think of they and still more when i think of my allow myself so long to keep my eye shut to what i ought to have see long ago but the only apology i make to myself be that one do not wish to think so ill of human nature there be a old scotch proverb ` he have need o ' a lang spoon that sup wus ' the de'il ' and since we be engage let we try if we can partake of the broth without scald ourselves i still hope that we may and however much my feeling revolt at have any connection in future with they yet i shall endeavor to the best of my power to repress my bile and to turn they own trick against themselves one in business must submit to many thing and swallow many a bitter pill when such a man as walter scott be the object in view you will see by this day 's edinburgh papers that the copartnery of john ballantyne & co be formally dissolve miller tell I that before jame ballantyne could get he wife 's friend to assent to the marriage walter scott be oblige to grant bond and security take upon himself all the engagement of john ballantyne & co as well as of jame ballantyne & co -lrb- footnote : lockhart say in he life of scott that in feb 1816 when jame ballantyne marry it be clearly prove by letter in he handwriting that he owe to scott more than # 3000 of personal debt -rrb- so that if there be any difficulty on they part he bind himself to fulfil the whole when we consider the large sum of money walter scott have get for he work the greater part of which have be throw into the hand of the ballantyne and likewise the excellent printing business jb have have for so many year it be quite incomprehensible what have become of all the money miller say ` it be just a jaw hole which swallow up all ' and from what he have hear he do not believe walter scott be worth anything murray be nevertheless willing to go on until the term of he bargain with ballantyne be fulfil and write to blackwood that he be resolve to swallow the pill bitter though it be but he express he surprise that mr scott should have allow he property to be squander as it have be by these people blackwood however be in great anxiety about the transaction fear the result of the engagement which he and murray have enter into _ mr wm blackwood to john murray _ _ July 2 _ 1816 this morning i get up between five and six but instead of sit down to write to you as i have intend i mount my pony and take a long ride to collect my thought sit walk or ride be all the same i feel as much puzzle as ever and undetermined whether or not to cut the gordian knot except my wife there be not a friend whom i dare advise with i have not once venture to mention the business at all to my brother on account of the cursed mystery and injunction of secrecy connect with it i know he would blame I for ever engage in it for he have a very small opinion of the ballantyne i can not therefore be benefit by he advice mr blackwood though she always dislike my have any connection with the ballantyne rather think we should wait a few week longer till we see what be produce i believe after all this be the safest course to pursue i would beg of you however to think maturely upon the affair take into account mr scott 's usefulness to the _ review _ take a day or two to consider the matter fully and then give I you best advice as to constable or he triumph as he will consider they i perfectly agree with you that they be not to be covet by we and that they should not give we a moment 's thought thank god we shall never desire to compass any of we end by underhand practice meanwhile correspondence with ballantyne about the work of fiction -- the name of which be still unknown-was still proceed ballantyne say that the author promise to put the first volume in he hand by the end of August and that the whole would be ready for publication by christmas blackwood think this reply be humbug as formerly nevertheless he be oblige to wait at last he get the first sight of the manuscript _ mr wm blackwood to john murray _ _ August _ 23 1816 _ midnight _ my dear murray -- i have this moment finish the reading of 192 page of we book -- for ours it must be -- and i can not go to bed without tell you what be the strong and most favourable impression it have make upon I if the remainder be at all equal -- which it can not fail to be from the genius display in what be now before I -- we have be most fortunate indeed the title as talk of my landlord _ collect and report by jedediah cleishbotham pariah clerk and schoolmaster of gandercleugh _ mr blackwood then proceed to give a account of the introduction the commencement of the black dwarf the first of the tale and the general nature of the story to the end of the fourth chapter he letter be of great length and extend to nine quarto page he conclude : there can not be a doubt as to the splendid merit of the work it would never have do to have hesitate and higgle about see more volume in the note which accompany the sheet ballantyne say ` each volume contain a tale ' so there will be four in all -lrb- footnote : this the original intention be depart from -rrb- the next relate to the period of the covenanter i have now neither doubt nor fear with regard to the whole be good and i anxiously hope that you will have as little i be so happy at the fortunate termination of all my pain and anxiety that i can not be in bad humor with you for not write I two line in answer to my last letter i hope i shall hear from you to-morrow but i entreat of you to write I in course of post as i wish to hear from you before i leave this -lrb- for london -rrb- which i intend to do on this day se ` nnight by the smack at length the principal part of the manuscript of the novel be in the press and as both the author and the printer be in sore strait for money they become importunate on blackwood and murray for payment on account they have take ballantyne 's wretched stock of book as blackwood style they and lockhart in he life of scott infer that murray have consent to anticipate the period of he payment at all event he find in a letter of scott 's write in August these word to john ballantyne : dear john -- i have the pleasure to enclose murray 's acceptance i earnestly recommend you to push realize as much as you can consider weel gude mon we hae but borrow gear the horse that i ride on it be john murray 's mear scott be at this time sorely press for ready money he be buy one piece of land after another usually at exorbitant price and have already increase the estate of abbotsford from 150 to nearly 1000 acre he be in communication with mr edward blore as to the erection of a dwelling adjacent to the cottage at a point face the tweed this house grow and expand until it become the spacious mansion of abbotsford the ballantyne also be ravenous for more money but they could get nothing from blackwood and murray before the promise work be finish at last the book be complete print and publish on December 1 1816 but without the magical word by the author of ` waverley ' on the title-page all doubt as to the work be by the author of waverley say lockhart have worn themselves out before the lapse of a week _ john murray to mr wm blackwood _ _ December _ 13 1816 have now hear every one 's opinion about we ` tale of my landlord ' i feel competent to assure you that it be universally in they favor there be only ` meg merrilies ' in they way it be even i think superior to the other three novel you may go on printing as many and as fast as you can for we certainly need not stop until we come to the end of we unfortunately limited 6000 my copy be more than go and if you have any to spare pray send they up instantly on the follow day mr murray write to mr scott : _ john murray to mr scott _ _ December _ 14 1816 dear sir although i dare not address you as the author of certain tale -- which however must be write either by walter scott or the devil -- yet nothing can restrain I from think that it be to you influence with the author of they that i be indebted for the essential honor of be one of they publisher and i must intrude upon you to offer my most hearty thanks not divide but double alike for my worldly gain therein and for the great acquisition of professional reputation which they publication have already procure I as to delight i believe i could under any oath that could be propose swear that i never experience such great and unmixed pleasure in all my life as the reading of this exquisite work have afford I and if you witness the wet eye and grin cheek with which as the author 's chamberlain i receive the unanimous and vehement praise of they from every one who have read they or hear the curse of those whose need my scanty supply would not satisfy you might judge of the sincerity with which i now entreat you to assure the author of the most complete success after this i could throw all the other book which i have in the press into the thame for no one will either read they or buy lord holland say when i ask he opinion : opinion we do not one of we go to bed all night and nothing sleep but my gout frere hallam and boswell lord glenbervie come to I with tear in he eye it be a cordial he say which have save lady glenbervie 's life heber who find it on he table on he arrival from a journey have no rest till he have read it he have only this moment leave I and he with many other agree that it surpass all the other novel wm lamb also gifford never read anything like it he say and he estimate of it absolutely increase at each recollection of it barrow with great difficulty be force to read it and he say yesterday very good to be sure but what powerful writing be _ throw away _ heber say there be only two man in the world walter scott and lord byron between you you have give existence to a third ever you faithful servant john murray this letter do not effectually draw the badger scott reply in the follow humorous but jesuitical epistle : _ mr scott to john murray _ _ December 18 1816 _ my dear sir i give you hearty joy of the success of the tale although i do not claim that paternal interest in they which my friend do I the credit to assign to I i assure you i have never read a volume of they till they be print and can only join with the rest of the world in applaud the true and striking portrait which they present of old scottish manners i do not expect implicit reliance to be place on my disavowal because i know very well that he who be dispose not to own a work must necessarily deny it and that otherwise he secret would be at the mercy of all who choose to ask the question since silence in such a case must always pass for consent or rather assent but i have a mode of convince you that i be perfectly serious in my denial -- pretty similar to that by which solomon distinguish the fictitious from the real mother -- and that be by review the work which i take to be a operation equal to that of quarter the child kind compliment to heber whom i expect at abbotsford this summer also to mr croker and all you four o'clock visitor i be just go to abbotsford to make a small addition to my premise there i have now about seven hundred acre thanks to the bookseller and the discerning public yours truly walter scott the happy chance of secure a review of the tale by the author of waverley himself exceed murray 's most sanguine expectation and fill he with joy he suggest that the reviewer instead of send a article on the gypsy as he propose should introduce whatever he have to say about that picturesque race in he review of the tale by way of comment on the character of meg merrily the review be write and appear in no 32 of the _ quarterly _ in January 1817 by which time the novel have already go to a third edition it be curious now to look back upon the author review he own work he adopt murray 's view and besides go over the history of waverley and the character introduce in that novel he introduce a disquisition about meg merrily and the gypsy as set forth in he novel of guy manner he then proceed to review the black dwarf and old mortality but with the utmost skill avoid praise they and rather endeavor to put he friend off the scent by undervalue they and find fault the black dwarf for example be full of violent event which be so common in romance and of such rare occurrence in real life indeed he write the narrative be unusually artificial neither hero nor heroine excite interest of any sort be just that sort of _ pattern _ people whom nobody care a farthe about the other story he add be of much deeper interest he describe the person who give the title to the novel -- robert paterson of the parish of closeburn in dumfriesshire -- and introduce a good deal of historical knowledge but take exception to many of the circumstance mention in the story at the same time quote some of the best passage about cuddie headrigg and he mother in respect to the influence of claverhouse and general dalzell the reviewer state that the author have cruelly falsified history and relate the actual circumstance in reference to these general we know little he say that the author can say for himself to excuse these sophistication and therefore may charitably suggest that he be write a romance and not a history in conclusion the reviewer observe we intend here to conclude this long article when a strong report reach we of certain trans-atlantic confession which if genuine -lrb- though of this we know nothing -rrb- assign a different author to these volume than the party suspect by we scottish correspondent yet a critic may be excuse seize upon the nearest suspicious person on the principle happily express by claverhouse in a letter to the earl of linlithgow he have be it seem in search of a gifted weaver who use to hold forth at conventicle i send to seek the webster -lrb- weaver -rrb- they bring in he _ brother _ for he though he maybe can not preach like he brother i doubt not but he be as well-principled as he wherefore i think it would be no great fault to give he the trouble to go to the jail with the rest mr murray seem to have accept the suggestion and write in January 1817 to mr blackwood : i can assure you but _ in the greatest confidence _ that i have discover the author of all these novel to be thomas scott walter scott 's brother he be now in canada i have no doubt but that mr walter scott do a great deal to the first ` waverley novel ' because of he anxiety to serve he brother and he doubt about the success of the work this account for the many story about it many person have previously hear from mr scott but you may rely on the certainty of what i have tell you the whole country be starve for want of a complete supply of the ` tale of my landlord ' respect the interest and merit of which there continue to be but one sentiment a few week later blackwood write to murray : _ January _ 22 1817 it be a odd story here that mr and mr thoma scott be the author of all these novel i however still think as mr croker say to I in one of he letter that if they be not by mr walter scott the only alternative be to give they to the devil as by one or the other they must be write on the other hand bernard barton write to mr murray and say that he have hear that jame hogg the ettrick shepherd be the author of ` tale of my landlord ' and that he have have intimation from himself to that effect by no mean a improbable story consider hogg 's vanity lady mackintosh also write to mr murray : do you hear who this _ new _ author of ` waverley ' and ` guy manner ' be mrs thomas scott as mr thoma scott assure lord selkirk -lrb- who have be in canada -rrb- and he lordship like lord monboddo believe it murray again write to blackwood -lrb- February 15 1817 -rrb- : what be you theory as to the author of ` harold the dauntless ' i will believe till within a inch of my life that the author of ` tale of my landlord ' be thomas scott thus matter remain until a few year later when george iv be on he memorable visit to edinburgh walter scott be one of the hero of the occasion and be the select cicerone to the king one day george iv in the sudden and abrupt manner which be peculiar to we royal family ask scott point-blank : by the way scott be you the author of ` waverley ' scott as abruptly answer : no sire have make this answer -lrb- say mr thoma mitchell who communicate the information to mr murray some year later -rrb- it be suppose that he consider it a matter of honor to keep the secret during the present king 's reign if the least personal allusion be make to the subject in sir walter 's presence matthew say that he head gently drop upon he breast and that be a signal for the person to desist with respect to the first series of the tale of my landlord so soon as the 6000 copy have be dispose of which the author through ballantyne have covenant as the maximum number to be publish by murray and blackwood the work revert to constable and be publish uniformly with the other work by the author of waverley chapter xviii alliance with blackwood -- blackwood 's edinburgh magazine -- termination of partnership we have already see that mr murray have some correspondence with thoma campbell in 1806 respect the establishment of a monthly magazine such a undertaking have long be a favorite scheme of he and he have mention the subject to many friend at home as well as abroad when therefore mr blackwood start he magazine murray be ready to enter into he plan and before long announce to the public that he have become joint proprietor and publisher of blackwood 's _ edinburgh magazine _ there be nothing very striking in the early number of the _ magazine _ and it do not appear to have obtain a considerable circulation the first editor be thoma pringle who -- in conjunction with a friend -- be the author of a poem entitle the institute and jame cleghorn best know as a contributor to the _ farmer ' magazine _ constable who be himself the proprietor of the _ scot magazine _ as well as of the _ farmer ' magazine _ desire to keep the monopoly of the scottish monthly periodical in he own hand and be greatly oppose to the new competitor at all event he contrived to draw away from blackwood pringle and cleghorn and to start a new series of the _ scot magazine _ under the title of the _ edinburgh magazine _ blackwood thereupon change the name of he periodical to that by which it have since be so well know he undertake the editing himself but soon obtain many able and indefatigable helper there be then two young advocate walk the parliament house in search of briefs these be john wilson -lrb- christopher north -rrb- and john gibson lockhart -lrb- afterwards editor of the _ quarterly _ -rrb- both be west-countrymen -- wilson the son of a wealthy paisley manufacturer and lockhart the son of the minister of cambusnethan in lanarkshire -- and both have receive the best of education wilson the robust christian have carry off the newdigate prize at oxford and lockhart have gain the snell foundation at glasgow be send to balliol and take a first class in classic in 1813 these with dr maginn -- under the _ sobriquet _ of morgan o'dogherty -- hogg -- the ettrick shepherd -- de quincey -- the opium-eater -- thoma mitchell and other be the principal writer in _ blackwood _ no 7 the first of the new series create a unprecedented stir in edinburgh it come out on October 1 1817 and sell very rapidly but after 10000 have be strike off it be suppress and could be have neither for love nor money the cause of this sudden attraction be a article head translation from a ancient chaldee manuscript purport to be a extract from some newly discover historical document every paragraph of which contain a special hit at some particular person well know in edinburgh society there be very little ill-nature in it at least nothing like the amount which it excite in those who be or imagine themselves to be caricature in it constable the crafty and pringle and cleghorn editor of the _ edinburgh magazine _ as well as jeffrey editor of the _ edinburgh review _ come in for they share of burlesque description among the person delineate in the article be the publisher of blackwood 's _ edinburgh magazine _ whose name be as it have be the color of ebony : indeed the name of old ebony long cling to the journal the principal writer of the article be themselves include in the caricature hogg the ettrick shepherd be describe as the great wild boar from the forest of lebanon and he rouse up he spirit and i see he whet he dreadful tusk for the battle wilson be the beautiful leopard and lockhart the scorpion -- name which be afterwards hurl back at they with interest walter scott be describe as the great magician who dwelleth in the old fastness hard by the river jordan which be by the border mackenzie jameson leslie brewster tytler alison m ` crie playfair lord murray the duncan -- in fact all the lead man of edinburgh be hit off in the same fashion mr garden in she memorial of jame hogg say that there be no doubt that hogg write the first draft indeed part of the original be still in the possession of the family some of the more irreverent passage be not he or be at all event largely add to by other before publication -lrb- footnote : mr garden 's memorial of jame hogg p 107 -rrb- in a recent number of _ blackwood _ it be say that : hogg 's name be nearly associate with the chaldee manuscript of course he claim credit for have write the skit and undoubtedly he originate the idea the rough draft come from he pen and we can not speak with certainty as to how it be subsequently manipulate but there be every reason to believe that wilson and lockhart probably assist by sir william hamilton go to work upon it and so altered it that hogg 's original offspring be change out of all knowledge -lrb- footnote : _ blackwood 's magazine _ September 1882 pp 368-9 -rrb- the whole article be probably intend as a harmless joke and the person indicate have they be wise might have join in the laugh or treat the matter with indifference on the contrary however they feel profoundly indignant and some of they commence action in the court of session for the injury do to they reputation the same number of _ blackwood _ which contain the translation from a ancient chaldee manuscript contain two article one probably by wilson on coleridge 's biographium literarium the other sign z by lockhart be the first of a series on the cockney school of poetry they be both clever but abusive and exceedingly personal in they allusion murray expostulate with blackwood on the personality of the article he fear lest they should be damage to the permanent success of the journal blackwood reply in a long letter say that the journal be prosper and that it be only constable and he myrmidon who be oppose to it chiefly because of its success in August 1818 murray pay # 1000 for a half share in the magazine and from this time he take a deep and active interest in its progress advise blackwood as to its management and urge he to introduce more foreign literary news as well as more scientific information he do not like the idea of two editor who seem to have take the management into they own hand subsequent number of _ blackwood _ contain other review of the cockney school of poetry : leigh hunt the king of the cockney be attack in may and in August it be the poet keat who come under the critic 's lash four month after croker 's famous review of endymion in the _ quarterly _ -lrb- footnote : it be say that keat be kill by this brief notice of four page in the _ quarterly _ and byron in he don juan give credit to this statement : poor keat who be kill off by one critique just as he really promise something great ` tis strange the mind that very fiery particle should let itself be snuff out by a article leigh hunt one of keat ' warmest friend when in italy tell lord byron -lrb- as he relate in he autobiography -rrb- the real state of the case prove to he that the supposition of keat ' death be the result of the review be a mistake and therefore if print would be a misrepresentation but the stroke of wit be not to be give up either mr gifford or the poet-priest milman have generally but erroneously be blame for be the author of the review in the _ quarterly _ which as be now well know be write by mr croker -rrb- the same number of _ blackwood _ contain a short article about hazlitt -- elsewhere style pimpled hazlitt it be very short and entitle hazlitt cross-question hazlitt consider the article full of abuse and commence a action for libel against the proprietor of the magazine upon this blackwood send hazlitt 's threatening letter to murray with he remark : _ mr blackwood to john murray _ _ September _ 22 1818 i suppose this fellow merely mean to make a little bluster and try if he can pick up a little money there be nothing whatever actionable in the paper the article on hazlitt which will commence next number will be a most powerful one and this business will not deprive it of any of its edge _ September _ 25 1818 what be people say about that fellow hazlitt attempt to prosecute there be a rascally paragraph in the _ time _ of Friday last mention the prosecution and say the magazine be a work fill with private slander my friend laugh at the idea of he prosecution mr murray however become increasingly dissatisfied with this state of thing he never sympathise with the slash criticism of _ blackwood _ and strongly disapprove of the personality a opinion which be share by most of he literary friend at the same time he name be on the title-page of the magazine and he be jointly responsible with blackwood for the article which appear there in a long letter date September 28 1818 mr murray deprecate the personality of the article in the magazine and entreat that they be keep out if not he beg that blackwood would omit he name from the title-page of the work a long correspondence take place during the month of October between murray and blackwood : the former continue to declaim against the personality of the article the latter aver that there be nothing of the sort in the magazine if blackwood would only keep out these personal attack murray would take care to send he article by mr frere mr barrow and other which would enhance the popularity and respectability of the publication in October of this year be publish a anonymous pamphlet entitle hypocrisy unveil which rake up the whole of the joke contain in the translation from a ancient chaldee manuscript publish a year before the number contain it have as we have already see be suppress because of the offence it have give to many person of celebrity while the general tone of bitterness and personality have be subsequently modify if not abandon murray assure blackwood that he number for October 1818 be one of the best he have ever read and he desire he to offer to he friend he very best thanks and congratulation upon the production of so admirable a number with this number he say you have give I a fulcrum upon which i will move heaven and earth to get subscriber and contributor indeed several of the contribution in this surpassingly excellent number have be send to the edinburgh publisher through the instrumentality of murray himself hypocrisy unveil be a lampoon of a scurrilous and commonplace character in which the lead contributor to and the publisher of the magazine be violently attack both murray and blackwood who be abused openly by name resolve to take no notice of it but lockhart and wilson who be mention under the thin disguise of the scorpion and the leopard be so nettled by the remark on themselves that they in October 1818 both send challenge to the anonymous author through the publisher of the pamphlet this most injudicious step only increase they discomfiture as the unknown writer not only refuse to proclaim he identity but publish and circulate the challenge together with a further attack on lockhart and wilson this foolish disclosure cause bitter vexation to murray who write : _ john murray to mr blackwood _ _ October _ 27 1818 my dear blackwood i really can recollect no parallel to the palpable absurdity of you two friend if they have plan the most complete triumph to they adversary nothing could have be so successfully effective they have actually give up they name as the author of the offence charge upon they by implication only in the pamphlet how they could possibly conceive that the writer of the pamphlet would be such a idiot as to quit he stronghold of concealment and allow he head to be chop off by exposure i be at a loss to conceive i declare to god that have i know what i have so incautiously engage in i would not have undertake what i have do or have suffer what i have in my feeling and character -- which no man have hitherto the slightest cause for assail -- i would not have do so for any sum in answer to these remonstrance blackwood beg he to dismiss the matter from he mind to preserve silence and to do all that be possible to increase the popularity of the magazine the next number he say would be excellent and unexceptionable and it prove to be so the difficulty however be not yet over while the principal editor of the chaldee manuscript have thus reveal themselves to the author of hypocrisy unveil the london publisher of _ blackwood _ be in November 1818 assail by a bite pamphlet entitle a letter to mr john murray of albemarle street occasion by he have undertake the publication in london of _ blackwood 's magazine _ the curse of he respectability he be tell have bring the letter upon he you name stand among the very highest in the department of literature which have fall to you lot : the eminent person who have confide in you and the work you have give to the world have conduce to you establishment in the public favor while you liberality you impartiality and you private motive bear testimony to the justice of you claim to that honorable distinction other criticism of the same kind reach mr murray 's ear moore in he diary -lrb- November 4 1818 -rrb- write : receive two most civil and anxious letter from the great ` bibliopola tryphon ' murray express he regret at the article in _ blackwood _ and he resolution to give up all concern in it if it contain any more such personality -lrb- footnote : memoirs journal and correspondence of thoma moore ii 210 by lord john russell -rrb- finally the hazlitt action be settle blackwood give to murray the follow account of the matter : _ December _ 16 1818 i have have two letter from mr patmore inform I that mr hazlitt be to drop the prosecution he agent have since apply to mine offering to do this if the expense and a small sum for some charity be pay my agent tell he he would certainly advise any client of he to get out of court but that he would never advise I to pay anything to be make a talk of as a sum for a charity would be he would advise I he say to pay the expense and a trifle to hazlitt himself privately hazlitt 's agent agree to this -lrb- footnote : i have not be able to discover what sum if any be pay to hazlitt privately -rrb- notwithstanding promise of amendment murray still complain of the personality and of the way in which the magazine be edit he also object to the echo of the _ edinburgh review 's _ abuse of sharon turner it be sufficient to give pain to I and to my most value friend there be another ungentlemanly and uncalled-for thrust at thoma moore that just make so many more enemy unnecessarily and you not only deprive I of the communication of my friend but you positively provoke they to go over to you adversary it seem impossible to exercise any control over the editor and murray have no alternative left but to expostulate and if he expostulation be unheed to retire from the magazine the last course be that which he eventually decide to adopt and the end of the partnership in _ blackwood 's magazine _ which have long be anticipate at length arrive murray 's name appear for the last time on no 22 for January 1819 the follow number bear no london publisher 's name but on the number for march the name of t cadell and w davy be advertise as the london agent for the magazine on December 17 1819 # 1000 be remit to mr murray in payment of the sum which he have originally advance to purchase he share and he connection with _ blackwood 's magazine _ finally cease he thereupon transfer he agency for scotland to messr oliver & boyd with whose firm it have ever since remain the friendly correspondence between murray and blackwood nevertheless continue as they be jointly interested in several work of importance in the course of the following year christopher north make the follow statement in _ blackwood 's magazine _ in a hour 's tte--tte with the public : the chaldee manuscript which appear in we seventh number give we both a lift and a shove nothing else be talk of for a long while and after 10000 copy have be sell it become a very great rarity quite a desideratum the sale of the _ quarterly _ be about 14000 of the _ edinburgh _ upward of 7000 it be not we intention at present to suffer we sale to go beyond 17000 mr murray under whose auspices we _ magnum opus _ issue for a few month from albemarle street begin to suspect that we might be eclipse the _ quarterly review _ no such eclipse have be foretell and mr murray be no great astronomer be at a loss to know whether in the darkness that be but too visible we be eclipse the _ quarterly _ or the _ quarterly _ eclipse we we accordingly take we pen and erase he name from we title-page and he be once more happy under we present publisher we carry everything before we in london mr murray take no notice of this statement prefer without any more word to be quit of he bargain it need scarcely be add that when mr blackwood have get he critic and contributor well in hand -- when he journal have pass its frisky and juvenile life of fun and frolic -- when the personality have cease to appear in its column and it have reach the year of judgment and discretion -- and especially when its principal editor mr john wilson -lrb- christopher north -rrb- have be appoint to the distinguished position of professor of moral philosophy in the university of edinburgh -- the journal take that high rank in periodical literature which it have ever since maintain chapter xix work publish in 1817-18 -- correspondence etc -- scott be now begin to suffer from the terrible mental and bodily strain to which he have subject himself and be shortly after seize with the illness to which reference have be make in a previous chapter and which disable he for some time blackwood inform murray -lrb- march 7 1817 -rrb- that mr scott have be most dangerously ill with violent pain arise from spasmodic action in the stomach but he be gradually get better for some time he remain in a state of exhaustion unable either to stir for weakness and giddiness or to read for dazzling in he eye or to listen for a whiz sound in he ear -- all indication of too much brain-work and mental worry yet as soon as he be able to resume he labor we find he characteristically employ in help he poorer friend _ mr blackwood to john murray _ _ may _ 28 1817 mr scott and some of he friend in order to raise a sum of money to make the poor shepherd comfortable have project a fourth edition of the queen 's wake with a few plate to be publish by subscription we have insert you name as we have no doubt of you do everything you can for the poor poet the advertisement which be excellent be write by mr scott hogg be tempt by the duke of buccleuch 's gift of a farm on eltrive lake to build himself a house as scott be do and apply to murray for a loan of # 50 which be grant in acknowledge the receipt of the money he write : _ mr jame hogg to john murray _ _ August _ 11 1818 i be tell gifford have a hard prejudice against I but i can not believe it i do not see how any man can have a prejudice against I he may indeed consider I a intruder in the walk of literature but i be only a saunterer and malign nobody who choose to let I pass i be go to say before but forget and say quite another thing that if mr gifford would point out any light work for I to review for he i 'll bet a m poem with he that i 'll write it better than he expect yours ever most sincerely jame hogg as scott still remain the great unknown murray 's correspondence with he related principally to he article in the _ quarterly _ to which he continue a occasional contributor murray suggest to he the subject of article and also request he to beat up for a few more contributor he want a article on the gypsy and if scott could not muster time to do it he hope that mr erskine might be persuade to favor he with a essay scott however in the midst of pain and distress be now busy with he rob roy which be issue towards the end of the year a short interruption of he correspondence with murray occur -- scott be busy in get the long bury and almost forget regalia of scotland expose to light he be also busy with one of he best novel the heart of midlothian murray know nothing of these thing again endeavor to induce he to renew he correspondence especially he article for the _ review _ in response scott contribute article on

disagreeable intelligence that circumstance have occur which i fear will deprive I of you as a publisher -- i hope never as a friend for i here attest though i have hear some bitter thing against you that i never meet with any man whatever who on so slight a acquaintance have behave to I so much like a gentleman blackwood ask to transfer you share of my trifling work to he new agent i answer never without you permission as the jacobite relic be not yet publish and as they would only involve you further with one with whom you be go to close account i give he liberty to transfer the share you be to have in they to messr cadell & davies but when i consider you handsome subscription for the queen 's wake if you have the slightest inclination to retain you share of that work and the brownie as you name be on they _ along with blackwood _ i would much rather not only from affection but interest that you should continue to dispose of they i know these book be of no avail to you and that if you retain they it will be on the same principle that you publish they namely one of friendship for you humble poetical countryman i 'll never forget you kindness for i can not think that i be taint with the general vice of author ' _ ingratitude _ and the first house that i call at in london will be the one in albemarle street i remain ever yours most truly jame hogg murray do not cease to sell

bud on receipt of this please burn the whole that be send thee and at thy convenience inform I that it have be do with thanks for thy highly commendable care i be respectfully thy friend john proctor the number of person who desire to publish poetry be surprising even sharon turner murray 's solicitor whose valuable historical work have be publish by the longman write to he about the publication of poem which he have write to idle away the evening as well as he could murray answer he letter : _ john murray to mr sharon turner _ _ November _ 17 1817 i do not think it would be creditable to you

pleasure to learn frequently of late that you be so much better i hope during the winter if we have any to send you many amusing book to shorten the tediousness of time and charm away you indisposition mr murray be still up and well and desire I to send she best compliment to you and mr turner ever yours faithfully j murray mr turner thank mr murray for he letter and say that if he proceed with he intention he would adopt he advice i have always find longman very kind and honorable but i will not offer he now what you think it right to decline during gifford 's now almost incessant attack of illness mr croker take charge of the _ quarterly review _ the follow letter embody some of he idea as to editing : _ mr croker to john murray _ brighton _ march _ 29 1823 dear murray as i shall not be in town in time to see you to-morrow i send you some papers i return the _ poor _ article -lrb- footnote : on the poor law by mr gleig -rrb- with its addition let the author 's amendment be attend to and let he termination be insert _ between _ he former conclusion and that which i have write it be a good article not overdo and yet not dull i return to be set up the article -lrb- by captain procter -rrb- on southey 's peninsular war it be very bad -- a mere _ abstracted history of the war itself _ and not in the least a _ review of the book _ i have take pain to remove some part of this error but you must feel how impossible it be to change the whole frame of such a article a touch throw in here and there will give some relief and the character of a _ review _ will be in some small degree preserve this cursed system of write dissertation will be the death of we and if i be to edit another number i should make a great alteration in that particular but for this time i must be satisfy with plaster up what i have not time to rebuild one thing i would do immediately if i be you i would pay for article of _ one _ sheet as much as for article of two and three and in fact i would _ scarcely _ permit a article to exceed one sheet i would reserve such extension for matter of great and immediate interest and importance i be delighted that w -lrb- footnote : probably blanco white -rrb- undertake one he will do it well but remember the necessity of _ absolute secrecy _ on this point and indeed on all other if you be to publish such name as cohen and croker and collinson and coleridge the magical we would have little effect and you _ review _ would be absolutely despise -- _ omne ignotum pro mirifico _ i suppose i shall see you about twelve on Tuesday could you not get I a gay light article or two if i be to _ edit _ for you i can not find time to _ contribute _ madame campan 's poem will more than expend my leisure i come here for a little recreation and i be all day at the desk as if i be at the admiralty this peninsular article have cost I two day ' hard work and be after all not worth the trouble but we must have something about it and it be i suppose too late to expect anything better mr william 's article on sir w scott -lrb- lord stowell -rrb- be contemptible and would expose you _ review _ to the ridicule of the whole bar but it may be make something of and i like the subject i have a long and amusing talk with the chancellor the night before last on he own and he brother 's judgment i wish i have time to embody we conversation in a article yours ever jwc southey be _ very _ long but as good as he be long -- i have nearly do with he i write _ very slowly _ and can not write long this letter be write at three sitting no sooner have croker get no 56 of the _ review _ out of he hand than he make a short visit to pari on this mr barrow write to murray _ mr barrow to john murray _ _ April _ 2 1823 croker have run away to pari and leave poor gifford helpless what will become of the _ quarterly _ poor gifford tell I yesterday that he feel he _ must _ give up the editorship and that the doctor have _ order _ he to do so some month later barrow write to murray say that he have see gifford that morning : _ mr barrow to john murray _ _ August _ 18 1823 i tell he to look out for some one to conduct the _

look very aged he face much wrinkled and he seem to be in decline health he dress be careless and he cravat and waistcoat cover with snuff there be a antique philosophic cast about he head and countenance better adapt to exact a feeling of curiosity in a stranger than the head of sir walter scott the latter seem more a man of this world 's mould such too be he character for with all he fine genius sir walter would never have be so successful a author have he not possess so large a share of common sense unite to a business-like method of conduct he affair even those which perhaps i might venture to call the affair of imagination we take we leave and before we get further than the first landing we meet mr murray conduct sir walter downstair they be go to have a private chat before the

brigadier-general lepel and the wife of lord hervey of ickworth author of the memoirs of the court of george ii and queen caroline she letter form a sort of anecdotal history of the politics and literature of she time a mysterious attachment be say to have exist between she and lord chesterfield who in he letter to he son desire he never to mention she name when he could avoid it while she on the other hand adopt all lord chesterfield 's opinion as afterwards appear in the aforesaid letter mr walter hamilton author of the gazetteer of indium a old and intimate friend of mr murray who first bring the subject under mr murray 's notice say lady hervey write more like a man than a woman something like lady mw montagu and in give she opinion she never mince matter mr hamilton recommend that archdeacon coxe author of the life of sir robert and horace walpole should be the editor mr murray however consult he _ fidus achate _ mr croker and put the letter in he hand ask he to peruse they and if he approve to edit they the follow be mr croker 's answer : _ mr croker to john murray _ _ November _ 22 1820 dear murray i shall do more than you ask i shall give you a biographical sketch -- sketch do you hear -- of lady hervey and note on she letter in which i shall endeavor to enliven a little the _ sameness _ of my author do not think that i say _ sameness _ in derogation of dear mary lepel 's _ power _ of entertainment i have be _ in love _ with she a long time which as she be dead twenty year before i be bear i may without indiscretion avow but all these letter be write in a journal style and to one person there be a want of that variety which lady hervey 's mind be capable of give i have apply to she family for a little assistance hitherto without success and i think as a _ lover _ of lady hervey 's i might reasonably resent the little enthusiasm i find that she descendant feel about she in order to enable I to do this little job for you i wish you would procure for I a file if such a thing exist of any newspaper from about 1740 to 1758 at which latter date the _ annual register _ begin as i remember so many little circumstance be mention in letter and forget in history that without some such guide i shall make but blind work of it if it be necessary i will go to the museum and _ grab _ they as my betters have do before I my dear little nony -lrb- footnote : mr croker 's adopt daughter afterwards marry to sir george barrow -rrb- be worse last night and not better all to-day but this evening they make I happy by say that she be decidedly improve yours ever jw croker send I walpoliana i have lose or mislay mine be there any memoirs about the date of 1743 or later beside bubb be that mr croker make all haste and exercise he usual painstaking industry in do this little job for mr murray will be evident from the follow letter : _ mr croker to john murray _ _ December _ 27 1820 dear murray i have do lady hervey i hear that there be a mr vincent in the treasury the son of a mr and mr vincent to whom the late general hervey the favorite son of lady hervey leave he fortune and he papers could you find out who they be nothing be more surprising than the ignorance in which i find all lady hervey 's descendant about she most of they never hear she maiden name it remind one of walpole write to george montagu to tell he who he grandmother be i be anxious to knock off this task whilst what little i know of it be fresh in my recollection for i foresee that much of the entertainment of the work must depend on the elucidation in the note yours jwc the publication of lady hervey 's letter in 1821 be so successful that mr croker be afterwards induce to edit with great advantage letter and memorial of a similar character -lrb- footnote : as late as 1848 mr croker edit lord hervey 's memoirs of the court of george ii and queen caroline from the family archive at ickworth the editor in he preface say that lord hervey be almost the boswell of george ii and queen caroline -rrb- the next important _ mmoires pour servir _ be bring under mr murray 's notice by lord holland in the follow letter : _ lord holland to john murray _ holland house _ November _ 1820 sir i write a letter to you last week which by some accident lord lauderdale who have take charge of it have mislay the object of it be to request you to call here some morning and to let I know the hour by a line by two-penny post i be authorize to dispose of two historical work the one a short but admirably write and interesting memoir of the late lord waldegrave who be a favorite of george ii and governor of george iii when prince of wale the second consist of three close-written volume of memoirs by horace walpole -lrb- afterwards lord orford -rrb- which comprise the last nine year of george ii 's reign i be anxious to give you the refusal of they as i hear you have already express a wish to publish anything of this kind write by horace walpole and have indirectly convey that wish to lord waldegrave to whom these and many other mss of that lively and laborious writer belong lord lauderdale have offer to assist I in adjust the term of the agreement and perhaps you will arrange with he he live at warren 's hotel waterloo place where you can make it convenient to meet he i would meet you there or call at you house but before you can make any specific offer you will no doubt like to look at the mss which be here and which -lrb- not be mine -rrb- i do not like to expose unnecessarily to the risk even of a removal to london and back again i be sir you obedient humble servant etc vassall holland it would appear that mr murray call upon lord holland and look over the mss but make no proposal to purchase the papers the matter lay over until lord holland again address mr murray _ lord holland to john murray _ it appear that you be either not aware of the interesting nature of the mss which i show you or that the indifference produce by the present frenzy about the queen 's business -lrb- footnote : the trial of queen caroline be then occupy public attention -rrb- to all literary publication have discourage you from a undertaking in which you would otherwise engage most willingly however to come to the point i have consult lord waldegrave on the subject and we agree that the two work viz he grandfather lord waldegrave 's memoirs and horace walpole 's memoirs of the last nine year of george ii should not be sell for less than 3000 guinea if that sum would meet you idea or if you have any other offer to make i will thank you to let I know before the second of next month three thousand guinea be certainly a very large price to ask for the memoirs and mr murray hesitate very much before accede to lord holland 's proposal he request to have the mss for the purpose of consult he literary adviser -- probably mr croker though the follow remark now before we be not in he handwriting this book of yours say the critic be a singular production it be ill-written deficient in grammar and often in english and yet it interest and even amuse now the subject of it be all i suppose go _ ad plure _ otherwise it would be intolerable the writer richly deserve a lick or a cudgelling to every page and yet i be ashamed to say i have travel unwearied with he through the whole divide between a grin and a scowl i never see nor hear of such a animal as a splenetic bustling kind of a poco-curante by the way if you happen to hear of any plan for make I a king be so good as to say that i be deceased or tell any other good-natured lie to put the king-maker off they purpose i really can not submit to be the only slave in the nation especially when i have a cross to sweep within five yard of my door and may gain my bread with less ill-usage than a king be oblige to put up with if half that be here tell be true lord holland seem to I to tread on ` igne supposito cineri doloso ' in retouch any part of the manuscript he be so perfectly kind and good-natured that he will feel more than any man the complaint of partiality and injustice and where he be to stop i see not there be so much abuse that little be to be gain by a occasional erasure while suspicion be excite he would have consult he quiet more by leave the author to bear the blame of he own scandal notwithstanding this adverse judgment mr murray be dispose to buy the memoirs lord holland drive a very hard bargain and endeavor to obtain better term from other publisher but he could not and eventually mr murray pay to lord waldegrave through lord holland the sum of # 2500 on November 1 1821 for the waldegrave and walpole memoirs they be edit by lord holland who write a preface to each and be publish in the following year but never repay they expense after suffer considerable loss by this venture mr murray 's rights be sell after he death to mr colburn the last of the _ mmoires pour servir _ to which we shall here refer be the letter of the countess of suffolk bedchamber woman to the princess of wale -lrb- caroline of anspach -rrb- and a favorite of the prince of wale afterwards george ii the suffolk papers be admirably edit by mr croker thackeray in he lecture on george the second say of he work : even croker who edit she letter love she and have that regard for she with which she sweet graciousness seem to have inspire almost all man and some woman who come near she the follow letter of croker show the spirit in which he begin to edit the countess 's letter : _ mr croker to john murray _ _ may _ 29 1822 dear murray as you tell I that you be desirous of publish the suffolk volume by November and as i have all my life have a aversion to make any one wait for I i be anxious to begin my work upon they and if we be to be out by November i presume it be high time i must beg of you to answer I the follow question 1st what shape will you adopt i think the correspondence of a nature rather too light for a quarto and yet it would look well on the same shelf with horace walpole 's work if you should prefer a octavo like lady hervey 's letter the papers would furnish two volume i for my part should prefer the quarto size which be a great favorite with I and the letter of such person as pope swift and gay the duchess of buckingham queensberry and marlbro ' lord peterborough chesterfield bathurst and lansdowne messr pitt pulteney pelham grenville and horace walpole seem to I almost to justify the magnificence of the quarto though in truth all they epistle be in its narrowest sense _ familiar _ and treat chiefly of tittle-tattle decide however on you own view of you interest only recollect that these papers be not to cost you more than belshazzar -lrb- footnote : mr milman 's poem for which mr murray pay 500 guinea -rrb- which i take to be of about the intrinsic value of the _ writings on the wall _ and not a third of what you have give mr crayon for he portrait of squire bracebridge 2nd do you intend to have any portrait one of lady suffolk be almost indispensable and would be enough there be two of she at strawberry hill one i think a print and neither if i forget not very good there be also a print a unassuming one in walpole 's work but a good artist would make something out of any of these if even we can get nothing better to make we copy from if you be to increase you number of portrait i would add the duchess of queensberry from a picture at dalkeith which be allude to in the letter lady hervey and she beautiful friend mary bellenden they be in walpole 's work lady hervey rather mawkish but the bellenden charming i dare say these plate could now be buy cheap and retouch from the original which would make they better than ever they be lady vere -lrb- sister of lady temple which latter be engrave in park 's edition of the noble author -rrb- be a lively writer and be much distinguish in this correspondence of the man i should propose lord peterborough whose portrait be little known lord liverpool have one of he not however very characteristic mr pulteney be also little known but he have be lately re-publish in the kit-cat club of _ we horace _ there be not a decent engraving anywhere i presume that there must be a good original of he somewhere whatever you mean to do on this point you should come to a early determination and put the work in hand 3rd i mean if you approve to prefix a biographical sketch of mr howard and two or three of those beautiful character with which in prose and verse the greatest wit of the last century honor she and themselves to the first letter of each remarkable correspondent i would also affix a slight notice and i would add at the foot of the page note in the style of those on lady hervey let I know whether this plan suit you fancy 4th all the letter of swift except one or two in this collection be print -lrb- though not always accurately -rrb- in scott 's edition of he work yet i think it would be proper to reprint they from the original because they elucidate much of lady suffolk 's history and she correspondence could not be say to be complete without they let I know you wish on this point 5th my material be numerous though perhaps the piece of great merit be not many i must therefore beg of you to set up in the form and type you wish to adopt the sheet which i send you and you must say about how many page you wish you volume or volume to be i will then select as much of the most interesting as will fill the space which you may desire to occupy yours truly jw croker mr croker also consent to edit the letter of mr delany to mr hamilton 1779-88 contain many anecdote relate to the royal family _ mr croker to john murray _ i have show mr delany 's m letter to the prince regent he be much entertain with this revival of old time in he recollection and _ he say that every word of it be true _ you know that hrh have a wonderful memory and particularly for thing of that kind he certificate of mr delany 's veracity will therefore be probably of some weight with you as to the letter-writing power of mr delany the specimen incline I to doubt she style seem stiff and formal and though these two letter which describe a peculiar kind of scene have a good deal of interest in they i do not hope for the same amusement from the rest of the collection poverty obscurity general ill-health and blindness be but unpromising qualification for make a agreeable volume of letter if a shopkeeper at portsmouth be to write he life the extract of what relate to the two day of the imperial and royal visit of 1814 would be amusing though all the rest of the half century of he life would be intolerably tedious i therefore counsel you not to buy the pig in miss hamilton 's bag -lrb- though she be a most respectable lady -rrb- but ask to see the whole collection before you bid the whole collection be obtain and with some correction and elucidation the volume of letter be give to the world by mr murray in 1821 in may 1820 mr murray request mr croker to edit horace walpole 's reminiscence mr croker reply say : i should certainly like the task very well if i feel a little better satisfied of my ability to perform it something towards such a work i would certainly contribute for i have always love that kind of tea-table history not be able to undertake the work himself mr croker recommend mr murray to apply to miss berry the editor of lady russell 's letter the life he say by which those letter be precede be a beautiful piece of biography and show besides higher quality much of that taste which a commentator on the ` reminiscence ' ought to have the work be accordingly place in the hand of miss berry who edit it satisfactorily and it be publish by mr murray in the course of the following year dr tomline while bishop of winchester enter into a correspondence with mr murray respect the life of william pitt in December 1820 dr tomline say he have bring the memoirs down to the declaration of war by france against great britain on February i 1793 and that the whole would make two volume quarto until he become bishop of lincoln dr tomline have be pitt 's secretary and from the opportunity he have possess there be promise here of a great work but it be not well execute and though a continuation be promise it never appear when the work be send to mr gifford he write to mr murray that it be not at all what he expect for it contain nothing of pitt 's private history he seem to be uneasy until he get back to he parliamentary papers yet it can hardly fail to be pretty widely interesting but i would not have you make yourself too uneasy about these thing pitt 's name and the bishop 's will make the work sell gifford be right the life go to a fourth edition in the following year among mr murray 's devoted friend and adherent be giovanni belzonus who bear at padua in 1778 have when a young man at rome intend to devote himself to the monastic life but the french invasion of the city alter he purpose and instead of be a monk he become a athlete he be a man of gigantic physical power and go from place to place gain he living in england as elsewhere as a posture-master and by exhibit at show he great feat of strength he make enough by this work to enable he to visit egypt where he erect hydraulic machine for the pasha and through the influence of mr salt the british consul be employ to remove from thebe and ship for england the colossal bust commonly call the young memnon he knowledge of mechanic enable he to accomplish this with great dexterity and the head now in the british museum be one of the finest specimen of egyptian sculpture belzonus after perform this task make further investigation among the

investigation which in due course be issue under the title of narrative of the operation and recent discovery within the pyramid temple tomb and excavation in egypt and nubium it be a very expensive book to arrange and publish but nothing daunt mr murray when a new and original work be bring under he notice although only 1000 copy be print the payment to belzonus and he translator as well as for plate and engraving amount to over # 2163 the preparation of the work give rise to no little difficulty for belzonus decline all help beyond that of the individual who be employ to copy out or translate he manuscript and correct the press as i make my discovery alone he say i have be anxious to write my book by myself though in so do the reader will consider I with great propriety guilty of temerity but the public will perhaps gain in the fidelity of my narration what it lose in elegance lord byron to whom mr murray send a copy of he work say : belzonus _ be _ a grand traveller and he english be very prettily broken belzonus be a very interesting character and a man of great natural refinement after the publication of he work he become one of the fashionable lion of london but be very sensitive about he early career and very sedulous to sink the posture-master in the traveller he be often present at mr murray 's reception and on one particular occasion he be invite to join the family circle in albemarle street on the last evening of 1822 to see the old year out and the new year in all mr murray 's young people be present as well as the entire d'israeli family and crofton

we kind host perceive with infinite zest give we punch at we supper to keep up the jest the line be pronounced to be excellent and belzonus wish to share in the enjoyment desire to see the word he read the last line twice over and then he eye flash fire he exclaim i be betray and suddenly leave the room crofton croker call upon belzonus to ascertain the reason for he abrupt departure from mr murray 's and be inform that he consider the line to be a insulting allusion to he early career as a showman croker assure he that neither murray nor d'israeli know anything of he former life finally he prevail upon belzonus to accompany he to mr murray 's who for the first time learn that the celebrated egyptian explorer have many year before be a itinerant exhibitor in england in 1823 belzonus set out for morocco intend to penetrate thence to eastern africa he write to mr murray from gibraltar thank he for many act of kindness and again from tangier _ mg belzonus to john murray _ _ April _

introduction from mr wilmot to mr dougla have be of much importance to I this gentleman fortunately find pleasure in afford I all the assistance in he power to promote my wish a circumstance which i have not be accustom to meet in some other part of africa i shall do myself the pleasure to acquaint you of my further progress at fez if not from some other part of morocco belzonus would appear to have change he intention and endeavor to penetrate to timbuctoo from benin where however he be attack by dysentery and die a short time after the above letter be write like many other man of herculean power he be not eager to exhibit he strength but on one occasion he give proof of it in the follow circumstance mr murray have ask he to accompany he to the coronation of george iv they have ticket of admittance to westminster hall but on arrive there they find that the sudden advent of queen caroline attend by a mob claim admission to the abbey have alarm the authority who cause all the door to be shut that by which they should have enter be hold close and guard by several stalwart janitor belzonus thereupon advance to the door and in spite of the effort of these guardian include tom crib and other of the pugilistic corps who have be engage as constable open it with ease and admit himself and mr murray in 1820 mr murray be invite to publish the fall of jerusalem a sacred tragedy by the rev hh milman afterwards dean of st paul 's as usual he consult mr gifford whose opinion be most favourable i have be more and more strike he say with the innumerable beauty in milman 's ` fall of jerusalem ' mr murray request the author to state he own price for the copyright and mr milman write : i be totally at a loss to fix one i think i might decide whether a offer be exceedingly high or exceedingly low whether a byron or scott price or such as be give to the first essay of a new author though the ` fall of jerusalem ' might demand a israelitish bargain yet i shall not be a jew further than my poetry make a liberal offer such as the prospect will warrant and i will at once reply but i be neither able nor inclined to name a price as i be at present not very far advance in life i may hereafter have further dealings with the press and of course where i meet with liberality shall hope to make a return in the same way it have be rather a favorite scheme of mine though this drama can not appear on the board to show it before it be publish to my friend mr siddon who perhaps might like to read it either at home or abroad i have not even hint at such a thing to she so that this be mere uncertainty and before it be print it would be in vain to think of it as the old lady 's eye and m could never agree together p -- i ought to have say that i be very glad of aristarchus ' -lrb- grifford 's -rrb- approval and by the way i think if i help you in redeem you character from ` don juan ' the ` hetaerse ' in the _ quarterly _ -lrb- footnote : mitchell 's article on female society in greece _ qr _ no 43 -rrb- etc you ought to estimate that very highly mr murray offer mr milman five hundred guinea for the copyright to which the author reply : you offer appear to I very fair and i shall have no scruple in accede to it milman in addition to numerous play and poem become a contributor to the _ quarterly _ and one of murray 's historian he write the history of the jew and the history of christianity he edit gibbon and horace and continue during he lifetime to be one of mr murray 's most intimate and attach friend in 1820 we find the first mention of a name afterwards to become as celebrate as any of those with which mr murray be associate owe to the warm friendship which exist between the murray and the d'israelis the younger member of both family be constantly bring together on the most intimate term mr murray be among the first to mark the ability of the boy benjamin disraelus and as would appear from the subjoined letter he confidence in he ability be so firm that he consult he as to the merit of a m when he have scarcely reach he eighteenth year _ mr benjamin disraelus to john murray _ _ August _ 1822 dear sir i run my eye over three act of wallace -lrb- footnote : wallace : a historical tragedy in five act be publish in 1820 joanna baillie speak of the author ce walker as a very young and promising dramatist -rrb- and as far as i could form a opinion i can not conceive these act to be as effective on the stage as you seem to expect however it be impossible to say what a very clever actor like macready may make of some of the passage notwithstanding the many erasure the diction be still diffuse and sometimes languish though not inelegant i can not imagine it a powerful work as far as i have read but indeed run over a part of a thing with people talk around be too unfair i shall be anxious to hear how it succeed many thanks dear sir for lend it to I you note arrive if on so slight a knowledge of the play i could venture to erase either of the word you set before I i fear it would be _ yes _ but i feel cruel and wicked in say so i hope you get you dinner in comfort when you get rid of I and that gentle pyramid -lrb- belzonus -rrb- yours truly bd mr southey be a indefatigable and elaborate correspondent and as he letter have already be publish it be not necessary to quote they he rarely write to mr gifford who cut down he article and as southey insist generally emasculate they by omit the best portion two extract may be give from those write to mr murray in 1820 which do not seem yet to have be give to the world the first in reference to a propose life of warren hasting : it appear to I that the proper plan will be to publish a selection from warren hasting 's papers and correspondence accompany it with he life that life require a compendious view of we indian history down to the time of he administration and in its progress it embrace the preservation of we indian empire and the establishment of the exist system something must be interwoven concern the history of the native power mahomedan moor mahratta etc and they institution i see how all this be to be introduce and see also that no subject can afford material more important or more various and what a pleasure it will be to read the triumph of such a man as hasting over the tremendous combination of he persecutor at home i have a noble catastrophe in write the life of nelson but the latter day of hasting afford a scene more touching and perhaps more sublime because it be more uncommon let I have the work of orme and bruce and mill and i will set apart a portion of every day to the course of reading and begin my note accordingly the second touch on he perennial grievance against gifford : you will really serve as well as oblige I if you will let I have a duplicate set of proof of my article that i may not _ lose _ the passage which mr gifford in spite of repeat promise always will strike out in the last paper among many other mutilation the most useful _ fact _ in the essay for its immediate practical application have be omit and for no imaginable reason -lrb- the historical fact that it be the read a calumnious libel which induce felton to murder the duke of buckingham -rrb- when next i touch upon public affair for you i will break the whig upon the wheel mr graham afterwards lady callcott then the wife of

most valuable acquaintance on my return to london a business in liverpool in which with he brother he be a partner prove a failure and in 1818 he be engage on he famous sketch book which he write in england and send to he brother ebenezer in new york to be publish there the work appear in three part in the course of the year 1819 several of the article be copy in english periodical and be read with great admiration a writer in _ blackwood _ express surprise that mr irving have think fit to publish he sketch book in america earlier than in britain and predict a large and eager demand for such a work on this encouragement irving who be still in england take the first three number which have already appear in america to mr murray and leave they with he for examination and approval murray excuse himself on the ground that he do not consider the work in question likely to form the basis of satisfactory account and without this he have no satisfaction in undertake to publish irving thereupon seek -lrb- but do not take -rrb- the advice of sir w scott and enter into a arrangement with miller of the burlington arcade and in February 1820 the first four number be publish in a volume miller shortly after become bankrupt the sale of the book -lrb- of which one thousand have be print -rrb- be interrupted and irving 's hope of profit be dash to the ground at this juncture walter scott who be then in london come to he help i call to he for help as i be stick in the mire and more propitious than hercule he put he own shoulder to the wheel through he favourable representation murray be quickly induce to undertake the future publication of the work which he have previously decline a further edition of the first volume be put to press and from that time murray become my publisher conduct himself in all he dealings with that fair open and liberal spirit which have obtain for he the well-merited appellation of the prince of bookseller -lrb- footnote : preface

try to induce mr murray to republish jame fenimore cooper 's novel in england mr murray feel oblige to decline as he find that these work be pirate by other publisher american author be then begin to experience the same treatment in england which english author have suffer in america the wonder be that washington irving 's work so long escape the same doom in 1819 mr murray first make the acquaintance of ugo foscolo a native of zante descend from a venetian family who have settle in the ionian island foscolo study at padua and afterwards take up he residence at venice the ancient

1805 form part of the army of england assemble at boulogne but soon leave the army go to pavia -lrb- where he have be appoint professor of eloquence -rrb- and eventually at the age of forty take refuge in england here he find many friend who support he in he literary effort among other he call upon mr murray who desire he co-operation in write for the _ quarterly _ a article on the poem of the italian be he first contribution mr thoma mitchell the translator of aristophane desire mr murray to give foscolo he congratulation upon he excellent essay as well as on he acquaintance with we language _ mr thoma mitchell to john murray _ the first time i have the pleasure of see m foscolo be at a _ table d'hte _ at berne there be something in he physiognomy which very much attract nay notice and for some reason or another i think that i seem to be a object of he attention at table foscolo be seat next to a young hanoverian between whom and I a very learn conversation have pass on the precede evening and a certain degree of acquaintance be cement in consequence the table be that day grace with the appearance of some of the court lady of stuttgard and all pass off with the decorum usually observe abroad when suddenly towards the conclusion of the feast a violent hubbub be hear between m foscolo and he hanoverian neighbor who in angry term and with violent gesture respectively assert the superior harmony of greek and latin this end with the former 's suddenly produce a card accompany with the follow annunciation : ` sir my name be ugo foscolo i be a native of greece and i have reside thirty year in italy i therefore think i ought to know something of the matter this card contain my address and if you have anything further to say you know where i be to be find ' whether foscolo 's name or manner daunt the young hanoverian or whether he be only a bird of passage i do not know but we see nothing more of he after that day foscolo after the lady have retire make a apology direct a good deal to I who by the form of the place happen to be at the head of the table a considerable degree of intimacy take place between we and a excellent man i believe he to be in spite of these little ebullition ugo foscolo who be eccentric to a excess and very extravagant have many attach friend though he try they sorely to mr murray he become one of the trouble of private as well as publish life he have a mania for building and a mania for ornamentation but he be very short of money for carry out he freak he think himself at the same time to be perfectly moderate simple and sweet-tempered he take a house in south bank regent 's park which he name digamma cottage -- from he have contribute to the _ quarterly review _ a article on the digamma -- and fit it up in extravagant style foscolo could scarcely live at peace with anybody and as the result of one of he numerous altercation he have to fight a duel we be lady dacre write to murray -lrb- December 1823 -rrb- to have the whole of foscolo 's duel to-morrow he tell I that it be not about a ` fair lady ' : thank heaven foscolo be one of mr murray 's inveterate correspondent -- about lecture about translation about building about debt about loan and about borrowing on one occasion mr murray receive from he a letter of thirteen page quarto a few sentence of this may be worth quote : _ mr foscolo to john murray _ south bank _ August _ 20 1822 during six year -lrb- for i land in england the 10th September 1816 -rrb- i have constantly labor under difficulty the most distressing no one know they so well as yourself because no one come to my assistance with so warm a friendship or with care so constant and delicate my difficulty have become more perplexing since the government both of the ionian island and italy have preclude even the possibility of my return to the country where a slender income would be sufficient and where i would not be under the necessity of make a degrading use of my faculty i be bear a racehorse and after near forty year of successful racing i be now draw the waggon -- nay to be the teacher of french to my copyist and the critic of english to my translators-to write sophistry about criticism which i always consider a sort of literary quackery and to put together paltry article for work which i never read indeed if i have not undergo the doom of almost all individual whose situation become suddenly oppose to they feeling and habit and if i be not yet a lunatic i must thank the mechanical strength of my nerve my nerve however will not withstand the threatening of shame which i have always contemplate with terror time and fortune have teach I to meet all other evil with fortitude but i grow every day more and more a coward at the idea of the approach of a stigma on my character and as now i must live and die in england and get the greater part of my subsistence from my labor i ought to reconcile if not labor with literary reputation at least labor and life with a spotless name he then go on to state that he debt amount to # 600 or thereabout include a sum of # 20 which he owe to mr murray himself then he must have the money necessary for he subsistence and he find he can not live on less than # 400 per annum my apartment he continue decently furnished encompass I with a atmosphere of ease and respectability and i enjoy the illusion of not have fall into the lowest circumstance i always declare that i will die like a gentleman on a decent bed surround by cast -lrb- as i can not buy the marble -rrb- of the venus of the apollo and of the grace and the bust of great man nay even among flower and if possible with some graceful innocent girl play a old pianoforte in a adjoining room and thus die the hero of my novel far from court the sympathy of mankind i would rather be forget by posterity than give it the gratification of ejaculate preposterous sigh because i die like camoen and tasso on the bed of a hospital and since i must be bury in you country i be happy in have insure for I the possession during the remains of my life of a cottage build after my plan surround by flowering shrub almost within the tumpike of the town and yet as quiet as a country-house and open to the free air whenever i can freely dispose of a hundred pound i will also build a small dwelling for my corpse under a beautiful oriental plane-tree which i mean to plant next November and cultivate _ con amore _ so far i be indeed a epicure in all other thing i be the most moderate of man the upshot of the letter be that he wish mr murray to let he have # 1000 to be repay in five year he meanwhile write article for the _ quarterly _ -- one-half of the payment to be leave with the publisher and the remain half to be add to he personal income he conclude : in seek out a way of salvation i think it incumbent on I to prevent the tyranny of necessity that i might not be compel by it to endanger my character and the interest of a friend whose kindness i have always experience and whose assistance i be once more oblige to solicit mr murray pay off some of he more press embarrassment -- # 30 to messr bentley for bill not take up # 33 7_s _ to mr kelly the printer # 14 to mr antoninus and # 50 to foscolo 's builder -- besides become security for # 300 to he banker -lrb- with whom foscolo do business -rrb- in order to ensure he a respite for six month on the other hand foscolo agree to insure he life for # 600 as a sort of guarantee be ever impecunious author so trust before at this crisis in he affair many friend come about he and take a interest in the patriot mr hallam and mr wilbraham offer he money but he would not accept gratuity from they though he have no objection to accept they loan arrangement be then make for foscolo to deliver a series of lecture on italian literature everything be settle the day arrive the room be crowd with a distinguished assembly when at the last moment foscolo appear without he m which he have forget the course of lecture however which have be design to relieve he from the pressure of he debt prove successful and bring he in it be say as much as # 1000 whereupon he immediately set to work to squander he earnings by give a public breakfast to he patron for which purpose he think it incumbent on he amongst other expense to make a new approach and a gravelled carriage road to digamma cottage ugo foscolo live on credit to the end of he life surround by all that be luxurious and beautiful how he contrived it no one know for he resource remain at the lowest ebb perhaps he friend help he for english liberal of good means regard he as a martyr in the cause of freedom one who would never bow the knee to baal and who have dare the first napoleon when he very word be law but foscolo 's friend without doubt become tired of he extravagance and he licentious habit and fall away from he disease at last find he out he die of dropsy at turnham green near hammersmith in 1827 when only in the fiftieth year of he age and be bury in chiswick churchyard but in June 1871 he body be exhume and convey to florence where he be bury in santa croce between the tomb of alfierus and the monument of dante lady caroline lamb have continue to keep up she intimacy with mr murray and now that she be prepare a new work for the press she correspondence increase while he be at wimbledon during summer she occasionally meet literary friend at he house she have already publish glenarvon the hero of which be suppose to represent lord byron and be now ready with penruddock i be in great anxiety she write to mr murray about you not inform I what gifford say i think it might be a civil way of give I my death-warrant -- if ` penruddock ' do not whether the criticism of mr gifford be too severe or whether mr murray be so much engage in business and correspondence as to take no notice of lady caroline lamb 's communication do not appear but she feel the neglect and immediately follow it up with another letter as follow : _ lady caroline lamb to john murray _ _ December 8 1822 _ my dear and most obstinately silent sir from one until nine upon Tuesday i shall be at melbourne house wait for you but if you wish to see the prettiest woman in england -- besides myself and william -- be at melbourne house at quarter to six at which hour we dine and if you will come at half-past one or two or three to say you will dine and to ask I to forgive you inexorable and inhuman conduct pray do for i arrive at twelve in that say home and leave it at nine the ensue morning what can have happen to you that you will not write the following letter from william lamb -lrb- afterwards lord melbourne -rrb- the long-suffering and generous husband of this wayward lady refer to a novel entitle ada real _ the honble william lamb to john murray _ _ December 20 1822 _ the incongruity of and objection to the story of ` ada reis ' can only be get over by power of write beauty of sentiment striking and effective situation etc if mr gifford think there be in the first two volume anything of excellence sufficient to overbalance they manifest fault i still hope that he will press upon lady caroline the absolute necessity of carefully reconsider and revise the third volume and particularly the conclusion of the novel mr gifford i dare say will agree with I that since the time of lucian all the representation of the infernal region which have be attempt by satirical writer such as ` fielding 's journey from this world to the next ' have be feeble and flat the sketch in ada real be commonplace in its observation and altogether insufficient and it would not do now to come with a decisive failure in a attempt of considerable boldness i think if it be think that anything could be do with the novel and that the fault of its design and structure can be get over that i could put she in the way of write up this part a little and give it something of strength spirit and novelty and of make it at once more moral and more interesting i wish you would communicate these my hasty suggestion to mr gifford and he will see the propriety of press lady caroline to take a little more time to this part of the novel she will be guide by he authority and she fault at present be to be too hasty and too impatient of the trouble of correct and recast what be faulty ada real be publish in march 1823 another of england 's prime minister lord john russell have in contemplation a history of europe and consult mr murray on the subject a first volume entitle the affair of europe be publish without the author 's name on the title-page and a few year later another volume be publish but it remain a unfinished work lord john be a ambitious and restless author without steady perseverance in any branch of literature he go from poem to tragedy from tragedy to memoirs then to history tale translation of part of the odyssey essay -lrb- by the gentleman who leave he lodgings -rrb- and then to memoirs and history again mr croker say of he don carlo : it be not easy to find any poetry or even oratory of the present day deliver with such cold and heavy diction such distorted trope and disjointed limb of simile wear to the bone long ago another work that excite greater interest than lord john russell 's anonymous history be mr jame morier 's hajjus

among the teacher throughout the country until at length it obtain a very large and regular circulation the book have subsequently undergo frequent revision and down to the present date it continue to be a great favorite especially in lady ' school chapter xxiii gifford 's retirement from the editorship of the quarterly -- and death it have for some time be evident as have be show in a previous chapter that gifford be become physically incapable of carry on the editorship of the _ quarterly review _ but a occasional respite from the pressure of sickness as well as he own unwillingness to abandon he connection with a work which he regard with paternal affection and murray 's difficulty in find a worthy successor combine to induce he to remain at he post he accordingly undertake to carry on he editorial duty till the publication of the 60th number aid and support by the active energy of barrow and croker who in conjunction with the publisher do most of the necessary drudgery in December 1823 canning have write to say that he be in bed with the gout to this gifford reply : my dear can i wish you have a pleasanter bedfellow but here be i on the sofa with a cough and a very disagreeable associate i find it old moore i think die all but he voice and my voice be nearly dead before I in other respects i be much as i be when you see I and this weather be in my favor i have promise murray to try to carry on the _ review _ to the 60th number the 58th be now nearly finish this seem a desperate promise and beyond it i will not can not go for at best as the old philosopher say i be die at my ease as my complaint have take a consumptive turn the vulture already scent the carcase and three or four _ quarterly review _ be about to start one be to be set up by haygarth whom i think i once mention to you as talk of to succeed I but he be now in open hostility to murray another be to be call the _ westminster quarterly review _ and will if i may judge from the profession of impartiality be a decide opposition journal they will all have they little day perhaps and then drop into the grave of they predecessor the worst be that we can not yet light upon a fit and promising successor ever my dear can faithfully and affectionately yours william gifford this state of matter could not be allow to go on much longer sometimes a quarter pass without a number appear in 1824 only two _ quarterly _ appear -- no 60 due in January but only publish in August and no 61 due in April but publish in December a expostulation come from croker to murray -lrb- January 23 1824 -rrb- : have you make up _ you mind _ about a editor southey have write to I on the subject as if you have and as if he know you choice i do not like to answer he before i know what i be to say will you dine at kensington on Sunday at 6 southey have long be meditate about the editorship it never appear to have be actually offer to he but he name as we have already see be often mention in connection with it he prefer however go on with he own work and remain a contributor only politics too may have influence he for we find he write to mr murray on December 15 1824 : the time can not be far distant when the _ qr _ must take its part upon a most momentous subject and choose between mr canning and the church i have always consider it as one of the greatest error in the management of the _ review _ that it should have be silent upon that subject so long so far as regard he position as a contributor southey express he opinion to murray explicitly : _ mr southey to john murray _ _ October 25 1824 _ no future editor be he who he may must expect to exercise the same discretion over my papers which mr gifford have do i will at any time curtail what may be deem too long and consider any objection that may be make with a disposition to defer to they when it can be do without sacrifice my own judgment upon point which may seem to I important but my age and -lrb- i may add without arrogance -rrb- the rank which i hold in literature entitle I to say that i will never again write under the correction of any one gifford 's resignation be announce in the follow letter to canning -lrb- September 8 1824 -rrb- : _ mr w gifford to the rt hon g canning _ _ September 8 1824 _ my dear can i have lay aside my regalia and king gifford first of the name be now no more as sir andrew aguecheek say than a ordinary mortal or a christian it be necessary to tell you this for with the exception of a dark cloud which have come over murray 's brow no prodigy in earth or air as far as i have hear have announce it it be now exactly sixteen year ago since you letter invite or encourage I to take the throne i do not mount it without a tremble fit but i be promise support and i have be nobly support as far as regard myself i have bear my faculty soberly if not meekly i have resist with undeviating firmness every attempt to encroach upon I every solicitation of publisher author friend or friend 's friend and turn not a jot aside for power or delight in consequence of this integrity of purpose the review have long possess a degree of influence not only in this but in other country hitherto unknown and i have the satisfaction at this late hour of see it in its most palmy state no number have sell better than the sixtieth but there be a sad tale to tell for the last three year i have perceive the mastery which disease and age be acquire over a constitution batter and tear at the best and have be perpetually urge murray to look about for a successor while i begged coplestone blomfield and other to assist the search all have be ineffectual murray indeed have be foolishly flattering himself that i might be cajole on from number to number and have not therefore exert himself as he ought to have do but the rest have be in earnest do you know any one i once think of robert grant but he prove timid and indeed he saintly propensity would render he suspect reginald heber whom i should have prefer to any one be snatch from I for a far higher object i have be offer a doctor 's degree and when i decline it on account of my inability to appear in public my own college -lrb- exeter -rrb- most kindly offer to confer it on I in private that be at the rector 's lodgings this too i decline and beg the dean of westminster who have a living in the neighborhood to excuse I as handsomely as he could it might for aught i know be a hard race between a shroud and a gown which shall get I first at any rate it be too late for honor faithfully and affectionately yours william gifford mr jt coleridge have long be regard as the most eligible successor to mr gifford and on he the choice now fall mr murray forward the reply of mr coleridge which contain he acceptance of the editorship to mr gifford accompany by the follow note : _ john murray to mr gifford _ whitehall place _ December 11 1824 _ my dear sir i shall not attempt to express the feeling with which i communicate the enclosed answer to the proposal which i suspect it would have be think contemptible in I any longer to have delay and all that i can find to console myself with be the hope that i may be able to evince my gratitude to you during life and to you memory if it so please the almighty that i be to be the survivor i be you obliged and faithful servant john murray mr murray lose no time in inform he friend of the new arrangement gifford live for about two year more and continue to entertain many kind thought of he friend and fellow-contributor : he intercourse with he publisher be as close and intimate as ever to the end the last month of gifford 's life be but a slow die he be sleepless feverish oppress by a extreme difficulty of breathing which often entirely deprive he of speech and he sight have fail towards the end of he life he would sometimes take up a pen and after a vain attempt to write would throw it down say no my work be do even think cause he pain as he last hour draw near he mind begin to wander these book have drive I mad he once say i must read my prayer he pass gradually away he pulse cease to beat five hour before he death and then he sleep out of life on December 31 1826 in he 68th year -- a few month before the death of canning mr gifford desire that he should be bury in the ground attach to grosvenor chapel south audley street where he have inter annie davy he faithful old housekeeper but he friend make application for he interment in westminster abbey which be accede to and he be bury there accordingly on January 8 1827 immediately under the monument of camden and garrick he be much richer at the time of he death than he be at all aware of for he be perfectly indifferent about money indeed he several time return money to mr murray say that he have be too liberal he leave # 25000 of personal property a considerable part of which he leave to the relative of mr cookesley the surgeon of ashburton who have be to he so faithful and self-denying a friend in he early life to mr murray he leave # 100 as a memorial and also 500 guinea to enable he to reimburse a military gentleman to whom jointly with mr cookesley he appear to have be bind for that sum at a former period gifford have earn but it be now generally recognize that he have unjustly earn the character of a severe if not a bitter critic possess a unusually keen discernment of genuine excellence and a scathing power of denunciation of what be false or bad in literature he form he judgment in accordance with a very high standard of merit sir walter scott say of he baviad and mviad that he squashed at one blow a set of coxcomb who might have humbug the world long enough he critical temper however be in truth exceptionally equable regard it as he duty to encourage all that be good and elevate and relentlessly to denounce all that be bad or tend to lower the tone of literature he conscientiously act up to the standard by which he judge other and never allow personal feeling to intrude upon he official judgment it need scarcely be say that he prove himself a excellent editor and that he entertain a high idea of the duty of that office william jerdan who be introduce to gifford by canning say : i speak of he as he always be to I -- full of gentleness a sagacious adviser and instructor upon so comprehensive a scale that i never meet he superior among the man of the age most renowned for vast information and he captivating power in communicate it he sagacity and quickness of apprehension be remarkable as be also the extraordinary rapidity with which he be able to eviscerate a work and summarize its contents in a few page the number of article which he himself write be comparatively small for he confine himself for the most part to revise and improve the criticism of other and though in thus deal with article submit to he he frequently erase what the writer consider some of they best criticism he never lose they friendship and support he dislike incur any obligation which might in any degree shackle the expression of he free opinion in conjunction with mr murray he lay down a rule which as we have already see be advocate by scott and to which no exception have ever be make that every writer in the _ quarterly _ should receive payment for he contribution on one occasion when a gentleman in office would not receive the money the article be return i be not more certain of many conjecture say jerdan than i be of this that he never propagate a dishonest opinion nor do a dishonest act gifford take no notice of the ferocious attack make upon he by hunt and hazlitt holding as he do that inviolable secrecy be one of the prime function of a editor -- though the practice have since become very different -- he never attempt to vindicate himself or to reveal the secret as to the writer of the review in accordance with he plan of secrecy he desire dr ireland he executor to destroy all confidential letter especially those relate to the _ review _ so that the name of the author as well as the price pay for each article might never be know in society of which he see but little except at mr murray 's he be very entertaining he tell a story remarkably well and have a inexhaustible supply the archness of he eye and countenance make they all equally good he have never be marry but although he have no child he have a exceed love for they when well he delight in give juvenile party and rejoice at see the child frisk about in the happiness of youth -- a contrast which throw the misery of he own early life into strange relief he domestic favorite be he dog and he cat both of which he dearly love he be also most kind and generous to he domestic servant and all who know he well sorrowfully lament he death many year after gifford 's death a venomous article upon he appear in a london periodical the chief point of this anonymous attack be contain in certain extract from the writings of sir w scott southey and other eminent contemporary of mr gifford mr rw hay one of the oldest contributor to the _ quarterly _ be at that time still live and in allusion to the article in question he write to mr murray 's son : _ mr rw hay to mr murray _ _ July 7 1856 _ it be wholly worthless excepting as it contain stricture of sir w scott southey and john wilson on the critical character of the late wm gifford i by no means subscribe to all that be say by these distinguish individual on the subject and i can not help suspect that the high station in literature which they occupy render they more than commonly sensitive to the correction and erasure which be propose by the editor sir walter -lrb- great man as he be -rrb- be perfectly capable of write so carelessly as to require correction and both southey and john wilson might occasionally have bring forth opinion on political and other matter which be not in keep with the general tone of the _ quarterly review _ that poor gifford be deform in figure feeble in health unhappily for he there can be no deny but that he have any pleasure in torment as assert by some that he indulge in needless criticism without any regard to the feeling of those who be under he lash i be quite satisfied can not justly be maintain in my small dealings with the _ review _ i only find the editor most kind and considerate he amendment and alteration i generally at once concur in and i especially remember in one of the early article that he diminish the number of latin quotation very much to its advantage that he heart be quite in the right place i have have perfect means of know from more than one circumstance _ eg _ he anxiety for the welfare of he friend hoppner the painter 's child be display in the variety of mode which he adopt to assist they and when john gait be sorely maltreat in the _ review _ in consequence of he have attribute to I incorrectly a article which occasion he wrath and indignation and afterwards be expose to many embarrassment in life gifford most kindly take up he cause and do all he could to further the promotion of he family that we poor friend should have be expose throughout the most part of he life to the strong dislike of the greatest part of the community be not unnatural as the _ redacteur _ of the _ anti-jacobin _ etc he in the latter part of the last century draw upon himself the hostile attack of all the modern philosopher of the age and of all those who hail with applause the dawn of liberty in the french revolution as editor of the _ quarterly review _ he acquire in addition to the former host of enemy the undisguised hatred of all the whig and liberal who be for make peace with bonaparte and for destroy the settle order of thing in this country in the present generation when the feeling of national hatred against france have entirely subside and party feeling have so much go by that no man can say to which party any public man belong it be impossible for anyone to comprehend the state of public feeling which prevail during the great war of the revolution and for some year after its termination gifford be deeply imbue with all the sentiment on public matter which prevail in he time and as some people have a hatred of a cat and other of a toad so we friend feel uneasy when a frenchman be name and buckle on he armor of criticism whenever a liberal or even a whig be bring under he notice and although in the present day there appear to be a greater indulgence to crime amongst judge and jury and perhaps a more lenient system of criticism be adopt by reviewer i be not sure that any public advantage be gain by have ticket of leave man who ought to be in new south wale let loose upon the english world by the unchecked appearance of a vast deal of spurious literature which ought to have wither under the severe blast of criticism believe yours very truly rw hay chapter xxiv the representative mr murray have for long be desirous of publish a journal which should appear more frequently than once a quarter more especially after the discontinuance of he interest in blackwood 's magazine in 1825 he conceive the more ambitious design of publish a daily morning paper a project now chiefly interesting from the fact that in this venture he have the assistance of the future lord beaconsfield the intimacy which exist between the murray and d'israeli have afford mr murray exceptional opportunity of form a opinion of benjamin 's character and he see with delight the rapidly develop capacity of he old friend 's son even in he eighteenth year benjamin be consult by mr murray as to the merit of a m and two year later he write a novel entitle aylmer papillon which do not see the light he also edit a history of paul jone admiral in the russian navy write by theophilus smart a american and originally publish in the united state young disraelus be already gifted with a power of influence other unusual in a man of he age he be eloquent persuasive and ingenious and even then as in future year when he become a lead figure in the political world he have the power of draw other over to the view which he entertain however different they might be from they own look merely to he literary career as a successful novel writer he correspondence with mr murray about he proposed work of aylmer papillon be not without interest _ mr benjamin disraelus to john murray _ _ may _ 1824 my dear sir you very kind letter induce I to trouble you with this most trivial of trifle my plan have be in these few page so to mix up any observation which i have to make on the present state of society with the bustle and hurry of a story that my satire should never be protrude on my reader if you will look at the last chapter but one entitle lady modeley 's you will see what i mean better than i can express it the first page of that chapter i have write in the same manner as i would a common novel but i have endeavor to put in _ action _ at the _ end _ the present fashion of get on in the world i write no humbug about candidly give you opinion etc etc you must be aware that you can not do I a greater favor than refuse to publish it if you think _ it will not do _ and who should be a better judge than yourself believe I ever to be my dear sir you most faithful and obliged b disraelus -lrb- footnote : it will be observe that while the father maintain the older spelling of the name the son invariably write it thus -rrb- p -- the second and the last chapter be unfortunately mislay but they have no particular connection with the story they be both very short the first contain a adventure on the road and the last mr papillon 's banishment under the alien act from a ministerial misconception of a metaphysical sonnet Thursday morn : excuse want of seal as we be do a bit of summer to-day and there be not a fire in the house frederick place _ may _ 25 1824 1\/2 past 1 o'clock be my dear sir the travels to which i allude this morning would not bind up with parry since a moderate duodecimo would contain the adventure of a certain mr aylmer papillon in a _ terra incognita _ i certainly should never have mention

to anybody believe I to be my dear sir you very faithful and obliged servant b disraelus frederick place _ June _ 1824 my dear sir until i receive you note this morning i have flatter myself that my indiscretion have be forget it be to I a matter of great regret that as appear by you letter any more trouble should be give respect this unfortunate m which will most probably be consider too crude a production for the public and which if it be even imagine to possess any interest be certainly too late for this season and will be obsolete in the next i think therefore that the sooner it be put behind the fire the better and as you have some small experience in burn mss -lrb- footnote : byron 's memoirs have be burn at albemarle street during the precede month -rrb- you will be perhaps so kind as to consign it to the flame once more apologise for all the trouble i have give you i remain ever my dear sir yours very faithfully b disraelus murray have a special regard for the remarkable young man and by degree have thoroughly take he into he confidence have relate to he he experience of man and affair and ere long begin to consult he about a variety of scheme and project these long confidential communication lead eventually to the suggestion of a much more ambitious and hazardous scheme the establishment of a daily paper in the conservative interest daring as this must appear murray be encourage in it by the recollection of the success which have attend the foundation of the _ quarterly _ and believe rashly that he personal energy and resource aid by the ability display by he young counsellor would lead to equal success he evidently have too superficially weigh the enormous difficulty of this far greater undertaking and the vast difference between the conduct of a _ quarterly review _ and a daily newspaper intent upon gain a position in the world benjamin disraelus see a prospect of advance he own interests-by obtain the influential position of director of a conservative daily paper which he fully imagine be destine to equal the _ time _ and he succeed in imbue murray with the like fallacious hope the emancipation of the colony of spain in south america in 1824-25 give rise to much speculation in the money market in the expectation of develop the resource of that country especially its mine share stock and loan be issue to a unlimited extent mr benjamin disraelus seem to have throw himself into the vortex for he become connect with at least one financial firm in the city that of messr powle and employ he ability in write several pamphlet on the subject this lead to he induce messr powle to embark with he in the scheme of a daily paper at length a arrangement be enter into by which john murray jd powle and benjamin disraelus be to become the joint proprietor of the propose new journal the arrangement be as follow : memorandum london _ August _ 3 1825 the undersign party agree to establish a morning paper the property in which be to be

representative _ as the first number be to appear in January 1826 there be little time to be lose in make the necessary arrangement for its publication in the first place a able editor have to be find and perhaps of almost equal importance a able subeditor trustworthy reporter have to be engage foreign and home correspondent have also to be select with care a printing office have to be take all the necessary plant and apparatus have to be provide and a staff of man bring together preliminary to the opening day the most important point in connection with the propose journal be to find the editor mr murray have be so ably assist by sir walter scott in the projection of the _ quarterly review _ that he resolve to consult he on the subject and this mission be undertake by benjamin disraelus part proprietor of the intended daily journal though he be then only twenty year old it be hope that mr lockhart sir walter scott 's son-in-law might be induce to undertake the editorship the follow be mr

such a extreme bustle and so delightfully gay it be a perfect carnival i postpone my journey from five in the morning to eleven and by so do get a hour for the minster where i witness a scene which must have far surpass by all account the celebrated commemoration in westminster abbey york minster baffle all conception westminster abbey be a toy to it i think it be impossible to conceive of what gothic architecture be susceptible until you see york i speak with cathedral of the netherland and the rhine fresh in my memory i witness in york another splendid sight -- the pour in of all the nobility and gentry of the neighborhood and the neighbouring county the four-in-hand of the yorkshire squire the splendid rivalry in livery and outrider and the immense quantity of gorgeous equipage -- number with four horse -- form a scene which you can only witness in the mighty and aristocratic county of york it beat a drawing room hollow as much as a oratorio in york minster do a concert in the opera house this delightful stay at york quite refresh I and i be not the least fatigue by my journey as i have only be in edinburgh a few hour of course i have little to say i shall write immediately that anything occur kindest remembrance to mr murray and all ever yours bd i find froissart a most entertaining companion just the fellow for a traveller 's evening and just the work too

doubtless receive it safe as i consider you be anxious to hear minutely of the state of my operation i again send you a few line i receive this morning a very polite letter from l -lrb- ockhart -rrb- he have just receive that morning -lrb- Saturday -rrb- wright 's letter i enclose you a copy of l 's letter as it will be interesting to you to see or judge what effect be produce on he mind by its perusal i have write to-day to say that i will call at chiefswood -lrb- footnote : chiefswood where lockhart then live be about two mile distant from abbotsford sir walter scott describe it as a nice little cottage in a glen belong to this property with a rivulet in front and a grove of tree on the east side to keep away the cold wind -rrb- on Tuesday i intend to go to melrose tomorrow but as i will not take the chance of meet he the least tired i shall sleep at melrose and call on the follow morning i shall of course accept he offer of stay there i shall call again at b -lrb- oyd -rrb- 's before my departure to-morrow to see if there be any despatch from you i shall continue to give you advice of all my movement you will agree with I that i have at least not lose any time but that all thing have go very well as yet there be of course no danger in we communication of anything unfairly transpire but from the very delicate nature of name interested it will be expedient to adopt some cloak _ the chevalier _ will speak for itself m from melrose for mr l x for a certain personage on whom we call one day who live a slight distance from town and who be then unwell o for the political puck mr chronometer will speak for itself at least to all those who give african dinner i think this necessary and try to remember it i be quite delighted with edinburgh its beauty become every moment more apparent the view from the calton hill find I a frequent votary in the present state of affair i suppose it will not be expedient to leave the letter for mr bruce it will seem odd ppc at the same moment i bring a letter of introduction if i return to edinburgh i can avail myself of it if the letter contain anything which would otherwise make mr murray wish it to be leave let I know i revel in the various beauty of a scotch breakfast cold grouse and marmalade find I however constant ever yours bd the letter of mr lockhart to which mr disraelus refer run as follow : _ mr jg lockhart to mr b disraelus _ the business to which the letter -lrb- of mr wright -rrb- refer entitle it to much consideration as yet i have have no leisure nor mean to form even a approximation towards any opinion as to the proposal mr w mention far less to commit my friend in a word i be perfectly in the dark as to everything else except that i be sure it will give mr lockhart and myself very great pleasure to see mr disraelus under this roof if you have no other object in view i flatter myself that this neighborhood have in melrose and abbotsford some attraction not unworthy of you notice mr disraelus pay he promise visit to chiefswood it appear that mr lockhart expect to receive mr isaac d'israelus the well-known author of the curiosity of literature instead of which the person who appear before he be mr d'israeli 's then unknown son benjamin _ mr b disraelus to john murray _ chiefswood _ September _ 25 1825 my dear sir i arrive at chiefswood yesterday m -lrb- lockhart -rrb- have conceive that it be my father who be come he be lead to believe this through wright 's letter in addition therefore to he natural reserve there be of course a evident disappointment at see I everything look as black as possible i shall not detain you now by inform you of fresh particulars i leave they for when we meet suffice it to say that in a few hour we completely understand each other and be upon the most intimate term m enter into we view with a facility and readiness which be capital he think that nothing can be more magnificent or excellent but two point immediately occur : first the difficulty of he leave edinburgh without any ostensible purpose and secondly the lose caste in society by so do he be fully aware that he may end by make he situation as important as any in the empire but the primary difficulty be insurmountable as regard he interest i mention that he should be guarantee for three year # 1000 per annum and should take a eighth of every paper which be establish without risk he income cease on he so do these be much better term than we have imagine we could have make the agreement be think extremely handsome both by he and the chevalier but the income be not imagine to be too large however i drop that point as it should be arrange with you when we all meet the chevalier breakfast here to-day and afterwards we be all three closet together the chevalier enter into it excellently he think however that we could not depend upon malcolm barrow etc _ keep to it _ but this i do not fear he of course have no idea of you influence or connection with regard to the delicate point i mention the chevalier be willing to make any sacrifice in he personal comfort for lockhart 's advancement but he feel that he son-in-law will lose caste by go to town without anything ostensible he agree with I that m can not accept a official situation of any kind as it would compromise he independence but he think _ parliament for m indispensable _ and also very much to _ we interest _ i dine at abbotsford to-day and we shall most probably again discuss matter now these be the point which occur to I when m come to town it will be most important that it should be distinctly prove to he that he _ will _ be support by the great interest i have mention to he he must see that through powle all america and the commercial interest be at we beck that wilmot h etc not as mere under-secretary but as we private friend be most staunch that the chevalier be firm that the west indium interest will pledge themselves that such man and in such situation as barrow etc etc be _ distinctly in we power _ and finally that he be come to london not to be a editor of a newspaper but the director-general of a immense organ and at the head of a band of high-bred gentleman and important interest the chevalier and m have unburthen themselves to I in a manner the _ most confidential _ that you can possibly conceive of m 's capability _ perfect complete capability _ there be no manner of doubt of he sound principle and of he real view in life i could in a moment satisfy you rest assure however that you be deal with a _ perfect gentleman _ there have be no disguise to I of what have be do and the chevalier have a private conversation with I on the subject of a nature _ the most satisfactory _ with regard to other plan of ours if we could get he up we should find he invaluable i have a most singular and secret history on this subject when we meet now on the grand point -- parliament m can not be a representative of a government borough it be impossible he must be free as air i be sure that if this could be arrange all would be settle but it be _ indispensable _ without you can suggest anything else m be two day in company with x this summer as well as x 's and we friend but nothing transpire of we view this be a most favourable time to make a parliamentary arrangement what do you think of make a confidant of wilmot h -lrb- orton -rrb- he be the kind of man who would be right pleased by such conduct there be no harm of lockhart 's come in for a tory borough because he be a tory but a ministerial borough be impossible to be manage if this point could be arrange i have no doubt that i shall be able to organise in the interest with which i be now engage a most _ immense party _ and a _ most serviceable one _ be so kind as not to leave the vicinity of london in case m and myself come up _ suddenly _ but i pray you if you have any real desire to establish a mighty engine to exert yourself at this present moment and assist I to you very utmost write as soon as possible to give I some idea of you movement and direct to I here as i shall then be sure to obtain you communication the chevalier and all here have the highest idea of wright 's _ nous _ and think it most important that he should be at the head of the legal department i write this despatch in the most extreme haste ever yours bd on receive the above letter and the previous communication mr murray send they to mr isaac d'israelus for he perusal _ mr isaac d'israelus to mr murray _ hyde house amersham _ September _ 29 1825 my dear friend how deeply i feel obliged and gratify by you confidential communication i read repeatedly the third letter of we young plenipotentiary i know nothing against he but he youth -- a fault which a few season of experience will infallibly correct but i have observe that the habit and experience he have acquire as a lawyer often greatly serve he in matter o # business he view be vast but they be baa on good sense and he be most determinedly serious when he set to work the chevalier and m seem to have receive he with all the open confidence of man strike by a stranger yet a stranger not wholly strange and known enough to they to deserve they confidence if he could inspire it i flatter myself he have fully -- he must if he have really have confidential intercourse with the chevalier and so confidently impress you with so high and favourable a character of m on you side my dear murray no ordinary exertion will avail you too have faith and confidence to inspire in they you observe how the wary northern genius attempt to probe whether certain friend of yours would stand together no doubt they wish to ascertain that point pardon I if i add that in satisfy they cautious and anxious inquiry as to you influence with these person it may be wise to throw a little shade of mystery and not to tell everything too openly at first because when object be clearly define they do not affect we imagination as when they be somewhat conceal vast as the project seem hold up as it will be by personage of wealth interest politics etc whenever it be once set up i should have no fear for the result which be indeed the most important that one can well conceive have the editor of paul jone consult I a little i could probably have furnish he with the account of the miserable end of he hero and i be astonished it be not find as you tell I in you american biography -lrb- footnote : the last paragraph in mr d'israelus 's letter refer to the life of paul jone which have be already mention as the novel aylmer papillon write in 1824 be never publish the preface to paul jone be benjamin 's first appearance as a author -rrb- meanwhile young disraelus still remain with mr lockhart at chiefswood _ mr b disraelus to john murray _ _ September _ 1825 my dear sir i be quite sure that upon the business i be upon now every line will be acceptable and i therefore make no apology for this hurry despatch i have just receive a parcel from oliver & boyd i transmit a letter from m to wright and which -lrb- footnote : this be a ungrammatical construction which lord beaconsfield to the end of he day never abandon _ vide _ letter on p 318 and lothair _ passim _ -- tm -rrb- be for you mutual consideration to you _ vi chronometer _ last Friday i afterwards receive a note from you date chichester and fear from that circumstance that some confusion would arise i write a few line to you at mr holland 's -lrb- footnote : the rev w holland mr murray 's brother-in-law be a minor canon of chichester -rrb- i now find that you will be in town on Monday on which day i rather imagine the say letter from m to wright will arrive i therefore trust that the suspect confusion will not arise i be very much oblige to you for you letter but i be very sorry that you have incur any trouble when it be most probable that i shall not use they the abbotsford and chiefswood family have place I on such a friendly and familiar footing that it be utterly impossible for I to leave they while there exist any chance of m 's go to england m have introduce I to most of the neighbouring gentry and receive with a loud laugh any mention of my return to edinburgh i dine with dr brewster the other day he have a pretty place near melrose it be impossible for I to give to you any write idea of the beauty and unique character of abbotsford _ adio _ bd mr murray continue to transmit the correspondence to mr isaac d'israelus whose delight may be conceive from the following : _ mr d'israelus to john murray _ _ October _ 9 1825 my dear friend thanks my warmest one be poor return for the ardent note you have so affectionately convey to I by he on whom we now both alike rest we hope and we confidence the more i think of this whole affair from its obscure beginning the more i be quite overcome by what he have already achieve never do the finest season of blossom promise a richer gathering but he have not the sole merit for you share it with he in the grand view you take of the capability of this new intellectual steam engine in the follow letter lockhart definitely decline the editorship of the _ representative _ _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ October _ 7 1825 i be afraid that in spite of my earnest desire to be clear and explicit you have not after all fully understand the inexpressible feeling i entertain in regard to the _ impossibility _ of my ever enter into the career of london in the capacity of a newspaper editor i confess that you who have adorn and raise you own profession so highly may feel inclined and justly perhaps to smile at some of my scruple but it be enough to say that every hour that have elapse since the idea be first start have only serve to deepen and confirm the feeling with which i at the first moment regard it and in short that if such a game _ ought _ to be play i be neither young nor poor enough to be the man that take the hazard sir walter scott also express he view on the subject as follow : _ sir w scott to john murray _ abbotsford _ Sunday _ my dear sir lockhart seem to wish that i would express my opinion of the plan which you have have the kindness to submit to he and i be myself glad of a opportunity to express my sincere thanks for the great confidence you be willing to repose in one so near to I and whom i value so highly there be nothing in life that can be more interesting to I than he prosperity and should there eventually appear a serious prospect of he better he fortune by quit scotland i have too much regard for he to desire he to remain notwithstanding all the happiness i must lose by he absence and that of my daughter the present state however of the negotiation leave I little or no reason to think that i will be subject to this deprivation for i can not conceive it advisable that he should leave scotland on the speculation of become editor of a newspaper it be very true that this department of literature may and ought to be render more respectable than it be at present but i think this be a reformation more to be wish than hope for and should think it rash for any young man of whatever talent to sacrifice nominally at least a considerable portion of he respectability in society in hope of be submit as a exception to a rule which be at present pretty general this might open the door to love of money but it would effectually shut it against ambition to leave scotland lockhart must make very great sacrifice for he view here though moderate be certain he situation in public estimation and in private society be as high as that of any one at we bar and he road to the public open if he choose to assist he income by literary resource but of the extent and value of these sacrifice he must himself be a judge and a more unprejudiced one probably than i be i be very glad he meet you wish by go up to town as this though it should bear no further consequence can not but serve to show a grateful sense of the confidence and kindness of the party concern and yours in particular i beg kind compliment to mr d'israelus and be dear sir with best wish for the success of you great national plan yours very truly walter scott although mr lockhart hang back from the propose editorship he nevertheless carry out he intention of visit mr murray in london a few week after the date of the above letter mr jt coleridge have express he desire to resign the editorship of the _ quarterly _ in consequence of he rapidly increase practice on the western circuit and mr lockhart be sound as to he willingness to become he successor mr murray entertain the hope that he might be able to give a portion of he time to render some assistance in the management of the proposed newspaper as sir walter scott have be take into they counsel through the medium of mr disraelus mr murray proceed to correspond with he on the subject from the draft of one of mr murray 's letter we extract the following : _ john murray to sir walter scott _ _ October _ 13 1825 my dear sir walter i feel greatly oblige by the favor of you kind letter and for the good opinion which you be dispose to entertain of certain plan of which you will by degree be enable to form i hope a still more satisfactory estimate at present i will take the liberty of assure you that after you confidence in I i will neither propose nor think of anything respect mr lockhart that have not clearly for its basis the honor of he family with regard to we great plan -- which really ought not to be designate a newspaper as that department of literature have hitherto be conduct -- mr lockhart be never intend to have anything to do as editor : for we have already secure two most efficient and respectable person to fill that department i merely wish to receive he general advice and assistance and mr lockhart would only be know or suspect to be the author of certain papers of grave national importance the more we have think and talk over we plan the more certain be we of they inevitable success and of they lead we to certain power reputation and fortune for myself the heyday of my youth be pass though i may be allow certain experience in my profession i have acquire a moderate fortune and have a certain character and move now in the first circle of society and i have a family : these i hope may be some fair pledge to you that i would not engage in this venture with any hazard when all that be dearest to man would be my loss in order however to completely obviate any difficulty which have be urge i have propose to mr lockhart to come to london as the editor of the _ quarterly _ -- a appointment which i verily believe be covet by many of the highest literary character in the country and which of itself would entitle its possessor to enter into and mix with the first class of society for this and without write a line but merely for perform the duty of a editor i shall have the pleasure of allow he a thousand pound a year and this with contribution of he own might easily become # 1500 and take no serious portion of he time either then for he connection with the paper he will become permanently interested in a share we can guarantee to he for three year and which i be confident will be worth at the end of that period at least # 3000 and the profit from that share will not be less than # 1500 per annum i have lately hear from good authority that the annual profit of the _ time _ be # 40000 and that a share in the _ courier _ sell last week -lrb- wretchedly conduct it seem -rrb- at the rate of # 100000 for the property but this be not all you know well enough that the business of a publishing bookseller be not in he shop or even he connection but in he brain and we can put forward together a series of valuable literary work and without observe I in any of these plan the slightest risk to mr lockhart and i do most solemnly assure you that if i may take any credit to myself for possess anything like sound judgment in my profession the thing which we shall immediately begin upon as mr lockhart will explain to you be as perfectly certain of command a great sale as anything i ever have the good fortune to engage in lockhart finally accept the editorship of the _ quarterly _ after negotiation which bring mr disraelus on a second visit to scotland but he undertake no formal responsibility for the new daily paper in london disraelus be indefatigable he visit city man for the purpose of obtain article on commercial subject he employ a architect mr g basevus jun he cousin with a view to the planning of office and printing premise a large house be eventually take in great george street westminster and duly fit up as a printing office he then proceed in common with mr murray to make arrangement for the foreign correspondence in the summer of 1824 -- before the new enterprise be think of -- he have travel in the rhine country and make some pleasant acquaintance of whom he now bethink himself when make arrangement for the new paper one of they be mr maa of the trierscher hof coblentz and mr disraelus address he as follow : _ mr b disraelus to mr maas _ _ October _ 25 1825 dear sir you hospitality which i have twice enjoy convince I that you will not consider this as a intrusion my friend mr murray of albemarle street london the most eminent publisher that we have be about to establish a daily journal of the first importance with he great influence and connection there be no doubt that he will succeed in he endeavor to make it the focus of the information of the whole world among other place at which he wish to have correspondent be the rhine and he have apply to I for my advice upon this point it have strike I that coblentz be a very good situation for intelligence its proximity to the rhine and the moselle its contiguity to the beautiful bath of the taunus and the innumerable traveller who pass through it and spread everywhere the fame of you admirable hotel all conduce to make it a place from which much interesting intelligence might be procure the most celebrated man in europe have promise they assistance to mr murray in he great project i wish to know whether you can point out any one to he who will occasionally write he a letter from you city intelligence as to the company at wiesbaden and em and of the person of eminence particularly english who pass through coblentz of the traveller down the rhine and such topic be very interesting to we you yourself would make a most admirable correspondent the labor would be very light and very agreeable and mr murray would take care to acknowledge you kindness by various courtesy if you object to say anything about politics you can omit mention the subject i wish you would undertake it as i be sure you would write most agreeable letter once a month would be sufficient or rather write whenever you have anything that you think interesting will you be so kind as to write I in answer what you think of this proposal the communication may be carry on in any language you please last year when i be at coblentz you be kind enough to show I a very pretty collection of ancient glass pray be it yet to be purchase i think i know a english gentleman who would be happy to possess it i hope this will not be the last letter which pass between we i be dear sir yours most truly b disraelus mr maa agree to mr disraelus 's proposal and he letter be hand to mr murray who give he further instruction as to the foreign correspondence which he require mr murray himself write to correspondent at hamburg maestricht genoa trieste gibraltar and other place with the same object the time for the publication of the newspaper be rapidly approach and mr b disraelus 's correspondence on the subject of the engagement of a staff become fast and furious by the end of December mr lockhart have arrive in london for the purpose of commence he editorship of the _ quarterly review _ the name of the new morning paper have not then be yet fix on from the correspondence respect it we find that some speak of it as the _ daily review _ other as the _ morning news _ and so on but that mr benjamin disraelus settle the matter appear from the follow letter of mr lockhart to mr murray : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ December _ 21 1825 my dear sir i be delighted and what be more satisfied with disraelus 's title -- the _ representative _ if mr powle do not produce some thundering objection let this be fix in god 's name strange to say from this time forward nothing more be hear of mr benjamin disraelus in connection with the _ representative _ after he two journey to scotland he interview with sir walter scott and mr lockhart he activity in make arrangement previous to the starting of the daily paper he communication with the architect as to the purchase and fitting up of the premise in great george street and with the solicitor as to the propose deed of partnership he suddenly drop out of sight and nothing more be hear of he in connection with the business it would appear that when the time arrive for the proprietor of the new paper to provide the necessary capital under the term of the memorandum of agreement date August 3 1825 both mr disraelus and mr powle fail to contribute they several proportion mr murray have indeed already spend a considerable sum and enter into agreement for the purchase of printing-offices printing-machine type and all the paraphernalia of a newspaper establishment he have engage reporter correspondent printer sub-editor though he still want a efficient editor he be greatly disappoint at not be able to obtain the service of mr lockhart mr disraelus be too young -- be then only twenty-one and entirely inexperienced in the work of conduct a daily paper -- to be entrust with the editorship indeed it be doubtful whether he ever contemplate occupy that position though he have engage himself most sedulously in the preliminary arrangement in one department he endeavor to obtain the assistance of man of commerce in the city however he be by no means successful nevertheless mr murray be so far commit that he feel bind to go on with the enterprise and he advertise the publication of the new morning paper some of he friend congratulate he on the announcement trust that they might see on they breakfast-table a paper which they wife and daughter might read without a blush the first number of the _ representative _ accordingly appear on January 25 1826 price 7_d _ the stamp tax be then 4_d _ in politics it be a supporter of lord liverpool 's government but public distress the currency trade and commerce be subject of independent comment notwithstanding the pain which have be take and the money which have be spend the _ representative _ be a failure from the begin it be badly organize badly edit and its contents -- lead article home and foreign news -- be ill-balanced fail lockhart a editor name tyndale have be appoint on short notice though he be a obscure and uninfluential person he soon disappear in favor of other who be no better dr maginn -lrb- footnote : dr maginn 's papers in _ blackwood _ be or should be know to the reader the murray correspondence contain many characteristic letter from this jovial and impecunious irishman he be generally suppose to have be the prototype of thackeray 's captain shandon -- tm -rrb- have be engage -- the morgan o'doherty of _ blackwood 's magazine _ -- wit scholar and bohemian he be send to pari where he evidently enjoy himself but the result as regard the _ representative _ be by no means satisfactory he be better at borrow money than at write article mr sc hall one of the parliamentary reporter of the paper say in he retrospect of a long life that : the day precede the issue of the first number mr murray might have obtain a very large sum for a shore of the copyright of which he be the sole proprietor the day after that issue the copyright be worth comparatively nothing editor there be literally none from the begin to the end the first number supply conclusive evidence of the utter ignorance of editorial tact on the part of the person entrust with the duty in short the work be badly do if not a snare it be a delusion and the reputation of the new journal fall below zero in twenty-four hour -lrb- footnote : retrospect of a long life from 1815 to 1883 by sc hall fsa i p 126 -rrb- a inspection of the file of the _ representative _ justify mr hall 's remark the first number contain a article by lockhart four column in length on the affair of europe it be correct and scholar-like but tame and colourless incorrectness in a leading article may be tolerate but dulness amount to a literary crime the foreign correspondence consist of a letter from valetta and a communication from paris more than a column in length relate to french opera in the matter of news for which the daily be principally purchase the first number be exceedingly defective it be hard to judge of the merit of a new journal from the first number which must necessarily labor under many disadvantage but the _ representative _ do not from the first exhibit any element of success mr murray find he new enterprise a increase source of annoyance and worry he health break down under the strain and when he be confine to he bed by illness thing go worse from day to day the usual publishing business be neglect letter remain unanswered manuscript remain unread and some correspondent become excessively angry at they communication be neglect mr murray 's worry be increase by the commercial crisis then prevail and by the downfall of many large publishing house it be fear that mr murray might be implicate in the failure at the end of January the great firm of archibald constable & co of edinburgh publisher of sir walter scott 's novel be declare bankrupt shortly after the failure be announce of jame ballantyne & co in which sir walter scott be a partner and with these house that of hurst kobinson & co of london be hopelessly involve the market be flood with the dishonoured paper of all these concern and mercantile confidence in the great publishing house be almost at a end we find washington irving communicate the follow intelligence to ah everett united state minister at madrid -lrb- January 31 1826 -rrb- : you will perceive by the papers the failure of constable & co at edinburgh and hurst robinson & co at london these be severe shock in the trading world of literature pray heaven murray may stand unmoved and not go into the _ gazette _ instead of publish one mr murray hold he ground he be not only able to pay he way but to assist some of the best-known london publisher through the pressure of they difficulty one of these be mr robert baldwin of paternoster row who express he repeat obligation to mr murray for he help in time of need the event of this crisis clearly demonstrate the wisdom and foresight of murray in break loose from the ballantyne and constable connection in spite of the promising advantage which it have offer he murray still go on with the _ representative _ though the result be increase annoyance and vexation mr milman write to he do get a new editor for the lighter part of you paper and look well to the _ quarterly _ the advice be take and dr maginn be bring over from pari to take charge of the lighter part of the paper at a salary of # 700 a year with a house the result be that a number of clever _ jeux d'esprit _ be insert by he but these be intermingle with some bite article which give considerable offence at length the strain become more than he could bear and he seek the first opportunity for stop the further publication of the paper this occur at the end of the general election and the _ representative _ cease to exist on July 29 1826 after a career of only six month during which brief period it have involve mr murray in a loss of not less than # 26000 -lrb- footnote : the _ representative _ be afterwards incorporate with the _ new time _ another unfortunate paper -rrb- mr murray bear he loss with much equanimity and find it a inexpressible relief to be rid of the _ representative _ even at such a sacrifice to washington irve he write : _ john murray to mr irving _ one cause of my not write to you during one whole year be my ` entanglement ' as lady g -- say with a newspaper which absorb my money and distract and depress my mind but i have cut the knot of evil which i could not untie and be now by the blessing of god again return to reason and the shop one of the unfortunate result of the initiation and publication of the _ representative _ be that it disturb the friendship which have so long exist between mr murray and mr isaac d'israelus the real cause of benjamin 's sudden dissociation from a enterprise of which in its earlier stage he have be the move spirit can only be matter of conjecture the only mention of he name in the later correspondence regard the newspaper occur in the follow letter : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ Thursday _ February _ 14 1826 i think mr b disraelus ought to tell you what it be that he wish to say to mr croker on a business _ of yours _ ere he ask of you a letter to the secretary if there really be something worth say i certainly know nobody that would say it better but i confess i think all thing consider you have no need of anybody to come between you and mr croker what can it be yours jgl but after the _ representative _ have cease to be publish the elder d'israelus think he have a cause of quarrel with mr murray and propose to publish a pamphlet on the subject the matter be bring under the notice of mr sharon turner the historian and solicitor and the friend of both mr turner strongly advise mr isaac d'israelus to abstain from issue any such publication _ mr sharon turner to mr d'israelus _ _ October _ 6 1826 fame be pleasant if it arise from what will give credit or do good but to make oneself notorious only to be the football of all the dinner-tables tea-table and gossip visit of the country will be so great a weakness that until i see you actually commit yourself to it i shall not believe that you at a age like my own can wilfully and deliberately do anything that will bring the evil on you therefore i earnestly advise that whatever have pass be leave as it be if you give it any further publicity you will i think cast a shade over a name that at present stand quite fair before the public eye and nothing can dim it to you that will not injure all who belong to you therefore as i have say to murray i say to you : let oblivion absorb the whole question as soon as possible and do not stir a step to rescue it from she salutary power if i do not gee you word before I i could not have suppose that after you experience of these thing and of the world you could deliberately intend to write -- that be to publish in print -- anything on the difference between you murray and the _ representative _ and you son if you do murray will be drive to answer to he the worst that can befall will be the public smile that he could have embark in a speculation that have cost he many thousand pound and a criticism on what lead to it the public know it and talk as they please about it but in a short time will say no more upon it it be now die away very few at present know that you be in any way concern about it to you therefore all that result will be new matter for the public discussion and censure and after read benjamin 's agreement of the 3rd August 1825 and you letter to murray on he and the business of the 27th September the 29th September and the 9th October my sincere opinion be that you can not with a due regard to you own reputation _ write _ or _ publish _ anything about it i send you hastily my immediate thought that he whom i have always respect may not by publish what will be immediately contradict diminish or destroy in other that respect which at present he possess and which i hope he will continue to enjoy mr d'israelus do not write he proposed pamphlet what mr murray thought of he intention may be infer from the follow extract from he letter to mr sharon turner : _ john murray to mr sharon turner _ _ October _ 16 1826 mr d'israelus be totally wrong in suppose that my indignation against he son arise in the smallest degree from the sum which i have lose by yield to that son 's unrelenting excitement and importunity this loss whilst it be in weekly operation may be suppose and naturally enough to have be sufficiently painful -lrb- footnote : see note at the end of the chapter -rrb- but now that it have cease i solemnly declare that i neither care nor think about it more than one do of the long-suffered agony of a ache tooth the day after we have summon resolution enough to have it extract on the contrary i be dispose to consider this apparent misfortune as one of that chastening class which if suffer wisely may be productive of greater good and i feel confidently that as it have re-kindle my ancient ardor in business a very few month will enable I to replace this temporary loss and make I infinitely the gainer if i profit by the prudential lesson which this whole affair be calculate to teach from I he son have receive nothing but the most unbounded confidence and parental attachment my fault be in have love not wisely but too well to conclude the story as far as mr disraelus be concern we may print here a letter write some time later mr powle have avail himself of disraelus 's literary skill to recommend he mining speculation to the public in march 1825 mr murray have publish on commission american mining company and the same year present state of mexico and lawyer and legislator all of they write by or under the superintendence of mr disraelus mr powle however again prove faithless and although the money for the printing have be due for some time he pay nothing and at length mr disraelus address mr murray in the follow letter : _ mr benjamin disraelus to john murray _ 6 bloomsbury square _ march _ 19 1827 sir i beg to enclose you the sum of one hundred and fifty pound which i believe to be the amount due to you for certain pamphlet publish respect the american mining company as state in account send in some time since i have never be able to obtain a settlement of these account from the party originally responsible and it have hitherto be quite out of my power to exempt myself from the liability which i have ever be conscious on they incompetency result from the peculiar circumstance of the case to myself in now enclose you what i consider to be the amount i beg also to state that i have fix upon it from memory have be unsuccessful in my endeavor to obtain even a return of the account from the original party and be unwilling to trouble you again for a second set of account which have be so long and so improperly keep unsettled in the event therefore of there be any mistake i will be oblige by you clerk instantly inform I of it and it will be as instantly rectify and i will also thank you to enclose I a receipt in order to substantiate my claim and enforce my demand against the party originally responsible i have to express my sense of you courtesy in this business and i be sir yours truly benjamin disraelus fortunately the misunderstanding between the two old friend do not last long for towards the end of the year we find mr isaac d'israelus communicate with mr murray respect wool 's life of joseph warton and certain select letter by warton which he think worthy of republication and with respect to he son mr benjamin disraelus although he publish he first work vivian gray through colburn he return to albemarle street a few year later and publish he contarinus fleme through mr murray note -- it appear from the correspondence that mr murray have be lead by the unrelenting excitement and importunity of he young friend to make some joint speculation in south american mine the same financial crisis which prevent mr powle from fulfil he obligation probably sweep away all chance of profit from this investment the financial loss involve in the failure of the _ representative _ be more serious but mr murray 's resentment against young mr disraelus be not due to any such consideration justly or unjustly he feel bitterly aggrieve at certain personality which he think be to be detect in vivian gray mr disraelus be also suspect of be concern in a ephemeral publication call _ the star chamber _ to which he undoubtedly contribute certain article and in which paragraph appear give offence in albemarle street the story of vivian gray -lrb- as it appear in the first edition -rrb- be transpose from the literary to the political key it be undoubtedly autobiographical but the identification of mr murray with the marquis of caraba must seem very far-fetched it be at all time difficult to say within what limit the novelist be entitle to resort to portraiture in order to build up the fabric of he romance intention of offence be vehemently deny by the d'israeli family which as the correspondence show rush with one accord to the defense of the future lord beaconsfield it be really a storm in a teacup and but for the future eminence of one of the friend concern would call for no remark mr disraelus 's bitter disappointment at the failure of he great journalistic combination sharpen the keen edge of he wit and perhaps magnify the irksomeness of the restraint which he older fellow-adventurer try to put on he unrelenting excitement and it be possible that he feeling find vent in the novel which he then be compose it be please to remark that at a later date he confidence and esteem for he father 's old friend return to he and that the incident end in a way honorable to all concern -- tm chapter xxv mr lockhart as editor of the quarterly -- hallam -- wordsworth -- death of constable the appointment of a new editor naturally excite much interest among the contributor and supporter of the _ quarterly review _ comment be make and draw from scott the follow letter : _ sir walter scott to john murray _ abbotsford _ November _ 17 1825 my dear sir i be much surprised to-day to learn from lockhart by letter that some scruple be in circulation among some of the respectable among the supporter of the _ quarterly review _ concern he capacity to undertake that highly responsible task in most case i might not be consider as a disinterested witness on behalf of so near a connection but in the present instance i have some claim to call myself so the plan -lrb- i need not remind you -rrb- of call lockhart to this distinguished situation far from be favor by I or in any respect advance or further by such interest as i might have urge be not communicate to I until it be form and as it involve the removal of my daughter and of she husband who have always love and honor I as a son from they native country and from my vicinity my private wish and that of all the member of my family be that such a change should not take place but the advantage propose be so considerable that it remove all title on my part to state my own strong desire that he should remain in scotland now i do assure you that if in these circumstance i have see anything in lockhart 's habit cast of mind or mode of think or composition which make he unfit for the duty he have to undertake i should have be the last man in the world to permit without the strongest expostulation not with he alone but with you he exchange a easy and increasing income in he own country and amongst he own friend for a larger income perhaps but a highly responsible situation in london i consider this matter very attentively and recall to my recollection all i have know of mr lockhart both before and since he connection with my family i have no hesitation in say that when he be pay he address in my family i fairly state to he that however i might be please with he general talent and accomplishment with he family which be highly respectable and he view in life which i think satisfactory i do decidedly object to the use he and other have make of they wit and satirical talent in _ blackwood 's magazine _ which though a work of considerable power i think too personal to be in good taste or to be quite respectable mr lockhart then pledge he word to I that he would withdraw from this species of warfare and i have every reason to believe that he have keep he word with I in particular i _ know _ that he have not the least concern with the _ beacon _ newspaper though strongly urge by he young friend at the bar and i also know that while he have sometimes contribute a essay to _ blackwood _ on general literature or politics which can be refer to if necessary he have no connection whatever with the satirical part of the work or with its general management nor be he at any time the editor of the publication it seem extremely hard -lrb- though not perhaps to be wonder at -rrb- that the folly of three -- or four and twenty should be remember against a man of thirty who have abstain during the interval from give the least cause of offence there be few man of any rank in letter who have not at some time or other be guilty of some abuse of they satirical power and very few who have not see reason to wish that they have restrain they vein of pleasantry thinking over lockhart 's offence with my own and other man 's whom either politics or literary controversy have lead into such effusion i can not help think that five year ' proscription ought to obtain a full immunity on they account there be none of they which could be ascribe to any worse motive than a wicked wit and many of the individual against whom they be direct be worthy of more severe chastisement the blame be in meddle with such man at all lockhart be reckon a excellent scholar and oxford have say so he be bear a gentleman have always keep the best society and he personal character be without a shadow of blame in the most unfortunate affair of he life he do all that man could do and the unhappy tragedy be the result of the poor sufferer 's after-thought to get out of a scrape -lrb- footnote : this refer without doubt to the unfortunate death of john scott the editor of the _ london magazine _ in a duel with lockhart 's friend christie the result of a quarrel in which lockhart himself have be concern -rrb- of he general talent i will not presume to speak but they be generally allow to be of the first order this however i _ will _ say that i have know the most able man of my time and i never meet any one who have such ready command of he own mind or possess in a greater degree the power of make he talent available upon the shortest notice and upon any subject he be also remarkably docile and willing to receive advice or admonition from the old and experienced he be a fond husband and almost a doat father seek no amusement out of he own family and be not only addict to no bad habit but averse to spend time in society or the dissipation connect with it speak upon my honor as a gentleman and my credit as a man of letter i do not know a person so well qualify for the very difficult and responsible task he have undertake and i think the distinct testimony of one who must know the individual well ought to bear weight against all vague rumor whether arise from idle squib he may have be guilty of when he come from college -- and i know none of these which indicate a bad heart in the jester -- or as be much more likely from those which have be rashly and falsely ascribe to he have any shadow of this want of confidence be express in the beginning of the business i for one would have advise lockhart to have nothing to do with a concern for which he capacity be call in question but _ now _ what can be do a liberal offer handsomely make have be accept with the same confidence with which it be offer lockhart have resign he office in edinburgh give up he business take a house in london and have let or be on the eve of let he house here the thing be so public that about thirty of the most respectable gentleman in edinburgh have propose to I that a dinner should be give in he honor the ground be cut away behind he for a retreat nor can such a thing be propose as matter now stand upon what grounds or by whom lockhart be first recommend to you i have no right or wish to inquire have no access whatsoever to the negotiation the result of which must be in every wise painful enough to I but as they advice must in addition to you own judgment have have great weight with you i conceive they will join with I in the expectation that the other respectable friend of this important work will not form any decision to lockhart 's prejudice till they shall see how the business be conduct by a different conduct they may do harm to the editor publisher and the work itself as far as the withdraw of they countenance must necessarily be prejudicial to its currency but if it shall prove that they suspicion prove unfounded i be sure it will give pain to they to have listen to they for a moment it have be my lot twice before now to stand forward to the best of my power as the assistant of two individual against whom a party run be make the one case be that of wilson to whom a thousand idle prank be imputed of a character very different and far more eccentric than anything that ever attach to lockhart we carry he through upon the fair principle that in the case of good moral and perfect talent for a situation where vice or crime be not allege the folly of youth should not obstruct the fair prospects of advanced manhood god help we all if some such modification of censure be not extend to we since most man have sow wild oats enough wilson be make a professor as you know have one of the fullest class in the university lecture most eloquently and be much beloved by he pupil the other be the case of john william now rector of we new academy here who be oppose most violently upon what on examination prove to be exaggerated rumor of old winchester story he get the situation chiefly i think by my own standing firm and keep other together and the gentleman who oppose he most violently have repeatedly tell I that i do the utmost service to the academy by bring he in for never be a man in such a situation so eminently qualify for the task of education i only mention these thing to show that it be not in my son-in-law 's affair alone that i would endeavor to remove that sort of prejudice which envy and party zeal be always ready to throw in the way of rise talent those who be interested in the matter may be well assure that with whatever prejudice they may receive lockhart at first all who have candor enough to wait till he can afford they the means of judge will be of opinion that they have get a person possibly as well situate for the duty of such a office as any man that england could afford they i would rather have write a letter of this kind concern any other person than one connect with myself but it be every word true be there neither son nor daughter in the case but as such i leave it at you discretion to show it not generally but to such friend and patron of the _ review _ as in you opinion have a title to know the contents believe I dear sir you most obedient servant walter scott mr lockhart himself address the two follow letter to mr murray : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ chiefswood _ November _ 19 1825 my dear sir i be deeply indebted to disraeli for the trouble he have take to come hither again at a time when he have so many matter of real importance to attend to in london the sort of stuff that certain grave gentleman have be mince at be of course thoroughly foresee by sir w scott and by myself from the beginning of the business such prejudice i can not hope to overcome except by do well what have be entrust to I and after all i should like to know what man could have be put at the head of the _ quarterly review _ at my time of life without have the doctor utter doctorism on the occasion if you but know it you yourself personally could in one moment overcome and silence for ever the whole of these people as for I nobody have more sincere respect for they in they own different walk of excellence than myself and if there be one thing that i may promise for myself it be that age experience and eminence shall never find fair reason to accuse I of treat they with presumption i be much more afraid of fall into the opposite error i have write at some length on these matter to mr croker mr ellis and mr rise -- and to no one else nor will i again put pen to paper unless someone have a right to put a distinct question to I do put it _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ Sunday _ chiefswood _ November _ 27 1825 my dear murray i have read the letter i receive yesterday evening with the greatest interest and close it with the sincerest pleasure i think we now begin to understand each other and if we do that i be sure _ i _ have no sort of apprehension as to the result of the whole business but in write one must come to the point therefore i proceed at once to you topic in they order and rely on it i shall speak as openly on every one of they as i would _ to my brother _ mr croker 's behavior have indeed distressed I for i have always consider he as one of those bad enemy who make excellent friend i have not the least idea that he have ever cease to regard you personally with friendship even affection until bd tell I about he trafficking with knight for as to the little hint you give I when in town i set all that down to he aversion for the notion of you set up a paper and thereby dethrone he from he invisible predominance over the tory daily press and of course attach little importance to it i be now satisfy more particularly after hear how he behave himself in the interview with you that there be some deeper feeling in he mind the correspondence that have be pass between he and I may have be somewhat imprudently manage on my part i may have _ committed _ myself to a certain extent in it in more way than one it be needless to regret what can not be undo at all event i perceive that it be now over with we for the present i do not however believe but that he will continue to do what he have be use to do for the _ review _ indeed unless he make the newspaper business he excuse he stand completely pledge to I to adhere to that but with reverence be it speak even this do not seem to I a matter of very great moment on the contrary i believe that he papers in the _ review _ have -lrb- with a few exception -rrb- do the work a great deal more harm than good i can not express what i feel but there be always the bitterness of gifford without he dignity and the bigotry of southey without he _ bonne-fous _ he scourging of such poor deer as lady morgan be unworthy of a work of that rank if we can get the same _ information _ elsewhere no fear that we need equally regret the secretary 's quill as it be we must be contented to watch the course of thing and recollect the roman 's maxim quae casus obtullerint ad sapientiam vertenda i a vex not a little at mr barrow 's imprudence in mention my name to croker and to rise as in connection with the paper and for this reason that i be most anxious to have produce at least one number of the _ review _ ere that matter should have be at all suspect as it be i hope you will still find means to make barrow rise and croker -lrb- at all event the two last -rrb- completely understand that you have indeed wish I to edit the paper but that i have decline that and that _ then _ you have offer I the _ review _ no matter what you say as to the firm belief i have express that the paper _ will _ answer and the resolution i have make to assist you by write political article in it it be of the highest importance that in we anxiety about a new affair one should not lose sight of the old and established one and i _ can _ believe that if the real state of the case be know at the outset of my career in london a considerable feeling detrimental to the _ quarterly might _ be excite we have enough of adverse feeling to meet without unnecessarily swell they number and aggravate they quality i beg you to have a serious conversation with mr barrow on this head and in the course of it take care to make he thoroughly understand that the prejudice or doubt he give utterance to in regard to I be hear of by I without surprise and excited no sort of angry feeling whatever he could know nothing of I but from fly rumor for the nature of which _ he _ could in no shape be answerable as for poor rise 's well-meant hint about my identify myself perhaps in the mind of society with the scavenger of the press the folly of _ you _ risk you name on a _ paper _ etc etc of course we shall equally appreciate all this rose be a timid dandy and a bit of a whig to boot i shall make some explanation to he when i next have occasion to write to he but that sort of thing would come surely with a better grace from you than from I i have not a doubt that he will be a daily scribbler in you paper ere it be a week old to all these people -- croker as well as the rest -- john murray be of much more importance than they ever can be to he if he will only _ believe _ what i _ know _ viz that he own name in _ society _ stand mile above any of theirs croker _ can not _ form the nucleus of a literary association which you have any reason to dread he be hate by the higher tory quite as sincerely as by the whig : besides he have not _ now-a-day _ courage to strike a effective blow he will not come forward i come to pleasanter matter nothing indeed can be more handsome more generous than mr coleridge 's whole behavior i beg of you to express to he the sense i have of the civility with which he have be please to remember and allude to _ I _ and assure he that i be most grateful for the assistance he offer and accept of it to any extent he choose in this way mr lockhart succeed to the control of what he friend john wilson call a national work and he justify the selection which mr murray have make of he as editor : not only maintain and enhance the reputation of the _ review _ by secure the friendship of the old contributor but enlist the assistance of many new one sir walter scott though work himself to piece to free himself from debt come to he help and to the first number which lockhart edit he contribute a interesting article on pepy ' memoirs lockhart 's literary taste and discernment be of the highest order and he display a moderation and gentleness even in he adverse criticism for which those who know he but slightly or by reputation only scarce give he credit there soon spring up between he and he publisher a intimacy and mutual confidence which last till murray 's death and lockhart continue to edit the _ quarterly _ till he own death in 1854 in truth there be need of mutual confidence between editor and publisher for they be call upon to deal with not a few person whose deep interest in the _ quarterly _ tempt they at time to assume a somewhat dictatorial tone in they comment on and advice for the management of the _ review _ when a article write by croker on lamennai ' parole d'un croyant -lrb- footnote : the article by jw croker be afterwards publish in no 104 of the _ quarterly _ -rrb- be under consideration lockhart write to the publisher : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ November 8 _ 1826 my dear murray it be always agreeable and often useful for we to hear what you think of the article in progress croker and i both differ from you as to the general affair for this reason simply that lamennai be to pari what benson or lonsdale be to london he book have produce and be produce a very great effect even religious people there applaud he and they be re-echoed here by old jerdan who pronounce that be he right or wrong he have produce a noble sacred poem it be needful to caution the english against the course of france by show up the audacious extent of she horror political moral and religious and you know what _ be _ the result of we article on those vile tragedy the extract of which be more likely to offend a family circle than anything in the parole d'un croyant and which even i be afraid of mr croker however will modify and curtail the paper so as to get rid of you specific objection it have already be judge advisable to put the last and only blasphemous extract in french in place of english depend upon it if we be to lower we scale so as to run no risk of offend any good people 's delicate feeling we should soon lower ourselves so as to rival my grandmother the british in want of interest to the world at large and even -lrb- though they would not say so -rrb- to the saint themselves -- _ verb sap _ like most sagacious publisher murray be free from prejudice and be ready to publish for all party and for man of opposite opinion for instance he publish malthus 's essay on population and sadler 's contradiction of the theory he publish byron 's attack on southey and southey 's two letter against lord byron he publish nugent 's memorial of hampden and the _ quarterly review 's _ attack upon it southey 's book of the church evoke a huge number of work on the roman catholic controversy most of which be publish by mr murray mr charle butler follow with he book on the roman catholic church and the rev joseph blanco white 's practical and internal evidence against catholicism with occasional stricture on mr butler 's book on the roman catholic church another answer to mr butler come from dr george townsend in he accusation of history against the church of rome then follow the divine of whom there be many : the rev dr henry phillpott -lrb- then of stanhope rectory durham but afterwards bishop of exeter -rrb- in he letter to charle butler on the theological part of he book on the roman catholic church the rev g faber 's difficulty of romanism and many other while most author be ready to take cash down for they manuscript there be other who desire to be remunerate in proportion to the sale of they work this be especially the case with work of history or biography which be likely to have a permanent circulation hence when the judicious mr hallam -- who have sell the first three edition of europe during the middle age to mr murray for # 1400 -- have complete he constitutional history of england he make proposal which result in mr murray 's agree to print and publish at he own cost and risk the constitutional history of england and pay to the author two-third of the net profit and these be the term on which mr murray publish all mr hallam 's subsequent work mr wordsworth about this time desire to republish he poem and make application with that object to mr murray who thereupon consult lockhart _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ July _ 9 1826 in regard to wordsworth i certainly can not doubt that it must be creditable to any publisher to publish the work _ of _ one who be and must continue to be a classic poet of england you adventure with crabbe however ought to be a lesson of much caution on the other hand again w 's poem _ must _ become more popular else why so many edition in the course of the last few year there have be _ two _ of the ` excursion ' alone and i know that those have not satisfy the public everything i should humbly say depend on the term propose by the great laker whose vanity be it whisper be nearly as remarkable as he genius the follow be the letter in which mr wordsworth make he formal proposal to mr murray to publish he collect poem : _ mr wordsworth to john murray _ rydal mount near ambleside _ December _ 4 1826 dear sir i have at last determine to go to the press with my poem as early as possible twelve month ago the be to have be put into the hand of messr robinson & hurst upon the term of payment of a certain sum independent of expense on my part but the failure of that house prevent the thing go forward before i offer the publication to any one but yourself upon the different principle agree on between you and I as you may recollect viz the author to meet two-third of the expense and risk and to share two-third of the profit i think it proper to renew that proposal to you if you be not incline to accept it i shall infer so from you silence if such a arrangement suit you pray let I _ immediately _ know and all i have to request be that without loss of time when i have inform you of the intended quantity of letter-press you will then let I know what my share of the expense will amount to i be dear sir you obedient servant wm wordsworth as mr murray do not answer this letter promptly mr h crabb robinson call upon he to receive he decision and subsequently write : _ mr hg robinson to john murray _ _ February _ 1827 i write to mr wordsworth the day after i have the pleasure of see you i be sorry to say that my letter come too late mr wordsworth interpret you silence into a rejection of he offer and he work will unfortunately lose the benefit of appear under you auspices they have be under the press some week for about fifteen year there have be no business transaction between murray and constable on the eve of the failure of the constable the head of the firm mr archibald constable -lrb- October 1825 -rrb- be pay a visit at wimbledon when mr murray address he host -- mr wright whose name have already occur in the _ representative _ correspondence -- as follow : my dear wright although i intend to do myself the pleasure of call upon mr constable at you house tomorrow immediately after church -lrb- for it be we charity sermon at wimbledon and i must attend -rrb- yet i should be most happy if it be agreeable to you and to he to favor we with you company at dinner at i will say five tomorrow mr constable be godfather to my son who will be at home and i be anxious to introduce he to mr c who may not be long in town mr constable and he friend accordingly dine with murray and that the meeting be very pleasant may be infer from mr constable 's letter of a few day later in which he write to murray it make my heart glad to be once more happy together as we be the other evening the rest of mr constable 's letter refer to hume 's philosophical writings which be tender to murray but which he decline to publish constable die two year later john ballantyne scott 's partner a few year earlier and scott enter in he diary it be write that nothing shall flourish under my shadow chapter xxvi sir walter 's last year owe to the intimate relation which be now establish between murray and lockhart the correspondence be full of reference to sir walter scott and to the last phase of he illustrious career lockhart have often occasion to be at abbotsford to see sir walter scott who be then carry on single-handed that terrible struggle with adversity which have never be equal in the annals of literature he son-in-law go down in February 1827 to see he about further article but write to murray : i fear we must not now expect sir w s 's assistance ere ` napoleon ' be out of hand in the follow month of June lockhart write from portobello : sir w scott have get ` napoleon ' out of he hand and i have make arrangement for three or four article and i think we may count for a paper of he every quarter article accordingly appear from sir walter scott on diverse subject one in no 71 June 1827 on the work of john home another in no 72 October 1827 on plant waste land a third in no 74 march 1828 on plantation and landscape gardening and a fourth in no 76 October 1828 on sir h davy 's salmonium or day of fly-fishing the last article be cordial and generous like everything proceeding from sir walter 's pen lady davy be greatly please with it it must always be a proud and gratifying distinction she say to have the name of sir walter scott associate with that of my husband in the review of ` salmonium ' i be sure sir humphry will like he bairn the better for the public opinion give of it by one whose immortality render praise as durable as it seem truly feel with respect to salmonia the follow anecdote may be mention as related to mr murray by dr gooch a value contributor to the _ quarterly _ at page 6 of salmonium say dr gooch it be state that ` nelson be a good fly-fisher and continue the pursuit even with he left hand ' i can add that one of he reason for regret the loss of he right arm be that it deprive he of the power of pursue this amusement efficiently as be show by the follow incident which be i think worth preserve in that part of he history which relate to he talent as a fly-fisher i be at the naval hospital at yarmouth on the morning when nelson after the battle of copenhagen -lrb- have send the wound before he -rrb- arrive in the road and land on the jetty the populace soon surround he and the military be draw up in the marketplace ready to receive he but make he way through the crowd and the dust and the clamor he go straight to the hospital i go round the ward with he and be much interested in observe he demeanor to the sailor he stop at every bed and to every man he have something kind and cheer to say at length he stop opposite a bed in which a sailor be lie who have lose he right arm close to the shoulder joint and the follow short dialogue pass between they _ nelson _ : ` well jack what be the matter with you ' _ sailor _ : ` lose my right arm you honor ' nelson pause look down at he own empty sleeve then at the sailor and then say playfully ` well jack then you and i be spoil for fisherman but cheer up my brave fellow ' he then pass quickly on to the next bed but these few word have a magical effect upon the poor fellow for i see he eye sparkle with delight as nelson turn away and pursue he course through the ward this be the only occasion on which i ever see lord nelson in the summer of 1828 mr lockhart go down to brighton accompany by sir walter scott miss scott mr lockhart and she son john -- the littlejohn to whom scott 's charming tale of a grandfather which be at that time in course of publication have be address it be on the boy 's account the party go to brighton he be very ill and gradually sink while at brighton lockhart have a interview with the duke of wellington and write to murray on the subject _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ may _ 18 1828 i have a message from the d of w to say that he on the whole highly approve the paper on foreign politics but have some criticism to offer on particular point and will send for I some day soon to hear they i have of course signify my readiness to attend he any time he be pleased to appoint and expect it will be next week that the duke maintain he interest in the _ quarterly _ be show by a subsequent extract : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ auchenraith _ January _ 19 1829 sir walter meet I here yesterday and he consider the duke 's

experience a thorough knowledge of the science of war could have write at the outset of he work he apply to the duke of wellington for he papers this rather abrupt request take the duke by surprise the document in he possession be so momentous and the great part of they so confidential in they nature that he feel it to be impossible to entrust they indiscriminately to any man living he however promise napier to put in he hand any specify paper or document he might ask for provide no confidence would be break by its examination he also offer to answer any question napier might put to he and

opinion murray it should be mention have publish southey 's history of the war in spain some negotiation ensue in the course of which mr murray offer 500 guinea for the volume this proposal however be decline by colonel napier murray after fuller consideration offer a thousand guinea which colonel napier accept and the volume be accordingly publish in the course of 1828 notwithstanding the beauty of its style and the grandeur of its description the book give great offence by the severity of its criticism and call forth a multitude of reply and animadversion more than a dozen of these appear in the shape of pamphlet bear they author ' name add to which the _ quarterly review _ depart from the general rule give no less than four criticism in succession this innovation greatly disgust the publisher who regard they as so much lead weigh down he _ review _ although they proceed from the pen of the duke 's right-hand man the rt hon sir george murray they be unreadable and produce no effect it be needless to add the duke have nothing to do with they mr murray publish no further volume of the history of the peninsular war but at he suggestion colonel napier bring out the second and succeed volume on he own account in illustration of the loss which occur to mr murray in publish the first volume of the history the follow letter may be give as address to the editor of the _ morning

bookseller purchase my first volume with the right of refusal for the second volume when the latter be nearly ready a friend inform I that he do not think murray would purchase because he have hear he say that sir george murray have declare it be not ` the book ' he do not point out any particular error but it be not ` the book ' mean doubtless that he own production when it appear would be ` the book ' my friend 's prognostic be not false i be offer just half of the sum give for the first volume i decline it and publish on my own account and certainly i have have no reason to regret that mr bookseller murray wait for ` the book ' indeed he have since tell I very frankly that he have mistake he own interest in answer to the first part of this statement i beg leave to say that i have not at the time to which colonel napier refer the honor of any acquaintance with sir george murray nor have i hold any conversation or correspondence with he on the subject of colonel napier 's book or of

to find by this result that my own proposal to you be perfectly just i will not however venture to offer you a less sum for the second volume but recommend that you should in justice to yourself apply to some other publisher if you should obtain from they the sum which you be right in expect it will afford I great pleasure and if you do not you will find I perfectly ready to negotiate and in any case i shall continue to be with the highest esteem dear sir you obliged and faithful servant john murray i be confident you will do I the justice to insert this letter and have no doubt its contents will convince colonel napier that he recollection of the circumstance have be incomplete i have the honor to be sir you obedient humble servant john murray it may not be generally know that we owe to colonel napier 's work the publication of the duke of wellington 's immortal despatch the duke upon principle refuse to read napier 's work not wish as he say to quarrel with its author but he be make sufficiently acquaint with the contents from friend who have peruse it and who have make the campaign with he could point to praise and blame equally undeserved to design misunderstand and misrepresent as well as to supercilious criticism and patronize approval which could not but be painful to the great commander he nature be too noble to resent this but he resolve in self-defence to give the public the means of ascertain the truth by publish all he most important and secret despatch in order he say to give the world a correct account not only of what he do but of what he intend to do colonel gurwood be appoint editor of the despatch and during they preparation not a page escape the duke 's eye or he own careful revision mr murray who be honor by be choose as the publisher compare this wonderful collection of document to a watch : hitherto the general public have only see in the successful and orderly development of he campaign as it be the hand move over the dial without fault or failure but now the duke open the work and they be enable to inspect the complicated machinery -- the wheel within wheel -- which have produce this admirable result it be enough to state that in these despatch the _ whole _ truth relate to the peninsular war be fully and elaborately set forth at the beginning of 1829 croker consult murray on the subject of a annotated edition of boswell 's johnson murray be greatly please with the idea of a new edition of the work by he laborious friend and closing at once with croker 's proposal write i shall be happy to give as something in the way of remuneration the sum of one thousand guinea mr croker accept the offer and proceed immediately with the work mr murray communicate to mr lockhart the arrangement he have make with croker he answer be : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ January _ 19 1829 i be heartily rejoice that this ` johnson ' of which we have so often talk be in such hand at whatever cost pray ask croker whether boswell 's account of the hebridean tour ought not to be melt into the book sir walter have many m annotation in he ` boswell ' both ` life ' and ` tour ' and will i be sure give they with hearty good will he will write down all that he have hear about johnson when in scotland and in particular about the amusing intercourse between he and lord auchinleck -- boswell 's father -- if croker consider it worth he while sir walter scott 's offer of information -lrb- footnote : sir walter 's letter to croker on the subject will be find in the croker correspondence ii 28 -rrb- to a certain extent delay croker 's progress with the work he write to mr murray -lrb- November 17 1829 -rrb- : the reference to sir walter scott delay we a little as to the revise but he name be well worth the delay my share of the next volume -lrb- the 2nd -rrb- be quite do and i could complete the other two in a fortnight while the work be pass through the press lockhart again write : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ i be read the new ` boswell ' with great pleasure though i think the editor be often wrong a prodigious flood of light be throw on the book assuredly and the incorporation of the ` tour ' be a great advantage now do have a really good index that to the former edition i have continually find inadequate and faulty the book be a dictionary of wisdom and wit and one should know exactly where to find the _ dictum magistrus _ many of croker 's own remark and little disquisition will also be hereafter among the choicest of _ quotabilium _ croker carry out the work with great industry and vigor and it appear in 1831 it contain numerous addition note explanation and memorandum and as the first attempt to explain the difficulty and enigma which lapse of time have create it may not unfairly be say to have be admirably edit and though macaulay accord to he own account smash it in the _ edinburgh _ -lrb- footnote : the correspondence on the subject and the criticism on the work by macaulay will be find in the croker correspondence vol ii pp 24-49 -rrb- some fifty thousand of the life have be sell it have be the fashion with certain recent editor of boswell 's johnson to depreciate croker 's edition but to any one who have take the pain to make himself familiar with that work and to study the vast amount of information there collect such criticism can not but appear most ungenerous croker be acquaint with or seek out all the distinguished survivor of dr johnson 's own generation and by he indefatigable effort be enable to add to the result of he own literary research oral tradition and personal reminiscence which but for he would have be irrevocably lose the addition of subsequent editor be but of trifling value compare with the information collect by mr croker and one of he successor at least have not hesitate slightly to transpose or alter many of mr croker 's note and mark they as he own mr shelley widow of the poet on receive a present of croker 's boswell from mr murray say : _ mr shelley to john murray _ i have read ` boswell 's journal ' ten time : i hope to read it many more it be the most amusing book in the world beside that i do love the kind-hearted wise and gentle bear and think he as lovable and kind a friend as a profound philosopher mr henry taylor submit he play of isaac comnenus -- he first work -- to mr murray in February 1827 lockhart be consult and after peruse the play he write to mr murray : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ there can be no sort of doubt that this play be everyway worthy of come out from albemarle street that the author might greatly improve it by shorten its dialogue often and once at least leave out a scene and by dramatize the scene at the synod instead of narrate it i think sufficiently clear : but probably the author have follow he own course upon deliberation in all these matter i be of opinion certainly that _ no poem _ have be lately publish of anything like the power or promise of this lockhart 's suggestion be submit to mr taylor who gratefully acknowledge he criticism and amend he play mr taylor make a very unusual request he propose to divide the loss on he drama with the publisher he write to mr murray : i have be pretty well convince for some time past that my book will never sell and under these circumstance i can not think it proper that you should be the sole sufferer whenever therefore you be of opinion that the book have have a fair trial i beg you to understand that i shall be ready to divide the loss equally with you that be i conceive the just arrangement in the case though mr lockhart give a interesting review of isaac comnenus in the _ quarterly _ it still hang fire and do not sell a few year later however henry taylor show what he could do as a poet by he philip van artevelde which raise he reputation to the highest point moore after the publication of this drama write in he diary : i breakfasted in the morning at roger 's to meet the new poet mr taylor author of ` philip van artevelde ' : we company besides be sydney smith and southey ` van artevelde ' be a tall handsome young fellow conversation chiefly about the profit bookseller make of we scribbler i remember peter pindar say one of the few time i ever meet he that the bookseller drink they wine in the manner of the hero in the hall of odin out of author ' skull this be a sharp say but roger if he have choose to relate he own experience when he negotiate with mr murray about the sale of crabbe 's work and the result of that negotiation might have prove that the rule be not of universal application the family library have already be mention mr murray have long contemplate a serial publication by means of which good literature and copyright work might be render cheaper and accessible to a wider circle of reader than they have hitherto be the society for the diffusion of useful knowledge be establish in 1828 with henry brougham as chairman mr murray subscribe # 10 to this society and agree to publish they library of entertaining knowledge shortly afterwards however he withdraw from this undertaking which be transfer to mr knight and revert to he own propose publication of cheap work the first volume of the family library appear in April 1829 murray send a copy to charle knight who return he the first volume of the library of entertaining knowledge _ mr charle knight to john murray _ we each launch we vessel on the same day and i most earnestly hope that both will succeed for good must come of that success we have plenty of sea-room and need never run foul of each other my belief be that in a very few year scarcely any other description of book will be publish and in that case we that be first in the field may hope to win the race mr murray 's intention be to include in the library work on a variety of subject include history biography voyage and travels natural history science and general literature they be to be write by the best-known author of the day -- sir walter scott southey milman lockhart washington irve barrow allan cunningham dr brewster captain head gr gleig palgrave and other the collection be head by a admirable life of napoleon by jg lockhart partly condensed from scott 's life of napoleon bonaparte and illustrate by george cruikshank when lockhart be first invite to undertake this biography he consult sir walter scott as to the propriety of he do so sir walter reply : _ sir w scott to mr lockhart _ _ October _ 30 1828 you scruple about do a epitome of the ` life of boney ' for the family library that be to be be a great deal over delicate my book in nine thick volume can never fill the place which we friend murray want you to fill and which if you do not some one else will right soon

have be cancel by that event he eye rest on he as the fittest person from he long intimacy with the poet to be entrust with the task for which indeed lord byron have himself select he accordingly in

correspondence together and many letter pass between murray and moore on the subject from the voluminous correspondence we retain the follow extract from a letter from moore to murray : one of my great object as you will see in read I be to keep my style down to as much simplicity as i be capable of for nothing could be imagine more discordant than the mixture of any of we asiatico-hibernian eloquence with the simple english diction of byron 's letter murray show the early part of byron 's life to lockhart who reply to he at once : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ February _ 23 1829 i can not wait till tomorrow to say that i think the beginning of ` byron ' quite perfect in every way -- the style simple and unaffected as the material be rich and how sad it will be moore 's greatest work -- at least next to the ` melody ' and will be a fortune to you my wife say it be divine by all means engrave the early miniature never be anything so drearily satisfactory to the imagination as the whole picture of the lame boy 's start in life moore be greatly touch by this letter he write from sloperton : _ mr moore to john murray _ lockhart 's praise have give I great pleasure and he wife 's even still greater but after all the merit be in my subject -- in the man not in I he must be a sad bungler who would spoil such a story as the work advance sir walter scott 's opinion also be ask _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ September _ 29 1829 sir walter have read the first 120 page of moore 's ` life of byron ' and he say they be charming and not a syllable _ de trop _ he be now busy at a grand rummage among he papers and have already find one of lord byron 's letter which shall be at mr moore 's service forthwith he expect to find more of they this be curious as be the first of ` byron ' to scott the first volume of lord byron 's life and letter publish on January 1 1830 be read with enthusiasm and meet with a very favourable reception moore say in he diary that lady byron be highly please with the ` life ' but among the letter receive by mr murray one of the most interesting be from mr shelley to whom a presentation copy have be send _ mr shelley to john murray _ _ January _ 19 1830 except the occupation of one or two annoyance i have do nothing but read since i get lord byron 's life i have no pretension to be a critic yet i know infinitely well what please I not to mention the judicious arrangement and happy _ tact _ display by mr moore which distinguish the book i must say a word concern the style which be elegant and forcible i be particularly strike by the observation on lord byron 's character before he departure to greece and on he return there be strength and richness as well as sweetness the great charm of the work to I and it will have the same to you be that the lord byron i find there be _ we _ lord byron -- the fascinating faulty philosophical being -- daring the world docile to a private circle impetuous and indolent gloomy and yet more gay than any other i live with he again in these page -- get reconcile -lrb- as i use in he lifetime -rrb- to those waywardness which annoy I when he be away through the delightful tone of he conversation and manners he own letter and journal mirror himself as he be and be invaluable there be something cruelly kind in this single volume when will the next come impatient before how tenfold more so be i now among its many other virtue this book be accurate to a miracle i have not stumble on one mistake with regard either to time place or feeling i be dear sir you obedient and obliged servant mary shelley the preparation of the second volume proceed more rapidly than the first for lord byron 's letter to murray and moore during the later year of he life cover the whole period and give to the record a almost autobiographical character it appear in January 1831 and amongst many other reader of it mr somerville to whom mr murray send a present of the book be full of unstinted praise _ mr somerville to john murray _ _ January _ 13 1831 you have kindly afford I a source of very great interest and pleasure in the perusal of the second volume of moore 's life of byron in my opinion it be very superior to the first there be less repetition of the letter they be better write abound more in criticism and observation and make the reader better acquaint with lord byron 's principle and character he morality be certainly more suit to the meridian of italy than england but with all he fault there be a charm about he that excite the deepest interest and admiration he letter to lady byron be more affect and beautiful than anything i have read it must ever be a subject of regret that it be not send it seem impossible that it should not have make a lasting impression and might possibly have change the destiny of both with kind remembrance to mr murray and the young people believe I truly yours mary somerville mr croker 's opinion be as follow : as to what you say of byron 's volume no doubt there be _ longueur _ but really not many the most teasing part be the blank which perplex without conceal i also think that moore go on a wrong principle when publish _ any _ personality he do not publish _ all _ it be like a suppression of evidence when such horror be publish of sir s romilly it would have be justice to he memory to show that on the _ slightest _ provocation byron would treat he dearest friend in the same style when he sneer against lady byron and she mother be record it would lessen they effect if it be show that he sneer at all man and womankind in turn and that the friend of he choicest selection or the mistress of he maddest love be serve no better when the maggot -lrb- selfishness -rrb- bit than he wife or he mother-in-law the appearance of the life induce captain medwin to publish he conversation with lord byron a work now chiefly remember as have call forth from murray who be attack in it a reply which as a crash refutation of personal charge have seldom be surpass -lrb- footnote : mr murray 's answer to medwin 's fabrication be publish in the appendix to the 8vo edition of lord byron 's poem -rrb- amongst the review of the biography be one by lockhart in the _ quarterly _ -lrb- no 87 -rrb- which be very favourable but a article by mr croker in no 91 on another of moore 's work -- the life of lord edward fitzgerald -- be of a very different character murray tell moore of the approach appearance of the article in the next number and moore enter in he diary see my ` lord edward fitzgerald ' announce as one of the article in the _ quarterly _ to be abuse of course and this too immediately after my dining and junketing with both author and publisher _ mr moore to john murray _ _ October _ 25 1831 i

ugliness of feature -lrb- which be also remarkable -rrb- but particularly for have this portrait a expression of _ stupidity _ and for its be _ molto antipatico _ as we say in we language but perhaps it be not the fault of the painter but of the original and i be sorry for that what be certain be that towards such a creature nobody may feel inclined to be indulgent and if she have fault and error to be pardon for she will never be so on account of she _ antipatium _ but pray do not say that to mr brockedon a copy be likewise send to sir r peel with the follow letter : albemarle street _ April

always on very friendly term with he though not live in particular intimacy out of school i do not recollect ever have a single angry word with he or that there ever be any the slightest jealousy or coldness between we it be a gratification to I to have my name associate with he in the manner in which you have place it in friendly connection and i do not believe if he could have foresee when we be boy together at school this continuance of a sort of amicable relation between we after he death the idea would have be otherwise than please to he believe I my dear sir very faithfully yours robert peel a few word remain to be add respect the statue of lord byron which have be so splendidly execute by thorwaldsen at rome mr hobhouse write to murray : thorwaldsen offer the complete work

honor of he memory which you now desire be in its proportion subject to the same objection i do indeed greatly wish for a figure by thorwaldsen here but no taste ought to be indulge to the prejudice of a duty with my respectful compliment to the committee i beg you to believe I yours truly john ireland the statue be for some time lay up in a shed on a thame wharf a attempt be make in the house of common to alter the decision of the dean and chapter but it prove of no avail i would do my best say mr hobhouse to prevail upon sir robert peel to use he influence with the dean it be a national disgrace that the statue should lie neglect in a carrier 's ware-house and it be so feel by man of all party i have have a formal application from trinity college cambridge for leave to place the monument in they great library and it have be intimate to I that the french government desire to have it for the louvre the result be that the subscriber in order to retain the statue in england forward it to trinity college cambridge whose noble library it now adorn the only memorial to byron in london be the contemptible lean bronze statue in apsley house garden nearly opposite the statue

apply to he for a interview mr murray however in whose mind the former episode be still fresh be unwilling to accede to this request and reply in the third person _ john murray to mr b disraelus _ mr murray be oblige to decline at present any personal interview but if mr benjamin disraelus be dispose to confide he m to mr murray as a man of business mr disraelus be assure that the proposal will be

my elect critic be the reason of my address myself to you i be sorry that mr mitchell be out of town because he be a person in whom you rightly have confidence but from some observation he make to I the other day it be perhaps not to be regret that he do not interfere in this business as he have overrate some juvenile indiscretion of mine i fear he be too friendly a critic i be thus explicit because i think that candor for all reason be highly desirable if you feel any inclination to pursue this affair act as you like and fix upon any critic you please i have no objection to mr lockhart who be certainly a able one and be i believe influence by no undue partiality towards I at all event this be a affair of no great importance -- and whatever may be you determination it will not change

truth be my friend and myself differ in the estimate of the m allude to and while i feel justified from he opinion in submit it to you judgment i feel it due to my own to explain verbally the contend view of the case for reason which must be obvious as you force I to decide i decide as i think most prudently the work be one which i dare say would neither disgrace you to publish nor I to write but it be not the kind of production which should recommence we connection or be introduce to the world by the publisher of byron and anastasius i be now about to leave england for a indefinite perhaps a long period when i return if i do return i trust it will be in my power for the _ third time _ to endeavor that you should be the means of submit my work to the public for this i shall be ever ready

in all probability cost I more than i shall ever obtain by it and indeed i may truly say that to write that work i have throw to the wind all the obvious worldly prospects of life i be ready to make every possible sacrifice on my part to range myself under you color i will willingly give up the immediate and positive receipt of a large sum of money for the copyright and by publish the work anonymously renounce that certain sale which as a successful although i confess not very worthy author i can command but in quit my present publisher i incur from the term of we last agreement a _

utterly inefficient for the last week in a state of almost complete blindness but be now i trust nearly restore mr milman however have read to I the whole of the m it be a very remarkable production -- very wild very extravagant very german very powerful very poetical it will i think be much read -- as far as one dare predict anything of the capricious taste of the day -- much admire and much abused it be much more in the macaulay than in the croker line and the former be evidently in the ascendant some passage will startle the rigidly orthodox the phrenologist will be in rapture i tell you all this that you may judge for yourself one thing insist upon if you publish it-that the title be change the whole beauty of the latter part especially be its truth it be a rapid volume of travels a childe harold in prose therefore do not let it be call a romance on any account let those who will believe it to be a real history and those who be not take in dispute whether it be truth or fiction if it make any sensation this will add to its notoriety a psychological auto-biography would be too sesquipedalian a title but my life psychologically related or the psychology of my life or some such title might be substitute hh milman before mr milman 's communication have be receive another press letter arrive from mr disraelus _ mr disraelus to john murray _ my dear sir it be with

can proceed from my pen hostile to the general question of _ reform _ independent however of all personal consideration and view the question of reform for a moment in the light in which my critic evidently speculate i would humbly suggest that the cause which he advocate would perhaps be more unite in the present page by be pass over _ in silence _ it be important that this work should be a work not of _ party _ but of national interest and i be induce to believe that a large class in this country who think themselves bind to support the present administration from a superficial sympathy with they domestic measure have long view they foreign policy with distrust and alarm if the public be at length convince that foreign policy instead of be a abstract and isolate division of the national interest be in fact the basis of we empire and present order and that this basis shake under the unskilful government of the cabinet the public may be induce to withdraw they confidence from

dear sir yours truly thomas carlyle mr murray be willing to undertake the risk of publishing 750 copy and thus to allow the author to exhibit he literary wares to the public even if the whole edition have sell the pecuniary result to both author and publisher would have be comparatively trifling but as the copyright be to remain in the author 's possession and he would have be able to make a much better bargain with the future edition the term may be consider very liberal have regard to the exceptional nature of the work mr carlyle however who do not know the usual custom of publisher have in the meantime take away he m and offer it to other publisher in london evidently to try whether he could not get a better bid for he book even jeffrey think it be too much of the nature of a rhapsody to command success or respectful attention the publisher think the same carlyle take the m to fraser of regent street who offer to publish it if carlyle would _ give he _ a sum not exceed # 150 sterling he have already be to longman & co offer they he german literary history but they decline to publish the work and he now offer they he sartor resartus with a similar result he also try

already become visible the sartor resartus be not however lose two year after carlyle 's visit to london it come out bit by bit in _ fraser 's magazine _ through the influence of emerson it be issue as a book at boston in the united state and carlyle get some money for he production it be eventually publish in england and strange to say have have the largest sale in the people 's edition of

more urgent affair i have hold no consultation with you regard my book and the sale or no sale of they as to the third edition of the state in its relation i should think the remain copy have better be get rid of in whatever summary or ignominious mode you may deem best they must be dead beyond recall as to the other i do not know whether the season of the year have at all revive the demand and would suggest to you whether it would be well to advertise they a little i do not think they find they way much into the second-hand shop with regard to the fourth edition i do not know whether it would be well to procure any review or notice of it and i be not a fair judge of its merit even in comparison with the original form of the work but my idea be that it be less defective both in the theoretical and in the historical development and ought to be worth the notice of those who deem the earlier edition worth they notice and purchase : that it would really put a reader in possession of the view it be intend to convey which i fear be more than can with any truth be say of its predecessor i be not however in any state of anxiety or impatience : and i be chiefly move to refer these suggestion to you judgment from perceive that the fourth edition be as yet far from have clear itself i remain always very faithfully yours we gladstone in the same year another author of different

of he posthumous work be convince that he would have have no other after what have pass on you lordship 's side however i feel that it would be inconsistent with my own character to embarrass you any

matter to please it with respect to the critique in the _ time _ i fully agree with you that it be harsh and unjust and the passage select by no means calculate to afford a fair idea of the contents of the work a book however like the bible in spain can scarcely be publish without exciting considerable hostility and i have be so long use to receive hard knock that they make no impression upon I after all the abuse of the _ time _ be better than its silence it would scarcely have attack the work unless it have deem it of some importance and so the public will think all i can say be that i do

antipode of lord carnarvon and yet how they tally in what they have in common and that be much -- the people the scenery of galicium and the suspicion and absurdity of spanish jacks-in-office who yield not in ignorance or insolence to any kind of red-tapist hatch in the hot-bed of jobbery and utilitarian mares-nest borrow spare none of they i see he hit right and left and floor he man wherever he meet he i be please with he honest sincerity of purpose and he graphic abrupt style it be like a old spanish ballad leap in _ re media _ go from incident to incident bang bang bang hop step and

house and let I have the satisfaction of at least try in the first place to settle the matter amicably in any case however you may rely upon all my means to promote the success of you work the offer of which have make I dear sir you obliged and faithful servant john murray _ mr colquhoun to john murray _ _ march _ 20 1841 dear sir i be much oblige by you note which i receive yesterday i shall endeavor to see you directly and when i explain the cause of my dissatisfaction with messr blackwood i be sure you will at once see that it would be impossible for we to go on comfortably together with my second edition and even if any adjustment be bring about i feel convinced that the book would suffer i do not mean to imply anything against the messr blackwood as man of business and should be sorry to be thus understand but this case have be a peculiar one and require too long a explanation for a letter in the meantime i have write to you under the strictest confidence as the messr b be not aware of my intention of bring out a second edition at the present time or of my leave they my reason however be such that my determination can not be alter and i hope after a full explanation with you that we shall at once agree to publish the book with the least possible delay i shall be most happy to return you note which you may afterwards show to messr b and i may add that have you

the moor and the loch it may be add that in the end mr colquhoun do as urge by murray return to the blackwood who still continue to publish he work allan cunningham end he literary life by prepare the memoirs of he friend sir david wilkie shortly before he undertake the work he have be prostrate by a stroke of paralysis but on he partial recovery he proceed with the memoirs and the enfeeble effect of he attack may be trace in portion of the work towards the close of he life wilkie have make a journey to the east have paint the sultan at constantinople and afterwards make he way to smyrna rhode beyrout jaffa and jerusalem he return through egypt and at alexandrium he embark on board the _ oriental _ steamship for england while at alexandrium he have complain of illness which increase partly in consequence of he intense sickness at sea and he die off gibraltar on June 1 1841 when he body be commit to the deep turner 's splendid picture of the scene be one of wilkie 's best memorial a review of allan cunningham 's work by mr lockhart appear in the _ quarterly _ no 144 previous to its appearance he write to mr murray as follow : _ mr lockhart to john murray _ _ February _ 25 1843 dear murray i do not know if you have read much of the life of wilkie all cunningham 's part seem to be wretched but in the italian and spanish journal and letter wilkie shine out in a comparatively new character he be a very eloquent and i fancy a deep and instructive critic on painting at all event vol ii be full of very high interest be there anywhere a good criticism on the alteration that wilkie 's style exhibit after he italian and spanish tour the general impression always be and i suppose will always be that the change be for the worse but it will be a nice piece of work to account for a unfortunate change be the result of travel and observation which we now own to have produce such a stock of admirable theoretical disquisition on the principle of the art i can see little to admire or like in the man wilkie some good homely scotch kindness for kith and kin and for some old friend too perhaps but generally the character seem not to rise above the dull prudentiality of a decent man in awe of the world and the great and awfully careful about no 1 no genuine enjoyment save in study of art and get money through that study he be a fellow that you can not suppose ever to have be drunk or in love -- too much a presbyterian elder for either you or I mr murray receive a communication -lrb- December 16 1841 -rrb- from mr john sterling carlyle 's friend with whom he have have transaction on he own account not he say respect he own literary affair but those of a friend the friend be mr john stuart mill son of the historian of british indium he have complete he work on logic of which mr sterling have the highest opinion he say it have be the labor of many year of a singularly subtle patient and comprehensive mind it will be we chief speculative monument of this age mr mill himself address mr murray first on December 20 1841 while he be prepare the work for the press and again in January and February 1842 when he have forward the m to the publisher and request he decision we find however that mr murray be very ill at the time that he could not give the necessary attention to the subject and that the m be eventually return when copyright become the subject of legislation in 1843 mr murray receive a letter from mr gladstone _ mr gladstone to john murray _ whitehall _ February _ 6 1843 my dear sir i beg leave to thank you for the information contain in and accompany you note which reach I on Saturday the view with which the clause relate to copyright in the custom act be frame be that those interested in the exclusion of pirate work would take care to supply the board of custom from time to time with list of all work under copyright which be at all likely to be reprint abroad and that this would render the law upon the whole much more operative and more fair than a enormous catalogue of all the work entitle to the privilege of which it would be find very difficult for the officer at the port to manage the use direction in conformity with the act of last session will be send to the colony but i can not omit to state that i learn from you note with great satisfaction that step be to be take here to back the recent proceedings of the legislature i must not hesitate to express my conviction that what parliament have do will be fruitless unless the _ law _ be second by the adoption of such mode of publication as will allow the public here and in the colony to obtain possession of new and popular english work at moderate price if it be practicable for author and publisher to make such arrangement i should hope to see a great extension of we book trade as well as much advantage to literature from the measure that have now be take and from those which i trust we shall be enable to take in completion of they but unless the proceedings of the trade itself adapt and adjust themselves to the altered circumstance i can feel no doubt that we shall relapse into or towards the old state of thing the law will be first evade and then relax i be my dear sir faithfully yours we gladstone here it be fitting that a few paragraph should be devote to the closing year of robert southey who for so many year have be the friend and coadjutor of the publisher of the _ quarterly _ between 1808 and 1838 southey have write ninety-four article for the _ quarterly _ the last be upon he friend thoma telford the engineer who leave he a legacy he have be return member of parliament for downton -lrb- before the reform bill pass -rrb- but refuse the honor -- a curious episode not often remember in the career of this distinguished man of letter when about fifty-five year old he only certain source of income be from he pension from which he receive # 145 and from he laureateship which be # 90 but the larger portion of these sum go in payment for he life insurance so that not more than # 100 could be calculate on as available he work be not always profitable in one year he only receive # 26 for twenty-one of he book publish by longman murray give he # 1000 for the copyright of the peninsular war but he book of the church and he vindicia produce nothing southey 's chief means of support be the payment -lrb- generally # 100 for each article -rrb- which he receive for he contribution to the _ quarterly _ but while recognize this as he could not fail to do as well as murray 's general kindness towards he he occasionally allow a vein of discontent to show itself even in he acknowledgment of favor receive in 1835 southey receive a pension of # 300 from the government of sir robert peel he be offer a baronetcy at the same time but he decline it as he circumstance do not permit he to accept the honor _ mr southey to john murray _ _ June _ 17 1835 what sir robert peel have do for I will enable I when my present engagement be complete to employ the remainder of my life upon those work for which inclination peculiar circumstance and long preparation have best qualify I they be the history of portugal the history of the monastic order and the history of english literature from the time when wharton break off the possibility of accomplish three such work at my age could not be dream of if i have not make very considerable progress with one and no little though not in such regular order with the other shortly after he second marriage southey 's intellect begin to fail he and he soon sink into a state of mental imbecility he would wander about he library take down a book look into it and then put it back again but be incapable of work when mr murray send he the octavo edition of the peninsular war he

small havoc among we literary man -- maginn cunningham basil hall and poor southey worst of all lockhart 's letter of late have make I very uneasy too about he have he yet return from scotland and be he at all improve only a few month later mr murray himself be to be call away from the scene of he life 's activity in the autumn of 1842 he health have already begin to fail rapidly and he have find it necessary to live much out of london and to try various watering-place but although he rally at time sufficiently to return to he business for short period he never recover and pass away in sleep on June 27 1843 at the age of sixty-five chapter xxxii john murray as a publisher in consider the career of john murray the reader can hardly fail to be strike with the remarkable manner in which he personal quality appear to correspond with the circumstance out of which he build he fortune when he enter he profession the standard of conduct in every department of life connect with the publishing trade be determine by aristocratic idea the unwritten law which regulate the practice of bookselling in the eighteenth century be derive from the stationer ' company found as it have be on the joint principle of commercial monopoly and state control this famous organization have long lose its old vitality but it have bequeath to the bookselling community a large portion of its original spirit both in the practice of cooperative publication which produce the trade book so common in the last century and in that deep-rooted belief in the perpetuity of copyright which only receive its death-blow from the celebrated judgment of the house of lord in the case of donaldson _ v _ becket in 1774 narrow and exclusive as they may have be in they relation to the public interest there can be no doubt that these tradition help to constitute in the dealings of the bookseller among themselves a standard of honor which put a certain curb on the pursuit of private gain it be this feeling which provoke such intense indignation in the trade against the publisher who take advantage of they strict legal rights to invade what be generally regard as the property of they brethren while the sense of what be due to the credit as well as to the interest of a great organized body make the associate bookseller zealous in the promotion of all enterprise likely to add to the fame of english literature again there be something in the best sense of the word aristocratic in the position of literature itself patronage indeed have decline the patron of the early day of the century who like halifax seek in the university or in the london coffee-house for literary talent to strengthen the rank of political party have disappear together with the later and inferior order of patron who after the manner of bubb dodington natter he social pride by maintain a retinue of poetical client at he country seat the nobility themselves absorb in politics or pleasure care far less for letter than they father in the reign of anne and the first two george hence as johnson say the bookseller have become the maecena of the age but not the bookseller of grub street to be a man of letter be no longer a reproach johnson himself have be reward with a literary pension and the name of almost all the distinguish scholar of the latter part of the eighteenth century -- warburton the two warton lowth burke hume gibbon robertson -- belong to man who either by birth or merit be in a position which render they independent of literature as a source of livelihood the author influence the public rather than the public the author while the part of the bookseller be restricted to introduce and distribute to society the work which the scholar have design naturally enough from such condition arise a highly aristocratic standard of taste the center of literary judgment pass from the half-democratic society of the coffee-house to the dining-room of scholar like cambridge or beauclerk and opinion form from the brilliant conversation at such gathering as the literary club afterwards circulate among the public either in the treatise of individual critic or in the page of the two lead monthly review the society from which it proceed though not in the strict sense of the word fashionable be eminently refine and widely representative it include the politician the clergyman the artist the connoisseur and be permeate with the necessary leaven of feminine intuition range from the observation of miss burney or the vivacity of mr thrale to the stately morality of mr montagu and mr hannah more on the other hand the whole period of murray 's life as a publisher extend to speak broadly from the first french revolution to almost the eve of the french revolution of 1848 be characterize in a marked degree by the advance of democracy in all direction there be a uprising of the spirit of individual liberty against the prescription of established authority in politics the tendency be apparent in the progress of the reform movement in commerce it be mark by the inauguration of the free trade movement in literature it make itself feel in the great outburst of poetry at the beginning of the century and in the assertion of the superiority of individual genius to the traditional law of form the effect produce by the working of the democratic spirit within the aristocratic constitution of society and taste may without exaggeration be describe as prodigious at first sight indeed there seem to be a certain abruptness in the transition from the highly organize society represent in boswell 's life of johnson to the philosophical retirement of wordsworth and coleridge it be only when we look beneath the surface that we see the old tradition still uphold by a small class of conservative writer include campbell roger and crabbe and as far as style be concern by some of the romantic innovator byron scott and moore but generally speak the age succeed the first french revolution exhibit the triumph of individualism society itself be penetrate by new idea literature become fashionable man of position be no longer ashamed to be know as author nor woman of distinction afraid to welcome man of letter in they drawing-room on all side the excitement and curiosity of the time be reflect in the demand for poem novel essay travels and every kind of imaginative production under the name of _ belle lettre _ a certain romantic spirit of enterprise show itself in murray 's character at the very outset of he career tie to a partner of a petty and timorous disposition he seize a early opportunity to rid himself of the incubus with youthful ardor he beg of a veteran author to be allow the privilege of publishing as he first undertake a work which he himself genuinely admire he refuse to be bind by mere trading calculation the business of a publishing bookseller he write to a correspondent be not in he shop or even in he connection but in he brain in all he professional conduct a largeness of view be apparent a new conception of the scope of he trade seem early to have rise in he mind and he be perhaps the first member of the stationer ' craft to separate the business of bookselling from that of publishing when constable in edinburgh send he a miscellaneous order of book from london he reply : country order be a branch of business which i have ever totally decline as incompatible with my more serious plan as a publisher with idea of this kind it may readily be imagine that murray be not what be usually call a good man of business a fact of which he be well aware as the follow incident which occur in he later year amusingly indicate the head of one of the larger firm with which he deal come in person to albemarle street to receive payment of he account this be duly hand to he in bill which by some carelessness he lose on he way home he thereupon write to mr murray request he to advertise in he own name for the lose property murray 's reply be as follow : twickenham _ October _ 26 1841 my dear ----- i be exceedingly sorry for the vexatious though i hope only temporary loss which you have meet with but i have so little character for be a man of business that if the bill be advertise in _ my _ name it would be publicly confirm the suspicion -- but in you own name it will be only consider as a very extraordinary circumstance and i therefore give my impartial opinion in favor of the latter mode remain my dear ----- most truly yours john murray the possession of ordinary commercial shrewdness however be by no mean the quality most essential for successful publishing at the beginning of the nineteenth century both constable and ballantyne be man of great cleverness and aptitude for business but want certain higher endowment they be unable to resist the whirl of excitement accompany a unprecedented measure of financial success they ruin be as rapid as they rise to murray on the other hand perhaps they inferior in the average art of calculation a vigorous native sense temper a genuine enthusiasm for what be excellent in literature give precisely that mixture of dash and steadiness which be need to satisfy the complicated requirement of the public taste a high sense of rectitude be apparent in all he business transaction and charle knight do he no more than justice in say that he have leave a example of talent and honorable conduct which would long be a model for those who aim at distinction in the profession he would have nothing to do with what be poor and shabby when it be suggest to he as a young publisher that he former partner be ready to bear part of the risk in a contemplated undertaking he refuse to associate he fortune with a man who conduct he business on method that he do not approve i can not allow my name to stand with he because he undersell all other publisher at the regular and advertised price boundless as be he admiration for the genius of scott and byron he abandon one of the most cherish object of he ambition-to be the publisher of new work by the author of waverley -- rather than involve himself further in transaction which he foresee must lead to discredit and disaster and at the risk of a quarrel strove to recall byron to the way of sound literature when through he wayward genius he seem to be drift into a unworthy course in the same way when the disagreement between the firm of constable and longman seem likely to turn to he own advantage instead of make haste to seize the golden opportunity he exert himself to effect a reconciliation between the disputant by point out what he consider the just and reasonable view of they mutual interest the letter which on this occasion he address respectively to mr ag hunter to the constable and to the longman be model of good sense and manly rectitude nor be he conduct to constable after the downfall of the latter less worthy of admiration deeply as constable have injure he by the reckless conduct of he business murray not only retain no ill-feeling against he but anxious simply to help a brother in misfortune resign in he favor in a manner full of the most delicate consideration he own claim to a valuable copyright the same warmth of heart and disinterested friendship appear in he effort to re-establish the affair of the robinson after the failure of that firm yet remarkable as he be for he loyalty to he comrade he be no less distinguish by he spirit and independence no man without a very high sense of justice and self-respect could have conduct a correspondence on a matter of business in term of such dignified propriety as murray employ in address benjamin disraelus after the collapse of the _ representative _ it be indeed a proof of power to appreciate character remarkable in so young a man that disraelus should after all that have pass between they have approach murray in he capacity of publisher with complete confidence he know that he be deal with a man at once shrewd and magnanimous and he give he credit for understand how to estimate he professional interest apart from he sense of private injury perhaps he most distinguishing characteristic as a publisher be he unfeigned love of literature for its own sake he almost romantic admiration for genius and its production raise he above the atmosphere of petty calculation not unfrequently it of course lead he into commercial mistake and in he purchase of crabbe 's tale he find to he cost that he enthusiastic appreciation of that author 's work and the magnificence of he dealings with he be not the measure of the public taste yet disappointment of this kind in no way embittered he temper or affect the liberality with which he treat writer like washington irving of whose power he have himself once form a high conception the mere love of money indeed be never a absorb motive in murray 's commercial career otherwise it be certain that he course in the suppression of byron 's memoirs would have be something very different to that which he actually pursue on the perfect letter which he write to scott present he with he fourth share in marmion the best comment be the equally admirable letter in which scott return he thanks the grandeur -- for that seem the appropriate word -- of he dealings with man of high genius be see in he payment to byron while he confidence in the solid value of literary excellence appear from the fact that when the _ quarterly _ be not pay its expense he give southey for he life of nelson double the usual rate of remuneration no doubt he lavish generosity be politic as well as splendid this and the prestige which he obtain as byron 's publisher naturally draw to he all that be vigorous and original in the intellect of the day so that there be a general desire among young author to be introduce to the public under he auspices the relation between author and publisher which have prevail in the eighteenth century be in he case curiously inverted and in the place of a solitary scholar like johnson surround by a association of bookseller the drawing-room of murray now present the remarkable spectacle of a single publisher act as the center of attraction to a host of distinguished writer in murray the spirit of the eighteenth century seem to meet and harmonize with the spirit of the nineteenth enthusiasm daring originality and freedom from conventionality make he eminently a man of he time and in a certain sense he do as much as any of he contemporary to swell that movement in he profession towards complete individual liberty which have be grow almost from the foundation of the stationer ' company on the other hand in he temper taste and general principle he reflect the best and most ancient tradition of he craft have he life be prolong he would have witness the disappearance in the trade of many institution which he reverence and always seek to develop some of they indeed vanish in he own life-time the old association of bookseller with its accompaniment of trade-books dwindle with the growth of the spirit of competition and the greater facility of communication so that long before he death the co-operation between the bookseller of london and edinburgh be no more than a memory another institution which have he warm support be the sale dinner but this too have all but succumb of recent year to the exist tendency for new and more rapid method of conduct business the object of the sale dinner be to induce the great distribute house and the retail bookseller to speculate and buy a increase supply of book on special term speculation have now almost cease in consequence of the enormous number of book publish which make it difficult for a bookseller to keep a large stock of any single work and render the life of a new book so precarious that the demand for it may at any moment come to a sudden stop the country bookseller -- a class in which murray be always deeply interested -- be die out profit on book be cut down to a minimum these tradesman find it almost impossible to live by the sale of book alone and be force to couple this with some other kind of business the apparent risk involve in murray 's extraordinary spirit of adventure be in reality diminish by the many check which in he day operate on competition and by the high price then pay for ordinary book man be at that time in the habit of form large private library and furnish they with the sumptuous edition of travels and book of costly engrave issue from murray 's press the taste of the time have change collection of book have be supersede as a fashion by collection of picture and the circulate library encourage the habit of read book without buy they cheap booksel the characteristic of the age have be promote by the removal of the tax on paper and by the fact that paper can now be manufacture out of refuse at a very low cost this cheapness the ideal condition for which charle knight sigh have be accompany by a distinct deterioration in the taste and industry of the general reader the multiplication of review magazine manual and abstract have impair the love of and perhaps the capacity for study research and scholarship on which the general quality of literature must depend book and even knowledge like other commodity may in proportion to the ease with which they be obtain lose at once both they external value and they intrinsic merit murray 's professional success be sufficient evidence of the extent of he intellectual power the foregoing memoir have confine itself almost exclusively to a account of he life as a publisher and it have be leave to the reader 's imagination to divine from a few glimpse how much of this success be due to force of character and a rare combination of personal quality a few conclude word on this point may not be inappropriate quick-tempered and impulsive he be at the same time warm-hearted and generous to a fault while a genuine sense of humor which constantly show itself in he letter save he many a time from those trouble into which the hasty often fall i wish write george borrow within a short time of the publisher 's death that all the world be as gay as he he be in some respects indolent and not infrequently cause serious misunderstanding by he neglect to answer letter but when he do apply himself to work he achieve result more solid than most of he compeer he have moreover a wonderful power of attraction and both in he conversation and correspondence possess a gift of felicitous expression which rarely fail to arouse a sympathetic response in those whom he address throughout the trade he be beloved and he rarely lose a friend among those who have come within he personal influence he be eager to look for and quick to discern any promise of talent in the young every one he would say have a book in he or she if one only know how to extract it and many be the time that he lend a help hand to those who be first enter on a literary career to he remarkable power as a host the many description of he dinner party which have be preserve amply testify he be more than a mere entertainer and take the utmost pain so to combine and to place he guest as best to promote sympathetic conversation and the general harmony of the gathering among the note wit and talker moreover who assemble round he table he be fully able to hold he own in conversation and in repartee on one occasion lady bell be present at one of these party and write : the talk be of wit and moore give specimen charle think that we host murray say the best thing that brilliant night many of the friend whose name be most conspicuous in these page have pass away before he but of those who remain there be scarcely one whose letter do not testify to the general affection with which he be regard we give here one or two extract from letter receive during he last illness thoma mitchell write to mr murray 's son : give my most affectionate remembrance to you father more than once i should have sink under the ill of life but for he kind support and countenance and so i believe would many other say besides myself be he malady

beyond the sea and we will close these remark with two typical extract from the letter of american correspondent to mr murray 's son dr robinson of new york sum up he quality in these word : i have deeply sympathise with the bereaved family at the tiding of the decease of one of whom i have hear and read from childhood and to whose kindness and friendship i have recently be myself so much
