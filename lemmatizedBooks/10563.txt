i turn to ` im with a smile ` i be watchman ` ere ' i ses ` and i let in who i think i will this be not a public ` ighway ' i ses ` it be a wharf ' ` bill ' he se ` you be a genius ' ` if miss lamb

she stand there chat and smile and seem to forget all about the cap'n and every moment i be afraid that the other one might come up at last she go off look behind ` er to the ship and then i go outside and put my back up agin the gate and wait i ` ad hardly be there ten minute afore the other one come along i see ` er stop and speak to a policeman and then she come straight over to I ' i want to see cap'n tarbell ' she se ` cap'n tarbell ' i ses very slow ` cap'n tarbell ` as go off for the evening ' ` go off ' she se stare ` but he can not ` ave be you sure ' ` sartain ' i ses then i

let ` er go i should ha ' save myself a lot o ' trouble and the man wot deserve it would ha ' get it instead o ' that i tell ` er about the music - ` all and arter carry on like a silly gal o ' seventeen and say she could not think of it she give way and say she would go with I to find ` im i be all right so far as clothes go as it happen mr plimmer say once that i get more and more dressy every time she see I and my missis ` ad say the same thing only in a different way i just take a peep through the wicket and see that joe ` ad take up my dooty and then we set off i say i be not quite sure which one he would go to but we would try the pagoda music - ` all fust and we go there on a bus from aldgate it be the fust evening out i ` ad ` ad for year and i should ` ave enjoy it if it ` ad not be for miss lamb wotever cap'n tarbell could ha ' see in ` er i can not think she be quiet and stupid and bad-tempered when the bus-conductor come round for the fare she ` ad not get any change and when we get to the hall she do such eggsterrordinary thing try to find ` er pocket that i try to look as if she do not belong to I when she leave off she smile and say she be farther off than ever and arter three or four wot be stand there ` ad beg ` er to have another try i ` ad to pay for the two the ` ouse be pretty full when we get in but she do not take no notice of that she idea be that she could walk about all over the place look for cap'n tarbell and it take three man in button and a policeman to persuade ` er different we be push into a couple o ' seat at last and then she start find fault with I ` where be cap'n tarbell ' she se ` why do not you find he ' ` i 'll go and look for ` im in the bar presently ' i ses ` he be sure to be there arter a turn or two ' i manage to keep ` er quiet for ` arf a hour -- with the ` elp of the people wot sit near we -- and then i ` ad to go i ` ad a glass o ' beer to pass the time away and while i be drink it who should come up but the cook and one of the hand from the <i> lizzie and annie </i> ` we see you ' se the cook wink ` do not we bob ' ` yes ' se bob shake he silly ` ead ` but it be not no surprise to I i have ` ad my eye on

arf-hour better than a play it be ' i stop they mouth with a glass o ' bitter each and go back to my seat while they be drink it i tell miss lamb in whisper that ' e be not there but i would ` ave another look for he by and by if she would ha ' whisper back it would ha ' be all right but she would not and arter a most unpleasant scene she walk out with she ` ead in the air foller by I with two man in button and a policeman o ' course nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait for cap'n tarbell and all the way there i be wonder wot would ` appen if she go on board and find ` im there with mr plimmer however when we get there i persuade ` er to go into the office while i go aboard to see if i could find out where he be and three minute arterwards he be stand with I behind
