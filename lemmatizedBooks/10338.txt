while poland suffer and dream of liberation while serbium be wait for redemption there be a little country the soul of which be tear to piece -- a little country that be so remote so remote that she ardent sigh can not be hear it be the country of perpetual sacrifice the country that see abraham build the altar upon which he be ready to immolate he only son the country that mose saw from a distance stretch in beauty and loveliness -- a land of promise never to be attain -- the country that give the world its symbol of soul and spirit palestine no war correspondent no red cross or relief committee have go to palestine because no actual fighting have take place there and yet hundred of thousand be suffer there that worst of agony the agony of the spirit those who have devote they life to show the world that palestine can be make again a country flow with milk and honey those who have dream of revive the spirit of the prophet and the great teacher be hang and persecute and exile they dream shatter they holy place profane they work ruin cut off from the world with no bread to sustain the starve body the heavy boot of a barbarian soldiery trample they very soul the dreamer of palestine refuse to surrender and amidst the clash of gun and sword they be battle for the spirit with the weapon of the spirit the time have not yet come to write the record of these battle nor even to attempt to render justice to the sublime hero of palestine this book be merely the story of some of the personal experience of one who have do less and suffer less than thousand of he comrade alexander aaronsohn with the turk in palestine chapter i zicron-jacob thirty-five year ago the impulse which have since be organize as the zionist movement lead my parent to leave they home in roumanium and emigrate to palestine where they join a number of other jewish pioneer in found zicron-jacob -- a little village lie just south of mount carmel in that fertile coastal region close to the ancient plain of armageddon here i be bear my childhood be pass here in the peace and harmony of this little agricultural community with its whitewashed stone house huddle close together for protection against the native arab who at first menace the life of the new colony the village be far more suggestive of switzerland than of the conventional slovenly village of the east mud-built and filthy for while it be the purpose of we people in return to the holy land to foster the jewish language and the social condition of the old testament as far as possible there be nothing retrograde in this movement no time be lose in introduce progressive method of agriculture and the climatological experiment of other country be observe and make use of in develop the ample natural resource of the land -lrb- illustration : the cemetery of zicron-jacob -rrb- eucalyptus import from australia soon give the shade of its cool healthful foliage where previously no tree have grow in the course of time dry farming -lrb- which some people consider a recent discovery but which in reality be as old as the old testament -rrb- be introduce and extend with american agricultural implement blood cattle be import and poultry-raising on a large scale be undertake with the aid of incubator -- to the disgust of the arab who look on such usurpation of the hen 's function as against nature and sinful we people replace the wretched native trail with good road border by hedge of thorny acacia which in season be cover with downy little yellow blossom that smell sweeter than honey when the sun be on they more important than all these a communistic village government be establish in which both sex enjoy equal rights include that of suffrage -- strange as this may seem to person who -lrb- when they think of the matter at all -rrb- form vague conception of all the women-folk of palestine as shut up in harem a short experience with turkish court and turkish justice teach we people that they would have to establish a legal system of they own two collaborate judge be therefore appoint -- one to interpret the mosaic law another to temper it with modern jurisprudence all jewish dispute be settle by this court its effectiveness may be judge by the fact that the arab weary of turkish venality -- as open and shameless as anywhere in the world -- begin in increase number to bring they difficulty to we tribunal jew be law-abiding people and life in those palestine colony tend to bring out the fraternal quality of we race but it be interesting to note that in over thirty year not one jewish criminal case be report from forty-five village zicron-jacob be a little town of one hundred and thirty fire -- so we call it -- when in 1910 on the advice of my elder brother who be head of the jewish experiment station at athlit a ancient town of the crusader i leave for america to enter the service of the united state in the department of agriculture a few day after reach this country i take out my first naturalization papers and proceed to washington where i become part of that great government service whose beneficent activity be too little know by american here i remain until June 1913 when i return to palestine with the object of take motion-picture and stereopticon view these i intend to use in a lecture tour for spread the zionist propaganda in the united state during the year of my residence in america i be able to appreciate and judge in they right value the beauty and inspiration of the life which my people lead in the holy land from a distance too i see better the need for organization among we community and i determine to build up a fraternal union of the young jewish man all over the country two month after my return from america a event occur which give impetus to these project the physician of we village a old man who have devote he entire life to serve and heal the people of palestine without distinction of race or religion be drive home one evening in he carriage from a neighbor settlement with he be a young girl of sixteen in a desert place they be set upon by four armed arab who beat the old man to unconsciousness as he try in vain to defend the girl from the terrible fate which await she night come on alarm by the absence of the physician we young man ride out in search of he we finally discover what have happen and then and there in the serene moonlight of that eastern night with tragedy close at hand i make my comrade take oath on the honor of they sister to organize themselves into a strong society for the defense of the life and honor of we villager and of we people at large these detail be perhaps useful for the better understanding of the disturbance that come thick and fast when in August 1914 the war-madness break out among the nation of europe the repercussion be at once feel even in we remote corner of the earth soon after the german invasion of belgium the turkish army be mobilize and all citizen of the empire between nineteen and forty-five year be call to the color as the young turk constitution of 1909 provide that all christian and jew be equally liable to military service we young man know that they too would be call upon to make the common sacrifice for the most part they be not unwilling to sustain the turkish government while the constitution impose on they the burden of militarism it have bring with it the compensation of freedom of religion and equal rights and we could not forget that for six hundred year turkey have hold she gate wide open to the jew who flee from the spanish inquisition and similar ministration of other civilized country of course we never dream that turkey would do anything but remain neutral if we have have any idea of the turn thing be ultimately to take we should have give a different greet to the _ mouchtar _ or sheriff who come to we village with the list of mobilizable man to be call on for service my own position be a curious one i have every intention of complete the process of become a american citizen which i have begin by take out first papers in the eye of the law however i be still a turkish subject with no claim to american protection this be sneeringly point out to I by the american consul at haifa who happen to be a german so there be no other course but to surrender myself to the turkish government chapter ii press into the service there be no question as to my eligibility for service i be young and strong and healthy -- and even if i have not be the physical examination of turkish recruit be a farce the enlist officer have a theory of they own that no man be really unfit for the army -- a theory which have be foster by the ingenious device of the arab to avoid conscription to these wild people the protracted discipline of military training be simply a purgatory and for week before the recruiting officer be due they dose themselves with powerful herb and physics and fast and nurse sore into be until they be in a really deplorable condition some of they go so far as to cut off a finger or two the officer however have learn to see beyond these little trick and few arab succeed in wriggle through they drag-net i have watch dozen of arab be bring in to the recruiting office on camel or horse so weak be they and welcome into the service with a severe beating -- the sick and the shammer share the same fate thus it often happen that some of the new recruit die after they first day of garrison life together with twenty of my comrade i present myself at the recruiting station at acco -lrb- the st jean d'acre of history -rrb- we have be give to understand that once we name be register we should be allow to return home to provide ourselves with money suitable clothing and food as well as to bid we family good-bye to we astonishment however we be march off to the hân or caravanserai and lock into the great courtyard with hundred of dirty arab hour after hour pass darkness come and finally we have to stretch ourselves on the ground and make the best of a bad situation it be a night of horror few of we have close a eye when at dawn a officer appear and order we out of the hân from we total number about three hundred -lrb- include four young man from we village and myself -rrb- be pick out and tell to make ready to start at once for saffêd a town in the hill of northern galilee near the sea of tiberia where we garrison be to be located no attention be pay to we request that we be allow to return to we home for a final visit that same morning we be on we way to saffêd -- a motley disgruntle crew -lrb- illustration : saffêd -rrb- it be a four day ' march -- four day of heat and dust and physical suffer the September sun smite we mercilessly as we straggle along the miserable native trail full of gully and loose stone it would not have be so bad if we have be adequately shod or clothed but soon we find ourselves envy the ragged arab as they trudge along barefoot pay no heed to the jagged flint -lrb- shoe to the arab be article for ceremonious indoor use when any serious walking be to be do he take they off sling they over he shoulder and trust to the horny sole of he foot -rrb- to add to we trouble the turkish officer with characteristic fatalism have make no commissary provision for we whatever any food we eat have to be purchase by the roadside from we own fund which be scant enough to start with the arab be in a terrible plight most of they be penniless and as the pang of hunger set in they begin pillage right and leave from the little farm by the wayside from modest beginning -- poultry and vegetable -- they progress to larger game unhindered by the officer house be enter woman insult time and again i see a stray horse grazing by the roadside seize by a crowd of grin arab who pile on the poor beast 's back until he be almost crush to earth and ride off triumphantly while they comrade hold back the weep owner the result of this sort of requisition be that we band of recruit be follow by a increase throng of farmer -- implore threatening try by hook or by crook to win back the steal goods little satisfaction do they get although some of they go with we as far as saffêd we garrison town be not a invite place nor have it a invite reputation lord kitchener himself have good reason to remember it as a young lieutenant of twenty-three in the royal engineering corps he be nearly kill there by a band of fanatical arab while survey for the palestine exploration fund kitchener have a narrow escape of it -lrb- one of he fellow officer be shoot dead close by he -rrb- but he go calmly ahead and complete he map splendid large-scale affair which have never since be equal -- and which be now in use by the turkish and german army however though saffêd combine most of the unpleasant characteristic of palestine native town we welcome the sight of it for we be use up by the march a old desert mosque be give we for barracks there on the bare stone floor in close-packed promiscuity too tired to react to filth and vermin we spend we first night as soldier of the sultan while the milky moonlight stream in through every chink and aperture and bat flit round the vault above the snore carcass of the recruit next morning we be route out at five the black depths of the well in the center of the mosque courtyard provide doubtful water for wash bathing and drinking then come breakfast -- we first government meal -- consist simply enough of boil rice which be ladle out into tin wash-basin hold ration for ten man in true eastern fashion we squat down round the basin and dig into the rice with we finger at first i be rather upset by this sort of table manners and for some time i eat with my eye fix on my own portion to avoid see the arab who fill the palm of they hand with rice pat it into a ball and cram it into they mouth just so the bolus make a great lump in they lean throat as it reluctantly descend in the course of that same morning we be allot we uniform the turkish uniform under indirect german influence have be greatly modify during the past five year it be of khaki -- a greener khaki than that of the british army and of conventional european cut spiral puttee and good boot be provide the only peculiar feature be the headgear -- a curious uncouth-looking combination of the turban and the german helmet devise by enver pasha to combine religion and practicality and call in he honor _ enverieh _ -lrb- with commendable thrift enver patent he invention and it be rumor that he have draw a comfortable fortune from its sale -rrb- a excellent uniform it be on the whole but to we disgust we find that in the great olive-drab pile to which we be lead there be not a single new one all be old discard and dirty and the mere thought of put on the clothes of some unknown arab legionary who perhaps have die of cholera at mecca or yeman make I shudder after some indecision my friend and i finally go up to one of the officer and offer to _ buy _ new uniform with the money we expect daily from we family the officer scent the chance for a little private profit give he consent the day and week follow be busy one from morning till night it be drill drill and again drill we be divide into group of fifty each of which be put in charge of a young non-commissioned officer from the military school of constantinople or damascus or of some arab who have see several year ' service these instructor have a hard time of it the german military system which have only recently be introduce be too much for they they keep mix up the old and the new method of training with the result that it be often hopeless to try and make out they order whole week be spend in grind into the arab the name of the different part of the rifle week more go to teach they to clean it -- although it must be say that once they have master these technicality they be excellent shot they efficiency would have be considerably greater if there have be more target-shooting from the very first however we feel that there be a scarcity of ammunition this shortage the drill-master in a spirit of compensation attempt to make up by abundant severity the whip of soft flexible stinging leather which seldom leave the turkish officer 's hand be never idle this be not surprising for the arab be a cunning fellow whose only respect be for brute force he exercise it himself on every possible victim and expect the same treatment from he superior so far as my comrade and i be concerned i must admit that we be generally treat kindly we know most of the drill-exercise from the gymnastic training we have practice since childhood and the officer realize that we be educate and come from respectable family the same be also true with regard to the native christian most of whom can read and write and be of a better class than the mohammedan of the country when turkey throw in she lot with the germanic power the attitude toward the jew and christian change radically but of this i shall speak later it be a hard life we lead while in training at saffêd evening would find we dead tired and little disposed for anything but rest as the tremendous light-play of the eastern sunset fade away we would gather in little group in the courtyard of we mosque -- its minaret tower black against a turquoise sky -- and talk fitfully of the little happening of the day while the arab murmur gutturally around we occasionally one of they would burst into a quaver hot-blooded tribal love-song it happen that i be fairly well know among these native through my horse kochba -- of pure maneghi-sbeli blood -- which i have purchase from some anazzus bedouin who be encamp not far from aleppo : a swift and intelligent animal he be winner of many race and in a land where a horse be considerably more valuable than a wife he ownership cast quite a glamour over I -lrb- illustration : the author on he horse kochba -rrb- in the evening then the arab would come up to chat as they speak seldom of they child of they women-folk never the conversation be limit to generality about the crop and the weather or to the recitation of never-ending tale of abou-zeid the famous hero of the beni-hilal or of antar the glorious politics of which they have amazing idea also come in for discussion napoleon bonaparte and queen victorium be still live figure to they but -lrb- significantly enough -rrb- they consider the kaiser king of all the king of this world with the exception of the sultan whom they admit to equality seldom do a evening pass without a dance as darkness fall the arab would gather in a great circle around one of they comrade who squat on the ground with a bamboo flute to a weird minor music they would begin sway and move about while some self-chosen poet among they would sing impromptu verse to the flute _ obbligato _ as a rule the theme be homely to-morrow we shall eat rice and meat the singer would wail _ yaha lili-amali _ -lrb- my endeavor be grant -rrb- come the full-throated response of all the other the chorus be tremendously effective sometimes the singer would indulge in pointed personality with answering roar of laughter these dance last for hour and as they progress the man gradually work themselves up into a frenzy i never fail to wonder at these people who without the aid of alcohol could reproduce the various stage of intoxication as i lay by and watch the moon ride serenely above these frantic man and they twist black shadow i reflect that they be just in the condition when one word from a holy man would suffice to send they off to wholesale murder and rapine it be my good fortune soon to be release from the noise and dirt of the mosque i have have experience with corruptible turkish officer and one day when barrack condition become unendurable i go to the officer command we division -- a old arab from latakieh who have be call from retirement at the time of the mobilization he live in a little tent near the mosque where i find he squat on the floor nod drowsily over he comfortable paunch as he be a officer of the old régime i enter boldly squat beside he and tell he my trouble the answer come with a enormous shrug of the shoulder you be serve the sultan hardship should be sweet i should be more fit to serve he if i get more sleep and rest he wave a fat hand about the tent look at I here i be a officer of rank and -- shoot a know look at I -- i have not even a nice blanket a crime a crime i interrupted to think of it when i a humble soldier have dozen of they at home i should be honor if you would allow I -- my voice trail off suggestively how could you get one he ask oh i have friend here in saffêd but i _ must _ be able to sleep in a nice place of course certainly what would you suggest that hotel keep by the jewish widow might do i reply more amenity be exchange the upshot of which be that my four friend and i be give permission to sleep at the inn -- a humble place but infinitely better than the mosque it be all perfectly simple -lrb- illustration : soldier ' tent in samarium -rrb- chapter iii the german propaganda so pass the day of we training swiftly monotonously until the fateful December morning when the news come like a thunderbolt that turkey be about to join hand with germany we have have report of the war -- of a kind copy of telegram from constantinople print in arabic be circulate among we give account of endless german victory these however we have laugh at as fabrication of a prussophile press agency and in we skepticism we have fail to give the teuton credit for the success they have actually win to we bear and breed in the east as we be the success of german propaganda in the turkish empire could not come as a overwhelming surprise but its fullness amaze we it may be of timely interest to say a few word here regard this propaganda as i have see it in palestine spreading under strong and efficient organization for twenty year in order to realize she imperialistic dream germany absolutely need palestine it be the key to the whole oriental situation no mere coincidence bring the kaiser to damascus in November 1898 -- the same month that kitchener in london be hail as gordon 's avenger -- when he utter he famous phrase at the tomb of saladin : tell the three hundred million moslem of the world that i be they friend we have all see photograph of the imperial figure drape in a amazing burnous of he own design -lrb- above which the prussian _ pickelhaube _ rise supreme -rrb- as he move from point to point in this portentous visit : we may also have see caran d'ache 's celebrated cartoon -lrb- a subject of diplomatic correspondence -rrb- represent this same imperial figure in its oriental toggery ride into jerusalem on a ass the nation of europe laugh at this visit and its transparent purpose but it be all part of the scheme which win for the german the concession for the konia-bagdad railway and make they owner of the double valley of the euphrate and tigri through branch line project through the firman they be practically in control of both the syrian route toward the cypriotic mediterranean and the lebanon valley they also control the three armenian route of cappadocium the black sea and the trans-caucasian branch of urfa marach and mardine -lrb- the fall of erzerum have alter condition respect this last -rrb- they dominate the persian route toward tauri and teheran as well and last but not least the gulf branch of zobeir these railway deliver into german hand the control of persium whence the road to indium may be make easy : through syrium lie the route to the suez canal and egypt which be use in February 1915 and will probably be use again this year to make this oriental dream a reality the german have not rely on they railway concession alone they government have do everything in its power to encourage german colonization in palestine scatter all over the country be german mill that half of the time have nothing to grind german hotel have be open in place seldom frequent by tourist german engineer appear in force survey sound note all these colonist hold gathering in the arab village when the ignorant native be tell of the greatness of germany of she good intention and of the evil machination of other power what i state here can be corroborate by any one who know palestine and have live in it about the time when we first know that turkey would join the germanic power come the news that the capitulation have be revoke as be generally know foreigner formerly enjoy the protection of they respective consul the turkish government under the term of the so-called capitulation or agreement have no jurisdiction over a american for instance or a frenchman who could not be arrest without the consent of he consul in the ottoman empire where law and justice be not at a premium such protection be a wholesome and necessary policy the revoke of the capitulation be a terrible blow to all the european mean as it do the practical abolition of all they rights upon the arab it act like a intoxicant every boot-black or boatman feel that he be the equal of the accursed frank who now have no consul to protect he and abuse begin immediately moreover as if by magic the whole country become germanize in all the mosque Friday prayer be end with a invocation for the welfare of the sultan and hadji wilhelm the significance of this lie in the fact that the title hadji can be properly apply only to a moslem who have make the pilgrimage to mecca and kiss the sacred stone of the kaaba instant death be the penalty pay by any christian who be find within that enclosure : yet wilhelm ii head of the lutheran faith step forward as hadji wilhelm he picture be sell everywhere german officer appear and it seem as if a wind of brutal mastery be blow the dominant figure of this movement in palestine be without doubt the german consul at haifa leutweld von hardegg he travel about the country make speech and distribute pamphlet in arabic in which it be elaborately prove that german be not christian like the french or english but that they be descendant of the prophet mohamm passage from the koran be quote prophesy the come of the kaiser as the savior of islam chapter iv road-making and discharge the news of the actual declaration of war by turkey cause a tremendous stir in we regiment the prevail feeling be one of great restlessness and discontent the arab make many bitter remark against germany why do not she help we against the italian during the war for tripolus they say now that she be in trouble she be draw we into the fight they opinion however soon undergo a change in the first place they come to realize that turkey have take up arm against russium and russium be consider first and foremost the arch-enemy german report of german success also have a powerful effect on they they begin to grow boastful arrogant and the sight of the plundering of european jew and christian convince they that a very desirable régime be set in saffêd have a large jewish colony and it be torment for I to have to witness the outrage that my people suffer in the name of requisition the final blow come one morning when all the jewish and christian soldier of we regiment be call out and tell that henceforth they be to serve in the _ taboor amlieh _ or work corps the object of this action plainly enough be to conciliate and flatter the mohammedan population and at the same time to put the jew and christian who for the most part favor the cause of the ally in a position where they would be least dangerous we be disarm we uniform be take away and we become hard-driven gangster i shall never forget the humiliation of that day when we who after all be the best-disciplined troops of the lot be first herd to we work of push wheelbarrow and handle spade by grin arab rifle on shoulder we be set to build the road between saffêd and tiberia on the sea of galilee -- a link in the military highway from damascus to the coast which would be use for the movement of troops in case the railroad should be cut off it have no immediate strategic bearing on the attack against suez however from six in the morning till seven at night we be hard at it except for one hour 's rest at noon while we have money it be possible to get some slight relief by bribe we taskmaster but this soon come to a end and we have to endure they brutality as best we could the wheelbarrow we use be the property of a french company which before the war be undertake a highway to beirut no grease be provide for the wheel so that there be a maddening squeak and squeal in addition to the difficulty of push the barrow one day i suggest to a inspection officer that if the wheel be not grease the axle would be burn out he agree with I and issue a order that the man be to provide they own oil to lubricate the wheel i shall not dwell on the physical suffering we undergo while work on this road for the reason that the condition i have describe be prevalent over the whole country and later when i have the opportunity to visit some construction camp in samarium and judaea find that in comparison we lot have be a happy one while we be break stone and trundle squeak wheelbarrow however the most disquieting rumor begin to drift in to we from we home village plunder have be go on in the name of requisition the country be full of soldiery whose capacity for mischief-making be well know to we and it be torture to think of what might be happen in we peaceful home where so few man have be leave for protection all the barbed-wire fence we hear have be tear up and send north for the construction of barricade in a wild land like palestine where the native have no respect for property where field and crop be always at the mercy of marauder the barbed-wire fence have be a tremendous factor for civilization and with these go the arab be once more free to sweep across the country unhindered stealing and destroy the situation grow more and more unbearable one day a little christian soldier -- a nazarene -- disappear from the rank we never see he again but we learn that he sister a very young girl have be forcibly take by a turkish officer of the nazareth garrison in palestine the dishonor of a girl can be redeem by blood alone the young soldier have hunt for he sister find she in the barracks and shoot she he then surrender himself to the military authority who undoubtedly put he to death he have not dare to kill the real criminal -- the officer -- for he know that this would not only bring death to he family but would call down terrible suffering on all the christian of nazareth -lrb- illustration : nazareth from the northeast -rrb- when i learn of this tragedy i determine to get out of the army and return to my village at all cost nine turkish officer out of ten can be buy and i have reason to know that the officer in command at saffêd be not that tenth man now accord to the law of the country a man have the right to purchase exemption from military service for a sum equivalent to two hundred dollar my case be different for i be already enrol but everything be possible in turkey i set to work and in less than two week i have buy half a dozen officer range from corporal to captain and have obtain consent of the higher authority to my departure provide i could get a physician 's certificate declare I unfit for service this be arrange in short order although i be healthy-looking and the doctor find some difficulty in hit on a appropriate ailment finally he decide that i have too much blood -- whatever that might mean with he certificate in hand i pay the regular price of two hundred dollar from fund which have be send I by my family and walk out of the barracks a free man my happiness be mingle with sadness at the thought of leave the comrade with whom i have suffer and hope the four boy from my village be splendid they feel that i be right in go home to do what i could for the people but when they kiss I good-bye in the eastern fashion the tear be run down they cheek and they be all strong brave fellow on my way back to zicron-jacob i pass through the town of sheff ` amr where i get a foretaste of the condition i be to find at home a turkish soldier saunter along the street help himself to fruit from the basket of a old vender and go on without offer to pay a farthing when the old man venture to protest the soldier turn like a flash and begin beat he mercilessly knock he down and batter he until he be bruise bleeding and cover with the mud of the street there be a hubbub a crowd form through which a turkish officer force he way demand explanation the soldier sketch the situation in a few word whereupon the officer turn to the old man say impressively -- if a soldier of the sultan should choose to heap filth on you head it be for you to kiss he hand in gratitude chapter v the hidden arm when i finally reach zicron-jacob i find rather a sad state of affair military law have be declare no one be suppose to be see in the street after sundown the village be full of soldier and civilian have to put up with all kind of ill-treatment moreover we people be in a state of great excitement because a order have recently come from the turkish authority bid they surrender whatever fire-arm or weapon they have in they possession a sinister command this : we know that similar measure have be take before the terrible armenian massacre and we feel that some such fate might be in preparation for we people with the arm go the head man of the village know that we last hold over the arab we last chance for defense against sudden violence would be go and they have refuse to give they up a house-to-house search have be make -- fruitlessly for we little arsenal be safely cache in a field beneath grow grain it be a tense unpleasant situation at any time the turk might decide to back up they demand by some of the violent method of which they be past master a family council be hold in my home and it be decide to send my sister a girl of twenty-three to some friend at the american syrian protestant college at beirut so that we might be able to move freely without the responsibility of have a girl at home in a country where as a matter of course the women-folk be seize and carry off before a massacre at beirut we know that there be a american consul-general who keep in continual touch with the battleship anchor in the harbor for the protection of american interest my sister get away none too soon one evening shortly after she departure when i be stand in the doorway of we house watch the ever fresh miracle of the eastern sunset a turkish officer come ride down the street with about thirty cavalryman he call I out and order I to follow he to the little village inn where he dismount and lead I to one of the inner room he spur jingle loudly as we pass along the stone corridor i never know whether i have be select for this attention because of my prominence as a leader of the jewish young man or simply because i have be stand conveniently in the doorway the officer close the door and come straight to the point by ask I where we store of arm be hide he be a big fellow with the handsome cruel feature usual enough in he class there be no open menace in he first question when i refuse to tell he he begin wheedle and offer all sort of favor if i would betray my people then all of a sudden he whip out a revolver and stick the muzzle right in my face i feel the blood leave my heart but i be able to control myself and refuse he demand the officer be not easily discourage the hour i pass in that little room with its smoky kerosene lamp be terrible one i realize however how tremendously important the question of the arm be and strength be give I to hold out until the officer give up in disgust and let I go home -lrb- illustration : house of the author 's father ephraim fishl aaronsohn in zicron-jacob -rrb- my father a old man know nothing of what have happen but the rest of my family be tremendously excited i make light of the whole affair but i feel sure that this be only the begin sure enough next morning -- the sabbath -- the same officer return and put three of the lead elder of the village together with myself under arrest after another fruitless inquisition at the hotel we be handcuff and start on foot toward the prison a day 's journey away as we little procession pass my home my father who be aged and feeble come totter forward to say good-bye to I a soldier push he roughly back he reel then fall full-length in the street before my eye it be a dismal departure we be drive through the street shackle like criminal and the woman and child come out of the house and watch we in silence -- they head bow tear run down they cheek they realize that for thirty-five year these old man my comrade have be struggle and suffer for they ideal -- a regenerated palestine now in the dusk of they life it seem as if all they hope and dream be come to ruin the oppressive tragedy of the situation settle down on I more and more heavily as the day wear on and heat and fatigue tell on my companion my feeling must have be write large on my face for one of they a fine-looking patriarch try to give I comfort by remind I that we must not rely upon strength of arm and that we spirit could never be break no matter how defenseless we be thus he a old man be encourage I instead of receive help from my youth and enthusiasm at last we arrive at the prison and be lock into separate cell that same night we be tortured with the _ falagy _ or bastinado the victim of this horrible punishment be truss up arm and leg and throw on he knee then on the bare sole of he foot a pliant green rod be bring down with all the force of a soldier 's arm the pain be exquisite blood leap out at the first cut and strong man usually faint after thirty or forty stroke strange to say the worst part of it be not the blow itself but the whistling of the rod through the air as it rush to its mark the groan of my older comrade whose gasp and prayer i could hear through the wall of the cell help I bear the agony until unconsciousness mercifully come to the rescue for several day more we be keep in the prison sick and break with suffer the second night as i lay sleepless and desperate on the strip of dirty mat that serve as bed i hear a scratch-scratching at the grate slit of a window and presently a slender stick be insert into the cell i go over and shake it some one at the other end be hold it firm and then a curious whispering sound begin to come from the end of the stick i put my ear down and catch the voice of one of the man from we village he have take a long bamboo pole pierce the joint and creep up behind a broken old wall close beneath my window by means of this primitive telephone we talk as long as we dare i assure he that we be still endure and urge he on no account to give up the arm to the turkish authority -- not even if we have to make the ultimate sacrifice finally when it be find that torture and imprisonment would not make we yield we secret the turk resort to the final test -- the ordeal which we could not withstand they announce that on a certain date a number of we young girl would be carry off and hand over to the officer to be keep until the arm be disclose we know that they be capable of carry out this threat we know exactly what it mean there be no alternative the people of we village have nothing to do but dig up the treasured arm and with broken heart hand they over to the authority and so the terrible news be bring to we one morning that we be free personally i feel much happier on the day i be put in prison than when i be release i have often wonder how we people have be able to bear the rack and thumbscrew of the spanish inquisition but when my turn and my comrade ' come for torture i realize that the same spirit that help we ancestor be work in we also now i know that we suffering have be useless whenever the turkish authority wish the horror of the armenian massacre would live again in zicron-jacob and we should be powerless to raise a hand to protect ourselves as we come limp home through the street of we village i catch sight of my own smith & wesson revolver in the hand of a mere boy of fifteen -- the son of a well-known arab outlaw i realize then that the turk have not only take we weapon but have distribute they among the native in order to complete we humiliation the blood rush to my face i start forward to take the revolver away from the boy but one of the old man catch hold of my sleeve and hold I back -lrb- illustration : in a native café saffêd \/ a lemonade-seller of damascus -rrb- chapter vi the suez campaign i have already speak of the so-called requisition that take place among we people while i be work at saffêd this of course really amount to wholesale pillage the hand of the turkish looter have fall particularly heavy on cart and draught animal as the arab know little or nothing of cart haul or the management of horse and mule the turk simply enough have requisition many of the owner -- middle-aged or elderly man -- and force they to go south to help along with the tremendous preparation that be be make for the attack on suez among these be a number of man from we village in the course of time they family begin to get the most harrowing message from they they be absolutely destitute no wages be pay they by the turk they clothes be drop off they in rag many be sick after much excited planning it be decide to send another man and myself down south on a sort of relief expedition with a substantial sum of money that have be raise with great difficulty by we people through the influence of my brother at the agricultural experiment station i get permission from the _ mouchtar _ to leave zicron-jacob and about the middle of January 1915 i set out for jerusalem to western mind the idea of the holy city serve as a base for modern military operation must be full of incongruity and as a matter of fact it _ be _ a amazing sight to see the street pack with khaki-clad soldier and hear the brooding silence of ancient wall shatter by the crash of steel-shod army boot here for the first time i see the german officer -- quantity of they strangely out of place they look with they pink-and-whiteness that no amount of hot sunshine could quite burn off they wear the regular german officer 's uniform except that the _ pickelhaube _ be replace by a khaki sun-helmet i be strike by the youthfulness of they many be nothing but boy and there be weak dissolute face in plenty -- a fact that be later explain when i hear that palestine have be the dumping-ground for young man of high family whose parent be anxious to have they as far remove as possible from the danger zone fast 's hotel be the great meeting-place in jerusalem for these young blood every evening thirty or forty would foregather there to drink and talk woman and strategy i well remember the evening when one of they -- a slender young prussian with no back to he head bracelet and monocle -- rise and announce in the decisive tone that go with a certain stage of intoxication : what we ought to do be to hand over the organization of this campaign to thoma cook & son however the german officer be by no means all incompetent they realize -lrb- i soon find out -rrb- that they have little hope of bring a big army through the egyptian desert and make a successful campaign there they object be to immobilize a great force of british troops around the canal to keep the mohammedan population in palestine impressed with turkish power and to stir up religious unrest among the native in egypt it must be admit that in the first two of these purpose they have be successful the turk be less far-sighted they believe firmly that they be go to sweep the english off the face of the earth and enter cairo in triumph and preparation for the march on suez go on with feverish enthusiasm the idea of the common soldier on this subject be amusing some of they declare that the canal be to be fill up by the sandbag which have be prepare in great quantity other hold that thousand of camel would be keep without water for many day precede the attack then the thirsty animal when release would rush into the canal in such number that the troops could march to victory over the packed mass of drowned body the army operating against suez number about one hundred and fifty thousand man of these about twenty thousand be anatolian turk -- trained soldier splendid fight material as be show by they resistance at the dardanelle the rest be palestinian arab and very inferior troops they be the arab as a soldier be at once stupid and cunning : fierce when victory be on he side but unreliable when thing go against he in command of the expedition be the famous djemal pasha a young turk general of tremendous energy but possess small ability to see beyond detail to the big broad concept of strategy although a great friend of enver pasha he look with disfavor on the german officer and in particular on bach pasha the german governor of jerusalem with whom he have serious disagreement this dislike of the german be reflect among the lesser turkish officer many of these after long year of service find themselves subordinate to young foreigner who in addition to arbitrary promotion receive much higher salary than the turk what be more they be pay in clinking gold whereas the turk when pay at all get paper currency beersheba a prosperous town of the ancient province of idumea be the southern base of operation for the advance on suez some of we villager have be send to this district and in search for they i have the opportunity of see at least the taking-off place of the expedition beyond this point no jew or christian be allow to pass with the exception of the physician all of whom be non-mohammedan who have be force into the army beersheba be swarm with troops they fill the town and overflow on to the sand outside where a great tent-city grow up and everywhere that the turkish soldier go disorganization and inefficiency follow they from all over the country the finest camel have be requisition and send down to beersheba until at the time i be there thousand and thousand of they be collect in the neighborhood through the laziness and stupidity of the turkish commissariat officer which no amount of german efficiency could counteract no adequate provision be make for feed they and incredible number succumb to starvation and neglect they great carcass dot the sand in all direction it be only the wonderful antiseptic power of the eastern sun that hold pestilence in check the soldier themselves suffer much hardship the crowding in the tent be unspeakable the water-supply be almost as inadequate as the medical service which consist chiefly of volunteer red crescent society -- among they a unit of twenty german nurse send by the american college at beirut medical supplies such as they be have be take from the different mission hospital and pharmacy of palestine -- these requisition be make by officer who know nothing of medical requirement and simply scoop together everything in sight as a result one of the army physician tell I that in beersheba he have open some medical chest consign to he and find to he horror that they be full of microscope and gynecological instrument -- for the care of wounded soldier in the desert visit of british aeroplane to beersheba be common occurrence long before the machine itself could be see its whanging resonant hum would come float out of the blaze sky seemingly from everywhere at once soldier rush from they tent squint up into the heaven until the speck be discover swim slowly through the air then follow wholesale firing at a impossible range until the officer forbid it true to the policy of avoid all unnecessary harm to the native these british aviator never drop bomb on the town but -- what be more dangerous from the turkish point of view -- they would unload package of pamphlet print in arabic inform the native that they be be deceive that the ally be they only true friend that the german be merely make use of they to further they own scheme etc these cleverly word little tract come shower down out of the sky and at first they be eagerly pick up the turkish commander however soon announce that any one find carry they would pay the death penalty after that when the little bundle drop near they the native would run as if from high explosive bomb all thing consider it be wonderful that the turkish demonstration against the canal come as near to fulfillment as it do twenty thousand soldier actually cross the desert in six day on scant ration and with they they take two big gun which they drag by hand when the mule drop from thirst and exhaustion they also carry pontoon to be use in cross the canal gun and pontoon be now at rest in the museum at cairo just what take place in the attack be know to very few the english have not see fit to make public the detail and there be little to be get from the demoralize soldier who return to beersheba piece by piece however i gather that the attack party have come up to the canal at dawn finding everything quiet they set about get across and have even launch a pontoon when the british who be lie in wait open a terrific fire from the farther bank back by armored locomotive and aeroplane it be as if the gate of jehannum be open and its fire turn loose upon we one soldier tell I the turk succeed in get they gun into action for a very short while one of the man-of-war in the canal be hit several house in ismaïlia suffer damage but the invader be soon drive away in confusion leave perhaps two thousand prisoner in the hand of the english if the latter have choose to do so they could have annihilate the turkish force then and there the ticklish state of mind of the mohammedan population in egypt however have lead they to adopt a policy of leniency and of keep to the defensive which subsequent development have more than justified it be characteristic of england 's faculty for hold she colony that battery man by egyptian do the finest work in defense of the canal the reaction in palestine after the defeat at suez be tremendous just before the attack djemal pasha have send out a telegram announce the overwhelming defeat of the british vanguard which have cause wild enthusiasm another later telegram proclaim that the canal have be reach british men-of-war sink the englishman route -- with a loss to the turk of five man and two camel which be afterwards recover but add the telegram a terrible sand-storm have arise the glorious army take it as the wish of allah not to continue the attack and have therefore withdraw in triumph these report hoodwink the ignorant native for a little while but when the stream of haggard soldier wound and exhaust begin pour back from the south they guess what have happen and a fierce revulsion against the germano-turkish régime set in a few week before the advance on suez i be in jaffa where the enthusiasm and excitement have be at fever-pitch parade and celebration of all kind in anticipation of the triumphal march into egypt be take place and one day a camel a dog and a bull decorate respectively with the flag of russium france and england be drive through the street the poor animal be horribly maltreat by the native who rain blow and flung filth upon they by way of give concrete expression to they contempt for the ally mr glazebrook the american consul at jerusalem happen to be with I in jaffa that day and never shall i forget the expression of pain and disgust on he face as he watch this melancholy little procession of scapegoat hurry along the street now however all be change the arab who take defeat badly turn against the authority who have get they into such trouble rumor circulate that djemal pasha have be buy by the english and that the defeat at suez have be plan by he and person keep a ear close to the ground begin to hear muttering of a general massacre of german in fact thing come within a ace of a bloody outbreak i know some german in jaffa and haifa who firmly believe that it be all over with they in the defeat army itself the turkish officer give vent to they hatred of the german three german officer be shoot by they turkish comrade during the retreat and a fourth committed suicide however djemal pasha succeed in keep order by means of stern repressive method and by the fear rouse by he large body-guard of faithful anatolian -lrb- illustration : railroad station scene between haifa and damascus\/camels bring in newly cut tree damascus -rrb- we feel sure that the turkish defeat would put a damper on the arrogance of the soldiery but even the mohammedan population be hope that the ally would push they victory and land troops in syrium and palestine for though they hate the infidel they love the turk not at all and the country be exhaust and the blockade of the mediterranean by the ally prevent the import and export of article the orange be rot on the tree because the annual liverpool market be close to palestine and other crop be in similar case the country be short too of petroleum sugar rice and other supplies and even of match we have to go back to old custom and use flint and steel for fire and we seldom use we lamp money be scarce too and turkey have declare a moratorium cash be often unobtainable even by those who have money in the bank and much distress ensue as the defeat army be pour in from the south i decide to leave beersheba and go home the road and the field be cover with dead camel and horse and mule hundred of soldier be straggle in disorder many of they on leave but many desert soon after the defeat at the canal several thousand soldier desert but a amnesty be declare and they return to they regiment when i arrive at jerusalem i find the city fill with soldier djemal pasha have just return from the desert and he quarter be guard by a battery of two field gun nobody know what to expect some thought that the country would have a little more freedom now that the soldiery have lose its braggadocio while other expect the lawlessness that attend disorganization i go to see consul glazebrook he be a true american a southerner formerly a professor of theology at princeton he be most earnest and devoted in behalf of the american citizen that come under he care render at jerusalem the same sort of service that ambassador morgenthau have render at constantinople he be practically the only man who stand up for the poor defenseless people of the city he receive I kindly and i tell he what i know of condition in the country what i have hear among the arab and of my own fear and apprehension he be visibly impressed and he advise I to see captain decker of the uss tennessee who be then in jaffa promise to write himself to the captain of my propose visit i go to jaffa the same day and after two day ' delay succeed in see captain decker with the further help of mr glazebrook who take I with he the police interfere and try to keep I from go aboard the ship but after long discussion i be permit to take my place in the launch that the captain have send for the consul captain decker be interested in what i have to say and at he request i dictate my story to he stenographer what become of my report i do not know -- whether it be transmit to the department of state or whether captain decker communicate with ambassador morgenthau -- but at all event we soon begin to see certain reform inaugurate in part of the country and these reform could have be effect only through pressure from constantinople the presence of the two american cruiser in the mediterranean water have without any doubt be instrumental in the saving of many life chapter vii fight the locust while i be travel in the south another menace to we people 's welfare have appear : the locust from the soudan they come in tremendous host -- black cloud of they that obscure the sun it seem as if nature have join in the conspiracy against we these locust be of the species know as the pilgrim or wander locust for forty year they have not come to palestine but now they visitation be like that of which the prophet joel speak in the old testament they come full-grown ripe for breed the ground be cover with the female digging in the soil and deposit they egg-packet and we know that when they hatch we should be overwhelm for there be not a foot of ground in which these egg be not to be find the menace be so great that even the military authority be oblige to take notice of it they realize that if it be allow to fulfill itself there would be famine in the land and the army would suffer with the rest djemal pasha summon my brother -lrb- the president of the agricultural experiment station at athlit -rrb- and intrust he with the organization of a campaign against the insect it be a hard enough task the arab be lazy and fatalistic besides they can not understand why man should attempt to fight the _ djesh allah _ -lrb- god 's army -rrb- as they call the locust in addition my brother be seriously handicap by lack of petroleum galvanized iron and other article which could not be obtain because of the ally ' blockade in spite of these drawback however he attempt to work up a scientific campaign djemal pasha put some thousand of arab soldier at he disposition and these be set to work digging trench into which the hatch locust be drive and destroy this be the only means of cope with the situation : once the locust get they wing nothing can be do with they it be a hopeless fight nothing short of the coöperation of every farmer in the country could have win the day and while the people of the progressive jewish village struggle on to the end -- man woman and child work in the field until they be exhaust -- the arab farmer sit by with fold hand the threat of the military authority only stir they to half-hearted effort finally after two month of toil the campaign be give up and the locust break in wave over the countryside destroy everything as the prophet joel say the field be waste the land mourneth for the corn be waste : the new wine be dry up the oil languisheth the land be as the garden of eden before they and behind they a desolate wilderness not only be every green leaf devour but the very bark be peel from the tree which stand out white and lifeless like skeleton the field be strip to the ground and the old man of we village who have give they life to cultivate these garden and vineyard come out of the synagogue where they have be pray and wail and look on the ruin with dim eye nothing be spare the insect in they fierce hunger try to engulf everything in they way i have see arab baby leave by they mother in the shade of some tree whose face have be devour by the oncoming swarm of locust before they scream have be hear i have see the carcass of animal hide from sight by the undulating rustling blanket of insect and in the face of such a menace the arab remain inert with they customary fatalism they accept the locust plague as a necessary evil they could not understand why we be so frantic to fight it and as a matter of fact they really get a good deal out of the locust for they love to feast upon the female insect they gather pile of they and throw they upon burn charcoal then squat around the fire devour the roasted insect with great gusto i see a fourteen-year-old boy eat as many as a hundred at a sit chapter viii the lebanon during the locust invasion my brother send I on a inspection tour to investigate the ravages of the insect in syrium with a official _ boyouroulton _ -lrb- passport -rrb- in my pocket i be able to travel all over the country without be interfere with by the military authority i have a excellent opportunity to see what be go on everywhere the locust have destroy everything from as far south as the egyptian desert to the lebanon mountain on the north but the locust be not the only nor the worst plague that the people have to complain of the plunder under the name of military requisition the despotic rule of the army officer and the general insecurity be even more desolating as i proceed on my journey northward i hope to find consolation and brighter prospects in the independent province of the lebanon few american know just what the lebanon be from the repeat allusion in the bible most people imagine it to be nothing but a mountain the truth be that a beautiful province of about four thousand square mile bear that name the population of the lebanon consist of a christian sect call maronite and the drus the latter a people with a secret religion the esoteric teaching of which be know only to the initiate and never divulge to outsider both these people be sturdy handsome folk through the machination of the turk whose policy be always to divide and rule the maronite be continually fight against the drus in 1860 turkish troops join with the drus and fall upon the maronite with wholesale massacre that spread as far south as damascus where ten thousand christian be kill in two day -lrb- illustration : the christian town of zahleh in the lebanon -rrb- the european power be move at last fifty warship be send to beirut and ten thousand french troops be land in the lebanon to create order under the pressure of the european power the sublime porte be force to grant a autonomy for the province of the lebanon the french english german russian austrian and a year later the italian government be sign the guaranty of this autonomy since then the lebanon have have peace the governor of the province must always be a christian but the general council of the lebanon include representative of all the different race and religion of the population a wonderful development begin with the liberation from turkish oppression macadamize road be build all over the province agriculture be improve and there be complete safety for life and property there be a proverb now in palestine and syrium which say in the lebanon a virgin may travel alone at midnight and be safe and a purse of gold drop in the road at midday will never be steal and the proverb tell the literal truth when one cross the boundary from turkish palestine into the lebanon province what a change meet he eye -- peaceful and prosperous village school fill with child immense plantation of mulberry tree and olive the slope of the mountain terrace with beautiful vineyard a handsome and sturdy population police on every road to help the stranger and young girl and woman with happy laugh and chatter working in the field with a population of about six hundred thousand this province export annually two million dollar ' worth of raw silk silkworm-raising be a specialty of the lebanon when autonomy be grant the lebanon french influence become predominant among the maronite and other christian of the province french be speak by almost all of they and love for france be a deep-rooted sentiment of the people on the other hand the drus feel the english influence for the last sixty year england have be the friend of the drus and they have not forget it it may be worth while to tell in a few word the story of one man who accomplish wonder in spread the influence of he country sir richard wood be bear in london a son of catholic parent from he early boyhood he aspire to enter the diplomatic service the east attract he strongly and in order to learn arabic he go with another young englishman to live in the lebanon in beirut they seek the hospitality of the maronite patriarch for a few day they be treat with lavish hospitality and then the patriarch summon they before he and tell they that they must leave the city within twenty-four hour the reason for they disgrace they discover later not suspect that they be be put to the test they have eat meat on a Friday and this make the patriarch think that they be not true catholic but be there as spy leave beirut in haste wood and he friend seek shelter with the drus who receive they with open arm for two year wood live among the drus in the village of obey there he learn arabic and become thoroughly acquaint with the country and with the way of the drus and there he conceive the idea of win the drus for england to counteract the influence of the french maronite he go back to london where he succeed in impress he view upon the foreign office and he return to syria charge with a secret mission before long he persuade the druse chieftain to address a petition to england ask for british protection british protection be grant and for over thirty year richard wood virtually single-handed shape the destiny of syrium it be he who break the power of ibrahim pasha the son of mehemet alus it be he who guide admiral stopford in the bombardment of beirut it be he again who bring about the landing of english troops in syrium in 1841 we find he afterwards in damascus as british consul and wherever he go he be always busy spread english power and prestige he understand the east thoroughly and feel that england must be strong in syrium if she wish to retain she imperial power it be very unfortunate that the policy of sir richard wood be not carry out by he nation it be with high hope and expectation that i approach the lebanon i be look forward to the moment when i should find myself among people who be free from the turkish yoke in a country where i should be able to breathe freely for a few hour but how great be my consternation when on enter the lebanon i find on all the road turkish soldier who stop I every minute to ask for my papers even then i could not realize that the worst have happen of course rumor of the turkish occupation of the lebanon have reach we a few week before but we have not believe it as we know that germany and austrium be among those who guarantee the autonomy of the lebanon it be true however the scrap of paper that guarantee the freedom of the lebanon have prove of no more value to the lebanese than have that other scrap of paper to belgium as i enter the beautiful village of ed-damur one of the most prosperous and enchanting place on earth i see entire regiment of turkish troops encamp in and about the village while i be water my horse i try to ask question from a few inhabitant my fair hair and complexion and my khaki costume make they take I for a german and they barely answer I but when i address they in french they face light up for the lebanon for all it be thousand of mile away from france be nevertheless like a french province for fifty year the french language and french culture have take hold of the lebanon no frenchman have more love for and faith in france than lie in the heart of the lebanese christian they have never forget that when massacre be threaten to wipe out all the christian of the lebanon ten thousand french soldier sweep over the mountain to spread peace life and french gayety and when the poor people hear the language they love and when they find out that i too be the son of a oppressed and ruin community all the sadness and bitterness of they heart be tell I -- how the turkish soldier have spread over the beloved mountain of lebanon how the strong stalwart young lebanese have be take away from the mountain and force into the turkish army how the girl and woman be hide in they home afraid to be see by the soldier and they officer how the chieftain be imprison and even hang and how violence and pillage have spread over the peaceful country -lrb- footnote : since the above be write the american press have chronicle many atrocity commit in the lebanon the execution of leader and the complete blockade of the mountain by the turkish authority result in the starve of eighty thousand lebanese the french government have warn turkey through the american ambassador that the turk will be hold accountable for they deed -rrb- i could not help wonder at the mistake of the ally if they have understand the situation in palestine and syrium how differently this war might have eventuate the lebanon and syrium would have raise a hundred thousand pick man if the ally have land in palestine the lebanon would have fight for its independence as heroically as do the belgian even the arab population would have welcome the ally as liberator but alas with a saddened heart i pursued my journey into beirut my come be a joyful surprise to my sister many sad thing have happen since she have last see I during my imprisonment she have suffer torture not know what would happen to I and now that she see I alive she cry from happiness she tell I how kindly she have be treat by president bliss of the syrian protestant college and of all the good thing the college have do what a blessing the college be for the people of beirut many unfortunate people be save from prison and hardship through the intervention of president bliss he never tire of render service wonderful personal service but alas even he influence and power begin to wane the american prestige in the country be break and the turkish government no longer respect the american flag a order issue from constantinople demand that the official language of the college be turkish instead of english and turkish officer even dare to enter the college premise to search for citizen belong to the belligerent nation without trouble to ask permission from the american consul -lrb- illustration : haifa -rrb- chapter ix a robber baron of palestine beirut be a city of about two hundred thousand inhabitant half of whom be christian and the rest mohammedan and jew the pinch of hunger be already feel there bread be to be have only on ticket issue by the government and price in general be extremely high the population be discontented and turbulent and every day thousand of woman come before the governor 's residence to cry and protest against the scarcity of bread the ally ' warship often pass near the town but the people be not afraid of they for it be know that the ally have no intention of bombard the city only once have a bombardment take place toward the end of march 1915 a french warship approach the bay of haifa and land a officer with a letter to the commandant of that town give notice of he intention to bombard the german consulate at 3 pm sharp this be in retaliation for the propaganda carry on by the consul leutweld von hardegg and chiefly because of he desecration of the grave of bonaparte 's soldier the consul have time to pack up he archive and valuable and he leave he house before three the bombardment begin exactly at three fifteen shell be fire with a wonderful precision not one house in the neighborhood of the consulate be touch but the consulate itself be a heap of ruin after a few shell have strike it the population be exceedingly calm only the german colony be panic-stricken and on every german house a american flag be raise it be rather humorous to see all the german who be active in the turkish army in one capacity or another seek safety by means of this trick this bombardment have a sobering effect upon the mohammedan population they see that the ally be not wholly ignorant of what be go on in the country and that they could retaliate and safety for the non-mohammedan increase accordingly in general beirut be a rather quiet and safe place the presence of a american cruiser in the port have much to do with that the american sailor be allow to come ashore three time a week and they spend they money lavishly it be estimate that beirut be get more than five thousand dollar a week out of they but the native be especially impress by the manliness and quick action of the american boy frequently a few sailor be involve in a street fight with score of arab and they always hold they own in a short time the american become fear which in the orient be equivalent to say they be respect the beirut people be famous for they fight spirit but this spirit be not manifest after a few week of intimate acquaintance with the american blue-jacket my inspection of the devastation cause by the locust complete i return home the news that greet I there be alarming i must narrate with some detail the event which finally decide I to leave the country about one hour 's ride on horseback from we village live a family of turkish noble the head of which be sadik pasha brother of the famous kiamil pasha several time grand vizier of the empire sadik who have be exile from constantinople come to palestine and buy great tract of land near my people after he death he son -- good-for-nothing wild fellow -- be force to sell most of the estate -- all except one fewzus bey who retain he part of the land and live on it here he collect a band of friend as worthless as himself and gradually commence a career of plunder and frightfulness much like that of the robber baron of mediaeval germany before the outbreak of the war he confine he attention chiefly to the arab whom he treat shamefully he raid cattle and crop and carry off girl and woman in broad daylight on one occasion he stop a wedding procession and carry off the young bride then he seize the bridegroom against whom he bear a grudge and subject the poor bedouin to the bastinado until he consent to divorce he wife by pronounce the word i divorce thee three time in the presence of witness accord to mohammedan custom this bedouin be the grandson of the sheikh hilou a holy man of the region upon whose grave the arab be accustom to make they prayer but we villager of zicron-jacob have never submit to fewzi bey in any way we young man be organize and arm and after a few encounter he let we alone after the mobilization however and the take away of

attentively while for a whole hour i pour out the story of fewzus bey 's outrage i put my whole heart into the plea and wind up by ask if it be to the credit of the progressive young turk to shelter feudal abuse of a bygone age djemal seem to be impressed he spring from he chair begin walk up and down the room then with a great dramatic gesture he exclaim justice shall be render and assure I that a commission of army officer would be send at once to start a investigation i return to zicron-jacob with high hope sure enough a few day later fewzi bey be summon to jerusalem at the same time the commission which have dwindle to one single officer on secret mission put in a appearance and begin to make inquiry among the native he get little satisfaction at first for they live in mortal terror of the outlaw they grow bolder however when they learn he purpose complaint and testimony come pour in and in four day the officer have the name of hundred of witness establish no less than fifty-two

outlaw now we have to submit to he as a officer he come ride into we village daily order everybody about and pick I out for distinguish spitefulness my position soon become unbearable i be of course know as the organizer of the young man 's union which for so long have put up a spirited resistance to fewzi i be still look upon as a leader of the younger spirit and i know that sooner or later fewzus would try to make good he threat often repeat that he would shoot I like a dog it be hardly likely that a open attempt on my life would be make when ambassador morgenthau visit palestine he have stay in we village and give my family the evidence of he sincere friendship these thing count in the east and i soon get the reputation of have influential friend however there be other way of dispose of I one evening about sunset while i be ride through a valley near we village my horse shy violently in pass a clump of bush i give he the spur and turn and ride toward the bush just in time to see a horseman dash out wildly with a rifle across he saddle i keep the incident to myself but i be more cautious and keep my eye open wherever i go one afternoon a fortnight later as i be ride to hedera another jewish village two hour ' ride away a shot be fire from behind a sand-dune the bullet burn a hole in the lapel of my coat that night i have a long talk with my brother there be no doubt whatever in he mind that i should try to leave the country while i on the contrary could not bear to think of desert my people at the crisis of they fortune it be a beautiful night such a night i think as only palestine can show a white serene moon-bathed night the roar of the mediterranean come out of the stillness as if to remind we that help and salvation could come only from the sea the sea upon which score of the warship of the ally be sail back and forth we have argue into the small hour before i yield to he persuasion -lrb- illustration : the bazaar of jaffa on a market day -rrb- chapter x a rash adventure it be all very well to decide to leave the country to get safely away be a different matter there be two way out one of these -- the land route by constantinople -- could not be consider the other way be to board one of the american cruiser which by order of ambassador morgenthau be empower to assist citizen of neutral country to leave the ottoman empire these cruiser have already do wonderful rescue work for the russian jew in palestine who when war be declare be to have be send to the mesopotamian town of urfa -- there to suffer massacre and outrage like the armenian this be prevent by mr morgenthau 's strenuous representation with the result that these russian jew be gather together as in a great drag-net and herd to jaffa amidst suffer unspeakable there they be meet by the american cruiser which be to transport they to egypt up to the very moment when they set foot on the friendly warship they be rob and horribly abuse by the jaffa boatmen the eternal curse of the wander jew drive from russium they come to seek shelter in turkey turkey then cast they from she under pretext that they be loyal to russia truly the jew lift he eye to the mountain ask the ancient and still unanswered question whence shall come my help the turkish government later repent of its leniency in allow these russian jew to escape and give order that only neutral should leave the country -- and then only under certain condition i be not a neutral my first papers of american citizenship be valueless to further my escape i have hear however that the united state cruiser tennessee be to call at jaffa and i determine to get aboard she by hook or by crook one evening as soon as darkness have fall i bade a sorrowful farewell to my people and set off for jaffa travel only by night and take out-of-the-way path to avoid the picket for now that the locust campaign be over my _ boyouroulton _ be useless at dawn two day later i slip into jaffa by way of the sand-dune and go to the house of a friend whom i could trust to help I in every possible way and beg he to find I a passport for a neutral he set off in search and i wait all day at he house consume with impatience and anxiety at last toward evening my friend return but the news he bring be not cheer he have find a passport indeed but he report of the rigor of the inspection at the wharf be such as to make it clear that the chance of my get through on a false passport be exceedingly slim since i be well know in jaffa if i be catch in such a undertaking it might mean death for I and punishment for the friend who have help I evidently this plan be not feasible all that night i rack my brain for a solution finally i decide to stake everything on what appear to be my only chance the tennessee be due on the next day but one early in the morning i give my friend the name of a boatman who be under obligation to I and have swear to be my friend for life or death even under the circumstance i hesitate to trust a mohammedan but it seem the only thing to do i have no choice leave my friend bring the boatman and i put my plan before he appeal to he daring and he sense of honor i want he to take I at midnight in he fishing-boat from a isolate part of the coast and wait for the appearance of the tennessee then on she arrival amid the scramble of boat full of refugee i be to jump aboard while he would return with the other boat the poor fellow try to remonstrate point out the danger and what he call -- rightly enough doubtless -- the folly of the plan i stick to it however make it clear that he part would be well pay for and at last he consent and we arrange a meeting-place behind the sand-dune by the shore i put a few personal belongings into a little suit-case and have my friend give it to one of the refugee who be to sail on the tennessee if i succeed i be to recover it when we reach egypt the only thing i take with I be the paper which declare my intention of become a american citizen the first paper from this document i be determine not to part i shall not tell how i keep it on I as the means i use may still be use by other in conceal such papers and a disclosure of the secret might bring disaster to they suffice it to say that i have the paper with I and that no search would have bring it to light arrive next morning at the appoint place i give the signal agree upon the whine of a jackal and after repeat it again and again i hear a very low and muffle answer my boatman be there i have some fear that he might have betray I and that i should presently see a soldier or policeman leap out of the little boat but my fear prove groundless the man be faithful -lrb- illustration : stormy sea break over rock off jaffa -rrb- we row out quietly we boat a little nutshell on the toss wave but i be relieve the element do not frighten I on the contrary i feel secure and refresh in the midst of the sea when morning begin to dawn score of little boat come out of the harbor and circle about wait for the cruiser this be we chance i crouch in the bottom of we boat and to all appearance my boatman be engage merely in fishing after i have lie there over a hour with my heart beat like a drum and with small hope for the success of my undertaking i hear at last the whistle of the approach cruiser follow by a babel of mad shouting and cursing among the boatman in the confusion i feel it safe to sit up no one pay the slightest attention to I all be engage in a wild race to reach and mount the tennessee 's ladder i scramble up with the rest and when on the deck a officer demand my passport i put on a bold front and ask he to tell captain decker that mr aaronsohn wish to see he ten minute later i stand in the captain 's cabin there i unfold my story and wind up by ask he if under the circumstance my first papers might not entitle I to protection as i speak i could see the struggle that be go on within he when he answer it be to explain with the utmost kindness that if he take I aboard he ship it would be to forfeit he word of honor to the turkish government he pledge to take only citizen of neutral country that he could not consider I a american on the strength of my first papers and that any such evasion might lead to serious complication for he and for he government well there be nothing for I to do but to withdraw and go back to jaffa to face trial for a attempt to escape when i reach the deck again i find it swarm with refugee many of whom know I and come up to congratulate I on get away i could only shake my head and with death in my heart descend the tennessee 's ladder it do not matter now what boat i take any boatman be eager enough to take I for a few cent as i sit in the boat every stroke of the oar bring I nearer to the shore and to what i feel be inevitable captivity a great bitterness swell my heart i be tired utterly tired of all the danger and trial i have be go through for the last month from depression i sink into despair and out of despair come strange to say a great serenity the serenity of despair on the quay i run into hassan bey commandant of the police who be superintend the embarkation of refugee i know he and he know I half a hour later i be in police headquarters under examination by hassan bey i be desperate and answer he recklessly a seasick man be indifferent to shipwreck this be the substance of we conversation : -- how do you get aboard the ship in a boat with some refugee a woman hide I with she skirt so you be try to escape be you if i have be i should not have come back then what do you do on the cruiser i go to talk to the captain who be a friend of mine my life be in danger fewzus bey be after I and i want _ my friend in america _ to know how justice be do in palestine who be you friend in america man who could break you in a minute do you know to whom you be speak yes hassan bey i be sick of persecution i wish you would hang I with you own hand as you hang the young christian my friend would have you life for mine i wonder now how i dare to speak to he in this manner but the bluff carry hassan bey look at I curiously for a moment -- then smile and offer I a cigarette assure I that he believe I a loyal citizen and declare he feel deeply hurt that i have not come to he for permission to visit the cruiser we part with a profusion of eastern compliment and that evening i start back to zicron-jacob -lrb- illustration : the author 's sister on she horse tayar -rrb- chapter xi escape the failure of my attempt to leave the country

alexandrium with refugee aboard beirut be a four day ' trip from we village and road be unsafe it be out of the question to permit my sister to come home alone and it be impossible for any of we to get leave to go after she nor do we want to have she at home in the unsettled condition of the country i begin wonder if i could not possibly get to beirut and get my sister aboard the chester which offer perhaps the last opportunity to go out with the refugee it would be a difficult undertaking but it might be we only chance and i quickly make up my mind to carry it out if it be a possible thing i have to act immediately no time be to be lose for no one could tell how soon the chester might sail my last adventure have be enter upon with foreboding but now i feel that i should succeed to we oriental intuition speak in very audible tone and we be train from childhood to listen to its voice it be with a feeling of confidence in the outcome therefore that i bade this second good-bye to my family and dearest friend solemn hour they be these hour of farewell hour that need few word then once more i slip out into the night to make my secret way to beirut it be about midnight when i leave home dress in a soldier 's uniform and drive a donkey before I i travel only by night and spend each day in hide in some cave or narrow valley where i could sleep with some measure of security for food i have bring bread dry fig and chocolate and water be always to be find in little spring and pool in these clear warm night i use to think of david a fugitive and pursue by he enemy how well i could now understand he despairing cry : how long wilt thou forget I o lord for ever how long shall mine enemy be exalt over I five night i journey and at last one morning beautiful beirut appear in the distance and i find myself in the forest of pine that lead into the city the fresh dawn be fill with the balmy breath of the pine and all the odor of the lebanon drive my donkey before I i boldly approach the first picket-house and salute the non-commissioned officer in military fashion he stop I and ask whence i come and where i be go i smile sweetly and reply that i be the orderly of a german officer who be survey the country a few hour to the south and that i be go to beirut for provision then i light a cigarette and sit down for a chat after discuss politics and the war for a few minute i jump up exclaim that if i do not hurry i should be late and so take my departure it be all so simple and it bring I safely to beirut my donkey have serve the purpose for which i have bring he be speedily abandon and i hurry to a friend 's house where i exchange my uniform for the garb of a civilian my sister be the most surprised person on earth when she see I walk into she room and when i tell she that i want she to go with I on the chester she think I crazy for she know that hundred of person be try in vain to find means of leave the country and it seem to she impossible that we who be turkish subject could succeed in outwit the authority even when i have explain my plan and she be willing to admit the possibility of success she still feel doubt as to whether it would be right for she to leave the country while she friend be leave behind in danger i assure she however that we family would feel relieved to know that we be in safety and could come back fresh and strong after the war to help in rebuild the country have gain she consent i still have the difficult problem of way and mean before I the chester have order to take citizen of neutral country only passport have to be examine by the turkish authority and by the american consul-general who give the final permission to board the cruiser how be i to pass this double scrutiny after long and arduous search with the assistance of several good friend i at last discover a man who be willing to sell I the passport of a young couple belong to a neutral nation i can not go into particulars about this arrangement of course suffice it to say that my sister be to travel as my wife and that we both have to disguise ourselves so as to answer the description on the passport when i go to the american consulate-general to get the permit i find the building crowd with people of all nation -- spanish and greek and dutch and swiss -- all wait for the precious little papers that should take they aboard the american cruiser that haven of liberty and safety the chester be to take all these people to alexandrium and those who have the means be to be charge fifty cent a day for they food from behind my dark goggles i recognize many a person in disguise like myself and seek escape we never betray recognition for fear of the spy who infested the place after secure my permit i run downstairs and straight to my consul whose dragoman i take along with I to the _ seraya _ or government building of course the dragoman be well tip and he help I considerably in hasten the examination i have to undergo at the hand of the turkish official all go well and i hurry back to my sister triumphant the chester be to sail in two day but while we be wait the alarming news come that the american consul have be advise that the british government refuse to permit the landing of the refugee in egypt and that the departure of the chester be indefinitely postpone with a sinking at my heart i rush up to the american consulate for detail and there learn that the uss des moines be to sail in a few hour for rhode with italian and greek refugee and that i could go on she if i wish in a few minute i have my permit change for the trip on the des moines and i hurry home to my sister we hastily get together the few belongings we be to take with we jump into a carriage and drive to the harbor we have still another

now we passport be examine again and several question be ask my sister be brave and self-possessed cool and unconcerned in manner and at last the final signature be affix and we jump into the little boat that be to take we out to the ship at this moment a man approach a dry-goods dealer of whom my sister have make some purchase a few month before he seem to recognize she and he ask she in german if she be not miss aaronsohn i feel my blood leave my face and look he straight in the eye i whisper if you say one word more you will be a dead man so help I god he must have feel that i mean exactly what i say for he walk off mumble unintelligibly at last the boat get away and five minute later we be mount the side of the des moines throng of refugee cover the deck of the cruiser they face show tension and anxiety they presence there seem too good to be true and all await the moment when the ship should heave anchor a filipino sailor show we about and as he speak italian i tell he i want to be hide somewhere till the ship get under way i feel that even yet we be not entirely safe that my fear be justified i discover shortly when from we hiding-place i see the shopkeeper approach in a small boat with a turkish officer they look over all the refugee on the deck but search for we in vain after a half-hour more of uncomfortable tension the engine begin to sputter the propeller revolve and -- we be safe -lrb- illustration : beirut from the deck of a outgoing steamer -rrb- the day be die and a beautiful twilight soften the outline of the lebanon and the house of beirut the mediterranean lay quiet and peaceful around we and the healthy sturdy american sailor give a feeling of confidence as the cruiser draw out of the harbor a great cry of farewell arise from the refugee
