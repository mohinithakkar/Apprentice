war have haunt the dream of pacificist and militarist alike many of we without deny its grow menace hope against hope that it might be avert by the gradual strengthening of international goodwill and mutual intercourse and the steady growth of democratic influence and political thought but we misgiving prove more prophetic than we hope and last August the great war come upon we like a thief in the night after four month of war we feel that in spite of the splendid response of the nation at large in spite of a unanimity which have no parallel in we previous history there be still large section of the community who fail to realize the vastness of the issue at stake the formidable nature of the force range against we and the true inner significance of the struggle and yet all that be worth live for depend upon the outcome of this war -- for ourselves the future of the democratic ideal in these island and in the british empire at large for the people of europe deliverance from compete armament and the yoke of racial tyranny but before we future can be secure sacrifice will be require of every citizen and in a free community sacrifice can only spring from knowledge moreover if we be to put a end to the intolerable situation of a unwilling europe in arm public opinion must think out very carefully the great problem which have be throw into the melting-pot and be prepare for the day of settlement the present volume have be write as a guide to the study of the underlie cause and issue of the war it do not pretend to cover the whole of so vast a field and it will have attain its aim if it provide the basis for future discussion it originate in the experience of its five writer at the summer school for working-class student hold in connection with the worker ' educational association in the early day of August at the outbreak of the war summer school be in full swing at oxford cambridge eton bangor and durham and it at once become apparent not merely that the word citizen have suddenly acquire a new depth and significance for the man and woman of we generation but also that for the individual citizen himself a large new field of study and discussion have be open up on subject and issue hitherto unfamiliar this book be plan to meet the need there express but it be hope that it may be find useful by a wider circle of reader we have call the book _ the war and democracy _ because we guide idea throughout have be the sense of the great new responsibility both of thought and action which the present situation lay upon british democracy and on believer in democracy throughout the world in devote one chapter to a survey of the issue raise for settlement by the war we must disclaim most emphatically all idea of divide the lion 's skin before the animal have be kill we object have not be to prophesy but merely to stimulate thought and discussion the field be so vast and complicated that unless public opinion begin to mobilise without further delay and to form clear idea as to how the principle lay down by we statesman be to be convert into practice it may find itself confront as it be confront in 1814 with a situation which it can neither understand nor control and with a settlement which will perpetuate many of the abuse which this war ought to remove we best excuse be supply by the attitude of many leader of german political thought

waste and futility the amount of war and war possibility and war danger in the world be just the measure of the present inadequacy of the world 's system of collective organization to the purpose before they it follow from this very directly that only one thing can end war on the earth and that be a subtle mental development a idea the development of the idea of the world commonweal in the collective mind -- hg well in 1908 this be a testing time for democracy the people of great britain and the dominion to whom all the world look as the trustee together with france and america of the great democratic tradition be bring face to face for the first time with they full ultimate responsibility as british citizen upon the way in which that responsibility be realize and discharge depend the future of the democratic principle not only in these island but throughout the world democracy be not a mere form of government it do not depend on ballot box or franchise law or any constitutional machinery these be but its trappings democracy be a spirit and a atmosphere and its essence be trust in the moral instinct of the people a tyrant be not a democrat for he believe in government by force neither be a demagogue a democrat for he believe in government by flattery a democratic country be a country where the government have confidence in the people and the people in the government and in itself and where all be unite in the faith that the cause of they country be not a mere matter of individual or national self-interest but be in harmony with the great moral force which rule the destiny of mankind no form of government be so feeble as a democracy without faith but a democracy arm with faith be not merely strong : it be invincible for its cause will live on in defeat and disaster in the breast of every one of its citizen belgium be a living testimony to that great truth british democracy have carry this principle of confidence to the furthest possible point alone among the state of europe great britain rely for she existence and for the maintenance of she world-wide responsibility upon the free choice of she citizen she privilege be extend to all : she active obligation be force upon none trusting in the principle of individual freedom and upon the sound instinct and understanding of she people she leave it to each citizen to make he choice whether and in what manner he shall serve he country never have responsibility so arduous and so urgent be lay upon the citizen of any community : and never have the citizen be so free to choose or to decline the burden the world will judge great britain and judge democracy accord to the measure of we free response what be the nature of the responsibility cast upon we at this crisis it be threefold it concern the present the past and the future there be three question which every citizen must need ask and try to answer for himself the first and most urgent be a matter of present decision : what be my duty here and now the second involve a judgment of past event : why be it that we be at war be we fight in a just cause the third involve a estimate of the future and of the part which british public opinion can and should play in shape it : what be the issue involve in the various belligerent country what should be the principle of a just settlement how can great britain best use she influence in the cause of human progress and for the welfare of the people involve in the war it be with the second and especially with the third of these responsibility that this volume be concern what be the war about be we fight in a just cause every one by now have ask himself this question and most people have study some at least of the evidence and try to satisfy themselves as to the answer the foreign office white paper and numberless book and pamphlet have enlighten the public on many of the question at issue yet the fact remain that the necessity of this educative campaign involve a confession of failure -- or at least of grave neglect -- on the part of british democracy under we democratic constitution the people of great britain have assume the responsibility for the management of they own affair one great department of those affair the most vital of all they and they representative have systematically neglect deeply engage and interest in domestic problem they have leave the control of they foreign relation in the hand of expert adviser and so it be with something like stupefaction that they discover one day in August that they be call upon to honor the obligation contract in they name there have be no desire to evade those obligation but there have be a very real desire to understand they and also a fix determination never again to allow such a lack of contact on vital issue between the mind of the people and the activity of they minister but no mere change in the machinery of democratic control can avail to save the people from the consequence of they own ignorance and neglect there be only one way in which we can achieve full democracy in this country and that be through education in the sphere of domestic affair particularly in connection with social and industrial question the people have slowly realize this hard truth after a generation or more of attempt and failure and disillusionment many thousand of workpeople have learn the lesson that power without knowledge be not power at all and that knowledge whether for public affair or for any other purpose can not be gain without effort and discipline they have come to realize that democracy need for its full work not only school in which to train its young but also -- what no democracy save those of the ancient world have ever possess -- such facility for the education for its adult citizen engage in the active work of the community as will enable they to maintain unimpaired they intellectual freshness and vigor and to face with wisdom and courage the problem for which as citizen they have assume responsibility they have come to think of education not as a time of tutelage or training but as a part of active life itself weave of the same texture and concern with the same issue as be in fact the effort to understand the world in which they live but they have naturally tend to confine those issue within the limit of they own domestic interest and experience they be call upon now to widen they horizon and to apply the democratic conception of education to the new problem which have arise owe to the part which great britain be now play in the affair of europe it be never easy to think thing out clearly and coldly but it be hardest of all in the crisis of a great war when man 's mind be blur by passionate emotion of sorrow anxiety and indignation hence a time of war be the heyday of fallacy and delusion of misleading hope and premature disillusionment : man tend to live in a unreal world of phrase and catchword yet never be it more necessary than at such a period in the old greek phrase to follow the argument whithersoe'er it lead to look fact squarely in the face and particularly the great ugly outstanding fact of war itself the survival of which democrat especially in great britain and the united state have of recent year be so greatly tempt to ignore people speak as if war be a new sudden and terrible phenomenon there be nothing new about the fact of war what be new about this war be the scale on which it be wage the science and skill expend on it and the fact that it be be carry on by national army numbering million instead of by professional body of soldier but war itself be as old as the world : and if it surprise and shock we this be due to we own blindness there be only two way of settle dispute between nation by law or by war as there be as yet no world-state with the power to enforce a world-law between the nation the possibility of war with all its contingent horror should have be before we eye all the time the _ occasion _ of this war be no doubt a surprise but that it could happen at all should not be a surprise to we still less a disillusionment it do not mark a backward step in human civilisation it only register the fact that civilisation be still grievously incomplete and unconsolidated terrible as this war be in its effect on individual life and happiness it ought not to depress we -- even if in we blindness we imagine the world to be a far better organise place than it actually be the fact that many of the combatant regard war as a anachronism add to the tragedy but also to the hope of the struggle it show that civilised opinion be gather strength for that deepen and extension of the meaning and range of citizenship which alone can make war between the nation of the world as obsolete as it have become between the nation of the british empire or between the component part of the united state it be perhaps inevitable that british citizen in particular remove from the storm centre of continental europe and never very logical in they thinking should have fail to realize the possibility of another great war similar to the napoleonic struggle of a hundred year ago for nearly half a century the great european state have be at peace : and we have come to look upon they condition and the attachment of they people as be as ancient and as stable as we own we have grow use to the map of europe as it have be leave by the great convulsion between 1848 and 1871 upon the basis of that map and of the government represent on it and in response to the grow need of the world as a whole we have embark on every kind of international co-operation and cosmopolitan effort the hague congress convene by the tsar of russium look forward to the day when war and the cause of war should be obsolete the socialist movement a grow force in all industrial community stand for the same ideal and for the international comradeship of the work class law and medicine science and scholarship follow suit and every summer in quest of health and change thousand of plain citizen have cross international frontier with scarcely greater sense of change than in move from province to province in a single state commerce and industry the greatest material force of we time have become inextricably international and in the palpable injury in which a war would involve they some thinker of clear but limited vision see the best hope of avert a european conflagration and yet throughout these two generation of economic and social development the fear of war have never be absent from the mind of europe she emperor and statesman have talk of peace but they have prepare for war more skilfully and more persistently than ever before in the history of europe or of the world almost the entire manhood of every european nation but england have be train to arm and the annual war budget of europe rise in time of peace to over 300 million pound the state of europe each afraid to stand alone against a coalition of possible rival form themselves into oppose group and each of the group arm feverishly against the other fearful lest by any change in the diplomatic or political situation they might be catch unaware and suffer loss thus it ought not to have surprise we that finally through the accident of a royal murder the spark should be fire and the explosion ensue and that merchant and manufacturer propagandist and philanthropist scholar and scientist should find the ground shake beneath they foot and the project patiently build up through year of international co-operation shatter by the event of a few day now that the war have come it be easy to see that they be mistake they have build up the structure of a cosmopolitan society without look to the foundation the economic activity of mankind have indeed bring a world-society and a world-industry into be but its political analog a world-state can only be form not through the co-operation of individual or group of individual but through the union of nation and the federation of national government the first task of we time for europe as we shall try to show in the next chapter be to lay firm the foundation of those nation by carry to victory the twin principle of nationality and democracy -- to secure that the people of europe shall be enable to have government correspond to they national need and responsible to they own control and to build up under the care and protection of those government the social institution and the civilisation of they choice so long as there be people in europe under alien government curtail in the use of they own language -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the propagation of they literature and idea in they social intercourse in they corporate life in all that we in great britain understand by civil liberty so long will there be man who will mock at the very idea of international peace and look forward to war not as a outworn instrument of a barbarous age but as a means to national freedom and self-expression englishman sometimes forget that there be worse evil than open war both in political and industrial relation and that the political cause for which they father fight and die have still to be carry to victory on the continent nationality and they national institution be the very life-blood of english people they be as natural to they as the air they breathe that be what make it sometimes so difficult for they to understand as the history of ireland and even of ulster show what nationality mean to other people and that be why they have not realize not only that there be people in europe living under alien government but that there be government in europe so foolish as to think that man and woman deprive of they national institution humiliate in they deepest feeling and force into a alien mould can make good citizen trustworthy soldier or even obedient subject -lrb- footnote 1 : the german official _ communiqué _ on August 26 1914 report as follow : all the newspaper in belgium with the exception of those in antwerp be print in the german language this of course be on the model of the prussian administration of poland the magyar be more repressive even than the german see the bibliography give in _ general book _ below -rrb- the political cause of the present war then and of the half century of armed peace which precede it be to be find not in the particular scheme and ambition of any of the government of europe nor in they secret diplomacy nor in the machination of the great armament interest ally to they sinister though all these may have be but in the nature of some of those government themselves and in they relation to the people over whom they rule if it be possible write prince büllow who direct german policy as imperial chancellor from 1900 to 1909 for member of different nationality with different language and custom and a intellectual life of a different kind to live side by side in one and the same state without succumb to the temptation of each try to force he own nationality on the other thing on earth would look a good deal more peaceful but it be a law of life and development in history that where two national civilisation meet they fight for ascendancy in the struggle between nationality one nation be the hammer and the other the anvil one be the victor and the other the vanquish -lrb- 1 -rrb- no word could indicate more clearly the cause that be at stake in the present war they show we that there be still government in europe so ignorant as to believe that the different nationality of mankind be necessarily hostile to one another and so foolish and brutal as to think that national civilisation or as the german professor call it culture can and indeed must be propagate by the sword it be this extraordinary conception which be at the back of protest like that of professor haeckel and professor eucken -lrb- man whom in the field of they own study all europe be proud to honor -rrb- against england fighting with a half-asiatic power against germanism -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ by prince bernhard von bülow english translation 1st ed pp 245-6 -lrb- london 1914 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : protest of professor ernst haeckel and rudolf eucken of jena quote in _ the time _ from the _ vossische zeitung _ of August 20 1914 -rrb- there be not only half-asiatic there be real asiatic side by side with england and england be not ashamed of it for she do not reckon the culture of europe as higher than the culture of asia or regard herself as the hammer upon the anvil of indium prince bülow 's word and the theory of policy underlie they really go to the root of the whole trouble in european politics they explain the balance of power the competition in armament the belief in the inevitability and the moral value of war and all those common european shibboleth which seem so inexplicable to citizen of the more modern-minded state and community of the world why should germany and austria arm against france and russium when canada do not arm against the united state why should a balance of power be necessary to the maintenance of european peace when we do not consider the preponderance of a single power such as the united state in north central and south america or great britain in the pacific or southern asia dangerous to the peace of the whole world why finally to press prince bülow 's logic home if member of different nationality can not live side by side without play the game of hammer and anvil together be not the english spending the whole of they energy fight the welsh the scotch and the irish in the unite kingdom the dutch in south africa and the french in canada not to speak of the jew in every part of the british empire the fact be that the statesman of germany and austria-hungary and of russium also have miss the chief lesson of recent history and politics : that in the grow complexity of world-relation power be fall more and more of necessity into the hand of state which be not nation but commonwealth of nation state compose like the british empire and the united state of a variety of nationality and culture live peacefully each with its own institution under a single law and a single central government but the time be not ripe yet for a commonwealth of europe the people of europe have yet to win they liberty before they can be free to dream of a united state of europe so long as the emperor and statesman of central europe believe like the mahomedan of old that propaganda can be impose by the sword they can only be meet by the sword and control by the sword not till they have be conquer and render harmless or displaced by the better mind of the people whom they have indoctrinate can europe proceed along the natural course of she development so far we have be concern -- as we shall be concern throughout this book -- with the _ political _ cause underlie the war but it would not be right to ignore the fact that there be other deeper cause unconnected with the action of government for which we in this country be jointly responsible with the rest of the civilised world this war be not simply a conflict between government and nation for the attainment of certain political end freedom and nationality on the one side and conquest and tyranny on the other it be also a great outburst of pent-up feeling break like lava through the thin crust of european civilisation on the _ political _ side as we have say just now the war reveal the fact that civilisation be still incomplete and ill-organised but on the _ moral _ side it reveal the fact that modern society have break down that the force and passion that divide and embitter mankind have prove stronger at the moment of strain than those which bind they together in fellowship and co-operation what we be suffer from say one of the greatest of live democrat -lrb- 1 -rrb- be something far more widespread than the german empire be it not the case that what we be in face of be nothing less than the breakdown in a certain idea and hope of civilisation which be associate with the liberal and industrial movement of the last century there be to be a inevitable and glorious progress of humanity of which science commerce and education be to be the main instrument and which be to be crown with a universal peace older prophet like thoma carlyle express they contempt for the shallowness of this prevail ideal and during this century we have be become more and more doubtful of its value but we be now witness its downfall science commerce and education have do and can do much for we but they can not expel the human spirit from human nature what be that at bottom love of self self-interest selfishness individual and corporate as a theory the philosophy of selfishness have often be expose but to a extent that be difficult to exaggerate it have be the motive acknowledge and rely upon without shame or apology in commerce in politics and in practical life we civilisation have be base on selfishness we commerce on competition and the unrestricted love of wealth we education on the motive of self-advancement and science and knowledge make the instrument of selfishness and competition have arm man against man class against class and nation against nation with tenfold the power of destruction which belong to a less educate and highly organised age -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the war and the church _ by charle gore -lrb- oxford mowbray 1914 -rrb- -rrb- the civilised world have be shock during the past month at the spectacle of the open adoption by a great power of this philosophy of selfishness man have not realize that the method and principle underlie so much of we commercial and industrial life could be transfer so completely to the field of politics or so ruthlessly press home by military force but it be well for we to remember that it be not prussia even in the modern world who invent the theory of blood and iron or the philosophy of force the iron law of wages be a generation older than bismarck : and business be business can be no less odious a watchword than war be war treitschke and nietzsche may have furnish prussian ambition with congenial ammunition but bentham with he purely selfish interpretation of human nature and marx with he doctrine of the class-struggle -- the high priest of individualism and the high priest of socialism -- can not be acquit of a similar charge if the appeal have be make in a less crude and brutal form and if the instrument of domination have be commercial and industrial rather than military it be because militarism be not the beset sin of the english-speaking people let we beware therefore at this moment of anything savor of self-righteousness some of we say bishop gore see the chief security against this disease which have infect we civilisation in the progress of democracy -- the government of the people really by the people and for the people i be one of those who believe this and desire to serve towards the realize of this end but the answer do not satisfy I i do not know what evil we might find arise from a world of materialistic democracy but i be sure we shall not banish the evil spirit which destroy human life and nation and civilisation by any mere change in the method of government nothing can save civilisation except a new spirit in the nation the task before europe then be a double one -- a task of development and construction in the region of politics and of purification and conversion in the region of the spirit for the finer spirit of europe say the great french writer romain rolland who be none the less a patriot because he be also a lover of germany there be two dwelling-place : we earthly fatherland and that other the city of god of the one we be the guest of the other the builder to the one let we give we life and we faithful heart but neither family friend nor fatherland nor aught that we love have power over the spirit which be the light it be we duty to rise above tempest and thrust aside the cloud which threaten to obscure it to build higher and stronger dominate the injustice and hatred of nation the wall of that city wherein the soul of the whole world may assemble -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : article in the _ journal de genève _ translate in the _ cambridge magazine _ and reprint in _ public opinion _ nov 27 1914 those who hold that christianity and war be incompatible would seem to be commit to a monastic and passively anarchist view of life inconsistent with membership in a political society but whatever the relation between christianity and war there can be no question of the relation between christianity and _ hatred _ hatred -lrb- which be not the same thing as moral indignation -rrb- be a poison which corrode and embitter and so degrade and thereby weaken the national spirit it be a pity that some of we most prominent newspaper-proprietor do not understand this -rrb- internationalism as a political theory have break down : for it be base on a false conception of the nature of government and of the obligation of citizenship the true internationalism -- a spirit of mutual understanding and fellowship between man and nation to replace the suspicion the competition and the watchful selfishness of the past generation -- be the moral task that lie before europe and america to-day if great britain be to lead the way in promote a new spirit between the nation she need a new spirit also in the whole range of she corporate life for what britain stand for in the world be in the long run what britain be and when thousand be die for she it be more than ever the duty of all of we to try to make she worthier of they devotion chapter ii the national idea in europe 1789-1914 europe what of the night -- ask of heaven and the sea and my babe on the bosom of I nation of mine but ungrown there be one who shall surely requite all that endure or that err : she can answer alone : ask not of I but of she liberty what of the night -- i feel not the red rain fall hear not the tempest at all nor thunder in heaven any more all the distance be white with the soundless foot of the sun night with the woe that it wear night be over and do ac swinburne _ a watch in the night _ sixty-two year ago reaction reign supreme in europe after the great national and social uprising of 1848 and england look on passively while the hope of freedom be crush in bohemia hungary and italy mazzinus the noblest of italian patriot the most prophetic soul among nineteenth-century nationalist select this moment of profound despair to publish a essay entitle _ europe its condition and prospects _ which burn with the passion of a inextinguishable faith pierce the veil of the future and foreshadow in a almost miraculous fashion the situation which face europe and england to-day nothing print in this country since the war break out express more clearly the real issue of the mighty conflict and the part we country be call to play in it than the follow word in reference to the unredeemed people of europe utter by the great italian more than half a century ago : they struggle they still struggle for country and liberty for a word inscribe upon a banner proclaim to the world that they also live think love and labor for the benefit of all they speak the same language they bear about they the impress of consanguinity they kneel beside the same tomb they glory in the same tradition and they demand to associate freely without obstacle without foreign domination in order to elaborate and express they idea to contribute they stone also to the great pyramid of history it be something moral which they be seek and this moral something be in fact even politically speak the most important question in the present state of thing it be the organization of the european task in principle nationality ought to be to humanity that which division of labor be in a workshop -- the recognize symbol of association the assertion of the individuality of a human group call by its geographical position its tradition and its language to fulfill a special function in the european work of civilisation the map of europe have to be re-made this be the key to the present movement herein lie its initiative before act the instrument for action must be organise before build the ground must be one 's own the social idea can not be realize under any form whatsoever before this reorganisation of europe be effect before the people be free to interrogate themselves to express they vocation and to assure its accomplishment by a alliance capable of substitute itself for the absolute league which now reign supreme if england persist in maintain a neutral passive selfish part she will have to expiate it a european transformation be inevitable when it shall take place when the struggle shall burst forth at twenty place at once when the old combat between fact and right be decide the people will remember that england stand by a inert immovable sceptical witness of they suffering and effort the nation must rouse herself and shake off the torpor of she government she must learn that we have arrive at one of those supreme moment in which one world be destroy and another be to be create in which for the sake of other and for she own it be necessary to adopt a new policy england to-day have adopt this new policy she have respond to mazzini 's appeal by step into the arena and declare herself ready to take part in the organization of the european task she son be die on the continent in defense of the principle of nationality in support of the rights of other nation to that liberty which she insular position have secure for herself for many century the liberty to associate freely without obstacle without foreign domination in order to elaborate and express they idea she be fight moreover not only on behalf of the threaten freedom of belgium france and serbium on behalf of the unborn freedom of poland alsace-lorraine and the subject race of the austro-hungarian and ottoman empire but also on she own behalf it be not merely that she recognize that she empire be in danger she recognize also that she be unable to work out she own salvation unable to carry on she industrial development and she scheme for the betterment of she people in security while the continent at she door remain in constant peril of change the social idea can not be realize under any form whatsoever before this reorganisation of europe be effect § 1 _ nation and nationality _ -- the social idea and the national idea have be for a century past the twin pivot of european development the political structure of the continent have oscillate this way and that accord as these idea have in turn assume ascendancy over man 's mind and when as in 1848 both claim attention at the same time the whole edifice be shake to its very foundation in england on the other hand it be the social idea alone which have be a motive force in the nineteenth century although she have always have to reckon with the national idea across the st george 's channel owe to she fortunate geographical situation she acquire national unity many century ago and have always be able to defend it successfully against the danger of external aggression the national idea therefore have long cease to be a aspiration and consequently a revolutionary force among we it have be realize in actual fact we have grow as accustomed to it and as unconscious of it as of the air we breathe thus englishmen as they attitude towards ireland have show find it difficult to understand exactly what the principle of nationality mean to those who have never possess national freedom or be in constant danger of lose it this be perhaps especially true of the english work class who grow to the full stature of political consciousness some fifty year after the last serious threat to we national existence be make by napoleon and upon whom the burden of the social idea press with peculiar weight and yet unless the significance of the principle of nationality and the part which it have play in the history of modern europe be realize it be impossible to enter fully into the true meaning of the present tremendous conflict what then be nationality the question be more difficult to answer than appear at first sight a nationality be not quite the same thing as a nation for example there be a german nation rule by the kaiser wilhelm ii but this do not include twelve million people of german nationality who be the subject of the emperor of austrium or again there be the swiss nation which be make up of no less than three distinct nationality still less be the term state and nationality synonymous for if they be then the native of indium might claim to be of the same nationality as ourselves or _ vice versa _ the united state would be regard as part of the british empire because a large proportion of they inhabitant happen to be of british descent the word race bring we somewhat nearer to the point but even this will not satisfy we when we remember that the slavonic race for example consist of a large number of nationality such as the russian the pole the czech the serb the montenegrin etc or that the english -lrb- as distinguish from the other three nation of the unite kingdom -rrb- belong to the same teutonic race as the german nevertheless a belief whether well ground or not in a common racial origin be one of the root principle of the idea of nationality what be a nation the great magyar nationalist kossuth ask a serb representative at the hungarian diet of 1848 the reply be : a race which possess its own language custom and culture and enough self-consciousness to preserve they a nation must also have its own government object kossuth we do not go so far explain he interlocutor one nation can live under several different government and again several nation can form a single state -lrb- 1 -rrb- both the magyar and the serb wear right though the latter be speak of nationality and the former of nation the conversation be in fact instructive in more way than one it would be difficult to find a better definition of _ nationality _ than that give by the serb speaker a common language a common culture and common custom : these be the outward and visible sign which make a people conscious of its common race which make it in other word a nationality -lrb- footnote 1 : rw seton-watson _ the southern slav question _ p 46 -rrb- the element of consciousness be all-important there be for example member of the finnish race scatter all over northern russium but they evince no consciousness of any kind that they be ally to the nationality which inhabit the country of finland again it be only within recent year that the serb and the croat in the south-west corner of the austro-hungarian empire have begin to realize that the only thing which divide they one from the other be a difference of religion and a difference of alphabet and now that the realisation of this fact have spread from the study to the market-place we see the formation of a new nationality that of the serbo-croat the research of historian and other learn man have do a immense deal to stimulate the development of nationality during the past century but they be unable of themselves to create they the fact of kinship be not enough community of language custom and culture be not even enough to be a real nationality a people must be conscious of all these thing and not merely conscious but sufficiently conscious to preserve they and if need be to die for they now the interesting thing for we about a nationality be that it be always strive to become a _ nation _ a nation as we have see may be compose of several nationality but such case be rare and be due to peculiar geographical condition as for example in switzerland and great britain or to external pressure as in belgium which have as it be weld together the different racial element into a single whole in general therefore a nation be simply a nationality which have acquire self-government it be nationality _ plus _ state ireland a nation the warcry of the irish nationalist party be a claim not a statement of fact ireland will become a nation when its desire for self-government be satisfy the case be instructive because it show that it be not necessary for a nationality to become a _ sovereign _ state in order to be in the full sense of the word a nation it be perfectly possible as we serb remark for several nation to form a single sovereign state but as a general rule all such nation will be allow to manage they own internal affair the self-governing dominion of the british empire and the magyar of hungary be nation though they be subordinate to they respective imperial government in question of peace and war treaty obligation etc the real test of national existence be ultimately a sentimental one do the nationality inhabit a give country regard the government under which it live as a true expression of its peculiar genius and will do the state of which it form a part exist by its consent or have it be impose upon it by some alien authority or nationality be it a territorial unity or have it be split up into section by artificial frontier all these question must be answer before we can say of any nationality that it be also a nation the national idea therefore which have be one of the chief factor in modern history be essentially a idea of development its root be the conception of nationality that be of a people consciously unite by race language and culture and from this spring the larger conception of nationhood that be of a nationality possess its own political institution govern by its own consent and co-extensive with its natural boundary as we shall see later political development do not always stop at the nation-state further growth however be extra-national in character it may either take the parasitical form of one nation impose its will and its culture upon other nation or it may assume the proportion of that highest type of polity yet know to mankind a commonwealth of nation freely associate together within the confines of a single sovereign state -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see chapter ix for further treatment of this -rrb- § 2 _ the birth of nationalism : poland and the french revolution _ -- with these general principle in mind let we now consider the national idea at work in the nineteenth century nation in the sense just define have of course long exist in europe england scotland and switzerland be nation whose life-history date right back to the middle age joan of are be a nationalist and france have be a nation since the end of the hundred year ' war in 1453 spain become a nation a few year later by the expulsion of the moor and the union of castille and aragon under ferdinand and isabellum holland again acquire she national freedom in she great struggle against spain in the sixteenth century but it be not until the end of the eighteenth century that nationalism become a real force in europe a idea for which man die and in whose name monarchy be overthrow in the old european system write lord acton the rights of nationality be neither recognize by government nor assert by the people the interest of the reign family not those of the nation regulate the frontier and the administration be conduct generally without any reference to popular desire where all liberty be suppress the claim of national independence be necessarily ignore and a princess in the word of fénelon carry a monarchy in she wedding portion -lrb- 1 -rrb- the state be in short regard as a purely territorial affair it be the property the _ land _ property of the monarch who in he capacity of owner control the destiny of the people who happen to live upon that territory conquest or marriage might unite in the hand of a single monarch the most diverse people and country the notorious case of the kind be that of the emperor charle v who in the sixteenth century manage to hold sway over germany spain the netherland naple and a large part of the new world -lrb- footnote 1 : _ history of freedom _ p 273 -rrb- the golden age of the dynastic principle be however the eighteenth century and the long and tedious war of that period be nearly all occasion by the aggrandisement of some royal house the idea of a nation as a living organism as something more than a collection of people dwelling in the same country speak the same language and obey the same ruler have not yet dawn upon the world apart from england scotland switzerland and holland no european nation have really become conscious of its personality as distinct from that of its hereditary monarch and as we have see until nationality become keenly self-conscious the national idea remain unborn only some great internal cataclysm or a overwhelming disaster inflict by a foreign power could evoke this consciousness in a nation and fate ordain that the two method should be try simultaneously at opposite end of europe france standing on the top of golden hour and poland crushed dismembered downtrodden -- it would be difficult to say which of these contribute the more to the great national awakening in europe poland be the first and greatest martyr of the nationalist faith by its constitution which be that of a oligarchical republic with a elective king poland be place beyond the pale of a europe rule upon dynastic principle its very existence be a insult to the accept ideal of legitimacy and hereditary monarchy and it be impossible for any particular house to acquire it in the honest way of marriage this be particularly annoying to its immediate neighbor prussium russium and austrium all of whom have grow into great power while poland tear by internal dissension sink lower and lower in the political scale it be significant that the earliest suggestion of partition come from frederick the great of prussium who be oblige to take russium and austrium into he counsel as he know that they would never allow he to annex the whole country himself indeed from first to last the story of the polish partition be a good example of prussian _ realpolitik _ at length after much hesitation on the part of russium and austria the power agree among themselves in 1772 to what be know as the first partition whereby the three monarch enrich they respective territory by peel as it be the unfortunate republic on all its frontier perhaps the most remarkable fact about the whole disgraceful concern be that it do not appear in the least disgraceful either morally or politically to the public opinion of the age meanwhile poland by a heroic effort convert herself in self-defence into a hereditary constitutional monarchy on the model of england prussium play the part of juda pretend to welcome these reform at first and lend the pole its encouragement but when russium take up arm on behalf of the polish reactionary party and the country turn to prussia to aid it in defend the constitution the treacherous frederick william not only decline to do so but begin to send he troops to occupy polish territory the upshot be the further dismemberment of poland know as the second partition -lrb- 1793 -rrb- no sophistry in the world write mr nisbet bain can extenuate the villainy of the second partition the theft of territory be its least offensive feature it be the forcible suppression of a national movement of reform the hurl back into the abyss of anarchy and corruption of a people who by incredible effort and sacrifice have struggle back to liberty and order which make this great political crime so wholly infamous yet here again the method of the russian empress be less vile than those of the prussian king catherine openly take the risk of a bandit who attack a enemy against whom he have a grudge frederick william ii come up when the fight be over to help pillage a victim whom he have swear to defend -lrb- 1 -rrb- after this the end come rapidly the heroic patriot kosciuszko head a popular rise against russium but after a remarkable resistance to the combined force of the three partition power the insurrection be finally suppress in torrent of blood the crown bandit nearly quarrel between themselves over the booty but eventually in 1795 austrium russium and prussium sign a treaty which leave nothing of poland on the map at all -lrb- footnote 1 : _ slavonic europe _ p 404 -rrb- the effect upon the subsequent history of the world of this crime against humanity carry out by the three most absolute dynasty in europe be incalculable the annihilation of the polish nationality have probably do more to endanger the monarchy of europe than any one political act accomplish since the monarchy of europe be first found to trace its effect in all they various ramification would lead we a long way it be sufficient here to notice that the destruction of poland like the destruction of jerusalem produce a dispersion and that as the jew of the dispersion have discharge a peculiar office in the economy of the world as usurer and financier so too have the pole of the dispersion as agent and vector of revolution in all the republican movement of the continent the pole have take a lead part they be to be find in the saxon riot of '48 in the berlin barricade in the struggle for the republic in baden in the italian and hungarian war of liberation in the chartist movement and in the french commune homeless and fearless school in war and make reckless by calamity they have be the nerve of revolution wherever they have be scatter by the wind of misfortune -lrb- 1 -rrb- and what mr fisher in this passage put in a concrete fashion lord acton have express with equal emphasis if more abstractly this famous measure he write of the final partition the most revolutionary act of the old absolutism awaken the theory of nationality in europe convert a dormant right into a aspiration and a sentiment into a political claim ` no wise or honest man ' write edmund burke ` can approve of that partition or can contemplate it without prognosticate great mischief from it to all country at some future date ' thenceforward there be a nation demand to be unite in a state -- a soul as it be wander in search of a body in which to begin life over again and for the first time a cry be hear that the arrangement of state be unjust -- that they limit be unnatural and that a whole people be deprive of its right to constitute a independent community before that claim could be efficiently assert against the overwhelming power of its opponent -- before it gain energy after the last partition to overcome the influence of long habit of submission and of the contempt which previous disorder have bring upon poland -- the ancient european system be in ruin and a new world be rise in its place -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the republican tradition in europe _ pp 212-213 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ history of freedom _ p 276 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : _ present state boundary _ -- the partition of poland -rrb- the last sentence remind we that while in the east the dynastic principle be display with cynical indifference its true character to the world event be occur in the west which threaten to shake its very foundation if poland be the first martyr of the national idea revolutionary france be its first evangelist for the new gospel which france preach be the gospel of liberty and nationalism be a extension a variant of this gospel in france itself at the time of the revolution the doctrine of liberty be interpret in its individual and constitutional sense which involve the abolition of class privilege and of political institution that conflict with or do not adequately express what rousseau call the general will there be no national question to be settle in france and she could therefore devote herself exclusively to the development of the social idea the establishment of democratic government the foundation of a republic and in general the determination of what should be the relation between the individual and the state a question which in course of time lead on to the problem of socialism but indirectly the french revolution do a enormous deal to promote the national idea in europe in the first place the execution of loui xvi and the proclamation of the republic administer a blow to the theory of legitimacy upon which the dynastic principle rest from which it never recover if the french nation could rise and abolish its native dynasty be there not hope that some day the italian hungarian and polish nation might also rise and throw off the still more objectionable yoke of they foreign ruler in the second place the revolution in and for itself produce a tremendous effect upon the rest of europe and in every country man awake from the long sleep of feudalism to the desire of sweeping away antiquated constitution and rebuild they upon a democratic basis it be however sufficient to glance at a map of europe at the end of the eighteenth century to see why these dream could not be at once realize of what real value be ideal of democratic reform to the people dwelling in italy germany or the austrian empire look for example at germany split up like a jig-saw puzzle into over three hundred different state each with its petty prince or grand-duke she poet and philosopher might sing of liberty and dream utopian dream and here and there a experiment in popular government might be try by some princeling who have catch the liberal fashion but she political fabric together with the rivalry between prussium and austrium keep she disunited and strangle all real hope of reform in short the first and most cry need of europe be not the abolition of antiquated constitution but the redrawing of anomalous frontier the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people proclaim in france presuppose the doctrine of the solidarity of the people proclaim by the dismembered nation of europe france could set its house in order but belgium germany italy bohemia hungary etc have as yet no house of they own the house have to be build before it could be furnish on the latest democratic line and before it could be even build the ground have to be wrest from the hand of absentee landlord or clear of the little dynastic state-shanty which cumber it the polish nationalist become the backbone of the republican movement in europe the french republican proclaim the independence of nation as one of they cardinal principle thus the social idea and the national idea be originally intimately connect they be the twin child of poland and the french revolution and in they cradle it be hard to tell they apart so strongly be the feature of each stamp with the likeness of liberty for a time it seem that the new idea would carry all before they even before france have herself abolish the monarchy belgium throw off the austrian rule and declare for a republic and when in 1792 france find herself at war with the austrian and prussian government and in the following year with practically all the government of europe she victorious army be everywhere greet as savior by the subject people but the old dynastic state prove to be of tougher material than be expect moreover it be not long before france find herself in conflict with the national aspiration which she have call into existence the various republic which france set up all over europe soon discover that they be nothing but tributary state of they deliverer and when napoleon begin he career of undisguised conquest he unwittingly do even more than the revolution to strengthen the national idea in europe for the nationality have now become thoroughly hostile to france and fight in alliance with they old dynasty to throw off the yoke of the hate foreign tyrant this strange change in france from liberator to despot be worthy of some attention it be not good for a nation any more than for a individual to be too successful moreover the doctrine of liberty whether in the individualist or nationalist sense if carry to extreme be liable to abuse all to-day be aware that sheer individualism in the economic sphere be a almost unmitigated evil sheer individualism in the political sphere and sheer nationalism be equally evil france at the beginning of last century be suffer from too much success too much political liberty too much nationalism have overthrow the old _ régime _ within the state quickly and easily she begin to think she could do without the state altogether : the result be anarchy for which the only remedy be despotism have again suddenly become conscious of she power and mission as a nation she begin to send she army across she frontier to carry the gospel of she peculiar culture to other and more benighted nation : the result be occupation which degenerate into conquest despotism within and conquest without both be sum up in the one word napoleon -- such be the fate of the mother of liberty who have love she child not wisely but too well yet napoleonism be a very necessary stage in the development of modern europe it be the tramp of the invader which do more than anything else to awake sleep nationalism all over the continent it be before the roar of napoleon 's cannon that the artificial boundary which have divide people crumble to dust napoleon clear the ground and even do something toward lay the foundation of the great modern nation-state germany and italy what napoleon do for europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century germany the napoleon-state among nation to-day be do for europe at the beginning of the twentieth century § 3 _ the congress of vienna and the international idea _ -- the overthrow of napoleon be due in a large measure to the spirit of nationalism which he conquest have evoke against he among the various people of europe the reward of that overthrow however be reap not by the people but by the dynasty and state-system of the old _ régime _ the congress of the power which meet at vienna in 1814 to resettle the map of europe after the upheaval and war of the previous twenty-five year be a terrible disappointment and we who be now hopefully look forward to a similar congress at the end of the present war can not do better than study the great failure of 1814 and take warning from it the phrase which herald the approach congress be curiously and disquietingly similar to those on the lip of we public man and journalist to-day when they speak of the settlement before we the parliament of man the federation of the world which have become a remote dream when tennyson first coin the expression in 1842 seem in 1814 on the eve of accomplishment the work of the congress be to be no less than the reconstruction of the moral order the regeneration of the political system of europe the establishment of a enduring peace found on a just redistribution of political force the institution of a effective and a permanent international tribunal the encouragement of the growth of representative institution and last but not least a arrangement between the power for a gradual and systematic disarmament it seem write sir aw ward as if the state compose the european family free once more to take counsel together on term of independence be also free to determine they own destiny -lrb- 1 -rrb- the congress of vienna be to inaugurate a new era such of these view however as pointed in a democratic or nationalistic direction represent the expectation of the people not the intention of the crown head and diplomatist who meet at the austrian capital among the member of the congress the only man who at first voice these aspiration of the world at large be the russian tsar alexander i and such concession to popular opinion as be make be due to what the english plenipotentiary lord castlereagh describe as the sublime mysticism and nonsense of the emperor -lrb- footnote 1 : _ cambridge modern history _ vol ix p 577 -rrb- instead therefore of establish a new era the congress do its utmost to restore the old one everything which have happen in europe since the outbreak of the french revolution be regard as a bad dream the principle of popular freedom and national liberty be completely ignore and a attempt be make to rivet again on the limb of europe the shackle of the antiquated frontier which have be strike off by the hammer of napoleon everywhere the national idea be trample upon germany and italy be put back again into the eighteenth century austrium 's territory in the latter country be largely increase norway be unwillingly yoke with sweden and belgium with holland switzerland be make to surrender she democratic constitution and to return to the aristocratic cantonal system of the past and lastly poland remain dismembered the ally while fight napoleon have issue the follow proclamation to the world couch in language almost identical with that use by the ally who be now fight germany : nation will henceforth respect they mutual independence no political edifice shall henceforth be erect on the ruin of formerly independent state the object of the war and of the peace be to secure the rights the freedom and the independence of all nation -lrb- 1 -rrb- the congress of vienna fail to redeem these pledge : firstly because its member have not grasp the principle of nationality and use nation and state as if they be synonymous term secondly because they do not represent the people whose destiny they take it upon they to determine and make no attempt whatever to consult the view of the various mass of population which they parcel out among themselves like so much butter they honestly try to lay the foundation of a permanent peace but they method of do so be not to satisfy the natural aspiration of the european nation and so leave they nothing to fight about but to establish such a exact equipoise among the great state by a nice distribution of the aforesaid butter in they respective scale that they would be afraid to go to war with each other lest they might upset the so-called balance of power the settlement of 1814 therefore leave a heritage of future trouble behind it which have keep europe disturb throughout the nineteenth century and be directly responsible for the present war the real settlement be yet to come and if we of this generation be to make it a final one we must avoid the error commit by the congress of a hundred year ago -lrb- footnote 1 : alison phillip _ modern europe _ p 8 -rrb- yet when all be say the congress of vienna represent a important milestone along the road of progress it be a great precedent as a disillusioned contemporary admit it prepare the world for a more complete political structure if ever the power should meet again to establish a political system by which war of conquest would be render impossible and the rights of all guarantee the congress of vienna as a preparatory assembly will not have be without use -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be a prophetic ring about this very welcome to we of the twentieth century we can not think altogether unkindly of we great-grandfather ' ill-judged attempt to avert the calamity which have now break over we -lrb- footnote 1 : friedrich von gentz quote in _ camb mod hist _ vol x p 2 -rrb- nor be the congress altogether barren of positive result for it give birth to that conception of a confederation of europe which though never realize have be one of the guide idea of nineteenth-century politics as this solution of the world 's problem be likely to be urge upon we with great insistency at the conclusion of the present war it will be well to look a little more closely into it and to see why it fail to secure the allegiance of europe a hundred year ago the congress have meet at vienna and settle all outstanding question to the satisfaction of its member why should it not meet periodically and constitute itself a supreme international tribunal the question have only to be ask to receive the approbation of all concern the dreamer alexander i at once see the destiny of the world entrust to a holy alliance which would rule accord to the sacred principle of the christian religion and even the more practical mind of castlereagh conceive that a council of the great power endow with the efficiency and almost the simplicity of a single state be a possibility yet it be quite clear to-day that at that time and under those condition the establishment of a permanent and effective confederation of europe would have prove disastrous to the world the congress of vienna be follow by further congress in 1818 1819 1820 and 1822 and each succeed conference reveal to europe more clearly the true character of the new authority into whose hand the power be slip certain very dangerous tendency become for example apparent the first conference have assemble to confer the blessing of order upon a continent ravage by the revolutionary and napoleonic war of france hence the confederation of europe start life as a kind of anti-jacobin society whose main business it be to suppress revolution whether it take the nationalistic or democratic form furthermore the interference with the internal affair of france in 1814 and 1815 tend to establish a precedent for interference with the internal affair of any country the holy alliance therefore soon assume the character of a trust of absolute monarch determine to aid each other when threaten by rising or agitation among they people and to crush liberal aspiration wherever they be to be find in other part of europe the popular desire for peace be exploit in the interest of unpopular government settlement by conference in regard to international matter be extend to settlement by a cabal of irresponsible crown head in regard to internal constitutional and national question a clique of despot threaten the liberty of the world and propose to back up they decision by use they army as police one government however even in that period of reaction refuse to lend its countenance to such proceedings england at first protest and at length take up a attitude of complete opposition and it be due to she that the confederation never become really effective she have to choose between peace and liberty and she choose the latter -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see alison phillip _ the confederation of europe _ together with he chapter on the congress 1815-1822 in vol x of the _ cambridge modern history _ the whole subject of the concert of europe which can only be touch upon here be of great importance it be again refer to in chap viii see pp 374 ff -rrb- the truth be that there be three idea in the air at the beginning of the nineteenth century all excellent in themselves but quite impossible to be realize at one and the same period two of these the social or democratic idea and the national idea be make as we have see live issue by the french revolution the third which may be call the international idea be raise by the congress of vienna it be a old idea of course for it have be embody in that shadowy holy roman empire which be the medieval dream of rome the great but its form be new and now for the first time it become a dream of the future rather than a dream of the past what man do not see then and still for the most part fail to see be that the human race can only work out these three idea properly in a certain order democracy and nationhood may as in the case of italy be acquire by a people at the same moment but without the realisation of the national idea it be hardly possible to conceive of democratic government for any country the national idea therefore precede the social idea as mazzinus rightly insist still more must it precede the international idea by this it be not mean that every nation in the world must have grow to self-consciousness and have possess itself of freedom before we come within sight of a world-concert and world-peace but certainly in europe itself the national question have to be settle before there could be any chance of establish a international tribunal it be equally certain that the social idea also claim preference of the international idea the great danger of set up a effective machine for regulate the affair of europe be that the machine may get into the wrong hand the holy alliance be a warning which should not be forget it become a obstruction to progress a strait-waistcoat which threaten to strangle the liberty of europe because it get into the hand of a vested interest the dynastic interest which be hostile both to nationalism and democracy since 1814 however there have be great stride along the path both of democracy and of nationalism and if germany lose this war the congress of the settlement will meet in a very different atmosphere from that in which its predecessor assemble at vienna it will be a conference of power victorious over reaction not revolution and pledge to the support of a liberal program and yet if such a conference become a permanent feature of european life if in other word a new attempt be make to set up a international tribunal it might easily become as dangerous to the liberty of the people as ever be the holy alliance the dynastic principle it be to be hope will never again threaten the world 's peace or progress but there be other vested interest besides the dynastic one during the nineteenth century economic development have give a enormous impetus to international movement and cosmopolitanism generally unfortunately political development though great have not by any means keep pace with the economic in other word it be still possible in most country and in some more possible than in other for a small oligarchy to gain control of the political machine again if there be one thing in the world more international than labor it be capital and as mr norman angell have show it be the capitalist who be hardest hit by international war and who stand to gain most from its abolition european capital be almost certain to have a large say in the settlement and considerable influence in the counsel of any new concert of europe that might come into existence now suppose -- a not impossible contingency -- that a ring of capitalist gain complete control of some politically backward country like russium and suppose a grave crisis arise in the labor world in england or france what would be easier than for arrangement to be make at the international conference for the transference of russian troops to the west to preserve the sacred rights of property and the peace of europe this may seem a somewhat fantastic supposition yet it be precisely in this way and on grounds like these that the holy alliance interfere with the internal affair of european country during the second and third decade of last century and even as late as 1849 we have russium still faithful to the principle of thirty year before come to the assistance of austrium in she suppression of the liberty of hungary it be a healthy instinct in the english people that lead they to break up the concert of europe in 1818 -- a system which not only threaten the liberty of other but might in the language of the orator of the opposition in time present the spectacle of cossack encamp in hyde park to overawe the house of common -lrb- 1 -rrb- and if the prevail internationalism have not quite blind they eye to-day they will scrutinise with the greatest possible care any new proposal to re-erect the concert of europe as a permanent and authoritative tribunal what the world need at present be more nationalism and more democracy and it be only after these two great nineteenth-century movement have work themselves out to the full at least on the continent of europe that mankind will be able safely to make experiment towards the realisation of the third and crowning principle the principle of a european commonwealth -lrb- footnote 1 : _ cambridge modern history _ vol x p 16 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : europe in 1815 -rrb- the national problem which the congress of vienna bequeath to posterity may be see at a glance by look at a political map of europe in 1815 the entire center of the continent from ostend to palermo and from königsberg to constantinople be leave a political chaos and it be not too much to say that the history of europe from 1814 to 1914 be the history of the settlement of this vast area the only state whose frontier have not alter during this period be switzerland and even that country seize the opportunity which a disturbed europe offer she in 1848 to substitute a unify federal system for the constitution impose upon she in 1815 the rest of the area fall into six section : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the kingdom of the netherland contain the two distinct and often antagonistic nation belgium and holland -lrb- 2 -rrb- the german nationality split up into no less than thirty-eight -lrb- 2 -rrb- sovereign state loosely hold together in a confederation -lrb- 3 -rrb- the italian nationality distribute under eight independent government include four duchy two kingdom the papal state and the province under austrian rule -lrb- 4 -rrb- the polish nationality divide up between the three power prussia russium and austrium -lrb- 5 -rrb- the austrian empire comprise a dozen distinct nationality and -lrb- 6 -rrb- the ottoman empire in which at least five different christian people groan beneath the sway of the mohammedan turk thus if we may regard the inhabitant of the southern netherland province for the moment as of one nationality there be roughly ten great nationality the german the italian the belgian the pole the bohemian the hungarian the southern slav the rumanian the bulgarian and the greek all leave with national aspiration unsatisfied all hamper by state frontier which have no correspondence with they natural boundary can we wonder that there have be war in the nineteenth century should we not rather wonder that those war have not be greater and more numerous for the congress of the power in 1814 have fail to give the nationality what they want nothing remain for they but to seize it for themselves the only alternative to settlement by conference be blood and iron and it be with blood and iron that nearly every nationality which have attain nationhood in the last hundred year have cement the structure of its state -lrb- footnote 2 : napoleon have succeed in reduce the number from 360 to 38 -rrb- it be not we purpose in the present chapter to deal with the whole of this vast area the three eastern section poland the austrian empire and turkey present special problem of they own and therefore need special treatment still less do we intend to write a history of the nineteenth century or even to adhere to a chronological treatment rather we object be to exemplify the principle of nationality by watch it at work in the three western section of the central european area to show how the national idea have be mould in belgium italy and germany by the various problem which the nationality in these country have have to face and the force which they have overcome and lastly to indicate the part which a over-developed nationalism in germany have play in bring about the war of 1914 § 4 _ the national idea in belgium and the problem of small nation _ -- the problem of the netherland which it will be convenient to deal with first introduce we to a aspect of nationhood which we have hitherto not touch upon the chief force which hold a community together and cause it to constitute one state write sir john seeley be three -- common nationality common religion and common interest these may act in various degree of intensity and they may also act singly or in combination -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the low country religion have up to the present be a stronger nation-making force than nationality three nationality each with its own language live there side by side -- the dutch the fleming and the walloon but of these the dutch and the fleming be very closely ally racially flemish be only a slight variant of the dutch language it would therefore seem natural on the face of it that these two section would amalgamate together leave the walloon to attach themselves to they french cousin that it be not so be due to the fact that the fleming and the dutch be adherent of two different and mutually hostile creed and that this distinction in they faith have be stamp upon the national memory by the whole history of they past holland the stronghold of calvinism have at the end of the sixteenth century throw off the yoke of catholic spain and assert its independence while the belgic province after alva have cruelly crush out such protestantism as exist among they people return to the faith and the allegiance of they father and remain part of the hapsburg inheritance until the congress of vienna thus the cleavage between protestantism and catholicism have make two nation out of one low german nationality in the netherland as it threaten to do with one celtic nationality in ireland on the other hand they common catholic faith have weld fleming and walloon together make one nation out of two nationality far more racially distinct than the fleming and the dutch and this amalgamation have acquire a certain flavor of common nationality from the fact that the language of the upper class be french -lrb- footnote 1 : _ expansion of england _ p 59 -rrb- it be obvious therefore that the attempt of the diplomatist in 1814 to ignore both historical and religious difference and to combine holland and belgium into a single state be doom at the outset fifteen year of constant friction be follow in 1830 by a rise in brussels against dutch supremacy which quickly spread to the rest of belgium the great power recognize the inevitable interfere on behalf of belgium she be declare a neutral state separate from holland and take to herself a king in the person of leopold i it be however highly significant that directly the dutch menace be remove from belgium the internal cleavage of nationality begin to be feel in 1815 the difference between flemish and walloon be to a large extent conceal beneath a veneer of french culture and french manners among the upper and commercial class no language but french be ever speak and in they dislike of dutch supremacy the flemish belgian take a sort of patriotic pride in they borrow speech and for a time relegate they native tongue to the level of a rustic _ patois _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and yet on the other hand the separation of belgium from holland have no sooner take place than the newly arouse national spirit begin to show itself among the flemish-speaking part of the people by a revival of interest in they ancestral teutonic language king william i 's attempt to make dutch the official language have meet with universal opposition but as early as 1840 a demand be put forward for the use of the flemish tongue -lrb- which be closely akin to the dutch -rrb- on equal term with french in the legislature the law court and the army as the year pass by the movement gather ever-increasing number of adherent and the demand be repeat with grow insistence -lrb- 2 -rrb- in 1897 the flemish party attain its ambition and flemish become the official language of the country side by side with french the remarkable thing about this teutonise movement be that its mainstay have always be the extreme catholic party which on religious grounds have be the most violent opponent of the attempt teutonification by the dutch the opposition between flemish and walloon indeed become so marked in recent year that many fear that the belgian nation be about to split into two germany have however postpone this national calamity for generation if not for ever and the belgium which arise like a phoenix from the ash of this third attempt at teutonification will we can not doubt be a belgium indissolubly knit together by common memory of a glorious struggle for freedom and cement by the blood and tear of the whole population germany like napoleon a century ago will call many nation into be the first and not the least of she creation be a transfigured and united belgium -lrb- footnote 1 : _ cambridge modern history _ vol x p 521 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ibid _ vol xi p 693 -rrb- as a frontier state a link between the latin and teutonic race to both of which she people be akin belgium offer a extremely interesting study of the national idea at work the people of germany and france which have be perpetually at war with each other since the time of julius caesar have almost always meet on she fair and prosperous plain to fight they battle since she be geographically the gateway from one to the other neither could afford to let the other occupy she territory and so she have win she independence as a state both have constantly threaten she existence in time past and so have force upon she bi-lingual population that consciousness of common interest which if strong enough may become as firm a basis for national unity as actual community of nationality it should be notice further that it have become the practice in recent time to guarantee the neutrality of small frontier state like belgium which lie at the mercy of they greater neighbor a practice intend not only to preserve the integrity of such state but also to prevent the frequent occurrence of war by close as it be the military gate between the hostile country -lrb- 1 -rrb- it remain to be see whether the violation of these principle by germany have the effect of strengthen they in the future rather than the reverse in any case we may expect to see attempt to apply the same principle to other part of europe already the northern and southern end of the frontier between germany and france be neutralise by the existence of belgium and switzerland why it may be ask should not the whole frontier be treat in the same way by neutralise the dispute territory of alsace-lorraine perhaps too a neutral poland would form a useful buffer between germany and russium such neutralisation it should be note need not necessarily carry with it independence poland and alsace-lorraine might form part of russium and france respectively and still be neutralise by a guarantee of other power a precedent exist for this in the term of the cession of the ionian island to greece in 1864 while savoy though a province of france be technically neutralise territory -lrb- 2 -rrb- case like these however it must be admit be extremely anomalous and could hardly stand the strain of a serious war but then as recent experience have show we not even independent neutralised state be safe when all europe be aflame the truth be that the whole conception of neutrality imply the existence of some power above and beyond the state it may be simply a group of powerful state who be able to impose they will upon the rest of europe it may be a general congress like the congress of vienna since the concert of europe disappear and gradually give place to the two oppose alliance of great power there have be no such authority in the civilised world the result be before we in the ruin city and starve population of violate belgium -lrb- footnote 1 : the neutralisation of sovereign state be very recent in origin switzerland and luxembourg be the only other instance the former be neutralise in 1815 the latter in 1867 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ cambridge modern history _ xi 642 see for the whole question of neutralised state lawrence _ principle of international law _ § § 246-248 -rrb- as independent state therefore small nation can only survive in the long run if they neutrality be permanently guarantee by some international authority which be itself permanently capable of enforce its decree upon recalcitrant state sovereignty and independence however be not as we have see essential to full nationhood provide the nation possess a certain amount of home-rule and regard the government under which it live as a true expression of its genius and will for example from 1809 till the setting in of russian reaction in 1899 the finnish nation enjoy all the privilege of complete nationhood except actual sovereignty there be therefore a future for small nation either as autonomous protégés of great power like russium or as partner in some commonwealth of nation like the british empire but there be yet another consideration to be face why it be ask should we trouble ourselves about the preservation of small nationality at all the state be power and it be only the really powerful state therefore that can and ought to survive there be something laughable in the idea of a small state it be weakness try to pose as strength and as for nation which have lose they independence and have bow to the yoke of the conqueror they fate be incorporation how can they hope or expect to retain they separate existence and they peculiar culture when they have surrender the power upon which these privilege depend no nation can permit the jew to have a double nationality and the same apply to pole finn alsatian irishman and belgian -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be the point of view of bernhardus treitschke and the german government this be the theory which be say to justify the practice of prussianisation russianisation magyarisation and so on it raise the whole question of the value and significance to civilisation of the existence of small nation treitschke of course and he school be convince that they possess neither value nor significance in small state there be develop that beggarly frame of mind which judge the state by the tax that it raise there be completely lack in small state the ability of the great state to be just all real masterpiece of poetry and art arise upon the soil of great nationality -- such be a few of treitschke 's dogmatic utterance on this subject -lrb- 2 -rrb- but it be not merely the german who think small beer of small nationality listen to sir john seeley : the question whether large state or small state be best be not one which can be answer or ought to be discuss absolutely we often hear abstract panegyric upon the happiness of small state but observe that a small state among small state be one thing and a small state among large state quite another nothing be more delightful to read of than the bright day of athen and florence but those bright day last only so long as the state with which athen and florence have to do be state on a similar scale of magnitude both state sink at once as soon as large country state of consolidated strength grow up in they neighborhood the lustre of athen grow pale as soon as macedonium arise and charle v speedily bring to a end the great day of florence now if it be true that a larger type of state than any hitherto know be spring up in the world be not this a serious consideration for those state which rise only to the old level of magnitude -lrb- 3 -rrb- the answer to which be yes indeed if the good old plan that he should take who have the power and he should keep who can be to be the guide principle in european politics of the future but surely sir john seeley 's argument though undoubtedly tell as regard the sovereign independence of small _ state _ tell for and not against the preservation of small _ nation _ be it to the interest of the world as a whole that athen and florence should be crush be it not true in spite of treitschke that the great thing of earth have be the product of small people we owe we conception of law to a city call rome we finest output of literature and art to small community like athen florence holland and elizabethan england we religion to a insignificant people who inhabit a narrow strip of land in the eastern mediterranean and small nation be as valuable to the world to-day as they have ever be denmark have enrich we educational experience by the establishment of she famous high school which we can hardly imagine she do have she be a province of prussium norway have give we the greatest of modern dramatist henrik ibsen and belgium have not only produce maeterlinck and verhaeren but be industrially the most highly develop country on the continent the world can not afford to do without she small people who must be either independent or autonomous if they be to find adequate expression for they national genius if they be to obtain proper condition in which to live think love and labor for the benefit of all can we guarantee to they this freedom that be one of the great question which this war will settle -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ selection from treitschke _ translate by al gowan pp 17-20 58-61 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2

distinction between _ state _ and _ nation _ be not make clear and the article on nationalism and liberalism in _ the round table _ December 1914 -rrb- § 5 _ the national idea in italy : the ideal type _ -- let we now turn to italy a country which have in the past be as much of a european tom tiddler 's ground as belgium though for rather different reason italy be inhabit by a race speak a common language and observe a common religion she have historical memory as glorious as those of any other country in the world and she natural boundary be almost as well-defined as those of great britain yet it be not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that she manage to become a nation the chief reason why she remain a geographical expression long after england france and spain have acquire national unity be the fact that she be until comparatively recent time a example of the less contain the greater throughout the middle age she be a suburb not a country rome be the capital of the world italy only its environs moreover since all road lead to rome and the lord of rome be the master of europe the road romeward be worn by the tramp of the army of all nation thus italy be constantly subject to invasion and the state-system with which the congress of vienna resaddle she in 1814 be little more than relic of past military occupation of she soil by foreign army the main problem therefore in the making of modern italy be how to get rid of the heavy burden of the past how to deal with rome and all that rome stand for the problem would have be insoluble have not the prestige of rome decline considerably since the middle age a prestige which spring from the fact that she be the capital of two empire -- the spiritual empire of the papacy and the secular empire found by charle the great the former have suffer from the reformation and the rise of the great protestant nation the latter have be grow feebler and feebler for century until it be abolish as a institution by napoleon yet italy in 1814 still lay helpless and divide at the foot of rome the pope hold under he immediate sway a large zigzag-shaped territory run across the center from sea to sea and as spiritual leader of half europe he could at any moment summon to he assistance the catholic chivalry of the world the roman emperor no longer exist but the austrian emperor be another title for the same man hold much the same territory and the fact that he have renounce he vague suzerainty over the rest of europe do not prevent he exercise a very real suzerainty in italy not merely over the eastern half of the lombard plain which definitely belong to austrium but also over the other state of the peninsula which be in theory at least independent the kingdom of the two sicily in the south the grand duchy of tuscany on the west and the smaller duchy of parma modena and lucca be only stable in so far as austrium bolster up they corrupt and unpopular government even the papal state themselves equally undermine with corruption and unpopularity ultimately rest upon the same support thus austria represent for italy all that evil past of which she want to be rid : the foreign yoke against which she newly conscious spirit of nationality revolt the dynastic frontier which be abhorrent to she desire for unity the absolute _ régime _ under which she soul after feed on the principle of the french revolution lay gag and bind the first step to be take towards the creation of italy be the expulsion of the austrian this fact in itself purify the struggle for italian freedom and raise italian nationalism to height of nobility and heroism almost unparalleled in history the nation have not merely to be unify but _ deliver _ and deliver from the oppression of that power which be the mainstay of reaction in europe nor be it simply a question of national freedom austrium have declare war upon individual and constitutional liberty also and use all she power to suppress they wherever they dare to raise they head from begin to end of she fight for national existence italy never forget that she be also fight for individual liberty or cease to be conscious that the downfall of austrium in italy would mean the downfall of reaction in europe the banner which mazzinus raise in 1831 have the word unity and independence on the one side and liberty equality and humanity on the other italy be indeed greatly bless inasmuch as in seek she own deliverance she could not help burst the band of brass which bind the whole world in captivity it be not possible here to tell the glorious story of the resurrection of italy or even to say anything of the three hero at whose hand she receive she freedom -- cavor who give she the service of he brain mazzinus who devote to she the love and passion of he great heart and garibaldus who fight for she with the strength of he own right arm it must suffice to indicate very briefly the various stage in the development of she national idea and the manner in which she finally realize it liberal principle take root in italy at the time of the french revolution and the first glimmering of nationalism be due to napoleon who bundle the prince out of the peninsula and even for a time exile the pope himself but it be constitutional rather than national freedom which seem most urgent to the generation which succeed napoleon the carbonarus as the early italian revolutionary be call confine themselves almost entirely to the demand for a constitution in the various exist state and though they eagerly desire the expulsion of austrium they do so not because she prevent italian unity but because she forbid political reform they rising therefore local and disunited in character be bind to fail the first fifteen year after the congress of vienna be occupy by a series of attempt to substitute a constitutional for a absolute _ régime _ in different part of italy attempt which austria crush with a heavy hand the period which follow 1830-1848 belong to mazzinus and he young italy party he task be to fire italy for the first time with the ideal of national unity and independence the conception of unity be a difficult one for italian to grasp all history seem to fight against it there be for example not only the tradition connect with rome to be reckon with but there be also the difference between north and south and perhaps most important of all the local spirit of independence associate with the great city like venice milan florence naple etc thus over against mazzini 's ideal of a single unified state there arise the counter-ideal of a federal system in this however later event prove mazzinus to be right where he fail in foresight be in regard to the constitutional character of the state he dream of he wish not only to abolish all exist frontier in italy but to do away with all exist state-system the only italy he could conceive be a republic and italy be not ripe for a republic which be for the rest a form of government too much bind up with the disruptive tradition of the city-state to be acceptable -lrb- 1 -rrb- but if italy be not to be a republic she must be a monarchy and where could she find a prince to put at the head of she united state clearly she would accept no one who be not the declare enemy of austrium and the declare friend of constitutional reform for a month or so in 1846 it seem that the pope himself might be prevail upon to undertake the rôle and the elevation of pius ix to the chair of st peter be greet with wild enthusiasm in italy because he be believe to be a liberal these hope prove illusory however and so the eye of all patriot turn more and more in the direction of piedmont -lrb- footnote 1 : it be noticeable that greece also play with the idea of a republic at first and eventually select a monarchical form of government as a matter of fact not a single nation-state form in europe since the congress of vienna have adopt the republican principle -rrb- this principality which be part of the kingdom of sardinium rule over by the semi-french house of savoy share the northern plain of italy with austrium and at first show neither anti-austrian nor liberal proclivity victor emmanuel come back smile in 1814 say that he have be asleep for fifteen year the old _ régime _ be restore as though the revolution have never be and a rising of the carbonarus in 1821 be suppress with the aid of austrian troops but in 1831 a king charle albert come to the throne who realize that it be the mission of he house to drive the austrian from italy and who be enlighten enough to begin to institute reform as unostentatiously as possible so as not to attract the unwelcome attention of vienna then come the great outburst of 1848 which be the culmination of mazzinus 's propaganda for the past sixteen year at first all go well the austrian army be almost expel from the peninsula constitution be grant in rome naple tuscany and piedmont venice and rome declare themselves republic but no real scheme for all italy emerge the mazzinian be heroic but unpractical and next year austrium return once more deal as before piecemeal with the revolted province and finally crush the hope of italy again at the battle of novara yet all be not lose the republican dream of mazzinus be it be true at a end but piedmont have step into mazzinus 's shoe she have champion the cause of freedom against austrium and when the latter reassert she sway she alone of the various state refuse to abrogate the newly-acquired constitution thus begin the third period in the emancipation of italy the period of cavor who become head of the piedmontese cabinet in 1850 he aim be first to make piedmont the model state and champion of all italy he believe fervently in liberty -- italy he say must make herself by means of liberty or we must give up try to make she -- and he be at the same time one of the ablest and most practical statesman who have ever guide the destiny of a nation in ten year he make the state of the north-west a oasis of freedom and good government which attract the best intellect of italy to its service and henceforth piedmont become the center of italian aspiration a new propaganda movement be set on foot call the national society which reject both federalism and republicanism and declare in favor of a unite italy under the crown of victor emmanuel of savoy and when the chance of french support come in 1858 cavor feel it be time to act this time the end crown the work austrium be deprive of everything but venice tuscany and romagna declare for incorporation by plebiscite garibaldus conquer sicily and the south and by the end of 1860 the king of sardinium be king of practically the whole of italy all that still remain to be win be venice which austria cede in 1866 rome which the french have occupy in the name of the pope and be force to evacuate in 1870 and the italium irredenta of to-day viz the trentino trieste and istrium which may be recover as a result of the present war it be worthy of note also that the trans-alpine province savoy and nice which have be part of the dominion of the sardinian kingdom be cede to france in 1858-1859 as a return for she aid thus round off the western frontier of the new kingdom of italy so as to correspond fairly closely with the boundary of nationality the foundation of modern italy show we the national idea at its best it be accomplish by noble means and by noble mind and the latter in they perpetual struggle against the force of reaction be never allow to forget the claim of individual as well as of national freedom three test of true nationhood it will be remember be suggest at the beginning of this chapter : a state-frontier co-extensive with the nationality-frontier a unitary state-system and a form of government recognize by the inhabitant as a expression of they general will italy fulfil all these condition for though the first have not yet be perfectly realize as regard italium irredenta the exception be after all a trifling one thus the development of the national idea in italy be almost a model of what such a development should be and we have dwell somewhat at length upon it for that very reason the work of mazzinus and cavor provide we with a standard of comparison which should be find very useful in deal with the national idea in other country § 6 _ the national idea in germany : a case of arrest development _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- nothing for example could be more instructive both as a study in nationalism and as a aid to the understanding of the present situation in europe than a comparison between the making of modern italy and the making of modern germany at first sight the german empire with its marvellous progress its vast resource and its world-wide ambition would appear to be a even more successful example of national development than the kingdom of italy its demand for a place in the sun its hustle diplomacy its military spirit its obvious intention to expand territorially if not in europe itself then in asia or africa be all take as symptom of this success no doubt there be a certain amount of truth in this view the truculence of german foreign policy be to be partly attribute to that form of swollen self-consciousness and self-complacency to which all nation be subject more or less and which be most likely one would suppose to be find in country where a nationality have recently succeed in make itself into a nation the natural instinct to regard one 's own nation as the peculiar people of god and to look down on other nation as lesser breed without the law be a phenomenon which must be constantly reckon with in any comprehensive treatment of nationalism every nation have its own variety of it in england it be jingoism in france chauvinism in italy irredentism in russium pan-slavism and so on these be instance of over-development of the national idea due either to some confusion between race and nationality or to simple national megalomania which usually subside after a healthy humiliation such as we suffer in england for example in the boer war or as russium suffer in she struggle with the japanese -lrb- footnote 1 : the student be advise to read the chapter on germany before begin this section -rrb- yet a careful examination of the german body-politic will reveal symptom unlike those to be find in any other nation german nationalism be over-developed in one direction because it be under-developed and imperfect in other direction apply we three test to the german nation and it will be find to fail in they all national boundary and state frontier do not coincide because there be still some twelve million german live outside germany in austria-hungary -lrb- 1 -rrb- germany be a state but not a unitary state for she still retain the obsolete particularism of the eighteenth century with its petty prince and dynastic frontier and lastly the government of germany can not claim to express the general will while more than a third of the voter in the empire be swear to overthrow the whole system at the earliest opportunity the german nation in fact be suffer from some form of arrest development and arrest development as the criminologist tell we be almost invariably accompany by morbid psychology that germany at the present moment and for some time past have be the victim of a morbid state of mind few impartial observer will deny it have however not be so generally recognize that this disease -- for it be nothing less -- be due not to any national depravity but to constitutional and structural defect which be themselves the result of a unfortunate series of historical accident let we look a little closer into this matter consider the three defect in german nationalism one by one and use the story of italy as a aid to we investigation -lrb- footnote 1 : there be also german live in switzerland the baltic province of russium and the united state of america but these may be regard as lose to the german nation as the french canadian be lose to france -rrb- first then why be it that while the unification of italy lead to the inclusion of the whole italian nationality within the state frontier with the trifling exception above refer to the unification of germany be only bring about or even make possible by the _ exclusion _ of a large section of the nationality germany like italy be hamper by tradition inherit from the mediaeval roman empire represent by a ancient capital which stand in the path of unity why be it that while italy could not and would not do without rome germany be compel to surrender vienna and to exclude austria the answer be : because the unification of germany be only possible through the instrumentality of prussium which would not brook the rivalry of austrium and therefore the latter have to go the problem of the making of germany as it present itself to the mind of bismarck be first of all a problem as to which should be _ supreme _ in germany prussium or austrium in other word bismarck care more for the aggrandisement of prussium than for the unity of germany -lrb- 1 -rrb- to the mind of cavor the problem of the unification of italy present itself in a totally different light for he there be no question of the aggrandisement of piedmont though he no doubt feel pride in the thought that the house of savoy be to possess the throne of italy austrium be expel from italy in 1860 not that piedmont might take she place as ruler of the peninsula but that piedmont might disappear in the larger whole of a emancipate italy austrium be expel from germany in 1866 in order that prussium might rule undisturbed thus though the austro-prussian war of 1866 be a essential step in the foundation of the modern german state its motive and result be not in the least comparable to those which inspire and follow the italian war of liberation in 1859-60 in the first place the austrian be not foreigner but german whom it be necessary for reason of state not of nationality to place outside the rest of germany germany have in fact to choose between national unity and state unity and she choose the latter partly because prussium really decide the matter for she partly because she realize that the establishment of a strong german state be the essential prelude to the creation of a strong united nation austrium have to be shut out in 1866 in order that she might be receive back again at some later date on germany 's own term in the second place austrium be in no sense the oppressor of germany as she have be of italy she be simply the preside member of the german confederation who as the rival of prussium as the inheritor of the mediaeval imperial tradition as the ruler of million of non-germanic people would have render the problem of german unification almost insoluble it be therefore necessary to get rid of she as gently and as politely as possible after the crush victory at königgrätz bismarck treat prussium 's ancient foe with extraordinary leniency for he have already plan the dual alliance in he mind know as he do that though in germany austrium might be a inconvenient rival to prussia in europe she be the indispensable ally of germany and so though the ramshackle old german imperial castle be divide in two and the northern portion at any rate bring thoroughly up to date the neighbor still live side by side in a semi-detached kind of way it would be a mistake then to call the war of 1866 a war of deliverance indeed since the defeat of napoleon at leipzig germany have have no such war that be in a great measure she national tragedy italian nationalism be spiritualise by the very fact that it have to struggle for decade against a foreign oppressor and the foundation of she unity be lay on the heroic memory of she effort to expel the intruder this spiritualisation these heroic memory be germany 's also in 1813-14 but the opportunity of unification be allow to slip by and when the task be perform fifty year later it be through quite other means and in a very different spirit and yet though there be no one to expel germany could only hope to attain unity by fight in 1848 she make a attempt to do so by peaceable means and a national parliament actually assemble at frankfurt to frame a constitution for the whole country but the attempt noble as it be in conception prove a dismal failure and it become clear that national unity in germany be to be win not by speech and majority resolution but by blood and iron the word be bismarck 's and the task be he also set they beside the word of cavor about italy and liberty quote above or compare the harsh unscrupulous spirit of the great german master-builder with the spirit of mazzinus cavor and garibaldus and you get a measure of the difference between the development of the national idea in germany and in italy yet bismarck 's famous sentence express the truth of the matter for germany austrium have be put outside the german pale and germany north of the main have accept unity under the hegemony of prussium but there still remain the four great state of south germany to bring in they have be the ally of austrium in 1866 and prussia have she will it might have incorporate they by conquest but bismarck see that they must put themselves willingly under prussium if the german empire be to be a stable concern he therefore leave they alone to think it over for a while sooner or later they would have to come in since now that austrium have be exclude there remain only the choice between dependence on france and union with prussium bismarck deliberately play upon south germany 's fear of france and napoleon iii 's restless foreign policy admirably second he effort but a war be necessary to bring matter to a head the opportunity come in 1870 and bismarck be able to make it appear a war not of he own choose the southern state throw themselves into the arm of prussium france be crushed and alsace-lorraine annex the german empire be proclaimed and modern germany come into be there have be no foreigner to expel from german soil but bismarck find that a attack upon france serve he purpose equally well -lrb- footnote 1 : perhaps it would be fairer to say that he be incapable of distinguish between they see he _ reflection _ i pp 315 316 -rrb- germany be make by a war of aggression result in territorial expansion at the expense of another nation italy by a war of liberation drive the alien from she soil and the subsequent history of the two nation be eloquent of this difference in they origin since 1860 italy have in the main occupied herself with domestic reform with the work out of the social idea which have have to wait upon the realisation of the national idea she have have it be true she adventure more especially in africa and she jingoism which have take the natural form of irredentism or the demand for the recovery of italian province still leave in austrian hand but she have never threaten the peace of europe or seek power at the expense of other nationality since 1870 on the other hand germany have have to sit armed to defend the booty take from france we have earn in the late war respect but hardly love say general von moltke soon after the conclusion of peace what we have gain by arm in six month we shall have to defend by arm for fifty year at the beginning of 1914 more than forty out of the fifty year name by moltke have pass by and the situation have undergo no material change the irreconcilability of france write the late imperial chancellor of germany be a factor that we must reckon with in we political calculation it seem to I weakness to entertain the hope of a real and sincere reconciliation with france so long as we have no intention of give up alsace-lorraine and there be no such intention in germany -lrb- 1 -rrb- the annexation of two small province have thus make a permanent breach between two great nation a breach which have poison the whole of european policy during the past half century which have widen until it have split europe into two huge armed camp and which have at last involve the entire world in one of the most terrible calamity that mankind have ever know -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ von bülow p 69 -rrb- why do bismarck annex alsace-lorraine to strengthen he say the german frontier against france but there be another reason fear of france have bring the southern state into the empire fear of france should keep they there the permanent hostility of france be necessary to assure the continuance of prussium 's position as the supreme military power in germany and so the plundered province become the very corner-stone of the german imperial system there be surely something very strange about all this why should it be necessary to retain the loyalty of nearly half germany by what practically amount to terrorisation the answer be that germany be not a single national state but a number of _ dynastic _ state federate together under the control of one predominant partner in other word the problem of alsace-lorraine have lead we to the consideration of the second flaw in the development of the national idea in germany the union of italy mean a clean sweep of all the old dynastic frontier and state which have strangle the country for so long the union of germany on the contrary rivet these obsolete chain still more firmly than ever on the country 's limb bismarck claim that this be necessary inasmuch as the german unlike all other nation be more alive to dynastic than to national loyalty that in short germany be not really ready in 1870 for true unity -lrb- 1 -rrb- the chief reason however for the retention of the old frontier be that they suit the aim of prussium the reformer of 1848 as professor erich marck somewhat naïvely say have want to place prussium at the head but only as the servant of the nation prussium be also to cease to be a state by itself a power on its own account she be to create the nation 's ideal -- complete unity -- and then to merge herself in the nation but prussium would not and could not do this she be far too great a power herself _ she could very well rule germany but not serve _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- both germany and italy at first play with the idea of a confederation but each be eventually force to look to one of its exist state to give it the unity it desire there be only one possible choice for each : for germany prussium for italy piedmont but while piedmont be content to serve prussium be too proud to do anything but rule the dynastic state frontier be therefore retain because prussium refuse to sacrifice she own state frontier the unification of germany in short be a episode in the gradual expansion of the prussian dynastic state which have begin far away back in the thirteenth century -lrb- 3 -rrb- it assume the air of a national movement because prussium cleverly avail herself of the prevail nationalistic sentiment for she own end the german empire be therefore something unique in the annals of the world it be at once a nation-state like italy france and great britain and also a military empire like rome under augustus europe under napoleon austrium under joseph ii _ ie _ a state in which the territory that command the army hold political sway over the rest of the country it be not mere accident of geographical proximity or even the kinship between austrian and german which have lead to the long and unshakable alliance of germany with the hapsburg dominion they be associate by common political interest and by similarity of political structure each stand for the supremacy of one dynastic state over a number of subordinate state or nationality -lrb- footnote 1 : the chapter entitle dynasty and stock in the _ reflection _ should be carefully study on this point bismarck be obviously uncomfortable about the old frontier -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ lecture on the history of the nineteenth century _ p 104 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : see chap iii p 95 -rrb- she common nationality lead we to forget that the german empire should more rightly be call the prussian empire -lrb- 1 -rrb- nor be there any reason at all why the empire of prussium should stop its process of expansion at the national boundary it have indeed already step beyond they into poland in the east into denmark in the north into france in the west why should not the process be carry farther still and germany become in europe nay in the world what prussium be in germany by preserve she identity as a state and by establish she hegemony prussium in the name of the national idea of germany have be able to spread she own ideal throughout the empire in other word to undertake that prussianisation of germany which be the most striking fact in she history since 1870 piedmont be swallow up in italy germany have be swallow up in prussium she have become the sharer of she victory and the accomplice of she crime and so under the tutelage of the spirit of bismarck the docile german people have adopt the prussian faith and the policy of aggression and conquest once enter upon there be no draw back bismarck feed the youthful nation upon a diet of blood and iron and its appetite have grow by what it feed on the success of 1870 turn the nation 's head the annexation of alsace-lorraine give it the first taste of conquest germany begin to imagine that german character and german culture possess some magical and unique quality which would alone account for this success dream of a european empire of infinite expansion of world-power float before the national consciousness the german people be no longer content to use mazzinus 's word to elaborate and express they idea to contribute they stone also to the pyramid of history they now crave to impose they idea upon the world at large and to place they stone on the top of the pyramid modern germany be a example of nationalism go wrong just as napoleon be a example of democratic individualism go wrong the man of destiny have be follow by the nation of destiny the super-man by the super-nation both have have to face a world in arm array against they -lrb- footnote 1 : german writer be fond of call it prussia-germany -lrb- _ preussen-deutschland _ -rrb- a phrase of treitschke 's -rrb- thus the national idea in germany have be cramped contorted and pervert by the prussian system and the dynastic frontier have the dream of 1848 be realize there might have be no franco-german war no alsace-lorraine question no war of 1914 and what of we third test of nationhood do the people of germany feel that they government adequately express they general will that it be truly representative by which be not necessarily mean that it be democratic in form -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be no doubt that in 1848 the educate class of germany do actually desire a democratic form of polity in that year germany be as liberal as italy she also have rising in almost every state not exclude prussium itself which be everywhere answer with promise of a constitution but when reaction come in germany as in italy prussium do not like piedmont stand out for freedom and make itself the model state of germany on the contrary she revert to she old military absolutism at the first opportunity and so the dream of german liberty like the dream of complete german unity disappear before the stern necessity of accept the supremacy of a politically reactionary state and the prussianisation which follow do much to neutralise altogether the liberalise influence of the south it be therefore possible to maintain that the political institution of germany have come to represent more and more the genius and will of the population the germany of the twentieth century maintain a recent writer be not two but one the current have mingle they water and the prussian torrent now have the depth and volume of the whole main-stream of german thought -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ eg _ russium have a representative government in this sense though she be without representative institution in the democratic sense -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ round table _ sept 1914 p 628 -rrb- it may be so it may be that the germany of goethe schiller and beethoven have be absorb by the germany of bismarck moltke and roon but it must not be forget at the same time that since they day yet another germany have come into be the germany of marx engel and bebel a germany which be represent by more than a third of the voter in the empire the old line of cleavage have barely close up when a new and much more fundamental schism appear in the state that between imperialism and social democracy the existence of this tremendous revolutionary force in germany determine to overthrow the militarist _ régime _ of prussium and to re-establish the state on a democratic basis be a unanswerable proof that the government of the empire be not in any true sense representative prussium have in this direction also impede the development of the national idea and give mechanical unity at the expense of spiritual unity it have create a vast political party of irreconcilable in the country man who have be lead to feel that they have neither part nor promise in the national life and who therefore elect to stand outside it we social democratic party write von bülow lack a national basis it will have nothing to do with german patriotic memory which bear a monarchical and military character it be not like the french and italian party a precipitate of the process of national historical development but since its begin it have be in determine opposition to we past history as a nation it have place itself outside we national life -lrb- 1 -rrb- and again : in the german empire prussium be the leading state the social democratic party be the antithesis of the prussian state -lrb- 2 -rrb- nevertheless the imperial government not find it possible to suppress the social democrat do its best to employ they for its own end it use they in fact as it use irreconcilable france namely for the purpose of terrorisation since it have discover that the spectre of socialism be as effective to keep the middle class loyal as the spectre of french revenge be to keep the southern state loyal but it also hope in time to eradicate socialism from the state a vigorous national policy prince von bülow declare to be the true remedy against the social democratic movement and though he make no specific mention of war it be obvious that a war like that in which germany be at present engage be the most vigorous form a national policy could possibly take be the outbreak of war last August in part occasion by the desire on the side of the german government to win over the worker of germany if so it have yet another spectre ready to its hand for the purpose -- the spectre of russium -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ p 184 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ibid _ p 186 -rrb- in any case with germany in this condition europe could hardly have avoid a great war at some time or other and 1914 follow naturally almost inevitably from 1870 the unification of 1870 be far from complete the german national idea still await development in the direction of racial unity political unity and constitutional freedom it be prussium that bar the way in all these direction prussium which in itself not a nation but a military bureaucracy a survival of the old territorial dynastic principle which the world have largely outgrow have stamp its character and system upon the german people prussium say one of its apologist have put a iron girdle round the whole of german life -lrb- 1 -rrb- but in the end life prove itself stronger than iron band germany be bind to make another attempt to reach complete nationhood she be do so now prussium fight for conquest for world-power and make docile germany imagine that she be fight for these also but what germany be really fight for blindly and gropingly be freedom and unity she have indeed to hack she way through but it be not as she suppose hostile europe which hem she in and keep she from she place in the sun it be the prussian girdle and the prussian chain which hamper the free movement of she limb and hold she close prisoner in the shadow of the hohenzollern castle the overthrow of prussium mean the release of germany and france who give germany greatness in 1870 may with the help of the ally be able in the near future to give she a even greater gift the gift of liberty -lrb- footnote 1 : _ lecture on the history of the nineteenth century _ p 106 -rrb- § 7 _ the map of europe 1814-1914 _ -- we have now watch the national idea at work in the three western country of that central european area which the congress of vienna leave unsettled in 1814 and in a later chapter we shall see the same principle act in the two great division of south-east europe austria-hungary and the balkan peninsula let we then use this opportunity to pause for a moment take a general survey of the map and consider in broad outline what have actually be accomplish during the past century and what still remain to do from 1814 to 1848 exhaust by the effort of the revolutionary and napoleonic war and disillusion by reactionary statesmanship the larger nation slumber : but belgium and greece secure they present liberty and outside europe the national movement spread throughout the south american continent then come 1848 the wonderful year of modern history there be no more remarkable example in history of the contagious quality of idea than the sudden spread of revolutionary excitement through europe in 1848 in the course of a few week the established order seem everywhere to be crumble to piece the revolution begin in palermo cross the strait of messina and pass in successive wave of convulsion through central italy to paris vienna milan and berlin it have often be remark that the latin race be of all the people of europe most prone to revolution but this proposition do not hold good in 1848 the czech in bohemia the magyar in hungary the german in austrium rise against the paralyse encumbrance of the hapsburg autocracy the southern slav dream of a illyrian kingdom the german of a unite germany the bohemian of a union of all the slavonic people of europe the authority of the austrian empire the pivot of the european autocracy have never be so rudely challenge and if the crown succeed in recover its shattered authority it be due to the dumb and unintelligent loyalty of its slavonic troops -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : hal fisher _ the republican tradition in europe _ p 193 -rrb- many of these rising be doom to failure but between 1848 and 1871 the alien government in the italian peninsula be abolish make way for a unitary government in the form of a constitutional monarchy which embrace with small exception the whole of the italian population of europe in 1871 after three successful war in seven year against denmark austrium and france a federal government be establish in germany with the kingdom of prussium as its leading state and the king of prussium as its monarch with the title of german emperor this be a step forward though the new germany be neither a unitary nor a constitutional state the austrian territory have also come in for they share of the general ferment and franci joseph come to the throne in 1848 amid the uprising of he subject people but these be successfully tide over though the hungarian portion of the austrian dominion achieve national recognition and institution in 1867

freedom from the joint tyranny of vienna and budapest russium have not yet solve the problem of finland nor england the problem of ireland the turk still occupy constantinople and finally the

each of which have a court and a dynasty and sovereign prerogative of its own in 1789 at the outbreak of the french revolution there be 360 of these state of every sort and size and variety some be

western europe be tire after the great napoleonic struggle and be not in a mood for big design to all outward appearance germany seem to have relapse after the thrill and glamour of the war of

these quality together with a certain clumsiness and helplessness due to they complete inexperience of the responsibility of a larger citizenship which go far to explain the subsequent history of germany but in the evil day after the congress of vienna the _ idea _ of german unity live on and form a constant theme of discussion and speculation like the idea of the unity of poland and of the southern slav in the present generation the stir memory of the great revolution be like a constant refrain at the back of man 's mind all through that dreary time in 1830 when the french establish a liberal monarchy and the belgian free themselves from the unwelcome supremacy of holland there be much excitement throughout germany but nothing serious occur until 1848 when the liberal and nationalist movement which have be gather force throughout the educate class of western europe for a generation at length come to a head the whole of germany be in a ferment a strong republican movement manifest itself and in almost every one of the many capital city there be a rise with a demand for a free constitution and parliamentary government and for the consolidation of german national unity in accordance with the same democratic ideal the prince have no alternative but to give way and as a result local constitution be grant and a national parliament be summon to meet at frankfurt to draw up a national german constitution on democratic line the task before the frankfurt parliament be similar to that which have confront british statesman several time during the last century in frame the dominion of canada the commonwealth of australium and the union of south africa -- the task of welding a number of separate state government with the free consent of they population into a homogeneous and democratic central authority but in the case of a old and still largely feudal country like germany the task be infinitely more difficult for it could not be successful without a levelling-up of the political ideal of the backward state such as prussium and the elimination of many ancient association and dynastic interest the frankfurt constitution do actually come into be and it be nobly plan it guarantee to every german citizen the rights of civil liberty equality before the law and responsible parliamentary government both central and local but the mind of the german nation be not yet equal to its new responsibility the frankfurt parliament like the first russian duma be out of touch with reality it waste precious time on the discussion of abstract question of principle and fail to meet the practical need of the moment while it sit and talk the enthusiasm which have create it gradually evaporate meanwhile the more reactionary state and the prince whose prerogative be endanger become more and more openly hostile all through 1849 the parliament be lose member by defection and by the end of the year its influence have sink to vanish point the movement which collapse thus ignominiously be not a popular agitation in the english sense of the term : like other movement of its generation it spring not from the people but from the well-to-do and its strength lay among the professional and educate class the frankfurt parliament be a predominantly middle-class assembly : lawyer and professor always a important element in german national life be strongly represent in it and largely responsible for its failure its collapse be a bitter disappointment and drive many of its leader into exile abroad more particularly to the united state where some of they such as carl schurz live to play a noteworthy part under more democratic political institution after the failure of the frankfurt constitution it slowly become clear to far-sighted german that there be only one way in which german unity could come about if unlike the separate province of canada and south africa the german state would not voluntarily sink they identity in a larger whole unity could only come through they acceptance of the supremacy of one of the exist state there be only two possible candidate for the supremacy austrium and prussium austrium be still at that time as she have be for century in a position of undisputed headship but she german policy be always hamper because she have also to consider she non-german subject prussia a younger and more homogeneous state with a better organise administration and a better disciplined people be prepare to assert herself in 1862 at a moment when liberalism be gather strength in prussium count bismarck become chief minister of the prussian crown and the dominate force in prussian policy bismarck be a conservative and a reactionary wholly out of sympathy with the ideal of 1848 he immediate object be to secure the supremacy of prussium among the german state in the very first month of he leadership he make it clear in a famous sentence by what method he hope to achieve he end the great question be to be settle he tell the prussian diet with a scornful hit at the confederation not by speech and majority resolution but by blood and iron he be not long in translate word into action in 1864 the king of denmark die and difficulty at once arise as to the succession to the duchy of schleswig and holstein which still belong to the german confederation austrium and prussium intervene jointly in the name of the confederation and as a result the duchy be separate from denmark schleswig be administer by austrium and holstein by prussium the object of this rather clumsy plan which originate with bismarck be to create difficulty which would enable he to pick a quarrel with austrium in 1866 this maneuver prove successful bismarck goad austrium into war and succeed after a six week ' campaign in expel she from the german state system follow this up by round off she own dominion with the annexation of a number of the smaller pro-austrian state amongst they the kingdom of hanover he victory also have the effect of completely check the grow agitation for the establishment of responsible government in prussium -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : on this point see bismarck 's _ recollection _ and the good short account in powicke 's _ bismarck _ -rrb- have make prussium supreme in germany bismarck be now in a position to solve the problem of german unity he resolve to employ the same well-tried method in 1870 the somewhat high-handed manner of napoleon iii make it possible for he to bring about a war between the german state and france in which germany under prussian leadership be completely victorious in the flush of they success after the capture of pari in January 1871 the lesser state of germany agree to enter into a federal union under prussian supremacy and to accept the king of prussium as its head with the title of emperor thus at length germany become a national state with a national constitution the term empire be mislead for to english ear it suggest the government of dependency germany be not a empire in that sense : she be a federation like the united state and switzerland of independent state which have agree to merge some of they prerogative notably the conduct of foreign affair and of defense in a central authority since some of these independent state be and still be monarchy a higher title have to be provide for the chief of the federation a ace as it be be need to trump the king after much deliberation the title emperor be agree upon but it be noteworthy that the kaiser be not the emperor of germany : he bear the more non-committal title of german emperor the german imperial constitution devise by bismarck in 1871 fall far short of the frankfurt experiment of 1848 it do indeed provide for the creation of a reichstag or imperial parliament elect by all male citizen over twenty-five but the reichstag can neither initiate legislation nor secure the appointment or dismissal of minister in the absence of ministerial responsibility to parliament which be the mainspring of we english constitutional system the reichstag might be describe as little more than a advisory body arm with the power of veto like the english parliament in the day of charle i 's ship-money the reichstag could in the last resort refuse supplies and so bring the machinery of government to a standstill but this situation have never yet arise or seem likely to arise the government have ride the reichstag with a strong hand turn awkward corner by concession to the various group in turn and the reichstag have respond to this treatment bismarck take he majority where he could get they and prince bülow 's book contain some illuminating page about the clever method which that statesman adopt to manage he parliament above the reichstag be the bundesrat or federal council on which all the federated state be represent prussium have seventeen member as against forty-two from the other state the bundesrat sit in secret its member be select by the different state government and vote accord to instruction receive all bill originate in the bundesrat before they be submit to the reichstag and be re-submitted to the bundesrat to be pass or veto after alteration in the reichstag the twenty-six member of the german federation represent in the bundesrat comprise four kingdom -lrb- prussium bavarium würtemberg and saxony -rrb- a number of grand duchy and smaller ducal state three free city -lrb- hamburg lübeck and breman -rrb- and the imperial territory of alsace-lorraine all these -lrb- except the last name -rrb- preserve they own local parliament and institution and the second largest bavarium even preserve in peace-time like the british self-governing dominion she own military organization and have also she own postal system but prussium in size influence and military strength be by far the most important and for practical purpose she power preponderate over that of all the other state combine the real control of legislation naturally lie with the state which control two-fifth of the vote in the bundesrat where legislation be initiate and can be veto it be wield by the kaiser as king of prussium and by he imperial chancellor president of the bundesrat and always a prussian minister the imperial chancellor who be the only imperial minister be choose by the kaiser and be responsible to he alone : he countersign all the kaiser 's order and edict and have the function it may be add of explain away he indiscretion it be inevitable under these circumstance that the policy and legislation of the central government should largely reflect prussian view and ideal on the other hand the temper of the rest of germany must always be keep in mind as prince büllow the late imperial chancellor say : if the empire be govern without reference to prussia ill-will towards the empire will grow in that country if prussium be govern without reference to the empire then there be the danger that mistrust and dislike of the leading state will gain ground in non-prussian germany the art of govern in we country will always have to be direct chiefly towards maintain the harmony between germany and prussium in the spirit as well as in the letter -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ pp 191-192 -rrb- why should the government of germany be such a art and why should there be any difficulty in maintain a harmonious spirit between prussium and non-prussian germany to answer these question we must widen the scope of we inquiry so far we have consider only the growth and development of the german state it be now time to turn from the german state to the german people § 2 _ the real germany _ -- the difficulty of establish german unity have lie in the fact that there have really always be two germany different in history in temper in ideal and in they stage of development in civilisation there have be prussium or north-eastern germany and there have be the real germany the germany of the south and west it be only since 1870 and especially within the reign of the present kaiser that through education and common experience the two have become fuse into one but even now beneath the uniform surface of german life and public opinion there be a great inner distinction let we take what we have call the real germany first this germany the germany of the rhine country of frankfurt and heidelberg and cologne and nüremberg be the germany which so many englishman know and admire this germany be a integral part of the civilisation of western europe and be closely akin to ourselves it have grow and develop alongside with france and the netherland and england sharing in all the great spiritual and social movement of the west it have pass with they through the middle age the revival of learn the reformation and the long struggle against the domination of france its famous city with they cathedral and town hall breathe the same proud free municipal spirit as those of they great neighbor in the netherland ghent antwerp louvain bruge ypre and the rest its scholar and teacher poet painter and musician from luther to goethe have make they special german contribution to the civilised life of the west -- a contribution as great and as unique as that of renaissance italy or elizabethan england its people be very similar in character to they neighbor of kindred stock as industrious as the dutch as persevere as the scotch as steady and good-hearted as the english good worker good citizen devote in they family relation they have find it easy to live at peace and on a good understanding with they neighbor and when they have migrate abroad they have by common confession make the best of settler both in the united state and in the british dominion yet they have develop certain characteristic quality in they social and political life which distinguish they sharply from they western neighbor history which have deprive they until recently of a wider citizenship have leave they timid docile dreamy and unpractical in just that sphere of action where englishman have learn for century to think and to act for themselves patriotism with englishman be a instinct we do not much care to wave flag or make speech or sing song about it : we assume it as the permanent background of we national life and we national consciousness with the german this be not so in germany partly owe to german history partly owe to the constitution of the german mind patriotism be not a instinct but a _ idea _ now idea do not grow up in man 's mind by a natural process they have to be implant the german have need to be _ teach _ to be patriotic the maker of german patriotism a century ago be teacher and philosopher they do not simply appeal to they patriotic instinct as englishman would have do : they argue the point and _ prove _ that germany be worth fight for : they found a school of patriotic german philosophy there be few more curious document in history or more instructive for the light they shed on future event than the famous _ speech to the german nation _ address to he fellow-countryman by the philosopher fichte in 1808 when he country be under the heel of napoleon they be not speech at all but philosophical lucubration discuss in abstract term the whole subject of the nature of patriotism and of germany 's right to exist as a nation one argument for instance on which he lay great stress be that germany be mark out to be a great political power because of the peculiar excellence of the german language which he show to he satisfaction to be superior to french italian and other latin language again he point out that there be no word in the german language for character -lrb- _ karakter _ -rrb- a word borrow from the greek the reason be he explain that there be no need for one because to have character and to be german be the same thing -- a curious foretaste of the german arrogance of to-day yet these speech which issue in england at such a crisis would have find no reader reverberate through germany and help to create the self-confident spirit which free she from the invader then as now under the inspiration of idea which they have accept from professor and philosopher german fight for the german language and for german culture but whereas in 1814 they fight to preserve they in 1914 they be fight to impose they just as patriotism in germany be wholly different from what it be in england so also be democracy and all those element in the national life which feed and sustain it british democracy do not depend upon we popular franchise or on any legal rights or enactment it depend upon the free spirit and self-respect of the british people we have be accustom for century to the unrestrained discussion of public affair and we treat we governor as be in fact as they be in name we minister or servant there be a force call public opinion which slow though it may be to assert itself british statesman have be teach by experience to respect it be as true of british as it be of american democracy that you can fool half the people all the time and you can fool all the people half the time but you can not fool all the people all the time but the german people as a people lack this irreplaceable heritage of political self-respect it have never yet dare to tread the path of democracy without lead string it have not yet learn to think for itself in politics or form the habit of free discussion and practical criticism of public affair this be the vital fact which must be bear in mind in all comparison between german and british democracy the german have a parliament elect by universal male suffrage but this parliament be powerless to control policy because the nation behind it do not give it sufficient support it be because of the absence of the drive force of a public opinion in germany that the german people submit complacently to the infringement on political liberty which form part of the normal _ régime _ of german life -- the domineering arrogance of officer and official the restraint upon the press and the shameless manufacture of news and inspiration of opinion from official source the control of the university the school and the public service by the state in the interest of orthodox political opinion and the ridiculous law which have send editor and cartoonist to prison in score for criticise the behavior and utterance of the emperor or the crown prince in england and in america underground attempt be sometimes make to injure the career of man whose opinion be consider dangerous by those who employ they in germany such interference with freedom of political thought be not the exception : it have become the rule no man can make a successful career in the public service -lrb- and education be a public service -rrb- unless he be consider politically orthodox -lrb- _ gesinnungstüchtig _ -rrb- and orthodoxy do not simply mean abstention from damaging criticism or dangerous opinion : it mean in practice deference to the opinion of those who know better that be to the clique of prussian general and bureaucrat who together with the kaiser control the policy of the country british reader who do not know germany may think the foregoing indictment of german political incapacity severe it be not so severe as prince büllow 's the portion of the late imperial chancellor 's book which deal with domestic policy open with these crush sentence : the history of we home policy with the exception of a few bright spot be a history of political mistake despite the abundance of merit and great quality with which the german nation be endowed political talent have be deny it we be not a political people a page or two later he go even further and quote with approval a dictum that the german be political donkey that a modern statesman should think this of he fellow-countryman be remarkable enough that he should say it outright be a still more remarkable proof of he unshakeable belief in they submissiveness therein lie the whole tragedy of the present situation the german people so kindly and alas so docile be suffer not for its sin but for its deficiency not for its own characteristic act or natural ambition but for what it have too tamely allow other prussian statesman and soldier with alien ideal and a alien temper to foist upon it until it have become a integral part of its natural life and consciousness germany have be indoctrinate and prussianise not only into acquiescence but into sympathy with the policy of its ruler § 3 _ prussium _ -- this bring we to the consideration of the second and more powerful of the two germany -- namely prussium in order to understand prussium and the prussian spirit we must plunge ourselves into a atmosphere wholly different from that of the germany that have just be describe the very name of the two country mark the measure of the difference germany mean the country of the german as england mean the country of the english but the name prussium commemorate the subjugation and extinction by german conqueror and crusader from the west of the prussian or bo-russian a tribe akin to the lett and lithuanian the old duchy of prussium which now form the province of east and west prussium at the extreme north-east of the present german empire consist of heathen land colonise or conquer between the thirteenth and sixteenth century by a great religious and military organization know as the knight of the teutonic order while southern and western germany be pass with the rest of western europe through the transition between mediaeval and modern europe what be now north-eastern germany be still in a wholly primitive stage of development and the knight of the teutonic order with crusading fervor be spread christianity and german culture by force of arm convert or repel the slavonic population and settle german colonist in the territory thus reclaim for civilisation the great british admirer of prussium thoma carlyle in the first volume of he _ frederick the great _ give a vivid account of they activity in they fort or burg of wood and stone and help we to realize what memory lie behind the struggle between german and slav to-day and why the word petersburg have become so odious to the russian as the name of they capital the teutsch ritter build a burg for headquarters spread themselves this way and that and begin they great task the prussian be a fierce fight people fanatically anti-christian : the teutsch ritter have a perilous never-resting time of it they build and burnt innumerable stockade for and against : build wooden fort which be now stone town they fight much and prevalently gallop desperately to and fro ever on the alert how many burg of wood and stone they build in different part what revolt surprisal furious fight in woody boggy place they have no man count they life read in dryasdust 's newest chaotic book -lrb- which be of endless length among other ill quality -rrb- be like a dim nightmare of unintelligible march and fight : one feel as if the mere amount of gallop they have would have carry the order several time round the globe but always some preach by zealous monk accompany the chivalrous fighting and colonist come in from germany trickle in or at time streaming victorious ritterdom offer term to the beaten heathen term not of tolerant nature but which will be punctually keep by ritterdom here we see the strange stern medieval crusading atmosphere which lie behind the unpleasant combination so familiar to we to-day in france and belgium of uhlan and religion of culture and violence of germanisation and devastation when we hear the german professor of to-day preaching of the spread of german culture by the german arm and when we feel disgust at the exaggerated religious phraseology which pervade the kaiser 's oratory and seem to accord so ill with he policy and ambition we must remember the peculiar origin of the prussian state and how comparatively recent those origin be i have once before have occasion say the kaiser at marienburg in east prussium on June 5 1902 to say in this place how marienburg this unique eastern bulwark the point of departure for the culture of the land east of the vistulum will always be a symbol for we german mission there be work for we again to-day polish arrogance wish to lay hand on germanism and i be constrain to call my people to the defense of its national possession here in marienburg i proclaim that i expect all the brother of the order of st john to be at my service when i call upon they to protect german way and german custom the kaiser 's crusade appeal be not hypocritical or consciously insincere : they be simply many century out of date -- a grotesque medley of medieval romanticism and royal megalomania what be possible for the warrior knight in north-east germany five or six century ago be a tragic absurdity and a outrageous crime to-day among a spirited and sensitive people like the pole -- still more so in a highly civilised national state such as belgium or france it be a absurdity that only a theatrical monarch could conceive and a crime that only a military autocracy could attempt to enforce in the sixteenth century the reformation spread throughout the north of europe undermine the basis of the teutonic order the grand master of the time transform himself into a lutheran prince hold the hereditary duchy of prussium as a vassal of the king of the neighbouring slavonic state of poland in 1611 the duchy be amalgamate with the territory of brandenburg farther west and in 1647 the enlarged prussian territory win they emancipation from poland prussium now become a distinct state essentially german in character -lrb- as oppose to the pole and lithuanian on its eastern border -rrb- but still remain for a time outside the community of the other german state the union between prussium and brandenburg have bring prussium under the rule of the house of hohenzollern which although originally a south german family have bear rule in brandenburg since 1415 under the hohenzollern prussia rapidly increase in territory and influence until in 1701 the ruler of the day the grandfather of frederick the great take on himself the title of king under frederick the great prussium 's career of conquest and aggrandisement continue seize a convenient opportunity he invade and annex the austrian province of silesium and later join with austrium and russium in promote the shameful partition of poland the old conquering and civilise policy of the teutonic knight be continue but under new condition and in a brutal and cynical spirit which render it impossible of success the surest means of give this oppressed nation better idea and moral write frederick the great in word quote with approval by prince bülow will always be gradually to get they to intermarry with german even if at first it be only two or three of they in every village this spirit in prussian policy may have extinguish the ancient prussian but it have not yet begin to germanise the pole and have go far to de-germanise the alsatian but it explain the utterance and justify the sincerity of those who believe that to-day as in the early day of she history prussium be fight on behalf of culture prussium remain to-day what she have be for the last two century a aggressive military monarchy prussium attain she greatness say prince bülow as a country of soldier and official and as such she be able to accomplish the work of german union to this day she be still in all essential a state of soldier and official power rest in the hand of the monarch and of a bureaucracy of military and civil official responsible to he alone and traditionally and fanatically loyal to the monarch who be before all thing they war lord the prussian outlook be so foreign to western habit of thought that it be well that we should try to understand it at its best prussium proper have not be rich like the rest of germany in poet and imaginative writer but she be fortunate to-day in possess in the greatest living greek scholar professor von wilamowitz-moellendorff a man who by birth and breeding be able to put the highest interpretation upon the aim and spirit of the prussian state to wilamowitz prussium be not only nearer and dearer than athen she be better and more advanced at the close of a wonderful address on the glory of the athenian empire in which he have employ all the resource of he wide learning to paint a picture of ancient greece at she best wilamowitz break into this impassioned peroration : but one element in life the best of all ye lack noble burgher of athen you sage tell we of that highest love which free from all bodily entanglement spend itself on institution on law on idea we prussian a rough much-enduring tribe of northerner may be compacted of harder stuff but we believe that love be on a higher level when the fullest devotion to a institution and a idea be inseparably link with a entirely personal devotion to a human being and at least we know how warm such a love can make a loyal heart when we child have scarce learn to fold they hand before god we set a picture before they we teach they to recognize the noble feature we tell they ` this be we good king ' we young man when they be of age to bear arm look with joy and pride on the trim garb of war and say ' i go in the king 's coat ' and when the nation assemble to a common political celebration the occasion be no feast of the constitution no day of the bastille no panathenaic festival it be then that we bow in reverence and loyalty before he who have allow we to see with we own eye that for which we father dream and yearn before he who ever extend the bound of the kingdom in freedom prosperity and righteousness before he majesty the emperor and king -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ speech and lecture _ 3rd edition berlin 1913 p 65 the good king refer to be the old emperor william as the address date from 1877 -rrb- here far better express than in the kaiser 's speech we see the spirit of the prussian junker at its best it be narrow old-fashioned and to democratic ear almost grotesque yet if it survive uncorrupted by the danger to which progress always expose a military caste it will not be easy either to crush by defeat or to transform by humiliation it be among the old prussian nobility and the large land proprietor in the original prussian province who have come to be know as the junker that this spirit prevail they stand for the old stern repressive military discipline and unchanging conservatism in its extremest form regard with well-founded suspicion and misgiving symptom of development in any direction whatsoever no party in germany acquiesce more unwillingly in the change necessitate by she commercial and industrial development even they militarism stop short at the army and it require a substantial increase in the protective tariff safeguard they agricultural interest to purchase they reluctant adhesion to the kaiser 's policy of naval expansion even now the german navy the pride of the commercial and industrial class throughout the german empire be regard by they with uneasy suspicion as a parvenu service in which the old prussian influence count for less in promotion than technical skill and practical efficiency the institution of the prussian state represent the spirit of its ruling caste if the german empire be not democratic prussium lag far behind it the electoral system in use for the prussian lower house be too complicate to explain here its injustice may be gauge from the fact that in 1900 the social democrat who actually poll a majority of the vote secure seven seat out of nearly 400 the whole spirit and practice of the government be inimical to inborn british conception of civil liberty and personal rights there be one law and code of conduct for officer and another for civilian and woe betide the civilian who resist the military pretension the incident at zabern in alsace in 1913 be still fresh in public memory reinforce by evidence of a similar spirit in german military proclamation in france and belgium but it be important to realize that these incident be not exceptional outburst but common prussian practice uphold as the sequel to the zabern event prove by the highest authority prussium and through prussium germany be in effect rule in accordance with the wish of the official caste : and short of a popular rise nothing but defeat can dethrone it any one who have any familiarity at all with we officer and general say a authoritative german writer in word that we may hope will be prophetic know that it would take another sedan inflict on we instead of by we before they would acquiesce in the control of the army by the german parliament -lrb- 1 -rrb- no clearer statement could be give as to where the real power lie in germany and how stern will be the task of displace it -lrb- footnote 1 : professor delbrück -lrb- who succeed to the chair of history in berlin hold so long by treitschke -rrb- in a book publish early in 1914 -lrb- _ government and the popular will _ p 136 -rrb- -rrb- the foreign policy of prussium have reflect the same domineering spirit its object have be the increase of its power and territory by conquest or cunning : and by the successful prosecution of this policy it have extend prussian authority and prussian influence over a large part of western germany the best way of illustrate this will be to quote a passage from the _ recollection of prince bismarck _ who direct prussian policy from 1862 to 1890 in 1864 trouble arise as to the succession to the duchy of schleswig and holstein on the danish border prussium have no claim whatever to the duchy but she covet holstein because it would give she a western sea-board with the result that we all know bismarck describe the argument which he use to persuade he royal master to assert he claim i remind he he write that each of he immediate predecessor have win a addition to the monarchy : he then go through the history of the six previous reign and end by encourage king william to be worthy of he ancestor he advice as we have see be successfully adopt -lrb- illustration : prussium since the accession of frederick the great -rrb- the conquest of france in 1870 by means of the military power of germany under prussian leadership make prussium supreme in germany and the german army supreme in central europe the treaty of frankfurt in may 1871 by which the new french republic cede to the german empire the two french province of alsace and lorraine mark the opening of a new epoch in european history the period of the armed peace which end in 1914 it mark also the opening of a new epoch in germany some feature of which we must now examine § 4 _ germany since 1870 _ -- german history from 1871 to 1914 fall into two well-defined period during the first period from 1871 to 1888 germany be rule by she imperial chancellor prince bismarck but the accession of the present kaiser lead to a change not in the letter but in the spirit of the new constitution and since 1890 when william ii drop the pilot and select a more amenable successor the real control of policy have lie with the emperor the relation between prince bismarck and the old emperor who be over ninety when he die in 1888 form a touching passage in modern history although he grandson have publicly claim for he a peculiar measure of divine inspiration he strength lay in he implicit confidence in he great minister bismarck 's attitude to he as describe in he _ memoirs _ be rather like that of a old family retainer who have earn by long and faithful service the right to assert he view and to pit he judgment against he master 's he one formidable antagonist be the empress and long experience he tell we enable he to judge whether difficulty in persuade the old kaiser to adopt a give line of policy be due to he own judgment or conceive in the interest of domestic peace the faithful servant have he own appropriate method of win he way in either case but with the new kaiser the old minister 's astuteness avail nothing and the story of bismarck 's curt dismissal after thirty-eight year of continuous service from the post which he have create for himself illustrate the danger of frame a constitution to meet a particular temporary situation bismarck put out of action by he own machinery retire growl to he country seat and live to see the reversal of he foreign policy and the exposure of germany through the franco-russian alliance to the one danger he always dread a attack on both flank like germany 's present ruler bismarck be not a scrupulous man but unlike they he be shrewd and far-sighted and understand the statesman and the people with whom he have to deal the main object of he foreign policy be to preserve the prestige of the german army as the chief instrument of power in central europe and to allow the new germany after three war in seven year time to develop in peace and to consolidate she position as one of the great power the situation be not a easy one for germany 's rapid rise to power and the method by which she have acquire it have not make she popular bismarck 's foreign policy be defensive throughout and he pursue it along two line he seek to strengthen germany by alliance and to weaken she rival by embroil they with one another the great fruit of he policy be the formation complete in 1882 of the triple alliance between germany austria-hungary and italy there be nothing sentimental about the triple alliance the italian hate the austrian whom they drive out of venice as recently as 1866 while neither the german austrian nor the other race in the dual monarchy have any love lose for the prussian but bismarck decide that this combination be the safest in germany 's interest : so he set to work to play upon austrium 's fear of russium and to embroil italy with france in north africa and he maneuver be duly reward but this be not sufficient face with the implacable hostility of france on account of the lost province bismarck saw danger of trouble from a french coalition with the two remain great power britain and russium bismarck never like england but he never make he successor ' mistake of despise she he cultivate good relation but he reject the idea of a alliance because as he say the english constitution be not compatible with treaty of assure continuity in other word he fight shy of british democracy which he feel to be a incalculable factor this throw he back upon russium the relation between the german and the russian people have never be cordial but between the reactionary bureaucracy of the prussian and russian government there be a strong bond of mutual interest which bismarck exploit to the full both have popular movement to hold in check both have steal goods to guard in the shape of they polish possession and both have a interest in the preservation of reactionary institution the influence of prussium upon russium and of the efficient highly-organised relentless prussian machine upon the arbitrary tyrannical but far less efficient and inhuman bureaucracy of russium have be wholly sinister -lrb- 1 -rrb- both for russium and for europe bismarck 's object of course be not so much to keep down the russian revolutionary as to check the aspiration of the panslavist whose design for the liberation of the slav nationality as we now see they unfold threaten the stability both of prussium and of austria-hungary -lrb- footnote 1 : the same remark apply to the influence of germany on turkey -rrb- throughout the ` eighty bismarck succeed in keep on foot a secret understanding with russium how deeply he have implant the necessity of this policy in the mind of william i be bring home by the fact that it be the think uppermost in the old man 's mind as he lay on he deathbed never lose touch with the tsar whisper the old man to he grandson when he be almost too weak to speak there be no cause for quarrel the old emperor die in 1888 in 1890 the young emperor drop the pilot in the same year russium refuse to renew she secret treaty in 1891 the first franco-russian treaty be sign and the diplomatic supremacy of europe pass from the triple alliance to be share between the two oppose group with which we have be familiar in recent year the disappearance of prince bismarck mark the beginning of a new phase in german policy and in german life the younger generation which have come to maturity like the kaiser since 1870 have never know the old divide germany or realize the difficulty of she statesman every one wonder what use the young kaiser would make of the great army bequeath to he he be believe to be a firebrand few believe that imbue with prussian tradition he would keep the peace for twenty-five year fewer still that when he break it germany would have the second navy in the world but we be not now concern with the baffling personality of the kaiser himself what be important for we here be the general attitude of mind among the german public of the kaiser 's generation which have render possible the prosecution of the cherish idea of they ruler the school of thought which have be steadily gain force under official encouragement during the last twenty-five year be best sum up in the popular watchword germany 's place in the sun and world-policy -lrb- _ weltpolitik _ -rrb- these phrase embody for german who always tend to be abstract in they thinking not only a practical policy but a philosophy of human society and government this be not the place in which to analyze in detail the outlook upon life -lrb- _ weltanschauung _ -rrb- of the man in the street in modern germany it be a confused and patchwork philosophy draw consciously or unconsciously from many quarter -- from the old cosmopolitan tradition of german culture date from goethe and leasing from the brave and arrogant claim of fichte and the prophet and poet of the napoleonic era from the far-reaching influence of hegel and he idealisation of the prussian state from the reaction to realism in politics after 1848 from the prestige of bismarck and the deep impression make by the apparent success of he method and principle from the gifted prussian historian treitschke and sybel who set they own interpretation upon bismarck 's work and imprint it by speech and pen upon the mind of the german nation and from a hasty interpretation of the theory of writer like nietzsche and thoma carlyle with they exaltation of hero and superman they encouragement to live dangerously they admiration for will-power as against reason and feeling and they tirade against legal sham ballot-box democracy and flabby humanitarianism the practical object of the policy of _ weltpolitik _ can be simply state it be to extend to the other continent and to the world as a whole the power and the prestige secure for germany in europe by the work of bismarck when germany have win a mighty position on a level with the older great power say prince bülow the path of international politics lay open to she in the emperor william ii the nation find a clear-sighted strong-willed guide who lead they along the new road some such expansion of german influence be inevitable from the fact of she economic development since 1871 the population of the empire which in 1871 be 41000000 have now rise to 65000000 the resource of the country the neglect of which during the day of disunion have force so many german to emigrate for a livelihood have be rapidly and scientifically develop already in the ` eighty make in germany have become a familiar talisman and before the outbreak of the present war germany rank with the united state as the second greatest commercial power in the world simultaneously of course there have be a great change in the distribution of the population in the year 1850 65 per cent and in 1870 47 per cent of the work population be engage in agriculture by 1912 the proportion have sink to 286 per cent it be inevitable also that germany should share with the other great power in the work of colonial government the adjustment of the relation between the advanced and backward race of mankind be the greatest political task of we age it be a responsibility share jointly between all the civilised state and when in the ` eighty and ` ninety the vast region of africa be partition amongst they germany late in the field assert she claim and receive she share in the responsibility rapid economic development and a colonial empire -- what be there in these to cause hostility between germany and great britain the united state have pass through a similar development and have accept a similar extension of responsibility far outside they own continent america be a great a grow and a self-respecting power yet american see no ground for that inevitable conflict of interest between they country and great britain which form the theme of so many german book from prince bülow 's candid self-revelation down to less responsible writer like bernhardus the explanation lie in the nature of german thought and ambition when german speak of a place in the sun they be not think of the spread of german trade the success of german adventure or enterprise or of the achievement of german in distant land they be think of the extension of the german state british influence beyond the sea have be build up during the last four century by the character and achievement of british pioneer down street have seldom help often hinder and generally only ratify the accomplished fact of british settlement and influence that be not the prussian theory or the prussian method it be for the state to win the territory and then to set the people to work there on line lay down from above the individual englishman when he go out to colonise carry england with he as a part of he personality not so the german at least on the prussian theory the _ rare case _ supervene say prince bülow -lrb- 1 -rrb- of a instance typical of the building up of the british empire that the establishment of state rule _ follow and do not precede _ the task of colonise and civilisation the state itself on this theory have a civilise mission of expansion towards which it direct the activity of its citizen -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ 1st ed p 249 -rrb- under the influence of idea such as these germany since the accession of william ii have build a navy second to that of great britain alone what be the purpose of the building of the german navy the german official answer be that its purpose be the protection of german trade we be now vulnerable at sea say prince bülow we have entrust million to the ocean and with these million the weal and woe of many of we countryman if we have not in good time provide protection for they we should have be expose to the danger of have one day to look on defencelessly while we be deprive of they we should have be place in the position of be unable to employ and support a considerable number of we million of inhabitant at home the result would have be a economic crisis which might easily attain the proportion of a national catastrophe these word may yet prove prophetic but the catastrophe will not be the result of germany 's lack of a navy it will be the result of challenge the naval supremacy of great britain prince bülow 's argument assume as a basis the hostility of great britain this assumption as we know be unjustified and its persistence in the german mind can only be set down to a uneasy conscience the hard fact of the matter be that it be impossible for germany or for any other power successfully to defend she foreign trade in case of war with great britain no other power think it necessary to attempt to do so for no other power have reason to desire or to foresee a naval conflict with great britain ever since 1493 when the pope divide the monopoly of traffic on the ocean between spain and portugal and english mariner flout he edict great britain have stand for the policy of the open sea and there be no likelihood of we abandon it the german official theory of the purpose of they navy with its suspicious attitude towards british sea-power be in effect a bid for supremacy inspire by the same idea which make the german army under bismarck supreme in central europe the kaiser 's speech on naval matter notably he famous declaration that we future be on the water provide a official confirmation if one be need of the real nature of germany 's naval ambition but what right it may be ask have great britain to this naval supremacy why should we more than any other power claim one of the element for we own have not germany some reason to be jealous why should we not allow she together with ourselves a place on the ocean the answer to this lie in the character of the british empire one quarter of the human race live under the union jack scatter throughout the ocean and control from a small island in the western sea for great britain alone among the state of the world naval supremacy and nothing less be a daily and hourly necessity indium realize this truth recently in a flash when after generation of silent protection by british sea-power german shell fall one night at madras any power that challenge the naval supremacy of great britain be quarrel not with the british government or the british people but with the fact of history of geography and of the political evolution of the world the british empire have not be build up like the german by the work of statesman and thinker it be not the result as german think of far-seeing national policy or persistent ambition and greed it have slowly take shape during the last four century since intercourse be open up by sea between the different race of mankind in accordance with the need of the world as a whole its collapse at the hand of germany or any other power would not mean the substitution of a non-british empire for a british it would inaugurate a period of chaos in all five continent of the world the ruler and people of germany who count on the decadence of great britain and the disintegration of she unorganised empire do not realize these simple fact they lack of perception be due partly to they political inexperience but a deeper reason for it lie in they wholly false estimate as to what world-policy and world-empire mean train in the prussian school they think of they like soldier in term of conquest glory and prestige that way lie napoleonism none of the great power be wholly free from blame on this score but until german realize as the other power be slowly realize that the true basis of empire be not a love of glory but a sense of responsibility towards backward people it will be hard to readmit they into the comity of the great power only a sense of common purpose and ideal and of joint responsibility for world-problem can make the concert of europe a reality such be the general attitude of mind among the german public of the younger generation let we now turn to the effect of this new outlook upon the political party and grouping the chief result have be the extinction in germany as a political force of the great liberal movement of the mid-nineteenth century which in england france and other western country have grow and develop during the last generation along line correspond to the need of the new century the younger generation of middle-class german indoctrinate with orthodox and national opinion at school and on military service eschew the ideal which attract they father and grandfather in 1848 and although so-called liberal free-thinking and radical party still exist they have steadily be grow more militarist militarism in its new guise bind up with idea of industrial and commercial expansion be far more attractive to they than in the form of the prussian army the emperor 's navy bill be from the first more popular in commercial and industrial circle than with the old prussian conservative but as the year go on the kaiser succeed in convert both the junker to he navy bill and the middle class to he army bill so that by 1913 when he demand the great national sacrifice of a levy of 50 million pound by a tax not on income but on property there be no difficulty whatever about manage the reichstag the army bill of 1913 say prince bülow meet with such a willing reception from all party as have never be accord to any requisition for armament on land and sea so far as man can tell every necessary and justifiable army and navy bill will always be able to count on a safe parliamentary majority -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ p 169 -rrb- prince bülow 's safe parliamentary majority means of course a majority sufficient to outvote the social democrat with whom every german government have to reckon as a permanent opposition so far we have leave the social democrat out of the picture it be necessary to do this in discuss german policy and the relation between the german government and reichstag opinion for the german government itself habitually leave they out of the picture hitherto in germany so far as opinion on political question have matter at all it be upper-and middle-class opinion that have count as it count in england up to fifty year ago to the german government and to the ordinary educate german the social democratic party though it number in its voting rank over 4 million german workman and other do not represent german opinion at all : it represent something un-german and anti-german -- a public enemy between the social democrat and the rest of society a great gulf be fix across which no intercourse be possible : as the pioneer who attempt to introduce the worker ' educational association into germany find such intercourse be forbid from either direction the social democrat be the red danger man who in the kaiser 's word be the enemy of empire and fatherland and unworthy -lrb- except of course in war-time -rrb- to bear the name of german we must go back a hundred year in english history to realize the depth of the animosity between the social democratic party and the rest of german society the word radical say a english historian convey a very different meaning in 1816 to what it do now the hand of the radical be suppose to be against every man and every man 's hand be against they scott when he talk of rebel in arm always style they radical ` radicalism be a spirit ' write the vicar of harrow in 1820 ` of which the first element be a rejection of scripture and a contempt of all the institution of you country and of which the result unless avert by a merciful providence must be anarchy atheism and universal ruin ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- the vicar of harrow in 1820 very fairly sum up the substance of innumerable german speech pamphlet and election address in 1912 on the subject of the social democrat -lrb- footnote 1 : spencer walpole _ history of england _ vol i p 348 -rrb- how be this extraordinary position maintain how be it possible that in a modern largely industrial community the representative of working-class opinion should be regard as public enemy the chief reason lie of course in the fact that the german empire be not a democracy and be not govern by minister responsible to parliament the immense number and rapid growth of the social democrat have therefore not really be a menace to the government in fact it have even be hold in some quarter that it have be to the interest of the german government which be base on the prussian military caste to maneuver the social democrat into a extreme position and then to hold they up as a terrible example of what democracy mean this they can tell the german people be the alternative to prussian rule a dangerous policy it may be argue for the social democrat may some day secure a majority in the reichstag the prussian answer to this be that without a redistribution of seat this be barely conceivable and that be it to take place the reichstag would promptly be dissolve for new election on a narrower franchise bismarck himself contemplate this course and he successor would not shrink from it another reason why it have be possible for the government to ignore the social democrat have be the absence of a practical alternative program on the part of the social democrat themselves if i have to make out a school report for the social democratic movement say prince bülow in the reichstag on one occasion i should say ` criticism agitation discipline and self-sacrifice i _ a _ positive achievement lucidity of program v _ b _ ' the taunt be not undeserved the socialist movement in germany have suffer like so many german movement through a rigid adherence to logical theory under the leadership of old revolutionary thinker like bebel it have fail to adapt itself to the fact of modern german life the vague phrase of its republican program survival from a past epoch of european thought have attract to it a large mass of inarticulate discontent which it have never be able to weld into a party of practical reformer in the municipal sphere and in the field of trade unionism under the education of responsibility german socialism can show great achievement but in national policy it have be as helpless as the rest of the german nation what effect it will be ask be the war of 1914 likely to have on the german working-class movement in 1848 middle-class germany make its stand for democracy may we hope for a similar and more successful movement in the direction of western ideal and method of government from working-class germany as a result of 1914 it be a tempting prophecy but the outlook be not propitious germany prussian and south german noble bourgeois and work class have rally round the emperor in this crisis of national history as the brutal and cynical director of german policy calculate that she would for the social democratic movement the war come with a peculiar appeal it be a war against russium a country about which the german workman know little and understand less but which he consider to be the home of a reaction far blacker than that of he own country a war of aggression against the western power would have find the social democrat divide by represent russium as the aggressor and the western power as the shameless ally of the mongol german diplomacy more successful within than without make certain of enlist socialist support moreover the socialist too have to pass through a natural reaction from they refusal to recognize the force of nationality -- from utopian dream of international action by the people across the barrier of separate government for the first time in the history of the party german socialism have be allow to be patriotic it be a exhilarating and heartening experience and it be certain to leave a indelible mark upon the spirit of the movement the great party organization hitherto confine to the sterile work of agitation be be use to cope with the many problem create by the war and this work rather than revolutionary agitation be likely to occupy it for some time to come a veil have fall upon germany : german book and papers be stop at we port : we can not know through what thought the german nation be pass but as we look with the mind 's eye across the north sea past devastate belgium to the populous town of industrial germany we see a people skilful highly instruct and mechanically intelligent yet equally devoid either of personal initiative or of great and inspiring leadership two generation of prussian education have leave german public life practically empty of name of more than local reputation great change be need -- a change of institution and a change of spirit yet whence this will come we can not divine only as democrat we can say with confidence that if the true spirit of the german people be to be liberate from its long imprisonment its freedom must be win not from without but from within not europe but only the german can make germany herself

no one can read recent article by the leader of german thought without feeling that the german be still before all thing and incurably the people of poet and philosopher and that by a tragic irony it be the best and most characteristic quality of the race which be sustain and will continue to sustain it in the conflict in which its dream have involve it chapter iv austria-hungary and the southern slav for a century past attempt have be make to solve the eastern question on the day when it appear to have be solve europe will inevitably be confront by the austrian question -- albert sorel -lrb- 1902 -rrb- in April 1909 a week after the international crisis evoke by austrium 's annexation of bosnium have come to a end i pay my first visit to cetinje the tiny mountain-capital of montenegro and be assure by the premier dr tomanovus that the conflict have merely be postpone not avert -- a fact which even then be obvious enough but remember he say it be a question of _ aut aut _ -lrb- either or -rrb- -- either serbium and montenegro or austria-hungary one or other have get to go and you may rest assure that in four or at most five year from now there will be a european war over this very question at the time i merely regard he prophecy as a proof of serb megalomania but it have be literally fulfil in 1908-1909 austria-hungary with the aid of she german ally enforce she wish in respect of bosnium upon a reluctant europe but instead of follow up this success by a determine effort to solve the southern slav question on a austrian basis she allow the confusion to grow yearly worse confound and gradually create a intolerable situation from which a peaceful exit be well-nigh impossible the actual event which precipitate the struggle the event from which the diplomatic contest of last July and thus the great war first proceed be the assassination of the archduke franci ferdinand and he wife at sarajevo on June 28 and the consequent acute friction between austria-hungary and serbium but the murder as will be show later be merely make the pretext for austrium 's declaration of war the real cause lie far deeper and can only be properly understand on the basis of a historical survey my apology for inflict so many unfamiliar detail upon the reader be that the key to the whole situation lie in austria-hungary and that upon the fate of its province and race in this war depend to a very great extent the question whether the new europe which be to issue from this fiery ordeal be to be better than the old europe which be crumble in ruin before we eye for the moment a thick fog of war obscure this point of view but the time will assuredly come when it will emerge in its true perspective in recent year it have become a cheap journalistic commonplace to refer to the come inevitable struggle between teuton and slav and the present war be no doubt widely regard as prove the correctness of this theory despite the fact that the two chief group of teuton be range on opposite side and that the slav enjoy the active support of celt and latin also that such a struggle have come be in the last resort due to the false conception of nationality which underly the policy of the two central power germany and austria-hungary the freedom from foreign oppression which the german so nobly vindicate against napoleon have not be extend to they own subject race the pole dane and lorrainer and recent year have see the accentuation of a conflict the germ of which may be detect as far back as the fatal crime of the polish partition in the eighteenth century the policy of germanisation in austrium have be gradually undermine by cause which it would take too long to enumerate but its sting have survive in the maintenance of a foreign policy which treat 26000000 slav as a mere _ annexe _ of militant germanism and as gun-fodder for the design of berlin while in hungary the parallel policy of magyarisation have increase in violence from year to year poisoning the well of public opinion create a gulf of hatred between the magyar and they subject race -lrb- the slovak roumanian croat serb etc -rrb- and render cordial relation with the neighbouring balkan state impossible nor be it a mere accident that official germany and official hungary should have pursue a actively turcophil policy for the same tendency have be noticeable in turkey though naturally in a somewhat cruder form than farther west just as the young turk policy of turkification render a war between turkey and the balkan state inevitable so the policy of magyarisation pursue by two generation of hungarian statesman sow the seed of war between austrium and the southern slav in the former case it be possible to isolate the conflict in the latter it have involve the greater part of europe in a common disaster the struggle centre round the austro-serbian dispute let we then attempt a brief survey of the two country § 1 _ austrium and the habsburg _ -- let we begin with austria-hungary in this country many misconception prevail regard austria-hungary nor be this surprising for it be unique among state and whether we regard it from a political a constitutional a racial or a social point of view the issue be equally complicate and difficult to sum up with the aid of a good gazetteer it be easy enough to elicit the fact that the austria-hungary of to-day be a state of fifty-two million inhabitant divide into three component part : _ -lrb- a -rrb- _ the empire of austrium _ -lrb- b -rrb- _ the kingdom of hungary each with subdivision which will be refer to later and _ -lrb- c -rrb- _ the annexed province of bosnia-herzegovina jointly administer by the two government but this bald fact be meaningless except in connection with the historical genesis of the habsburg state -lrb- illustration : austria-hungary physical -rrb- austrium -- _ oesterreich _ -- be the ancient eastmark or frontier province the outpost of carlovingian power against the tribe of the east then of the mediaeval german empire against slav and magyar under the house of habsburg which first rise to greatness on the ruin of a greater bohemia austrium grow steadily stronger as a distinct unit two famous motto sum up the policy of that dynasty in the earlier century of its existence _ austriae est imperare orbi universo _ -lrb- austrium 's it be to rule the universe -rrb- run the device of that canny frederick iii who amid much adversity lay the plan which prompt a equally striking epigram about he son and successor maximilian the last of the knight -- _ bellum gerant alius tu felix austria nube _ -lrb- let other wage war do thou marry o fortunate austrium -rrb- there be three great stage in habsburg marriage policy in 1479 maximilian marry the heiress of charle the bold thus acquire the priceless dowry of the low country -lrb- what be now belgium and holland -rrb- in 1506 he son philip add the crown of spain and the indy by he marriage with the heiress of ferdinand and isabellum in 1526 when the battle of mohács place hungary at the mercy of the turk maximilian 's grandson ferdinand in he wife 's name unite bohemia hungary and croatium with the austrian duchy henceforth for over two century austrium and habsburg become the bulwark of christendom against the turk though delay by war of religion and by the excess of religious bigotry they yet never lose sight of the final goal twice -- at the beginning and at the end of this period in 1527 and 1683 -- the turk be before the very wall of vienna but the second of these occasion represent they final effort in the closing year of the seventeenth and the first two decade of the eighteenth century the tide finally roll back against they foremost among the victor stand out the great name of prince eugene comrade-in-arm of we own marlborough whose song prinz eugen der edle ritter -lrb- prince eugene the noble knight -rrb- have be sing in July and August 1914 on the street of vienna just as marlbrook s ` en va-t-en guerre might be sing by we belgian ally the peace of 1718 represent habsburg 's farthest advance southwards belgrade and half of present-day serbium own allegiance to vienna then come the check of 1739 when these conquest be restore to the sultan due merely to incompetent general it need not have be permanent have not frederick the great create a diversion from the north by the time that the war of austrian succession and the seven year ' war be over that expansion southward which have seem so certain be irrevocably postpone the organization of fresh military frontier the colonisation of waste land in south hungary -- all be admirable so far as it go but be already a defensive rather than a offensive measure meanwhile a formidable rival appear in the shape of the russian colossus and the history of two century be dominate by austro-russian rivalry in the balkan here we be confront by the first of those lose opportunity in which the history of modern austrium be unhappily so rich during the eighteenth century austrium become as it be the chief home of bureaucratic government first under marium theresa one of the greatest women-sovereign then under she son joseph ii a series of enlighten experiment in government typical of the age of voltaire and of frederick and honestly conduct _ for _ the people though never _ by _ the people end as such experiment be apt to end in failure the most that can be say be that the bureaucratic machine have become more firmly fix in the groove which it be henceforth to occupy the failure of joseph ii be above all due to he inability to recognize the meaning of nationality to he attempt to apply germanisation as the one infallible remedy for all internal difficulty in he dominion the idea of nationality already gain strength obtain a fresh impetus from the french revolution while in the west it sow the seed of unite italy and unite germany which the nineteenth century be to bring to fruition in the balkan it stir water which have seem dead for century and lead to the uprising of the serb and greek then of the roumanian and finally a generation later of the bulgarian in the habsburg dominion the same movement reveal itself in the revival of national feeling in hungary bohemia and croatium but nowhere more strongly than in hungary where it be accompany by a remarkable literary revival and the appearance of a group of magyar poet of real genius the kingdom of hungary which from 1526 to 1687 have be partially under turkish rule lead a vegetable existence during the eighteenth century this lull be a necessary period of recuperation after exhaust war the ancient hungarian constitution date in its essential from the thirteenth century but fall on evil day during the turkish era now come more and more out of abeyance its fundamental principle be reaffirm by the famous law of leopold ii -lrb- 1790-92 -rrb- and after a further relapse due to the napoleonic war a long series of constitutional and linguistic reform be introduce by successive parliament between 1825 and 1848 without enter into a discussion of the hungarian constitution it be well to point out one factor which lie at the root of all political and constitutional development in hungary and explain the magyar outlook for century past even up to the present day till 1840 latin be the official language of the country and in that latin the term for the political nation be _ populus _ which we would naturally translate as people but populus contrast in hungarian law with pleb the _ misera pleb contribuen _ that phrase of ominous meaning to describe the mass of the oppressed and unenfranchised people the populus be the noble a caste which be relatively very wide but none the less a caste and which enjoy a monopoly of all political power till 1848 only the populus could vote only the pleb could pay tax -- a delightful application of the principle head i win tail you lose in 1848 the distinction be break down in theory the franchise be extend beyond the privileged class by the initiative of that class itself but in effect the distinction have survive to the present day in a veil form political power and above all the parliamentary franchise and the county elective body continue to be a monopoly -- henceforth a monopoly of the magyar nobility _ plus _ those class whom they have assimilate and attach to they cause _ against _ the other race form more than half the population of hungary this point of populus and pleb may seem at first sight somewhat pedantic and technical but in reality it be the key which explain the whole social structure of hungary even its economic and agrarian problem the period from the death of joseph ii to the great revolutionary movement of 1848 may be regard so far as eastern europe be concern as a period when nationality be simmer everywhere it be a period of preparation for the rise of national state -- usher in by the great crime of the polish partition to which so many modern evil may be trace and close by a sudden explosion which shake europe from pari to budapest from palermo to berlin the first stage be of course the long napoleonic war during which the seed be sown broadcast the second the era of reaction and political exhaustion -lrb- 1815-1848 -rrb- when all that be best in europe concentrate in the romantic movement in literature art and music for austrium this period be bind up with the name of metternich who personify the old hide-bound method of the bureaucracy the diplomacy of a past age to which the nation be mere pawn on a chessboard under he the police-state assume its most perfect form a form not even surpass by russium from 1881 to 1905 then come the year 1848 when the dam burst the hungarian constitution restore in its entirety become for a time the watchword and inspirer of the movement while austrium for the first time receive a serious constitution unhappily the issue between reaction and progress be not a clear one the magyar in hungary unquestionably stand for historic development and constitutional rights but they also stand for racial hegemony for the forcible assimilation of all the other race for a unitary magyar state instead of the old polyglot hungary they thus drive all the other race to coalesce with the dynasty and the force of reaction the result be a violent racial war with all kind of excess slovak croat serb roumanian saxon all fight against the magyar and finally the scale be turn by the russian troops who pour across the carpathian in the name of outraged autocracy there follow the inevitable reaction which again can be best sum up in two phrase -- that of prince felix schwarzenberg austrium will astonish the world by she ingratitude so strikingly fulfil in the crimean war when austrium leave russium in the lurch and that of a hungarian patriot the other race have receive as reward what we magyar receive as punishment in short the statesman of vienna untaught by experience revert to the old bureaucratic and absolutist _ régime _ for ten year -lrb- 1849-1859 -rrb- this endure -- clericalism rampant financial ruin stagnation everywhere then nationality burst its bond once more the war with napoleon iii end in austrium 's loss of lombardy and the creation of the italian kingdom face by the bankruptcy of the whole political and financial system franci joseph launch into a period of constitutional experiment follow the line of least resistance as throughout he long reign he incline now to federalism now to centralism and he be still experiment when the war of 1866 break out for austrium this war be decisive for its result be she final expulsion both from germany and from italy and the creation of that fatal dual system which have distort she whole subsequent development under the ausgleich or compromise of 1867 the dual monarchy be compose of two equal and separate state the empire of austrium and the kingdom of hungary each possess a distinct parliament and cabinet of its own but both share between they the three joint ministry of foreign affair war and finance the chief of these three office be equally responsible to both delegation which be committee of the two parliament sit alternately in vienna and budapest but act quite independently of each other this system really secure the political power in austrium and hungary to two race -- the german and the magyar and they as the strongest in each country buy off the two next strongest the pole and the croat by the grant of autonomy to galicium and croatium the remain eight be not consider at all at first this ingenious device seem to offer fair prospects of success but ere long -- for reason which would lead we too far -- the german hegemony break down in austrium and the whole balance be disturb it gradually become clear that the system be only workable when one scale be high in the air the history of the past forty-seven year be the history of the gradual decay of the dual system austrium have progress in many way she institution have steadily grow freer she political sense have develop universal suffrage have be introduce racial inequality have be reduce though not abolish industry art and general culture have advance steadily but she have be continually hamper by hungary where racial monopoly have grow worse and worse the magyar chauvinist attempt the impossible -- the assimilation by seven million people of twelve million other yet in spite of every imaginable trick -- a corrupt and oppressive administration gross manipulation of the franchise press persecution the suppression of school and ruthless restriction of every form of culture -- the non-magyar race be stronger to-day than in 1867 and the result of the struggle have be in hungary a decay of political standard a corruption of public life such as fill even the greatest optimist with despair § 2 _ hungary and magyar misrule _ -- such a assertion may seem to run counter to the common idea of hungary as the home of liberty and the vanguard of popular uprising against despotism and it be certainly incompatible with the arrogant claim of magyar statesman that nowhere in the world be there so much freedom as in hungary at the risk of disturb the proportion of this chapter i propose to give a few classic illustration of magyar method select almost at random from a overwhelming mass of damning evidence on paper hungary possess a most admirable and enlighten law guarantee the equal rights of nationality -lrb- 1868 -rrb- in practice it have remain almost from the very first a dead letter let we take the field of education every effort legal and illegal have be make to magyarise the educational system with the result that in all the primary and secondary school under state control magyar be the exclusive language of instruction while the number of denominational school have be steadily diminish and they sphere of action as more favourable to the non-magyar race materially restricted fifty year ago the slovak who even then number over two million possess three gymnasium -lrb- middle school -rrb- which they have found and maintain by they own exertion in 1875 all three be arbitrarily close by order of the hungarian government and since that date the unhappy slovak have not be allow a single secondary school in which they own language be teach while the number of they primary school have be reduce from 1821 in 1869 to 440 in 1911 the deliberate aim be of course to prevent the growth of a slovak middle class it be quite a common thing for schoolboy to be persecute or even dismiss for show slovak proclivity or even talk they mother -- tongue ostentatiously on the street only last year a brilliant young slovak student know to I personally be deprive by the magyar authority of a scholarship in oriental language for no other reason than that he be untrustworthy in a national sense -lrb- 1 -rrb- such instance be even more frequent among the roumanian of hungary a specially notorious case occur in march 1912 at grosswardein when sixteen roumanian theological student be expel from the catholic seminary for the demonstrative use of they language which be regard as offensive by they fellow-student and professor -lrb- footnote 1 : this document be in my possession -rrb- linguistic restriction be carry to outrageous length there be not a single inscription in any language save magyar in any post office or railway station throughout hungary slovak medal and stamp produce in america and bear such treasonable inscription as for we slovak language and i be proud to be a slovak have be confiscate in hungary only magyar inscription be tolerate on the tombstone of the budapest cemetery the erection of monument to roumanian or slovak patriot have more than once be prohibit and the fund collect have be arbitrarily seize and apply to magyar purpose national color other than the magyar be strictly forbid two year ago at the funeral of a roumanian poet at kronstadt -lrb- transylvanium -rrb- gendarme press up to the hearse and clip off the color from a wreath which have be send by the society of journalist in bucarest about the same time a nurse be send to prison because a child of three be find wear a roumanian tricolor bow and its parent be reprimand and fine last July on the very eve of war fifteen theological student return to bucarest from a excursion into transylvanium be arrest at the frontier by hungarian gendarme haul by main force out of the train send back to hermannstadt and keep for day in gaol they offence consist in wave some roumanian tricolor from the train window as they steam out of the last station in hungary no law of association exist in hungary and the government use its arbitrary power to prohibit or suppress even such harmless organization as temperance society choral union or woman 's league perhaps the most notorious example be the dissolution of the slovak academy in 1875 and of the roumanian national party 's organization in 1894 but the treatment mete out to trade union and working-class organization both magyar and non-magyar for year past have be equally scandalous the right of assembly be no less precarious in a country where parliamentary candidate be arrest or expel from they constituency where deputy be prevent from address they constituent where a electoral address be often treat as a penal offence as for hungary 's electoral system the less say the better gerrymandering a narrow and complicated franchise bribery and corruption on a gigantic scale the wholesale use of troops and gendarme to prevent opposition voter from reach the poll the cooking of electoral roll illegal disqualification sham count official terrorism and in many case actual bloodsh -- such be but a few of the method which preserve a political monopoly in the hand of a corrupt and increasingly inefficient racial oligarchy in a country where the absence of the ballot place the peasant peculiarly at the mercy of the authority small wonder then if the non-magyar race of hungary who on a basis of population would have have 198 deputy never be allow to elect more than 25 and if even this scanty number be at the infamous election of 1910 reduce by terrorism and corruption to eight in judicial matter the situation be no less galling petition be not accept in the court unless draw up in magyar and the whole proceedings be invariably conduct in the same language the non-magyar stand like a ox before the court of he native land and a whole series of provision exist for he repression notably the monstrous paragraph deal with action hostile to the state with the incitement of one nationality against another and with the glorification of a criminal action -- apply with rigorous severity to all political opponent of magyarisation but never to its advocate let I cite one classic example of the latter in 1898 a well-known slovak editor be sentence to eight month ' imprisonment for two article severely criticise the magyarisation of place-name in hungary on he return from prison he be meet at the railway station of the little county town by a crowd of admirer : song be sing a short speech of welcome be deliver and a bouquet of flower be present the sequel of this perfectly orderly incident be that no fewer than twenty-four person include mr hurban the lead slovak poet be sentence to term of imprisonment vary from fourteen day to six month the three girl who have present the flower be let off with a fine of # 16 perhaps the reader will regard I as a very dangerous conspirator when i tell he that in June 1910 a old lady of seventy-three the widow of a high-school headmaster be fine # 4 because i have call at she house for twenty minute on election day without its be notify to the police and that in June 1914 a enquiry be institute by the local authority against some slovak friend who have entertain I to luncheon and yet i can honestly assert that i have never be guilty of any worse crime than captain grose of whom burn warn my countryman a hundred year ago in the famous line : a chiel 's amang ye takin ' note the fabric of magyar rule be far too rotten and corrupt to regard with equanimity any extensive note-taking on the part of the outer world whole book might be write to illustrate the contention that in matter of education administration and justice of association and assembly of the franchise and the press the non-magyar nationality of hungary have long be the victim of a policy of repression which be without any parallel in civilised europe it be this magyar system from which i have lift but a corner of the veil that be one of the mainspring of the present war and if there be to be a new and healthy europe in the future this system must be sweep away root branch and stock to such length have national fanaticism drive the magyar that in 1906 it be possible for a ex-premier of hungary speaking in open parliament amid the applause of the majority to lay down the follow axiom : the legal state be the aim : but with this question we can only concern ourselves when we have already assure the national state hungary 's interest demand its erection on the most extreme chauvinist line man who applaud such a sentiment be worthy ally of those so-called statesman who regard international treaty as a mere scrap of paper § 3 _ the decay of the dual system _ -- the radical divergence of political development in austrium and in hungary its paralysing effect upon the foreign policy of the monarchy as a whole couple with the growth of national feeling among the minor nationality and they steady emancipation from the economic thraldom of the german and the jew -- all this have slowly but surely undermine the dual system and render its final collapse inevitable indeed for some time past it have merely owe its survival to the old age of the emperor who have a natural reluctance to destroy he own creation for some year it have be know that he heir franci ferdinand be the advocate of far-reaching change which would have take the form of a compromise between a federalist and a centralist system he abrupt removal from the scene be secretly welcome by all those whose political and racial monopoly be bind up with the exist _ régime _ german dominance in austrium it should be add mean a close alliance with the german empire and every fresh effort of the subject race to emancipate themselves from germanise or magyarise tendency forge the chain of the alliance closer and increase the dependence of the magyar oligarchy upon berlin as in mediaeval time so in the twentieth century habsburg policy be explain by two famous latin motto -- _ viribus unitis _ -lrb- union be strength -rrb- and _ divide et impera _ -lrb- divide and rule -rrb- between these two watchword franci joseph and he adviser have waver for sixty-five year what then be the force which have hold austria-hungary together under franci joseph first unquestionably come the dynasty for it would be difficult to over-estimate the power exercise by the dynastic tradition on the many race under habsburg sway next come the joint army for there be no finer body of man in europe than the austrian officer ' corps poorly pay hard-worked but inspire to the last man with unbounded devotion to the imperial house and to a large extent immune from that spirit of caste which be the most offensive feature of the ally german army -lrb- 1 -rrb- hardly less important be the catholic church with its vast material resource and its powerful influence on peasant small tradesman and court alike and the bureaucracy with its tradition of red tape small-mindedness slowness of movement and genial _ gemütlichkeit _ -lrb- easy-goingness -rrb- it be only _ after _ these force that we can fairly count the parliament and representative government and yet there be no fewer than twenty-three legislative body in the monarchy -- the two central parliament of vienna and budapest entirely distinct from each other the two delegation the provincial diet seventeen in austrium one in croatium and the diet of bosnium whose every legislative act require the ratification of the joint minister of finance and of the austrian and hungarian government -lrb- footnote 1 : it be in no way a preserve of the aristocracy be largely recruit from the middle and even lower-middle class -rrb- against all this there be one supremely disintegrate force -- the principle of nationality only a map can make clear the racial complication of the dual monarchy and even the largest scale map fail to show how inextricably the various race be interweave in many district of hungary or bohemia the follow table offer at least a statistical survey : -lrb- 1 -rrb- racial -- austrium hungary bosnium german 9950266 2037435 czech -lcb- 6435983 slovak -lcb- 1967970 pole 4967984 ruthene

austria-hungary be utterly incomplete and inadequate but it may perhaps serve as a basis for further study let we now consider she rival in the dispute which have lead to the great war -- serbium here at the outset it can not be emphasise too strongly that those who regard the problem merely as a dispute between the government of vienna and the government of belgrade have not grasp even its element the southern slav question go far deeper and wider than that it must be treat as a whole and of it serbium be only a part in any study of the slavonic race the first fact which emerge be that they fall naturally into two main group -- the northern and the southern -- divide by a solid wedge of three non-slavonic race the german the magyar and the roumanian stretch from the kiel canal to the black sea it be with the southern group that we be concern the southern slav fall into four section -- the slovene croat serb and bulgar who between they occupy the whole country from southern carinthium to central thrace the significance of the bulgar will be deal with elsewhere and of the slovene it will suffice for we present purpose to say that they be a small and ancient race of vigorous stock and clerical leaning whose true importance lie in they geographical position and its latent possibility for the future the croat and serb occupy the border-line between west and east between rome and byzantium between catholicism and orthodoxy broadly speak every croat be a catholic every serb a orthodox broadly speak again the croat language be serb write with latin character the serb language croat write in the cyrilline alphabet despite they common language the two kindred race have never all be unite under a single ruler from the ninth to the end of the eleventh century the duchy then kingdom of croatium be govern by native prince upon whose extinction it be conquer by hungary for eight century croatium have enjoy a autonomous position under the holy crown of st stephen its scope have vary accord to the political constellation but till 1912 its constant tradition have remain unbroken meanwhile the dalmatian coast town remain a bone of contention between venice and hungary but the marble lion on they batter wall be still the best proof of the triumph of italian culture within they ragusa alone resist both venetian and turk and preserved herself inviolate as the home of commerce and the muse until she tiny republic be destroy by napoleon in 1808 the kingdom of serbium develop on more distinctively slavonic line during its great day in the thirteenth and fourteenth century under the nemanja dynasty it dominate the balkan peninsula produce a code of law which be unique in mediaeval record develop a prosperous commerce and mining industry and seem on the point of strike a new note in architecture she greatest tsar stephen dushan die mysteriously of poison when he host be already thunder at the gate of constantinople -lrb- 1356 -rrb- but the greatness of he empire do not survive he and only a generation later serbian independence receive its death-blow on the fatal field of kosovo -- the flodden of the balkan but a event far direr in its consequence than flodden be to scotland bosnium and a fragment of serbium linger on under more or less independent ruler till the middle of the fifteenth century then the turkish night replace the turkish twilight from 1463 to 1804 the national life of the serb lay utterly crush in serbium they nobility be literally wipe out in bosnia it accept islam in order to save its land the relation of conqueror and conquer be best characterise by the single fact that a christian who fail to dismount from he horse on meet a turk be liable to be kill on the spot throughout this period of utter gloom only two thing serve to keep alive the serb tradition -- they splendid popular ballad unequalled in europe for directness and imagination save perhaps by the ballad of the anglo-scottish border and the clergy of the orthodox church poor ignorant despise peasant like they flock yet bravely keep the national flame burn the one bright spot be the tiny mountain eyrie of montenegro which stubbornly maintain its freedom under a long succession of warrior-priest the serb patriarchate which have long have its seat in ipek migrate to austria in 1690 at the special invitation of the emperor leopold i and have ever since be establish -lrb- though the title of patriarch lapse for a time -rrb- at karlowitz on the danube large settlement of refugee serb from turkey follow they spiritual chief to croatium slavonium and the southern plain of hungary between 1690 and 1740 the special privilege grant to they by the emperor be however gradually undermine and revoke by the hungarian estate meanwhile the military frontier be extend on essentially democratic line : a land-tenure subject to military service breed a hereditary race of soldier and officer devote to the imperial idea and it have take many long long year of bungling on the part of viennese and magyar diplomacy to efface that devotion thus the habsburg dominion become the center of culture for the serb whose literary revival come from neusatz karlowitz and even buda it be not only under prince eugene that they look to the habsburg for aid kara george who lead they first serious rise in 1804 more than once offer himself to vienna in the balkan the serb be the first to revolt and win they own freedom with less help than greek roumanian or bulgarian and under far less favourable circumstance thus serbia be essentially a self-made man among state build from the foundation upward and possess no aristocracy and hardly even a middle class she curse have be the rivalry of two or rather three native dynasty the karageorgevitch the obrenovitch and the petrovitch and this rivalry have bear fruit in three dastardly political crime -- the murder of the heroic black george in 1817 by order of he rival milosh obrenovitch of prince michael serbium 's wisest ruler by the adherent of george 's son and finally of king alexander and he wife in June 1903 the history of the southern slav for the last century have be a slow movement towards national unity overshadow sometimes hasten sometimes paralyse by the rivalry of austrium and russium for the hegemony of the balkan peninsula till 1875 the influence of the two power alternate in belgrade and there be nothing definite to suggest which influence would win though of course russium may be say to have possess a advantage in she position as the foremost orthodox power and as the greatest among the slavonic brotherhood of race that year however bring a fresh rising of bosnium and herzegovina against turkish rule and in defense of this purely serbo-croat province public opinion in serbium and montenegro rise side by side the two little principality fight the turk and risk they all upon the issue the province be to the last man friendly and welcome they action then when the battle seem win austria-hungary at the congress of berlin step in and occupy bosnium and herzegovina -- with the active approval of disraelus and salisbury the inhabitant resist stoutly but be overcome thus be realize the first stage upon the road of the austrian advance towards salonica serbium receive compensation at nium pirot and vranja montenegro acquire the open roadstead of antivarus and a scrap of barren coast-line but the heart of both still cling to bosnium henceforth the friction between vienna and belgrade have be permanent though often latent it be accentuate by the fact that king milan be little better than a austrian agent the most notorious example of this be the ill-considered and ill-managed war with bulgarium into which he plunge serbium at the instigation of the ballplatz -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1885 -rrb- afterwards it be true vienna intervene to rob the bulgarian of the fruit of victory and argue that serbium be thus under she debt but this crass application of the principle of _ divide et impera _ could not deceive any one milan be a man of great ability but vicious and corrupt the ceaseless scandal of he private life the frequent political _ coup d'etat _ in which he indulge tend to confirm the dislike of he subject for the austrophilism with which he be identify alexander he son and successor be even worse indeed it be not too much to say that he be the most impossible monarch whom europe have know since the day of the tsar paul he court be characterise by gross favouritism and arbitrary revision of the constitution and he position become finally untenable when he commit the fatal error of marry draga mashin a woman of no position and notorious private character two incident in she tragic story remind we of similar scandal in english history -- the fond delusion of mary tudor and the legend of mary of modena 's warming-pan the last straw be the design widely attribute to she and the infatuated king for secure the succession to she brother who have as little claim to the throne as any other serbian subject on June 10 1903 alexander and draga be assassinate by a gang of serbian officer under circumstance of the utmost brutality such as nothing can excuse in the light of recent event however it be important to note that both austrium and russium know of the plot at least ten day before the murder and do nothing to stop it -lrb- 2 -rrb- on the day after the crime the _ fremdenblatt _ the organ of the austro-hungarian foreign office publish a leading article couch in term of the utmost cynicism and declare that it matter little to austria-hungary which dynasty reign in serbium the serbian government might have be excuse for enclose a copy of this article in its reply to the austrian note of July 23 1914 -lrb- footnote 1 : the austro-hungarian foreign office -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in 1908 this be confirm to I by a distinguished member of the then austrian cabinet since dead who be certainly in a position to know -rrb- the obrenovitch dynasty be thus at a end its rival the karageorgevitch dynasty return to power -- naturally under a black cloud of european disgust and suspicion king peter be not however as black as he have sometimes be paint he fight gallantly in 1870 as a french officer as a young man he translate stuart mill 's _ essay on liberty _ into serb and for a generation he live by preference in democratic geneva and in pari under he serbia have for the first time enjoy real constitutional government quietly as occasion arise the regicide be remove to the background the old method of favouritism be steadily discourage and it be not too much to say that a entirely new atmosphere have be create in belgrade since 1903 among the younger politician in serbium as in other slavonic country the moral influence of professor masaryk the great czech philosopher and politician have grow more and more marked the depth of serb aspiration in bosnium have two obvious grounds -- on the one hand pure national sentiment of the best kind on the other the urgent economic need for a seaboard serbium be the only inland country in europe save switzerland and not enjoy the latter 's favored position in the immediate vicinity of great world-markets austria-hungary on she part set herself deliberately not merely to block this access to the sea but also to keep serbium in complete economic dependence under the new dynasty the little kingdom show a keener desire to shake off its vassalage and find new market the so-called pig war -- the breeding of swine be serbium 's staple industry and the founder of she two rival dynasty be wealthy pig-breeder -- prove a unexpected success for new trade outlet be find in egypt and elsewhere but the initial strain hit every peasant in he pocket and thus greatly accentuate the feeling against austria-hungary at this stage come the young turk revolution and its sequel the annexation of bosnium to any impartial observer it have be obvious from the first that those who dream of austria-hungary 's voluntary withdrawal from the two province be live in a fool 's paradise the formal act of annexation merely set a seal to thirty year of effective austrian administration during which the sultan 's rule have be confine to the official celebration of he birthday educational and agrarian problem have be neglect popular discontent have smoulder but at least great material progress have be make road railway public building have be create out of nothing capital have be sink a new machine of government have be construct austrium have come to stay and aehrenthal in annex the province feel himself to be merely set the seal to a document which have be sign a generation earlier he have fail to reckon with the outcry which this technical breach of international law evoke : like bethmann-hollweg he have no blind faith in scrap of paper and have no scruple in tear up the treaty of berlin on which the whole balkan settlement have rest nowhere be the outburst of feeling so violent as in serbium and montenegro who have never cease to dream of the lose serb province for some month the two little state challenge the accomplished fact and seem bent on stake they very existence upon war with the great neighbouring monarchy aehrenthal remain unmoved by they cry of impotent fury and settle down to a trial of strength with he rival izvolsky the russian foreign minister who encourage the sister slavonic state in they resistance at length in march 1909 germany step forward in shine armor to support she austrian ally and russium to avoid european war give way and abandon the serb to they fate nothing be leave but a humiliating submission : the serbian government be oblige to address a note to the great power declare that the annexation and internal condition of bosnium do not in any way concern she -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : this declaration be make the basis of the austrian note to serbium in July 1914 -rrb- § 5 _ the renaissance of serbium _ -- from this diplomatic defeat date the renaissance of serbium it restore she to a sense of hard reality and teach she to substitute hard work for loud talk so rough a challenge put the national spirit on its mettle the brief period between 1908 and 1912 work a real transformation in belgrade which could not fail to impress those who take the trouble to look beneath the surface nowhere be the change more marked than in the serbian army from which the regicide element have be slowly but steadily eliminate the two balkan war of 1912-1913 reveal serbium to the outside world as a military power notable alike for the élan of its infantry the high efficiency of its artillery the close camaraderie of officer and man the first use make of she victory over the turk be the occupation of northern albania she only possible outlet to the sea so long as dalmatium remain in austrian hand austria-hungary who have only remain inactive because she have take a turkish victory for grant now intervene and by the creation of a artificial albanian state veto serbium 's expansion to the adriatic the austrian foreign minister count berchtold short-sighted and indolent then as now fail to realize that the north albanian harbor for obvious reason of physical geography could never be convert into naval basis save at a prohibitive cost and that they possession by serbium so far from be a menace to austrium would involve the police of a mountainous tract of country inhabit by a turbulent and hostile population it ought to have be obvious to he that the moment have arrive for tempting the serb into the austrian sphere of influence by the bait of generous commercial concession through bosnium and dalmatium several far-sighted politician in austrium urge this course upon he and the serbian premier actually approach vienna with far-reaching proposal in this very sense they contemptuous rejection by berchtold and the little clique of foreign office official who control he puppet figure naturally strengthen still further the bond which unite belgrade and petrograd serbia shut out from the adriatic have no alternative save to seek she economic outlet down the valley of the vardar towards the aegean and in so do she come into violent conflict with bulgarian aspiration in macedonium these fact alone would justify the assertion that the war between the balkan ally be directly due to austro-hungarian initiative but it have also transpire that the dissension between sofium and belgrade be actively encourage from vienna that magyar influence be bring to bear upon king ferdinand and that war material be send down the danube from hungary to bulgaria the outward and visible sign of these intrigue be a speech of the hungarian premier count tisza oppose the tsar 's intervention in favor of peace and virtually incite bulgarium to fight it out the break-up of the balkan league be the first condition to that austrian advance on salonica which have always remain the ideal of the advocate of a forward policy in vienna and budapest and which lie at the root of austria-hungary 's action in provoke the present war serbium and montenegro however be but one half of the problem the issue involve be wider and deeper than the quarrel of vienna and budapest with belgrade even if every man in serbium be willingly prostrate before the habsburg throne there could be no real peace until the internal problem of austria-hungary 's southern slav province be solve what be at stake be the future of eleven million people inhabit the whole tract of country from sixty mile north of trieste to the center of macedonium from the southern plain of hungary to the north albanian frontier of these roughly four million be in the two independent kingdom the remain seven million be divide between austrium -lrb- the province of dalmatium istrium and carniolum -rrb- and hungary -lrb- the autonomous kingdom of croatia-slavonium -rrb- while bosnia-herzegovina be govern jointly by austrium and hungary the history of these province during the past generation be one of neglect and misgovernment croatium have be exploit economically by the magyar and the narrow interest of budapest have prevent railway development and hamper local industry by skilful manipulation of tariff and taxation a further result be that even to-day dalmatium -lrb- with the exception of ragusa -rrb- have no railway connection with the rest of europe and those of bosnium be artificially direct towards budapest rather than towards agram vienna and western europe it be not too much to say that the situation of those province have become less favourable -lrb- if compare with surround standard -rrb- than it be at earlier period of they history for the old system of trade-route have break down there as elsewhere in europe but have not be replace by modern communication § 6 _ serbo-croat unity _ -- parallel with the new era institute in serbium since 1903 a strong movement in favor of national unity take root among she kinsman across the austro-hungarian frontier the disruptive tendency which have hitherto be so marked in croatian politics begin to weaken the so-called serbo-croat coalition round which all the younger element speedily rally put forward a ambitious program of constructive democratic reform as the basis of joint political action on the part of both race and hold stubbornly together when the inevitable breach with the magyar oligarchy occur the magyar government feel that every effort must be make to restore that discord between croat and serb which have be for a generation one of the main pillar of they racial hegemony these design happen to coincide with the aim of the foreign office in vienna in connection with the annexation of bosnium and budapest and vienna combine in a systematic campaign of persecution against the serb of croatium wholesale arrest and charge of treason lead up to the monster trial at agram which drag on for seven month amid scandal worthy of the day of judge jeffrey the diet cease to meet the constitution of croatium be in abeyance the election be characterise by corruption and violence such as eclipsed even the infamous hungarian election of 1910 the press and the political leader be single out for special act of persecution and intimidation these tactic be reveal to the outside world in the notorious friedjung trial -lrb- December 1909 -rrb- result out of a libel action bring by the serbo-croat coalition leader against dr friedjung the distinguished austrian historian the document on the basis of which he have publicly accuse they of be pay agent of the serbian government have be supply to he by the austro-hungarian foreign office and the trial reveal they as impudent forgery concoct in the austro-hungarian legation in belgrade the moral responsibility for these forgery be subsequently bring home to count forgách the minister in belgrade and indirectly of course to count aehrenthal himself as foreign minister but forgách though publicly denounce as count azev -lrb- 1 -rrb- be not allow to fall into disgrace on the contrary he have become within two year of he exposure permanent under-secretary at the ballplatz and inspirer of new plot to discredit and ruin serbium -lrb- footnote 1 : a allusion to the notorious russian _ agent provocateur _ who be at one and the same time a member of the secret police and of the revolutionary organization -rrb- the scandal of the friedjung trial lead to the fall of the governor of croatium but there be no change of system after a temporary truce the old conflict revive and within eighteen month the friction between magyar and croat be as acute as ever the magyar government employ every possible device of administrative pressure in order to create dissension between the croat and serb party -- repeated election wholesale corruption and violence persecution of the press and of the political leader yet so far from languish under such a system the movement for unity gain fresh strength and extend to the kindred slovene striking root even among the extreme clerical who have hitherto regard the orthodox serb with distrust and suspicion in the spring of 1912 the conflict culminate in the abolition of the croatian constitution by the arbitrary decree of the hungarian premier in the appointment of a reactionary official as dictator and a few month later in the suspension of the charter of the serb orthodox church § 7 _ the balkan war _ -- never in history have a more inopportune moment be choose for such cry illegality for close upon the heel of the demonstration and unrest which they evoke come the dramatic event of the balkan war the crush victory of the ally the resurrection of the lose serb empire the long-deferred revenge for the defeat of kosovo the whole southern slav province of austria-hungary be carry off they foot by a wave of enthusiasm for the ally and a impossibly strained situation be reach when the government of vienna place itself in violent conflict with serbium veto she expansion to the sea insist upon create a phantom albanian state egg on bulgarium against she ally and finally mobilise in order to impose its will upon the serb every peasant in the slavonic south naturally contrast magyar misrule in croatium with the splendid achievement of he serb kinsman across the frontier i know of poor villager in the mountainous hinterland of dalmatium who have no money to give to the cause of the balkan red cross offer cask of country wine or even such clothes and shoe as they could spare from they scanty belongings the total subscription raise among the southern slav of the monarchy in aid of the ally far exceed any sum previously raise for charitable purpose among so poor a population in the balkan sun say a prominent croat clerical we see the dawn of we day the national rejoicing which the avenging of kosovo evoke among the croat serb and slovene of austria-hungary be accompany by lively protest against the bare idea of a austro-serbian war which so far as the southern slav on both side of the frontier be concern would have be a civil war in the most literal sense of the word -lrb- and this civil war it must be remember be now actually be wage -rrb- the politician however though well-nigh unanimous in they enthusiasm for the cause of the balkan ally could not at one breath throw off the habit of a lifetime petty jealousy still divide they and be skilfully play upon by the magyar government the strain of five year of opposition and persecution have produce its effect upon the coalition leader and render they all too prone to further concession but the younger generation have be profoundly affect by the croatian dictatorship and the balkan war at a age when we youth think of nothing but cricket and football the student and even the schoolboy of croatium dalmatium and bosnium become engross in political speculation brood over the wrong of they disunited race and dream of serbium as the new piedmont of the balkan to all alike even the most advanced politician seem no better than a old fogey and it be no exaggeration to assert that the exist party have lose all hold upon the overwhelming majority of those who in ten year ' time will represent the manhood and the intellect of the race the widespread nature of the movement may be illustrate by the school strike of the spring of 1912 during which every boy and girl above the age of fourteen in most of the primary and secondary school of croatium dalmatium and bosnium play truant as a protest against the misgovernment of croatium on that occasion a crowd of 5000 school child parade the street of agram shout down with cuvaj -lrb- the ban or governor of croatium -rrb- and cheer the police when they try to intervene as in all such movement the view of individual vary in intensity : some merely give a theoretical adherence to the ideal of mazzinus or of mill other swallow the nihilist doctrine of bakunin and dream of revolution usher in by terrorist propaganda out of this milieu come the two young assassin who murder the archduke franci ferdinand § 8 _ the murder of the archduke _ -- by a hideous irony of fate franci ferdinand be the one man capable of restore order to a already desperate internal situation he very person be a program and a watchword and it have long be a open secret that he accession would be the signal for drastic reform it be he ambition to supersede the effete dual system by a blend of centralism and federalism such as would reconcile the national sentiment of individual race with the consciousness of a common citizenship and would at the same time restore to foreign policy the possibility of initiative this program involve the emancipation of the non-magyar race of hungary from the intolerable racial tyranny of the magyar and at the same time a serious attempt to solve the southern slav question by unifying the race under habsburg rule as he imperial uncle grow older and feebler franci ferdinand be know to have elaborate he design and a regular staff of able lieutenant have group themselves round he but on the very eve of action the strong man be remove to the scarcely veil relief of all those element in the state whose political and racial monopoly be threaten by such far-reaching and beneficial change the circumstance of the murder be still shroud in mystery it be know that no proper measure be take for the protection of the archduke and he wife in bosnium though it be still impossible to assign the responsibility for such criminal negligence it be notorious that in a country like bosnium which have for year be infested with police spy and informer and where every movement of every stranger be strictly under control so elaborate and ramify a plot could hardly hope to escape the notice of the authority it have even be assert that princip and cabrinovic the two assassin be _ agent provocateur _ in the pay of the police and though no proof be as yet forthcoming there be nothing inherently improbable in the idea -lrb- 1 -rrb- certain it be that the gravest suspicion rest upon those who connive at the disgraceful anti-serb riot of which sarajevo be the scene for nearly forty-eight hour after the murder -lrb- footnote 1 : the fact that they have only be sentence to term of imprisonment while some of they accomplice have be condemn to death have a much simpler explanation both man be under the age of twenty and therefore by austrian law immune from the death penalty -rrb- the murder provide a admirable pretext for aggression against serbium and at the same time tend to revive all the latent prejudice with which the country of the regicide be still regard in the west yet those who seek to establish a connection between the crime of sarajevo and the serbian government be on a utterly false scent i have try to describe the atmosphere of universal and grow discontent which produce the explosion those who know the slavonic south be well aware that bosnium dalmatium and croatium be a seething pot which need no stir from the outside and that the assassin be but the natural successor of the wild young student who during the last five year fire upon the governor of croatium and bosnium -lrb- 1 -rrb- but quite apart from this the complicity of official belgrade be render incredible by urgent consideration of internal serbian politics after a long and delicate negotiation the concordat with the vatican have just be conclude : the orient railway question have reach the critical stage : above all a custom and military union between serbium and montenegro be on the point of be conclude but of course quite apart from such consideration serbia be suffer from the extreme exhaustion consequent upon wage two war within a year and she statesman despite the rebuff administer by count berchtold be genuinely anxious for a _ modus vivendus _ with the neighbouring monarchy as a essential condition to a period of quiet internal consolidation but this be the very thing which the controller of austrian foreign policy -- the phantom minister berchtold the sinister clique in the foreign office and the magyar oligarchy lead by that masterful reactionary count tisza the hungarian premier -- be anxious to avoid they have never reconcile themselves to the new situation in the balkan and have twice back the wrong horse -lrb- turkey in the first war bulgarium in the second -rrb- still continue to plot against the bucarest settlement of August 1913 salonica still remain the secret austrian objective and serbium the main obstacle to the realisation of this dream not for the first time the interest of vienna and constantinople coincide and the occult interest which link budapest with salonica play they part in the game -lrb- footnote 1 : June 1910 June and November 1912 June 1913 -rrb- the crime of sarajevo remove the chief restrain force in the council of the monarchy and place the fate of europe at the mercy of a group of gambler in vienna budapest and berlin the military party under konrad von hoetzendorf chief of the austrian general staff -lrb- who a year ago be seriously speculate as to the collapse of austria-hungary -rrb- join hand with the magyar extremist whose political monopoly be threaten by the advance slavonic tide and with the inner ring of prussian diplomacy which believe the psychological moment to have arrive for measure sword with russium the murder serve as a admirable pretext to veil grossly aggressive tactic it be hope that russium might be manoeuvre into a position where autocracy would rather abandon the slav cause than seem to condone assassination and it be confidently believe that britain would hold aloof from a quarrel whose origin be so questionable strip of all outward seem the true issue of the conflict be very different just as the policy of violent turkification adopt by the young turk inevitably provoke the balkan war so the policy of magyarisation which have dominate hungarian affair for forty-five year and poison the relation of austria-hungary with she southern neighbor have lead directly to the present conflagration § 9 _ the future of the southern slav _ -- there have always be two fatal obstacle to a austrian solution of the southern slav problem -- magyar hegemony and the dual system to which alone that hegemony owe its survival and it be these two worn-out and reactionary idea -lrb- if they can be describe as idea -rrb- that be at present fight they death-struggle it be the ambition of franci ferdinand to achieve serbo-croat unity within the monarchy and thus simultaneously to counteract the attraction of pan-serb propaganda and to remove the most fertile source of friction between austria-hungary and serbium he death destroy the last chance of such a solution for the statesman of vienna and budapest be not merely incapable but openly hostile a appeal be to be make to the arbitrament of the sword long before war break out it have become a commonplace of political theory that the southern slav question could be solve in one of two way -- either inside the habsburg monarchy or outside it -- either with its help and under its aegis or against it and despite its resistance with the outbreak of war the problem assume a new form the alternative be the absorption of the two independent serb state in the neighbouring monarchy -- in other word the union of the entire southern slav race under habsburg rule -- or the liberation of she kinsman in the monarchy by serbium as the southern slav piedmont this latter ideal it have always be obvious could only be achieve through the medium of a general european war and it be in this manner that it be actually in process of achievement the austrian note to serbium be deliberately frame in such a manner as to be unacceptable by any state which value its self-respect or prestige the military leader desire war while the foreign office already commit for year to a violently serbophobe policy be work hand in glove with the german ambassador tschirschky and with the very highest quarter in berlin the german government in its official case admit have give austria a free hand against serbium while there be good grounds for believe that the text of the note be submit to the german emperor and that the latter fully approve of -lrb- if he do not actually suggest -rrb- the fatal time-limit of forty-eight hour which render all effort towards peace hopeless from the outset the austrian case against serbium as embody in this note rest upon a secret investigation in the prison of sarajevo the persistent rumor that the assassin be _ agents-provocateurs _ and that pressure of a somewhat drastic kind be bring to bear upon they after they arrest can not of course be accept as proved but the essential point to bear in mind be the fact that the detail of the austrian case as embody in the notorious note of July 23 originate in the same quarter as the previous attempt to slander and discredit serbium count forgách the arch-forger of the austrian legation in belgrade be permanent under-secretary in the foreign office and as count berchtold 's right hand and prompter in balkan affair be directly responsible for the pronounced anti-serb tendency which have dominate the foreign policy of the dual monarchy since the rise of the balkan league as a magyar nobleman with intimate jewish connection forgách be a invaluable link between magyar extremist policy and berlin on the one hand and salonica and constantinople on the other in view of he record as the inspirer of the vasic forgery we be amply justified in decline to accept any evidence prepare by he and he subordinate and insist upon a full and open trial of the murderer as the only conceivable foundation for charge of complicity when all be say and do however the murder of the archduke though a event of world-importance so far as the internal development and future of the dual monarchy be concern be none the less a side-issue in the southern slav question this seem paradox will not surprise those who consider the current of national life among the southern slav the diplomatic conflict between belgrade and vienna or budapest be but the outcome of a far deeper and wider movement we be witness the birth-throe of a new nation the rise of a new national consciousness the triumph of the idea of national unity among the three southern slav sister -- the croat serb and slovene fate have assign to britain and to france a important share in the solution of the problem and it be we duty to insist that this solution shall be radical and permanent base upon the principle of nationality and the wish of the southern slav race only by treat the problem as

myself i can testify to it i have see it and marvel at it i have see it in spite of the degraded sin and poverty-stricken appearance of we peasantry they be not servile and even after two century of serfdom they be free in manner and bearing -- yet without insolence and not revengeful and not envious ` you be rich and noble you be clever and talented well be so god bless you i respect you but i know that i too be a man by the very fact that i respect you without envy i prove my dignity as a man ' god will save he people for russium be great in she humility i dream of see and seem to see clearly already we future it will come to pass that even the most corrupt of we rich will end by be ashamed of he riches before the poor and the poor see he humility will understand and give way before he will respond joyfully and kindly to he honorable shame believe I that it will end in that thing be move to that equality be to be find only in the spiritual dignity of man and that will only be understand among we if we be brother there would be fraternity but before that they will never agree about the division of wealth we preserve the image of christ and it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world so be it so be it -- dostoieffsky _ the brother karamazov _ the french be a decent civilised lot of people but i wish we be not ally of russium this or something very like it be the speak or unspoken thought of a very large number of person especially among the working-class in england at the present time english suspicion of russium be no new thing though there be no doubt that the suppression of the revolution during the year 1906-1909 make it more general than ever before it be responsible for example for the crimean war and the crafty russian have become a catch-word almost as widely accept in england as the phrase perfidious albion be upon the continent i have see russium at she worst : i see the revolution stamp out cruelly and relentlessly i have live three year in finland and know the weariness of spirit and ache bitterness of heart that come to a fine and culture race in its perpetual struggle for liberty against a alien government to whom the word liberty mean nothing but rebellion and yet i be firmly persuade of the innate soundness of the russian people and of the tremendous future which lie before it in the history of the world i believe too that the english be suspicious of russium not because russium be crafty or evil or barbaric but because english people find it very difficult to understand a race which be so extraordinarily different from themselves we fear the unknown we suspect what be unlike ourselves yet we shall do well in the present crisis whether we be think of we enemy germany or we ally russium to remember the axiom lay down by edmund burke the greatest of english political thinker : it be impossible to bring a indictment against a whole nation in any case for good or ill russium be we ally and if germany be beat russium seem likely to play as great a part in the settlement as she do in 1815 it therefore behove we in we own self-interest if for no higher motive to try and understand the spirit and ideal of a great people who as they do a century ago at the time of napoleon be once again come forward to assist europe in rid herself of a military despotism § 1 _ the russian state _ -- many of we do not realize the most obvious fact about russium for example we atlas which give we europe on one page and asia on another prevent we from grasp the most elementary fact of all -- she vastness mr kipling have tell we that east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet but russium confound both mr kipling and the map-maker by stretch from the baltic to the pacific for she there be not europe and asia but one continent and she be the whole _ inside _ of it all europe between the four inland sea and all asia north of lat 50 ° -lrb- and a good deal south of it too -rrb- -- that be russium a total area of 8-1\/4 million square mile this enormous country which comprise one-sixth of the land-surface of the globe be at present thinly populate it have roughly 20 person to the square mile as against 618 to the square mile in england and wale yet for all that it contain the largest white population of any single state on earth numbering in all 171 million soul moreover this population be increase rapidly it have quadruple itself during the last century and with the advent of industrialism the increase be likely to be still more rapid many among we alive to-day may see russium 's population reach and perhaps pass that of teem china as yet however industrialism be only at its beginning in russium more than 85 per cent of the inhabitant live in the country as tiller of the soil it will be at once evident that this fact give she a immense advantage over industrial nation in time of war she have on the one hand a almost inexhaustible supply of man to draw upon while on the other hand she simple economic structure be hardly at all affect a great european war may mean for a western country dislocation of trade hundred of mill and pit stand idle vast mass of unemployed lead to distress poverty and in the end starvation for russium it mean little more than that the peasant grow fat on the corn and food-stuff which in normal time they would have export to the west furthermore she geographical and economic circumstance render russium ultimately invincible from the military point of view as napoleon find to he cost in 1812 she have no vital part such as france have in pari or germany have in silesium or westphalium upon which the life of the whole state organism depend she be like some vast multi-cellular invertebrate animal which it be possible to wind but not to destroy russium have much to gain from a great european war and hardly anything to lose at first sight therefore there seem to be a great deal in favor of the theory somewhat widely hold at the moment that to crush germany and austrium will be to lay europe at the foot of russium and that when germany have be drive out of france and belgium the ally in the west might have to patch up a peace with she in order to drive the russian out of germany behind this theory lie the assumption that russium be a aggressive military state inspire by the same ideal as have lead germany to deluge the world with blood this be a assumption which be i believe absolutely unwarranted by anything in the history or character of the nation historically speak the russian empire be a extension of the old roman empire it be the direct heir of the eastern roman empire which have its capital at constantinople as the mediaeval holy roman empire found by charlemagne in ad 800 be the heir of the western roman empire which have its capital at rome itself but the eastern empire survive its western twin by a thousand year the goth depose the last roman emperor in 476 the turk take constantinople in 1453 the russian empire therefore which do not begin its political development until after the fall of constantinople enter the field some six and a half century later than the mediaeval empire of charlemagne which be indeed already fall to piece in the end of the fifteenth century thus russium present the strange spectacle of a mediaeval state exist in the twentieth century and she be still in some particulars what western europe be in the middle age she have however attain a unity a strength and a centralisation which the holy roman empire never succeed in acquire there be nothing corresponding to the feudal system with all the disruptive tendency which that system carry with it in modern russium partly owe to the constant danger of mongolian invasion which threaten russium for so many century partly as a result of ivan the terrible 's destruction of the _ boyar _ who be analogous to the mediaeval baron and of peter the great 's substitution of a nobility of service for that of rank russium be politically more centralised than any mediaeval and socially more democratic than any modern country russium have also solve that other great problem which perpetually agitate the mediaeval world -- the conflict between the secular and the spiritual power she be the most religious nation in the world but she have no papacy peter the great subordinate the church to the state by place the holy synod which control the former under the authority of a layman a minister appoint by the tsar yet while she appear unite and centralise when we think of she nebulous prototype the holy roman empire we have only to compare she with she western neighbor and especially with that triumph of state-organisation germany to see how amorphous how inefficient how loose how mediaeval be the structure of this enormous state peter the great who be more than any other man the creator of modern russium see clearly that the only way of hold this inchoate state-mass together be to call into existence a huge administrative machine and he see equally clearly that if such a machine be not itself to become a disruptive force through the personal ambition and self-aggrandisement of its member it must be frame on democratic and not aristocratic principle as mr maurice bare put it peter the great introduce the democratic idea that service be everything rank nothing he have it proclaim to the whole gentry that any gentleman in any circumstance whatsoever and to whatever family he belong should salute and yield place to any officer the gentleman serve as a private soldier and become a officer but a private soldier who do not belong to the nobility and who attain the rank of a commission officer become _ ipso facto _ a member of the hereditary nobility in the civil service he introduce the same democratic system he divide it into three section : military civil and court every section be divide into fourteen rank or _ chin _ the attainment of the eighth class confer the privilege of hereditary nobility even though those who receive it might have be of the humblest origin he hereby replace the aristocratic hierarchy of pedigree by a democratic hierachy of service promotion be make solely accord to service lineage count for nothing there be no social difference however wide which could not be level by means of state service this be partly what be mean when it be state in the last paragraph that russium be socially the most democratic of modern country the system establish by peter the great exist to-day russium be govern not by a feudal nobility like that which grind the face of the poor in france before the revolution of 1789 nor by a number of capitalist who live by exploit the worker for neither feudal nobility nor capitalism -lrb- as yet -rrb- have any real power in russium she be govern by a civil service and by a civil service more democratic than we own where the higher post be as a rule only open to member of the upper and middle class less exclusive than that of indium where the higher official be nearly all recruit from the member of a alien race -- a civil service in short whose only close parallel be the hierarchy of the roman catholic church imagine the roman church as a secular institution with a monarch at its head ruling by hereditary right instead of a elect president like the pope and you get a very fair idea of the russian government machine all that we associate with the word aristocracy in the west the hereditary principle primo-geniture the accumulation of the land and capital of the country in the hand of a small class the spirit of caste the tradition of nobility hand down with the title-deed from father to son be either non-existent or of comparative unimportance in russian society there be also none of the keen sensitiveness to minute social distinction and to the social propriety which mark they that be so striking a feature of the life in democratic england and to which we have give the name snobbery there be of course social stratum in russium but they be broadly marked and there be no sense of competition between they a peasant be not ashamed of be a peasant and when he meet a nobleman he meet he on term of spiritual equality while acknowledge he superior position in the social scale a twin-brother of english snobbery be english hypocrisy this as have be well say be a kind of social cement for it be a tribute to a standard of social conduct set up by the dominant class in a nation and since there exist no dominant class in russium but only a dominant hierarchy draw from all class hypocrisy be absent from the russian character mr stephen graham who be i believe at one time a clerk in a london office find we civilisation so intolerable that one day he fling it off and escape to russia where he have live as a peasant tramp for many year to revolutionary who meet he and express they astonishment that a englishman should choose russium of all place to live in he reply i come to russium because it be the only free country leave in the world there be in truth much to be say for this startling remark in no country on earth be there such unaffected good-will such open hospitality such a instinctive respect for personal liberty -- liberty of thought and of manners -- such tolerance for the frailty of human nature such a abundance of what the great russian novelist dostoieffsky call all-humanness and st paul call charity as in russium all this of course do not come about as a result of the bureaucratic system it spring like that system itself from the fundamentally democratic spirit of the russian people § 2 _ religion _ -- the last paragraph will read strangely to those people whose only idea about russium be glean from newspaper account of the revolution of 1905 we shall come back to the revolution and its significance later but meanwhile we must notice another very striking fact about russian life -- its all-pervading religious atmosphere russium be a land of peasant in england and wale 78 per cent of the population live in town and the remain 22 per cent in the country in russium something like 87 per cent live in the country as against 13 per cent in the town these figure be enough to show where the real center of gravity of the russian nation lie the peasant or _ moujik _ be a primitive and generally a entirely illiterate person but he possess quality which he more sophisticated brother in the west may well envy and admire a profound common-sense a grand simplicity of life and outlook and a unshakable faith in the unseen world the interior of russium be almost wholly unknown in the west until a few year back it be as much of a _ terra incognita _ as central africa but the revolution lead english writer and journalist to explore it and when the dust and smoke of that upheaval which have obscure the truth from the eye of europe pass away a astonished world perceive the real russium for the first time russium write mr stephen graham who have do more than any other man to bring the truth home to we be not a land of bomb-thrower be not a land of intolerable tyranny and unhappiness of a languish and decay peasantry of a corrupt and ugly church the russian be a agricultural nation breed to the soil illiterate as the savage and have as yet no ambition to live in the town they be as strong as giant simple as child mystically superstitious by reason of they unexplained mystery russium be in fact 145 million peasant -- plough and pray and here once again one be remind of the middle age cross the russian frontier and you enter the mediaeval world miracle be believe in holy man be revere as saint thousand of pilgrim journey on foot every year to jerusalem which be to every true believer the center of the universe and therefore become at easter almost a russian city russium be the most christian country in the world and she people be the most christ-like the turbulence and violence so contrary to the christian spirit which be a inseparable feature of mediaeval feudalism be absent from russium and the gospel of non-resistance of brotherly love of patience under affliction of pity and mercy which tolstoi preach so eloquently to the world at large he learn from two teacher -- the peasant of modern russium and the peasant of ancient palestine who be crucify upon the cross yet it be a mistake to talk as some do of the power of the russian church or of priestcraft the church have little political power or social prestige it be the power of religion not that of ecclesiastical institution which be the arrest fact about modern russium it be not so much that russium have a church as that she _ be _ a church in england we have narrow religion down to one day of the week and shut it up in special building which we call church in russium it be impossible to avoid religion as you pass out of the gangway of the ticket-office at the railway station you find yourself in front of a sacred picture with a lamp burning continually before it and you be expect to utter a prayer before begin you journey every room in russium have its _ eikon _ -- be in fact a chapel every enterprise be sanctify by prayer and ceremony all english traveller in russium have acknowledge this profound national sense of religion and contrast it with the religious formalism of the west italy write mr hg well on he recent visit to russium abound in noble church because the italian be artist and architect and a church be a essential part of the old english social system but moscow glitter with two thousand cross because the people be organically christian i feel in russium that for the first time in my life i be in a country where christianity be alive the people i see cross themselves whenever they pass a church the bearded man who kiss the relic in the church of the assumption the unkempt grave-eyed pilgrim with he ragged bundle on he back and he little tea-kettle slung in front of he who be stand quite still beside a pillar in the same church have no parallel in england mr rothay reynold in he interesting and sympathetic book _ my russian year _ write in much the same strain : in russium god and he mother saint and angel seem near man rejoice or stand ashamed beneath they gaze the people of the land have make it a vast sanctuary perfumed with prayer and fill with the memory of hero of the faith saint and sinner believer and infidel be affect by its atmosphere and so it have come about that russium be the land of lofty ideal and mr stephen graham again in he _ undiscovered russium _ speak with glowing admiration of the russian church the holy church he say be wonderful it be the only fervid living church in europe it live by virtue of the people who compose it if the priest be wood it would still be great the worshipper be always there with one accord there be always stranger in the church always pilgrim god be the word that write all man brother in russium and all woman sister the fact behind that word be the fountain of hospitality and friendship the religious aspect of russian life have be dwell upon at some length because it be the key to everything in russium and have a direct bearing upon the present war religion in russium write mr maurice bare be a part of patriotism the russian consider that a man who be not orthodox be not a russian he divide humanity roughly into two category -- the orthodox and the heathen -- just as the greek divide humanity into greek and barbarian not only be the church of russium a national church owe to the large part which the state the emperor and the civil authority play in it but in russium religion itself become a question of nationality nationalism and patriotism russian christianity like russian tsardom be derive from the old roman empire of constantinople the russian church be a branch and far the most important branch of the greek orthodox church which drift apart from the catholic church which have its center at rome and finally separate from it in the eleventh century as the greatest orthodox christian power in the world russium naturally regard herself as the rightful protector of all orthodox christian she mortal enemy with whom so long as he remain in europe any lasting peace be impossible be the turk and she eye be ever direct towards constantinople as the ancient capital of she faith the spirit of the crusade be far from dead in the russian people the crimean war for example be fight in that spirit it will be at once apparent that russium take and must continue to take a profound interest in the christian people of the balkan greek roumanian servian bulgarian and montenegrin all belong to the orthodox church all have be engage throughout the nineteenth century in a struggle for existence against the common foe islam moreover all except the two first-mentioned people be ally to russia by tie of race as well as by religion since they be member of the slavonic stock to the average russian therefore the bulk of the balkan peninsula be as much russium irredenta as the north-east coast of the adriatic be italium irredenta to the average italian and as a matter of fact there be a good deal more to be say for russium 's case than for italy 's there be however another great power which possess interest in the balkan and which be view by russium with a suspicion and dislike hardly inferior to that entertain towards turkey -- i mean the empire of austria-hungary a catholic state control by german and magyar austria-hungary contain in its southern portion a population of over seven million slav some three million of whom be of the orthodox faith the dual monarchy have constantly outraged national and religious feeling in russium by she treatment of this slavonic population and she annexation in 1908 of bosnium and herzegovina both of they slavonic country be regard as a open challenge to russia it be not therefore surprising that the tsar have intervene in the present crisis have it refuse to come to the assistance of servium when austrium attack she the russian government would have be unable to face public opinion even those who know russium best be amaze at the complete unanimity of the country in the matter of this war and proof that it be not merely a war of aggression inspire by pan-slavist sentiment may be find in the fact that all political party revolutionary constitutionalist and reactionary have enthusiastically approve it how far germany misunderstand -lrb- or affect to misunderstand -rrb- the real state of feeling in russium may be see in the despatch of July 26 by the british ambassador in vienna who in talk the crisis over with the german ambassador and ask whether the russian government might not be compel by public opinion to intervene on behalf of a kindred nationality be tell that everything depend on the personality of the russian minister for foreign affair who could resist easily if he choose _ the pressure of a few newspaper _ england draw she sword in this struggle on behalf of belgium and in the name of civilisation and treaty rights russium have do the same on behalf of serbium and in the name of common blood and a common altar i for one firmly believe that she hand be as clean as ours § 3 _ the revolutionary movement and its significance _ -- it be now time to say something of the revolutionary movement of 1905 and of its ruthless suppression which give russium so evil a reputation in the eye of western europe it be my good fortune to be a resident in the dominion of the tsar during the critical year of 1906-9 to be present at a session of the first duma and to mingle with the member of that historic assembly in the lobby of the parliament house to catch something of the extraordinary belief in the come of the millennium which be prevalent among all class in petrograd in the first charmed month of 1906 and finally to have be acquaint with active revolutionary and they friend throughout the whole of my period of residence i can therefore speak with a certain amount of inner knowledge of the revolution and though i do not wish to claim any particular authority for the opinion state below which be after all nothing but the opinion of a single individual who have live for three year in a corner of the russian empire yet they have at least this advantage over those entertain on the subject by the average englishman viz that they be base not on newspaper report but on actual experience and that they be arrive at gradually and -- it may be add -- with considerable reluctance since they have as it be to win they way through a number of my own personal sympathy and political prejudice there be of course no room here for any detailed treatment of a movement upon which a big book might be write and i shall therefore have to limit myself to a few rather bald generalisation which i must ask the reader to accept not as the truth but as what one man of limited experience and vision conceive to be the truth about the russian revolution the main reason why english people get mistaken idea about russium be that they imagine russian to be nothing but englishman picturesquely disguise in fur and top-boot and because they interpret the political situation in russium in term of english history and politics as i have already try to show russian be build differently from english people _ from the soul outwards _ while the political and social condition of the russian empire be totally unlike anything that have ever exist in this country if therefore the real cause of the movement of 1905 and of its failure be to be rightly understand we must put away from we mind the desire to find analogy in the english revolution of 1642 and 1688 or the french revolution of 1789 or the social revolution of which karl marx dream russium can only be interpret in term of russian history and russian condition in one thing however the russian revolution be like all revolution which have ever be or be ever likely to be viz that it be concern with two distinct issue one a narrow question of political and constitutional reform and the other a far wider question involve a attempt to reconstruct not merely the institution of society but also to transform the ideal and conception upon which society rest let we first of all consider the narrower political issue this be simple enough the outbreak of 1905 have as its primary object the set up of some form of representative government which would control the bureaucratic machine it have be already point out that the constitution of modern russium be largely due to the genius of peter the great during the nineteenth century however it become apparent to think russian that the constitution for the sake both of stability and efficiency need development in the direction of popular representation the plea of efficiency be really far the stronger of the two have peter the great be eternal he might possibly have continue to exercise a effective control over the administrative system which he create for he be a man of superhuman energy and will-power but most tsar who be man of ordinary capacity find it impossible to do so the consequence be that the bureaucracy acquire what amount in practice to absolute irresponsibility now irresponsibility be demoralise to any administration however democratic be the principle upon which its official be select a bureaucracy ruling without proper external control become a prey to the demon of red tape routine officialdom and place-hunting it tend to stifle individual initiative and the sense of moral responsibility since it forget the real object of its existence -- the good government of the country -- in its passion for self-preservation and its desire to secure the smooth-working of the machine it become inhuman intensely conservative and corrupt above all it develop a hyper-sensitiveness to lay criticism which compel it to do all in its power -- and in russium that power be unlimited -- to crush freedom of speech and freedom of the press the problem however of devise some popular check upon its action be a extremely difficult one for the simple reason that the mass of the russian people never have take and even to-day do not take any interest in political question nevertheless the tsar alexander ii who be one of the most enlighten monarch that ever sit upon the russian throne determine to attempt a solution unfortunately on march 1 1881 the very day when alexander have give he approval to a scheme of constitutional reform involve the establishment of representative institution he be assassinate by revolutionary this fatal act put back the clock for twenty-five year the court and the nation be throw into the arm of the bureaucracy as they only protector against terrorism and reaction reign supreme meanwhile the bureaucracy grow more corrupt more tyrannical more inefficient every day while on the other hand the party of reform thrust as it be underground and hunt like rat become more and more bitter in spirit and more and more extreme in theory it be important to bear in mind that the struggle have never from begin to end be one which divide the nation as a whole into two hostile camp public opinion when it have not be indifferent have sway now to one side and now to the other accord as it be stir by some flagrant act of oppression on the part of the bureaucracy or some outrageous act of terrorism on the part of the revolutionary the truth be that the civil war in russium -- for it be nothing less -- be confine to quite a narrow section of society it have be say that there be practically speak no class distinction in the english sense of the word in russium there be however a very real distinction between the _ intelligentsia _ and the peasant the _ intelligentsia _ be the few million educate russian who control or seek to control the destiny of the 145 million uneducated tiller of the soil there be nothing quite like they in this country though the expression the professional class describe they in part broadly speak they be people who have pass through school and university and can therefore lay claim to a certain amount of culture they birth be a matter of no moment they may be the child of peasant or of nobleman it be from this class if we can call it so that both the bureaucracy and the revolutionary movement draw they recruit the real tragedy of russium be that neither the party of reform nor the party of reaction share or even understand the outlook and ideal of the people russian culture be still so comparatively recent that it have not yet pass out of the imitative stage and in spite of the work of pushkin gogol and dostoieffsky the book that be read and study in russium be for the most part translation from foreign author the result be that the political and social idea of the _ intelligentsia _ be almost wholly derive from country whose structure be totally different from they own we shall presently see that this fact have a important bearing on the development of the outbreak of 1905 it be sufficient here to notice that the struggle be one between two section of the _ intelligentsia _ political idealism against political stagnation the red flag _ versus _ red tape after twenty year of bureaucratic government the country as a whole begin to grow once again restless in this period a proletariate have come into be it be a mere drop in the bucket of 145 million of peasant but its voice be hear in the town and it be steep in the marxian doctrine of social democracy moreover the peasant themselves have they grievance they care nothing and understand less of the political theory which the revolutionary assiduously preach among they but they prick up they ear when the agitator begin to talk about land and taxation up to 1861 the peasant have be serf the property with the land on which they live of the landowner at they emancipation it be necessary to provide they with land of they own the state therefore buy what be consider sufficient for the purpose from the landowner hand it over to the peasant and recoup itself by impose a land-tax on the peasant to expire after a period of forty-nine year this tax be feel to be exceedingly onerous and in addition to this by the beginning of the twentieth century it become clear that the land acquire in 1861 be not nearly enough to support a grow population these factor together with the disastrous russo-japanese war which reveal a appalling state of corruption and incompetency in the government of the country furnish the revolutionary with a opportunity which be not to be miss a rapid series of military and naval mutiny agrarian disorder assassination of obnoxious official socialist rising in the town during the year 1905 culminate in the universal strike of October bring the government to its knee and on the 17th of the same month the tsar issue he manifesto grant freedom of speech freedom of the press and a representative assembly the revolution have apparently win on the constitutional issue yet what look like the end of bureaucratic absolutism prove to be the destruction of the revolutionary party have the reformer of 1905 concentrate they energy upon the task of turn the new legislature into a adequate check upon the bureaucratic system there be little doubt they would have succeed as it be they success in this direction be only partial it be true that a duma still sit at the taurida palace at petrograd but it be elect on a narrow property franchise and its relation with the bureaucracy be as yet not properly define it criticise but it possess no real control this failure of the revolution be almost wholly due to the revolutionary themselves who instead of confine they attack to the government machine seek to undermine the entire structure of society and to overthrow the moral and religious ideal of the nation moreover they attitude be entirely negative and they possess little or no constructive ability of any kind even the first duma which contain the ablest politician among the reformer do not succeed in pass act of parliament affirm the most elementary principle of civil liberty and it damage itself irreparably in the eye of the country by refuse to condemn terrorism while demand a amnesty for all political offender the unique opportunity which the first duma afford be fritter away in futile bickering and wordy attack upon the government meanwhile though a temporary truce be observe during the duma 's session its dissolution on July 21 1906 two and a half month after open be the signal for a fresh outburst of outrage on both side the country be fast drift into anarchy agrarian rising indiscriminate bomb-throwing _ pogrom _ highway robbery carry out in the name of the social revolution and euphemistically entitle expropriation outbreak of a horrible kind of blood-lust which delighted in motiveless murder for the sake of murder be the order of the day the revolution be strong enough neither to crush the reactionary nor to control the revolutionary themselves the foundation of the social structure seem to be dissolve in a welter of blood and crime and public opinion which in its hatred of bureaucracy have hitherto side with the revolution suddenly draw back in horror from the abyss which open out in front of it stolypin the strafford of modern russium who condemn the extremist of both side be call to the helm of the state he watchword order first reform afterwards be back by the force of public opinion and as he stamp out the revolution with a heel of iron the country shudder but approve the peasant be pacify by the remission of the hate tax and by measure for provide they with more land and russium sink once more into she normal condition but political incompetency be not a reason sufficiently weighty in itself to account for the remarkable revulsion of public feeling against the revolutionary party behind the narrow political issue lay the larger philosophical and moral one and it be the discovery by the country of the real character and ultimate aim of the party which for a few month in 1906 seize the rein of power that will alone provide a sufficient explanation of one of the most astonishing political debacle of modern history the revolution be nothing less than a attempt by a small minority of theorist and moral anarchist to force western civilisation upon russium and not western civilisation as it actually be but a sort of abstract westernism derive from book for the revolutionary be far more western than the western they have not merely swallow wholesale the latest and most extreme political and social fad pick up from the literature of england france and germany but they possess a courage of they conviction and a will to carry they out to the logical conclusion which many advanced thinker of the west lack they be not modernist or new theologian but atheist not fabian or social reformer but revolutionary socialist arm with bomb not radical but republican not divorce-law-reformer but free lover a remarkable book be publish in 1910 call _ landmark _ it be write by a number of disillusioned revolutionary and give a vivid picture of the effect which the foregoing principle have upon the life of those who uphold they here be one extract : in general the whole manner of life of the _ intelligentsia _ be terrible a long abomination of desolation without any kind or sort of discipline without the slightest consecutiveness even on the surface the day pass in do nobody know what to-day in one manner and to-morrow as a result of a sudden inspiration entirely contrariwise -- everyone live he life in idleness slovenliness and a measureless disorder -- chaos and squalor reign in he matrimonial and sexual relation -- a naïve absence of conscientiousness distinguish he work in public affair he show a irrepressible inclination towards despotism and a utter absence of consideration towards he fellow-creature and he attitude towards the authority of the state be mark at time by a proud defiance and at other -lrb- individually and not collectively -rrb- by compliance as a set-off to this picture of moral chaos it should be remember that these people when call upon to die for they revolutionary faith do so with the greatest heroism nor be the picture true of all revolutionary some of the noblest man it have ever be my good fortune to meet be russian revolutionary but these be the product of a earlier and sterner school the puritanical nihilism of the ` eighty and it be impossible to deny the substantial truth of the above description as far as the rank and file of the modern revolutionary school be concerned -lrb- 1 -rrb- such people be divide by a whole universe from the peasant to whom they offer themselves as leader and savior and the scheme of regeneration which they preach be not merely useless because purely negative but be exotic plant which could never flourish on russian soil thus the revolution triumph for about twelve month as a purely destructive force but when the necessity for construction arise its adherent find that they be entirely ignorant of the element of the problem before they this problem be the peasant and the revolutionary though they have worship the people -lrb- with a capital p -rrb- for year and have do they best to convert they have never make any attempt to understand they and when the peasant discover what the revolutionary be like he loathe and detest he they hate we a writer in _ landmark _ confess because they fail to recognize that we be man we be in they eye monster in human shape man without god in they soul and they be right -lrb- footnote 1 : it be confirm by all impartial observer see _ eg _ professor pare ' _ russium and reform _ chap ix entitle life of the intelligent -rrb- there be a characteristic story tell by mr maurice bare about a certain revolutionary who one day arrive at a village to convert the inhabitant to socialism he think he would begin by disprove the existence of god because if he prove that there be no god it would naturally follow that there should be no emperor and no policeman so he take a holy picture and say ` there be no god and i will prove it immediately i will spit upon this _ eikon _ and break it in piece and if there be a god he will send fire from heaven and kill I and if there be no god nothing will happen to I at all ' then he take the _ eikon _ and spat upon it and break it to bit and he say to the peasant ` you see god have not kill I ' ` no ' say the peasant ` god have not kill you but we will ' and they kill he this story whether true or not be a parable in which one may read the whole meaning of the failure of the russian revolution it show how a attack upon what they hold sacred may rouse to act of fury a people who be admit by all who know they to be the most tolerant most tender-hearted and most humane in europe the notion that russium be a humane country may sound strange in english ear yet capital punishment which be still part of we legal system be abolish in russium as long ago as 1753 except for case of high treason from 1855 to 1876 only one man be execute in the whole of that vast empire and from 1876 to 1903 only 114 on the other hand between the year 1905 and 1908 the total of execution reach the appalling figure of 3629 this be but to translate into criminal statistics the story just quote for the year 1905-8 be the year when martial law reign in russium the year of revolution the tsar it be true wear the black cap and the hangman 's rope be manipulate by the bureaucracy but the jury who bring in the verdict be a jury of 145 million peasant such in broad outline be the history of the revolutionary movement which be still so greatly misunderstand in england it be not the uprising of a oppressed nation which successful for a brief while be finally crush by the brute force of reaction it be a civil war between two section of a small educate class in which the sympathy of the nation after fluctuate for a time eventually come down heavily against the revolutionary there be in truth every excuse for misunderstand amongst english people especially if they belong to the party of progress in english politics for the obvious thing about russium be so deceptive all that one saw on the surface be on the one hand a irresponsible bureaucracy use the knout the secret agent the _ pogrom _ and siberium for the suppression of anything suspect of threatening existing condition and on the other a band of devoted reformer and revolutionary risk all in the cause of political liberty and die the marseillaise on they lip with the fortitude of christian martyr but beneath all this something immensely bigger be in progress which can only be describe as a conflict of two philosophy of life diametrically oppose or if you like a life-and-death struggle between two civilisation so different that they can hardly understand each other 's language it be a renewal of the titanic contest which be decide in the west by the renaissance and the reformation the contest between the mediaeval and the modern world to the modern mind no period be so difficult to grasp as the middle age we dream be of progress which be another word for process of success which imply perpetual change in either case of get on somewhere somehow we know not where or how we very universe from which we have carefully exclude the supernatural have become a development machine a huge spinning-mill and we religion if we have one a matter of progressive revelation we look before and after forwards to some dim utopia backwards to some ape-like ancestor who link we with the animal world we outlook be horizontal the mediaeval outlook perpendicular the mediaeval man look upward and downward to heaven and hell when he think of the future to sun and cloud land and crop when he think of the present he live in the presence of perpetual miracle the daily miracle of sunrise sunset and shower and in the constant faith in resurrection whether of the corn which he sow in the furrow or of he body which he friend would reverently sow in that deeper furrow the grave and he life be as simple and static as he universe the season determine he labor the church he holiday book do not disturb he faith in the unseen world for he be illiterate nor the lust of gold he contentment with he existence for commerce be still confine to a few town russia to-day be in spirit what europe be in the middle age -lrb- 1 -rrb- the revolutionary offer she western civilisation and western philosophy and she reject the gift with horror -lrb- footnote 1 : this of course by no means imply that she be _ behind _ the west or that she be of necessity bind to pass through the same process of development the problem of modern russium be not to imitate the west but to discover some way of come to term with western ideal without surrender she own -rrb- will she continue to maintain this attitude the russian peasant say mr maurice bare as long as he till the ground will never abandon he religion or the observance of it because the religion of the peasant be the work hypothesis teach he by life and by he observance of it he follow what he conceive to be the dictate of common sense consecrate by immemorial custom the crucial point of this passage be the conditional clause : as long as he till the ground of course russium the granary of europe must always be predominantly a agricultural country yet she be at the present moment threaten in many part with a industrial revolution the ultimate effect of which may prove far more subversive than the attempt revolution of 1905 for beneath she soil lie explosive material more deadly than any dynamite manufacture by _ intelligentsia _ she mineral wealth at present almost untouched be incalculable in quantity and amazing in variety when she mine be open up russium will become accord to the judgment of dr kennard editor of _ the russian year-book _ without a doubt the richest empire the world have ever see attract by she vast mining possibility by she enormous virgin forest by she practically unlimited capacity for grain-production the capital of europe be knock at the door of russium factory be rise mine be start all over the country russium be about to be exploit by european business enterprise just as america and africa have be the world have need of she raw material and be only interested in she people as potential cheap labor thus within the last few year something analogous to the proletariat and the bourgeoisie of europe have come into existence in russium we may catch a glimpse of what these new class be like from a recent book by mr stephen graham call _ change russium _ he write : the russian bourgeois be of this sort he want to know the price of everything of thing which be independent of price he know nothing or if he know of they he sneer at they and hate they talk to he of religion and show that you believe the mystery of christ talk to he of life and show that you believe in love and happiness talk to he of woman and show that you understand anything about she unsexually talk to he of work and show that though you be poor you have no regard for money -- and the bourgeois be uneasy instead of opera the gramophone instead of the theater the kinematograph instead of national literature the cheap translation instead of national life a miserable imitation of modern english life it may be think that there be little harm in the commercialisation of the russian the secularising of he life and that after all the bourgeois population of england france and germany be not so bad as not to be on the way to something better but that would be a mistake if once the russian nation become thoroughly pervert it will be the most treacherous most vile most dangerous in europe for the perverted russian all be possible it be indeed he favorite maxim borrow he think from nietzsche that ` all be permit ' and by ` all ' he mean all abomination all fearful and unheard-of bestiality all cruelty all falsity all debauch selfish as it be possible to be crass heavy ugly unfaithful in marriage unclean impure incapable apparently of understand the good and the true in they neighbor and in life -- such be the russian bourgeois mr graham 's picture of the new proletariat in the ural mine be a equally horrible one : gold mining be a sort of rape and incest a crime by which earth and man be make viler if i have doubt of its influence on man i need but to go to the ural goldfield a more drunken murderous brother-hating population than that of this district i have not see in all russia it be a great sorrow to see such a delightful peasantry all in debauchery the miner have no culture no taste not even a taste for property and squiredom so that when at a stroke he gain a hundred or a thousand pound it be rather difficult to know how to spend it he ideal of happiness have be vodka and all the bliss that money can obtain for he lie in that mia be a gold-mining village of twenty-five thousand inhabitant it have two church four electric theater fifteen vodka shop a score of beer-house and many den where card be play and woman buy and sell to the strain of the gramophone it be situate in a most lovely hollow among the hill and see from the distance it be one of the most beautiful village of north russium but see from within it be a veritable inferno mr graham write as a poet rather than as a economist or a sociologist but there be no doubt a grave danger to russia in a sudden adoption of industrial life _ intelligentsia _ bourgeoisie and proletariate be all product of the same force all belong to the same family they be westernised russian they have pass from the fourteenth to the twentieth century at one stride and the violent transition have cut they completely adrift from tradition and from all moral and religious standard book commerce and industry the three boast instrument of we civilisation have not civilised such russian they have _ de-civilised _ they but as yet russian of this character form only a tiny fraction of the nation and there be happily sign that the danger of a exotic culture be be realize even by the _ intelligentsia _ themselves since the failure of the revolution there have be a remarkable revival of interest among russian thinker in the native institution habit and even the religion of the country and it may be that in time there will emerge from this chaos of ideal a culture and a civilisation which will make the best of both world by adopt western method without surrender a inch of the nation 's spiritual territory above which float the standard of religion simplicity and brotherly love the present war terrible as it be may do something towards bring this about for the russian people face by a common danger and unite in a common purpose be now of one mind and one heart in a way that they have not be since a century ago napoleon be thunder at the gate of moscow and let this be say : if russium should ever cease to be russium if she ever lose those grand national characteristic which make she so different from the west and therefore so difficult for we western to understand the world as a whole will be infinitely the poorer for that loss we need russium even more than russium need we for while we have grasp the trappings she possess the real spirit of democracy of the three democratic ideal proclaim by france in 1789 the mystical trinity : liberty fraternity equality how much have yet be realize by the people of the west and russium be in the way of realize they all fraternity and equality be as we have see the distinctive feature of she national spirit and social structure and if she liberty be as yet imperfect on the political side it be far more complete than ours on the side of moral tolerance and respect for the sanctity of human personality after all the reason why russium have not get complete political freedom be because as a nation she have hitherto take no interest in politics for the first time in 1905 she discover the use of political action and she get out of it a solution of the agrarian distress and a representative assembly when she _ want _ more liberty in this direction she will have no difficulty in secure it § 4 _ the subject nationality _ -- it may fairly be object at this point that while russium may possess these excellent quality she have consistently refuse to allow liberty to other people to the jew for example the pole and the finn it be necessary therefore to say something on the matter of russium 's subject nationality before bring these remark to a conclusion out of the six or seven million jew in the world over five million live within the boundary of the russian empire russium be therefore the motherland of the child of israel though perhaps the phrase step-motherland would express more truly the actual relationship both in its origin and its character russium have inherit she tremendous responsibility towards the hebrew race from poland and she vexed jewish question be in part a just punishment for she complicity in the wicked partition of that country in the eighteenth century the matter however go back much farther than the eighteenth century in the middle age poland be a more powerful state than russium and comprise territory stretch from the gulf of riga to the black sea and from the oder to the dnieper she be also the one country in europe which offer to the jew security from persecution and a opportunity of develop the commercial instinct of the race without interference the result be that jew settle in large number all over the king of poland 's possession and the presence of jew in any part of modern russium be almost a sure sign that that particular town or province have be polish territory in former time the russian government have never except for a short period allow the jew to live in russium proper and it be very rare to find jew in north or central russium even in large city like petrograd and moscow they number be small while it be interesting to note that the finn have copy the rest of russium in this respect at least that they have always resolutely refuse to admit the hebrew where russium find jew among the new subject which she acquire by she gradual encroachment upon poland she have of course to let they remain but she have confine they strictly to these district the existence of this jewish pale be one of the grievance of the jew of russium but it be not the heaviest the liberal-minded alexander ii have show himself lenient to they but he assassination in 1881 at the hand of terrorist and the accession of the reactionary alexander iii begin a period of persecution which have continue until the present day alexander iii be much influence by he tutor pobiedonostsev who for the next thirty year be the most prominent exponent of the philosophy of slavophilism this which in its modern form may be trace back to 1835 be in fact nothing else than a perverted glorification of the russian national characteristic which have be dwell upon above the slavophil declare not only that the russian be a great and admirable nation which few who really know they will be dispose to deny but that they institution -- and in particular of course autocracy and bureaucracy -- be a perfect expression of the national genius which could hardly be improve upon furthermore it be maintain that since all other country but russium have take a wrong turn and fall into decadence and libertinism it be russium 's mission to bring the world back into the path of rectitude and virtue by extend the influence of she peculiar culture -- and in particular again of course its special manifestation autocracy and bureaucracy -- as widely as possible a variant of slavophilism be panslavism which work for the day when all member of one great slav race will be unite in one nation presumably under the russian crown both these movement be example of that nationalism run mad to which reference have be make in the second chapter -lrb- 1 -rrb- but the slavophil who be of course ardent supporter of the orthodox church be face at the outset with a great difficulty the western province of russium from the arctic to the black sea contain mass of population which be neither russian nor orthodox the finn in the north be lutheran the pole in the center though slav be roman catholic in religion and anti-russian in sentiment and the jew in the center and south be -- jew the first step therefore towards the slavophil goal be the russification of the subject people of russium in theory russification mean confer the benefit of russian custom speech and culture upon those who do not already possess they in practice it amount to the suppression of local liberty and tradition -lrb- footnote 1 : see p 57 -rrb- it be obvious that it be no easier to make a jew into a russian by force than to change the skin of the proverbial ethiopian nor be it likely that the russian government ever entertain the idea of make such a attempt if it have any definite plan at all it be to render thing so uncomfortable to the unfortunate hebrew that they would gradually leave the country real persecution begin at the accession of alexander iii in 1881 when it spread into russium significantly enough from germany where a violent anti-semite agitation have spring up at the beginning of the year riot direct against the jew and wink at if not encourage by the authority break out in the town of southern russium edict follow which exclude the jew from all direct share in local government refuse to allow more than a small percentage of jew to attend the school and university forbid they to acquire property outside the town lay special tax upon they back and so on this attitude of the government encourage the populace of the town to believe that they might attack the jew with impunity the jew be regard in modern russium in much the same light as they be regard by we forefather in the middle age they be hate that be to say on two count : as unbeliever and as usurer the condition of affair in a township where the population be half-jewish half-christian and where the christian be financially and commercially in the hand of the jew and the jew be politically and administratively in the hand of the christian be obviously a extremely dangerous one add to this the presence of a large hooligan section which be find in almost every russian town of any size the open disfavor show towards the jew by the government and the secret intrigue and incitement of the police and you get a train of circumstance which lead inevitably to those violent anti-semitic explosion know as _ pogrom _ which have stain the page of modern russian history the revolutionary movement have complicate matter still further for jew be naturally to be find in the revolutionary rank and the bureaucracy and its hooligan supporter have tend to identify the jewish race with the revolutionary party nothing can excuse the treatment of the jew in russium during the last thirty-five year and the guilt lie almost entirely upon the government which instead of lead the people and educate they by initiate a enlighten policy towards the jew a policy which might in fact have do more than anything else to russify the latter have persistently aid and abet the worst element of the population in they act of violence it have reap its reward in the rise of one of the most formidable of the revolutionary party in modern russium the so-called jewish bund the governor of vilna in a confidential report write in 1903 declare that this political movement be undoubtedly a result of the abnormal position of the jew legal and economic which have be create by we legislation a revision of the law concern the jew be absolutely urgent and every postponement of it be pregnant with the most dangerous consequence yet when we condemn russium for she _ pogrom _ and she jew-baiting we must not forget two fact : first that these occurrence be the work not of the real russian people the peasantry which have be describe above but of the dregs of the population which be to be find at the base of the social structure in the town of russium as in town nearer home second that russium be not the only country in the world that have these racial problem to face i once hear a russian and a american discuss the comparative demerit of they respective land and i be bind to say that the former hold he own very well when for example the american say what about the jew the other answer well what about the negro and he parry the further question what about _ pogrom _ with another of he own what about lynch the problem be not of course quite on all fours nor do two wrong make a right but a reminder that similar problem exist in other part of the world will perhaps be enough to show that the jewish question in russium be neither unique nor at all easy to solve let we instead of visit the sin of a few township upon the head of the entire russian nation be thankful that we have no such problem in we own island recent riot outside the shop of german pork-butcher in different part of the country do not it must be confess lead one to hope that we people would behave much more calmly and discreetly than the whites of the southern state or the christian of south-west russium be they place in the same circumstance the polish question be at once simpler and its story less damaging to the russian government than that of the jew the partition a account of which have already be give -lrb- 1 -rrb- be of course iniquitous but as we have see prussium must bear the chief blame for they in any case the tsar alexander i do he utmost for poland at the congress of vienna in 1815 he plead eloquently for a reunited poland and he almost win over prussium by make arrangement to compensate she for she polish territory at the expense of saxony but france england and austrium oppose he project and he be oblige to yield to the combined pressure of these power russium be therefore not more but less guilty of the present dismembered state of poland than she western neighbor among whom we must not forget ourselves -lrb- 2 -rrb- and she be to-day only attempt to carry out the promise which she make but be not allow to fulfill a century ago disappoint as he be alexander i make the best of a bad job by grant a liberal constitution to that part of poland which the congress assign to russia indeed he do everything possible short of a grant of absolute independence which at that time would have be absurd to conciliate public opinion in the grand-duchy of warsaw unfortunately the experiment prove a complete failure largely owe to the factious and self-seeking polish nobility who have always be the worst enemy of they country alexander after a time lose patience and in 1820 he feel compel to withdraw some of the liberty which he have confer in 1815 after this the breach between the russian government and the polish people begin to widen partly owe to stupid and clumsy action on the side of russium partly to the incurable lack of political common-sense on the side of the upper class in poland partly to the fact that the country could never be anything but restless and unsatisfied while it remain divide the history of russian poland since the time of alexander be the history of two great failure to throw off the russian yoke the failure of 1830 and of 1863 these rising be mark by heroism disunion and incapacity on the one side and by relentless repression on the other the upshot be that poland be deprive of she constitutional rights one by one until finally she become nothing more than so many province of russium itself to some extent however the failure of 1863 prove a blessing in disguise the rise have be almost entirely confine to the nobility russium therefore turn to the peasant of poland release they from all obligation to work upon the estate of the large landowner and hand over to they at least half the land of the country as freehold property the result of this measure and of the removal of the custom barrier between the two country in 1877 be twofold : the power of the factious nobility be shatter for ever and a marvellous development of industry take place in poland which have unite she to russia with chain of self-interest likely to prove a serious obstacle to the realisation of polish hope of independence -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be indeed doubtful whether at this date the pole cherish any such hope what they desire be national unity and self-government rather than sovereign independence and they know that they be at least as likely to receive these from russium as from prussium -lrb- footnote 1 : pp 24-27 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : as a matter of fact we representative lord castlereagh be alexander 's chief opponent at the congress in the question of poland see _ camb mod hist _ vol x p 445 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ camb mod hist _ vol xi p 629 -rrb- while of late year the relation between russium and poland have steadily improve those between russium and finland on the contrary have grow rapidly worse until 1809 finland be a grand-duchy under the swedish crown but in that year owe to a war which have break out between russium and sweden she pass into the control of the nearer and more powerful state after put up a stubborn resistance to annexation which will always figure as the most glorious episode in the annals of the country alexander i who be at that time tsar adopt the same policy towards finland as he do towards poland he refuse to incorporate the new province into the russian state-system he take the title of grand-duke of finland -lrb- thereby imply that she lay outside the empire -rrb- and he confirm the ancient liberty of the finn later on they even secure greater liberty than they have possess under sweden by the grant of a finnish diet on the line of the swedish diet in stockholm which should have full control of all internal finnish affair finland therefore gain much from the transfer she possess for the first time in she history complete internal autonomy this state of thing last for practically ninety year during which period finland make wonderful progress both economic and intellectual so that by the end of the nineteenth century she be one of the happiest most enlighten and most prosperous country in northern europe as regard the condition of finland alexander i have declare my intention have be to give this people a political existence so that they may not feel themselves conquer by russium but unite to she for they own clear advantage therefore not only they civil but they political law have be maintain this liberal policy be continue by the various tsar throughout the century the reformer alexander ii take particular interest in the development of the grand-duchy which he evidently regard as a place where experiment in political liberty be be work out that might later be apply to the rest of russium the weakness of finland 's position lay in the fact that she liberty really depend upon the personal whim of the grand-duke : in theory she constitutional law be only alterable by the joint sanction of monarch and people in practice the small but courageous nation have no means of redress should the tsar sway by bureaucratic reaction choose to go back upon the policy of he ancestor and in 1894 a tsar mount the throne nichola ii who do so choose the word go forth for the russification of finland after pick a quarrel with the diet on the military question the tsar on February 18 1899 issue a manifesto suspend the finnish constitution and abolish the diet finland become with a stroke of the pen a department of the russian empire a rigorous press censorship be establish the hate governor-general bobrikoff fill the country with gendarme and spy native official be dismiss or drive to resign a attempt be make to introduce the russian language into the school and though the finn could only oppose a campaign of passive resistance to these wicked and short-sighted measure at the end of seven year the nation which have for almost a century be the most contented portion of the tsar 's dominion be seethe with ill-feeling and disloyalty the inevitable outcome be the assassination of general bobrikoff by a young student in June 1904 and when the russian universal strike take place in October 1905 the entire finnish nation join in as one man finland regain she liberty for a time and immediately set to work put she house in order by substitute for she old mediaeval constitution a brand new one base on universal suffrage male and female and employ such up-to-date device as proportional representation the only result of seven year ' russification be the creation of a unite democracy with a strong socialistic leaven in place of a nation govern by a antiquated aristocratic diet and divide into two hostile political camp on the question whether swedish or finnish should be the language of the national culture but the fortune of finland be accidentally but inextricably bind up with those of the party of reform in russium and when the bureaucracy after the downfall of the revolutionary find itself once more firmly seat in the saddle it return to the attack on the finnish constitution not indeed with the open and brutal method of bobrikoff but by gradual and insidious means no less effective and it must be admit that the russian duma as reform by stolypin so far from be of any help to finland in the struggle have be make the instrument of the destruction of she liberty finland be in a very unfortunate position geographically she be bind to form part of the russian empire even the extremest russophobe in the country have long ago give up hope of re-union with sweden and yet the frontier between finland and russium be one which divide two world as all who have make the journey from helsingfor to petrograd must have notice in literature art education politics commerce industry and social reform finland be as much alive as any of the scandinavian state from whom she first derive she culture in many way indeed she be the most progressive country in europe and it be she proud boast that she be framtidsland the land of the future lutheran in religion non-slavonic in race without army court or aristocracy and consequently without the tradition which these institution carry with they she present the greatest imaginable contrast to the empire with which she be irrevocably link finland be western of the western and keenly conscious of the fact just because of this irrevocable link russium be -- russium and yet as part of the russian system she must come to term sooner or later with the empire she can not receive the protection of the russian military force a protection to the value of which if report be true she be at the present moment very much alive and yet retain she claim to be what be virtually a independent state that these claim have be pitch on a high note be no doubt largely the fault of the blundering and cruel policy of the russian bureaucracy but it must be admit that finland have never try in the very least to understand she mighty neighbor she have always sit as it be with she back to russium look westward and she statesman have not even take the trouble to learn the russian language there have in fact be something a little priggish in she superior attitude in she perpetually draw comparison between russian barbarism and finnish culture though she capital helsingfor be but twelve hour by rail from petrograd finland know as little of the interior of russium as people do in england the policy of the russian government on the other hand have be mark by that inconsistency political blindness and arbitrariness which one expect from a irresponsible bureaucracy for ninety year finland be leave alone to work out she own salvation entirely apart from that of the rest of the empire and then suddenly it be discover that she coast be of the highest strategical importance and that she be develop a commercial and industrial system in dangerous competition with the tender plant of commerce and industry in russium itself the slavophil raise a outcry and the decree go out that the russian whale should swallow this active and prosperous little jonah the former policy be really as stupid though less cruel than the latter have there be anything like that steady political tradition and wide political experience in russium which we can draw upon in england the imperial government would have from the first endeavor to draw finland closer to the empire not by band of steel and iron but by the more delicate and more permanent tie of considerateness affection and self-interest it be political stupidity base upon ignorance and inexperience and not inhumanity which be the real explanation of russium 's unfortunate relation with she subject people during the past century moreover the political machinery which have hitherto serve she own internal need be the worst possible instrument for deal with province which possess a full measure of western political consciousness together with the tradition of political liberty russium therefore require representative institution not merely for the political education of she own people and as a check upon bureaucratic tyranny and incompetency but also in order that she may adopt some fair and _ consistent _ policy towards she subject nationality it may be optimistic but i can not help feeling that the present war will do much for russium much for finland much for poland russium be fight to defend a small nation against oppression she be fight a life-and-death struggle with the military bureaucracy which we call germany for the moment she be fight on behalf of liberty and of the scrap of paper upon which the freedom of state and individual depend all this will leave a profound effect upon the national consciousness and may even bring home for the first time to the people at large the meaning of political freedom russium be so vast so loose in structure so undeveloped in those means of intercommunication such as road railway newspaper etc which make england like a small village-community in comparison that it take the shock of a great war to draw the whole people together that it have do so no one who have read the papers during the last two month can doubt war as a historical fact have always be beneficial to russia the crimean war lead to the emancipation of the serf the japanese war lead to the establishment of a duma and the present war have already lead to surprising result the consumption of alcohol have be abolish concession have be promise to a reunited poland and except against the unhappy jew in the polish war-area there have be a subsidence throughout the empire of racial antagonism it be the hope of all who love russium and no one who really know she can help love she that these beginning may be crown not only with victory over germany in the field of battle but with victory over the german spirit in the world of idea a victory of which the first-fruit would be the firm establishment of representative government a cleanse of the bureaucratic augean stable and a settlement of the problem of subject nationality upon line of justice and moderation but whatever the outcome may be let we in england be fair to russia the road to fairness lie through understanding and we have grossly misunderstand russium because we have not take the trouble to acquaint ourselves with the fact the real fact as distinct from the newspaper fact of she situation when those fact be realize be it for we to cast the first stone russium need political reform the tremendous task of peter the great need complete the bureaucracy must be crown with representative institution but be russium 's need in the sphere of political reform greater than ours in the sphere of social reform look at we vast miserable slum we sprawl ugly aimless industrial centre inhabit by million who have just enough education to be able to buy they think ready-made through the halfpenny press and just enough leisure for a weekly attendance at the local football match and a annual excursion to blackpool or ramsgate who seldom if ever see the glorious face of nature and when they do gaze into it with blank unrecognising eye whose whole life be one long round of monotony -- monotonous toil monotonous amusement monotonous clothes monotonous brick and mortar -- until the very heaven itself with its trail cloud-armada and its eternal star be forget and the whole universe become a cowl of hodden gray where-under crawling coop they live and die and then look at those other million -- the million of russium -- look at the grand simple life they lead in the field a life of toil indeed but of toil sweet and infinitely vary russium be they country not merely because they live there but because they -- the peasant -- now actually possess by far the greater part of the arable land god be they god not because they have hear of he as some remote be in the Sunday school but because he be very near to they -- in they home in they sacrament and in they heart and so contentment of mind and soul be theirs not because they have climb higher than they fellow whether by the accumulation of knowledge or wealth but because they have discover the secret of existence which be to want little to live in close communion with nature and to die in close communion with god

policy the present war have raise in the mind of many man a question which we as a people will soon be call upon to answer be this war necessary or be it cause by the ambition and foolishness of statesman might it not have be avert if the people of europe have have more control over the way in which foreign policy be carry on out of these question have arise a demand for the democratisation of foreign policy that be for greater popular control over diplomatic negotiation in view of this it become necessary for every british citizen to gain some idea of what foreign policy be and by what principle it should be govern it be the purpose of this chapter to give first some account of the actual meaning of the word foreign policy and then secondly to consider how foreign policy may best be control in the interest of the whole population of the british empire and in the interest of the world at large a the meaning of foreign policy § 1 _ the foreign office _ -- to the ordinary man foreign policy be a affair of mystery and it not unnaturally rouse he suspicion he do not realize what be nevertheless the simple truth that he himself be both the material and the object of all foreign policy the business of the government of a country be to maintain and further the interest of the individual citizen that be the starting-point of all political institution the business of the foreign office be a part of this work of government and consist in the protection of the interest of the individual citizen where those interest depend upon the goodwill of a foreign government but just as in domestic politics the individual citizen be incline to suspect -- too often with truth -- that the government do not give impartial attention to the interest of all the citizen but be preoccupy in protect the interest of powerful and privileged person or group so in foreign policy the individual citizen be particularly prone to believe that the time of the foreign office be take up in further the interest of rich bondholder or powerful capitalist moreover the charge be sometimes hear that some of the most powerful of these capitalist be engage in the manufacture of armament and that the foreign office aim at secure order from foreign government for these firm thus encourage the nation of the world to provide themselves with means of destruction now just as no sensible man will say that government do not often oppress the people under they care so no sensible man will contend that foreign office do not sometimes sin in the same way but let we try to give a accurate picture of the work on which the british foreign office spend its time the organization of the foreign office consist of : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a office situate in down street man by a number of clerk under the direction of the secretary of state for foreign affair -lrb- 2 -rrb- the diplomatic service -- that be to say from three to eight official reside in the capital of each foreign country in the more important country these official be call a embassy and be under the direction of a ambassador in the smaller country they be call a legation and be under the direction of a minister these ambassador and minister receive instruction from and report to the secretary of state for foreign affair and be the mouthpiece of the british government in all business which great britain transact with foreign country -lrb- 3 -rrb- the consular service -- that be to say a large number of official call consul distribute over all the town of the world where british subject have important trade connection or where there be a considerable number of british subject these consul be under the direction of the foreign office and of the embassy or legation in the country where they reside and they business be to assist british trade and protect british subject § 2 _ the work of the foreign office _ -- the work of this whole organization may be divide into four class : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the protection of individual british subject this protection often extend to the most petty matter through the office of a consul and of a embassy or legation flow day by day a continual stream of british subject who be in small difficulty or have small grievance against the official of the country one old lady have lose she luggage a work man be strand without work and want to get back to england a commercial traveller have get into trouble with the custom official and ask for redress but the protection thus give be often concern with very important matter and be constantly employ on behalf of the poorest and the most helpless for instance we official in the united state be constantly occupy in assist british immigrant work man and woman who be suffer hardship under the stringent provision of the united state immigration law -lrb- 2 -rrb- the further of british trade it be the duty of the whole foreign office organization but especially of the consul to give advice to the representative of commercial firm to report opening for the sale of british goods abroad and generally to give assistance to british trade in its competition with foreign trade enquiry will for instance be receive by a consul at a chinese port from a manufacturer of pottery or harness or tin-tack ask what type of goods will be likely to find a market in that locality the consul will then enquire and give such information as he local knowledge enable he to supply or again a foreign country will sometimes make regulation which hinder the importation of english product english oats may for instance be affect with a blight which italy fear may infect she crop if she allow they importation it may then become the duty of the british embassy at rome to make arrangement with the italian government in order that english farmer may not suffer by lose the market for they produce but one important point must be remember because it be too often forget by those who criticise the foreign office there be one general restriction on the activity of the foreign office in assist british trade : no british official be allow to invite or try to persuade any foreign government to give order to british firm whether for war material or for any other article what we have already say apply to the relation between civilised country but the relation between civilised country on the one hand and uncivilised or semi-civilised country on the other hand be very much more difficult in many way difficulty especially arise with regard to commerce many of the less-developed country of the world such as some south american country and china can not like they richer neighbor undertake the development of they own resource they lack money scientific training business ability and so on they therefore give what be call concession to foreign company or capitalist that be the government of the country lease some industry for a term of year to the foreign company the mexican government for instance have lease its oil-well to english american and dutch company and the chinese government have largely confide the construction and management of its railroad to english french and german company now in many country where this happen the government be not strong enough or permanent enough to guarantee proper security of tenure to the foreign company to which it grant a concession very likely some official be bribe to grant the concession to one company and then bribe by another company to cancel it or the government be overthrow by a revolution and its successor cancel the concession it have grant by this mean british workman may be throw out of work and they employment may pass to workman in the united state or germany consequently foreign government -- the government of civilised country -- gradually begin to intervene and give protection to they subject who have concession in such country provide that they have obtain they concession in a respectable and proper manner competition between the different foreign company then grow up they government gradually begin to support they against each other in this competition until at last it become necessary for the different government if bad feeling be to be avoid to try to arrive at some arrangement among themselves fix the way in which the concession grant by this or that semi-civilised country shall be distribute among the subject of the great power something like this have be recently happen in china to a certain extent this line of action seem to be necessary in deal with backward country and it may be make mutually beneficial both to those country themselves and to the commerce of the great power but on the other hand the whole policy be obviously liable to great abuse consequently every self-respecting government know that all matter relate to concession must be treat with the greatest caution and forbearance and that the interest of all concern will be best serve in the long run by gradually help backward country along the path of civilisation and strengthen they government so that they may be able to assume complete control of they own finance and commercial enterprise we have now describe roughly the personal and the commercial work of the foreign office this work cover all the immediate interest of individual british citizen in regard to foreign country if each british subject be protect when abroad and if the trade and industry of the country on which the welfare and livelihood of every individual citizen ultimately depend be foster and safe-guarded then the primary duty of the british government in relation to other government have be discharge but this be not enough if the interest of the individual citizen of great britain be to be permanently secure in relation to foreign country we must be assure that the policy of foreign government be civilised and generally friendly to british subject there must be a general rule of law throughout the world on which british subject can count with assurance of safety and so the foreign office have a third and even more important class of work : -lrb- 3 -rrb- the maintenance of permanent good relation with foreign country these good relation be secure not only by continually friendly communication with foreign government over innumerable question of policy but also by the conclusion of a network of treaty some of they design to establish international co-operation in particular social or economic question such for instance as the exist treaty between great britain and france provide for the mutual payment of compensation under the workman 's compensation law of the two country and other conclude with the object of define the mutual policy of different country in general matter such as the regulation of trade the newest and most important class of treaty be those which like the hague convention and the treaty guarantee the neutrality of belgium and luxemburg attempt to lay down general rule of law which all country agree to observe in other word the office of diplomacy be to secure _ certainty _ in the government of the world so that every man may know what to expect in deal with he fellow-man of a different nationality it be difficult to describe adequately the complexity of this diplomatic work the economic and social system of the world have become so involve and intertwine that there be hardly anything one country can do which do not react in some way on the interest of the subject of another country in every european country and in the united state the government be be more and more call upon to regulate the delicate economic and social machinery on which modern life depend each government adopt a attitude towards such problem which be determine partly by the thought and the belief of its public man and partly by the course of historical development through which each country have pass there thus arise gradually in each country a more or less definite policy with which the country become identify formerly the policy of most european country be mainly confine to question arise in europe itself but in these day of industrial expansion the real aim of they policy generally lie outside europe there be vast region of the world where civilised government do not exist or be only begin to exist but where the citizen of civilised country travel and carry on trade no civilised country can prevent its trader go where they please -- indeed the prosperity of every great country now depend to some extent at least upon its trader find new market for the sale of they goods -- but if these trader go to a uncivilised country like central africa or the interior of china or the south sea island the civilised country not only feel oblige to protect they there but it must also by every claim of justice and humanity prevent they from ill-use the uncivilised and helpless native the horror which accompany the unregulated activity of foreign trader in a savage country may be see from the _ life of john g paton _ a missionary in the new hebride island of the southern pacific these island before they come under the government of any civilised power be visit by european and american trader especially trader in sandalwood the sandalwood trader write paton be as a class the most godless of man by they the poor defenceless native be oppress and rob on every hand and if they offer the slightest resistance they be ruthlessly silence by the musket or revolver the sale of intoxicant opium fire-arm and ammunition by the trader among the new hebridean have become a terrible and intolerable evil it become necessary for the civilised power to prohibit by international regulation the sale of fire-arm and intoxicant in the island such international regulation be always very difficult to enforce and finally the administration of the island be take over by great britain and france who now govern they jointly hence the civilised country of the world have gradually be lead to assume jurisdiction in uncivilised region and have convert many of they into colony or protectorate or sphere of influence by this process the interest of the nation of europe reach out into all the far corner of the earth and constant care and arrangement be need to prevent those interest clash where the interest of the different power do clash in a uncivilised or semi-civilised part of the world a general international agreement be often necessary to put thing straight for instance during recent year the interest of germany france and spain -- and to a less degree those of many other country -- be continually clash in morocco till it become necessary in 1906 to conclude a general international treaty call the algecira act whereby the relation of all the power with regard to morocco be define in great detail § 3 _ the balance of power _ -- it be this continual attempt to arrange matter and to keep the different power clear of each other in order that they interest may not clash which be the real underlie cause to-day of what be know as the balance of power the doctrine of the balance of power grow up at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century when europe be threaten by the policy of aggression and conquest undertake by loui xiv of france from that day onward european statesman have seek to establish a definite european system and to limit the growth of the european state in such a way as to ensure that no state should be so strong as to threaten its neighbor the history of this attempt have be somewhat as follow a coalition of the state of europe be form against the aggression of loui xiv after a series of war a peace be sign at utrecht in 1713 define the boundary of the european state in such a way as to establish equality and a balance of power between they for about ten year european statesman attempt to maintain the system thus set up by means of what have since come to be know as the concert of europe -- that be by means of a series of international congress where opportunity be give for the settlement of dispute between the different state soon however it become impossible to satisfy the ambition of the ruler and people of europe by this mean and the concert of europe break up war follow during which those statesman especially in england who believe in the balance of power seek to prevent any european nation from be overwhelm by its enemy to this end england support austrium against the attack of prussium and then later support prussium against a coalition form by the rest of europe to crush she unfortunately neither england nor france have sufficient strength or courage to prevent the partition of poland between prussium russium and austrium which constitute a fatal violation of the balance of power peace do not return to europe till 1815 when the whole continent have be drive to combine for the overthrow of napoleon at the congress of vienna in that year the concert of europe be revive and for more than thirty year it practically succeed by means of a series of international congress in maintain a stable and balanced system in europe but this concert of europe be the very thing against which the democratic force on the continent finally rebel for the concert take the form of the so-called holy alliance between the ruler of europe whose object be to prevent popular movement from disturb the neat and orderly peace which they have create the system create by the congress of vienna begin to break down in 1848 since then the warlike nationalist and democratic movement in europe follow by the tremendous economic growth of the european nation have make it almost impossible to secure any stable balance of power though a more or less successful attempt to establish such a balance in the affair of south-eastern europe be make at the congress of berlin in 1878 the two hague conference of 1899 and 1907 do little but reveal the mutual fear and suspicion of the european nation though many statesman especially english and american labor sincerely to make the hague convention the guarantee of a lasting peace but it must be observe that the balance of power which be originally a distinctly european conception have now become a world-wide conception in order to secure a balance of power between the european state it be no longer sufficient to settle european frontier it be necessary to settle and as it be dovetail into each other the economic interest of the european country in africa asia and the southern pacific it be also necessary to define the relation of european country to the state in north and south america what be the conclusion to be draw from this history the idea of the balance of power be unsatisfactory you can not really balance live force nation be not dead mass which can be weigh against each other but live growth which expand accord to obscure natural law human law can never stop natural growth growth can only be stop by death and so the balance of power seem to necessitate continual conflict and so at least twice in the last two century the attempt to maintain a stable european system by a peaceful concert of europe have break down once in the holy alliance that concert itself become a intolerable tyranny many man to-day hope to secure peace by re-establish the concert of europe on a democratic basis but it may well be doubt whether any such system can be permanent unless there be a radical reform in the mind and character not only of european statesman but of the european people we shall discuss this later but meanwhile we may say this at least a balance of power be a imperfect conception it be a rough and ready -- almost barbarous -- policy the best that can be say for it be that no alternative policy have be devise or at least none have succeed every one of we who have a spark of idealism believe that the day will come when it shall give place to some more perfect system but at the present day not only international politics but also home politics be govern by this idea of a balance of power no democracy have yet be able to establish itself in any country except by virtue of a continual conflict between class and class between interest and interest between capital and labor and international conflict be but the reflection of the domestic conflict within each state both be continual unsuccessful attempt to reach a stable equilibrium and they can only be end by a true fusion of heart and will § 4 _ the estimation of national force _ -- it have be necessary to undertake this long discussion in order to give a more or less clear idea of the work do by diplomacy in maintain a stable international system arise out of this we have now to consider the fourth class of work -- and the most difficult -- which the foreign office have to perform for want of a better name we may call it -- -lrb- 4 -rrb- the estimation of national force nation be not mere agglomeration of individual they have each they own character they own feeling and they own life science have do little to determine the law of they growth but as we have see each nation do grow reach out slowly -- almost insensibly -- in this or that direction and gather to itself new interest which in they turn give new impulse to its growth perhaps the best simile that we can use for the foreign policy of the world be that of a rather tangle garden where creeper be continually grow and take root in new soil and where life be therefore always threatening and be threaten by new life the point be that we be deal with _ life _ -- with its growth and decay not with the movement of piece on a chequer-board now the foreign office largely exist in order to watch this growth and like a gardener to train and lead it in direction where it can expand without danger but for this work intimate knowledge be necessary -- knowledge not so much of the personal character or policy of those who govern the different nation but knowledge of the character the economic need the belief the feeling and the aspiration of the half-dumb million who form and ultimately determine the life of each nation the diplomatist must study every political and social movement which go on in a nation he must estimate the effect which the national system of education be have on the mind of the nation he must form a idea of the lesson which the government of he own country should learn from the government of other country whether it be for instance lesson in constitutional government or in municipal sanitation and he must above all be able to warn he government of the danger to he own country which the growth of foreign country seem to entail in order that peaceful measure may be take in time to prevent a collision this then be a rough account of the actual work of diplomacy it be not a full account there be many wrong thing do which deserve criticism but which we have not have space to mention there be also much self-sacrificing and thankless work do by diplomatist and consul in distant part of the world -- much seeming drudgery which can hope for no reward -- many honorable service render to the public of which the public never hear but the above account will suffice to give a rough idea of the organization with which we be deal and we may now pass on to consider the question of how this organization should be manage and control b the democratisation of foreign policy this phrase be rapidly become a political catchword as such it require to be approach with the utmost caution before go further it be necessary to test the assumption underlie it and to inquire how far they really correspond to the fact § 1 _ democracy and peace _ -- first of all the main assumption make by englishman who advocate the democratisation of foreign policy be that international peace would thereby be assure true the extension of the democratic principle be to many man a end in itself quite apart from the question whether it tend to peace but great mass of man be not move to make political demand merely by theoretical consideration it be the pressure of definite and imminent evil which arouse they to action in the case of england the demand for greater democratic control in the sphere of foreign policy arise in large measure from the sudden realisation in the late summer of 1911 at the time of the so-called agadir crisis that war between this country and germany be a possibility with which english statesman and the english people have to reckon we have feel the breath of war actually on we cheek and a large section of english sentiment revolt from it a demand be raise for a democratic policy of peace three year later on August 3 1914 when parliament meet to decide the happiness or suffering of the quarter of the human race comprise in the british empire the same demand be voice in a series of speech which accurately express the belief that peace be the policy of the people while war be the secret aim of they ruler mr t edmund harvey mp speak as follow : i be convince that this war for the great mass of the country of europe and not for we own country alone be no people 's war it be a war that have be make by man in high place by diplomatist work in secret by bureaucrat who be out of touch with the people of the world who be the remnant of a older evil civilisation which be disappear by gradual and peaceful method mr ponsonby mp speak in the same sense : i trust that even though it may be late the foreign secretary will use every endeavor to the very last moment disregard the tone of message and the manner of ambassador but look to the great central interest of humanity and civilisation to keep this country in a state of peace democracy mean peace -- can we accept this assumption contrast be sometimes illuminating and it may be well to turn from the parliamentary debate of August 3 to a article write sixty-two year ago in a english review by the greatest democrat of he time in April 1852 mazzinus publish in the _ westminster review _ a appeal to england to intervene on the continent in favor of the revolutionary movement in progress there since 1848 the following be a extract from that article : the menace of the foreigner weigh upon the smaller state the last spark of european liberty be extinguish under the dictatorial veto of the retrograde power england -- the country of elizabeth and cromwell -- have not a word to say in favor of the principle to which she owe she existence if england persist in maintain this neutral passive selfish part she will have to expiate it a european transformation be inevitable when it shall take place when the struggle shall burst forth at twenty place at once when the old combat between fact and right be decide the people will remember that england have stand by a inert immovable sceptical witness of they suffering and effort england will find herself some day a third-rate power and to this she be be bring by a want of foresight in she statesman the nation must rouse herself and shake off the torpor of she government mr ponsonby appeal in the name of the people to sir edward gray to stand aloof from european war mazzinus appeal in the name of the people to the respectable peaceable middle class of england to forsake cobden 's pacifist doctrine and throw england 's sword into the scale of european revolution -- it be a strange contrast which serve to remind we that the word democracy so lightly bandy about by political party have many different meaning and have stand for many different policy it may be roughly say that it stand for internationalism in 1792 when france claim as she mission the liberation of all nation under the tricolor it stand for nationalism in 1848 in the mouth of mazzinus kossuth and the german constitutional party to-day it again stand for internationalism in the more advanced country of europe but be we justified as yet in call this more than a phase in the development of democratic doctrine it be a very difficult question which it would be presumptuous to try to answer offhand all we have try to show here be that on the whole the assumption as to the peaceful tendency of a democratic foreign policy be a doubtful one on which we must to some extent reserve we judgment § 2 _ foreign policy and popular force _ -- the above consideration will help we to appreciate at its true value the second main assumption which lie behind the demand for increase democratic control of foreign policy -- namely the assumption that the stuff of international politics be at present spin from the design of individual statesman and have no relation to the need of the people they govern state thus this idea will not bear examination for a moment the doctrine of the economic interpretation of history which have receive perhaps its most emphatic expression in the teaching of marxian socialist be now in one form or another accept by all think man but economics be after all a rough name for the sum of the ordinary need and effort of every single human being and the economic interpretation of history mean that the history of the world be in the long run determine by the cumulative force of these humble need and effort this and this alone be the real stuff of international politics statesman may attempt to find system but the only real force in international as in domestic politics be the education of the individual man 's desire it be indeed open to any critic to say that we present capitalist economic system be responsible for war because it dam up and divert from they true channel the need and the effort of the mass of mankind but to this a englishman may fairly answer that the free trade system under which we capitalist organization have reach its greatest development be build up by the manchester school with the sincere and avowed object of introduce universal peace cobden avowed this object clearly : i see he say in free trade that which shall act on the moral world as the law of gravitation in the universe draw man together thrust aside the antagonism of race and creed and language and unite we in the bond of eternal peace i believe that the desire and motive for large and mighty empire for gigantic army and mighty navy will die away yet in spite of these aspiration great war have come to england not once but at least three time since these word be speak and armament be immeasurably larger than ever before let we understand one thing clearly in connection with the present war mr ponsonby in the word already quote implored sir e gray to look to the great central interest of humanity and civilisation and to preserve the neutrality of england in those interest but at the moment at which he speak the eye of english statesman be look at one thing alone it be not a question of what french statesman expect they to do the british government have explain quite clearly to french statesman that they must not expect armed support from england this fact have be make clear to the french foreign office long before in a series of conversation between the statesman and it have be embody in a letter from sir e gray to the french ambassador but when the shadow of war actually fall on france these conversation and this letter fade into the background it be no longer a question of what the french president expect from the king of england it be a question of what jacque roturier artisan in the street of pari know that the german be on the frontier and might be drop they shell into pari in a fortnight expect from john smith shopkeeper in the east indium dock road london safe behind the english channel from all the horror of war that be not rhetorically but in all soberness of fact the real international obligation on August 3 1914 for though treaty be make by statesman they be in the long run interpret not by statesman but by the public opinion which become slowly centre on they -- by the hope and fear of million of work man and woman who have never read the term of the treaty but to whom it have become the symbol of a friendship on which they can draw in case of need the magistrate may write the marriage line but the marriage become what the husband and wife make it -- a thing far deeper and more binding than any legal contract in the light of these consideration we can establish one point of supreme importance in deal with foreign policy -- namely that the cause of war be very different from the immediate occasion of war when the british government at the outbreak of the present war publish a white paper contain the diplomatic correspondence between July 20 and August 4 1914 they be publish evidence as to the immediate occasion of war -- namely the austrian ultimatum of July 23 to serbia which bring on the war in the twelve day which intervene between the delivery of that ultimatum and the declaration of war between england and germany the negotiation on which hang the immediate fate of europe be it be true conduct by a few lead statesman but it be of little use to argue whether or not these negotiation be conduct ill or well for they be not the real _ cause _ of the war the cause of the war must be seek in the slow development of force which can be trace back for year and even for century it be comparatively futile for parliament to discuss whether this or that despatch or telegram be wise or unwise the real question to be ask be -- what produce the crowd in vienna surge round the serbian legation at the end of June and round the russian embassy at the end of July what produce the slow patient sympathy for the balkan people and hatred for austrium in the heart of million of russian peasant what produce the servian nationalist movement above all what produce that strange sentiment throughout germany which could honestly regard the invasion of belgium as justifiable to answer those question we have to estimate the force of the most heterogeneous factor in history : -- for instance on the one hand the slow break-up of the turkish empire extend over more than two century which have allow the cauldron of the slavonic balkan people to boil up through the thin crust of foreign domination and on the other hand the gradual development of the whole system of german state education and the character of the german newspaper which have turn the eye of german public opinion in upon itself and have exclude from public teaching and from the formation of thought every breath of fresh air from the outside world until at last german public sentiment through extreme and incessant self-contemplation have lose the calmness and simplicity which be once the strength of the german character no man can allot the responsibility for these thing spread as they do over generation but assuredly the responsibility do not rest with the half-dozen minister for foreign affair who be in power in July 1914 if we be right in what we have say above then the phrase the democratization of foreign policy take on a new meaning it do not mean merely the introduction into foreign policy of any set of democratic institution it mean the realisation by both statesman and people that foreign policy be already in its essence a fundamentally democratic thing and that the success or failure of any line of action depend not upon the desire of politician but upon the mighty force which move and determine the life of people at present the statesman do not realize this sufficiently and hence come much futile and aimless talking and writing among politician who fancy that what they say or write to each other in they study can determine the course of the world in order to enable diplomatist to discharge all the duty we have already enumerate under the head of the estimation of national force they need to have a better training and a fuller knowledge of the life and social movement both of they own country and of foreign country the royal commission on the civil service be still consider when war break out how this could be accomplish it be too long a question to enter on here but it may safely be say that the more the problem be examine the more do it appear to be like the wider problem of the whole body of 200000 civil servant in the unite kingdom a question of national education and not a mere matter of government regulation and democratic institution what be require in the foreign office as in the whole british civil service have be well express by mr graham walla in he book _ human nature in politics _ : however able we official be and however vary they origin the danger of the narrowness and rigidity which have hitherto so generally result from official life would still remain and must be guard against by every kind of encouragement to free intellectual development § 3 _ foreign policy and education _ -- but if statesman do not sufficiently realize the strength of exist popular force in foreign policy it be equally true that the people themselves do not realize it the people of every country be incline to think that they can alter the destiny of nation by oust one foreign minister from power and set up another they think that speech and the resolution pass by congress can change fundamental economic fact they think that mere expression of mutual goodwill can take the place of knowledge and they forget that no nation can shake itself free in a moment from the historical development which have form it just as no man can wholly shake himself free from the character which he have inherit from he ancestor indeed all we phrase -- we whole attitude of mind -- show how little we as a people realize popular force we commonly speak for instance of russium as if nothing in that vast country have any influence on foreign affair except the opinion of a few bureaucrat in petrograd we sympathy for or hostility to russium be determine by we opinion of the russian bureaucracy and we never spare a thought for the hope and fear and the dumb but ardent belief of million of russian peasant we be apt to dismiss they from we mind as ignorant and superstitious villager tyrannise over by the tsar without trouble to enquire narrowly into the real fact of russian life we thus make precisely the same mistake that diplomatist too often make we forget that the mass of peasant who flow every year on pilgrimage to the shrine of they religion constitute a more vital fact in the history of the world than the deliberation of the duma or the decision of police magistrate here we have a lesson to learn from germany for german statesman strangely enough have take immense trouble to make they policy a democratic one the whole german nation be behind they because for year and year they have teach the nation through the school the university and the press they own reading of history and they own idea of what true civilisation be they have adapt they teaching to the fundamental characteristic and to the history of the german people they have take pain to ally the interest alike of capital and labor to they policy and to fuse the whole nation by a uniform national education and by a series of paternal social reform impose from above the real strength and danger of germany be not what she statesman or soldier _ do _ but what german themselves _ believe _ we be fight not a army but a false idea and nothing will defeat a false idea but the knowledge of the truth when this war be over whatever its outcome may be we must try to introduce a new era into the history of the world but we father and we father ' father have try to do this same thing and we shall not succeed if we go about the work in a spirit of self-sufficiency and hasty pride only knowledge of the truth will enable we to succeed knowledge of the truth be not a easy thing it be a question of laborious thought mental discipline the humility which be content to learn and the moral courage which can face the truth when it be learn how be we to gain these thing first of all by school university class -- all the machinery of we national and private education then by the same means as popular government employ in other matter -- by discussion by debate in parliament by criticism of the government now these means be not employ at present partly because it be fear that criticism of the government in matter of foreign policy will weaken its hand in deal with foreign nation this be a just fear if criticism merely spring from the critic ' personal liking or prejudice but no such evil effect need be fear if the criticism spring from deep thought from knowledge of the fact and from the patience and wisdom which think and knowledge bring but partly also effective discussion of foreign politics do not exist because we be more interested in home politics we really have if we care to use it as much democratic control over the foreign office under we constitution as over any government department for the foreign office like every other department be under the control of a member of parliament elect by the people but we be more interested in social reform in labor legislation and in constitutional reform than in foreign politics and so it be on question of home policy that we make and unmake government and when we discuss whether a conservative or a liberal government ought to be in power we never think what effect the change would have on foreign policy if the democracy be to take a real part in foreign politics it must recognize that great responsibility mean great sacrifice we must be content to think a little less of we internal social reform and give more of we attention to the very difficult question which arise beyond the channel and beyond the atlantic ocean we must live constantly in the consciousness that the world to-day be one community and that in everything we do as a people we bear a responsibility not to ourselves alone but to the population of the british empire as a whole and to the family of nation but when we have really set ourselves to understand and discharge the responsibility of foreign policy how shall we the people of this country make we opinion effective how can we be sure that the foreign office will carry out a policy correspond to the consider conviction which we as a people have form as already state we have in we hand the same means of parliamentary control over foreign policy as over internal policy parliament can overthrow a government whose policy it disapprove and it can refuse to grant supplies for the carry out of such a policy short of this the people can express through parliament its view as to the way in which foreign policy should be conduct and generally minister will bow in this as in other matter to the clearly express view of parliament we have in fact recently see a striking example of this when after the international crisis of 1911 the country clearly express the opinion that no secret engagement should be enter into with any power which would force great britain to go to war in support of that power the prime minister state and have repeat he statement emphatically on several subsequent occasion that the government of this country neither have enter nor would enter into any such secret engagement and that any treaty entail warlike obligation on this country would be lay before parliament this have now become a fix and recognize fact in british policy and it be not too much to say that like other constitutional change under the british system of government it be rapidly become a part of the unwritten constitution of the country but many people would like to go beyond this and lay down that no treaty between great britain and another country shall be valid until it have be vote by parliament many country have provision of this kind in they constitution for instance the constitution of the united state provide that all treaty must be ratify by a two-third majority of the senate and the french constitution contain the follow provision : the president of the republic negotiate and ratify treaty he bring they to the knowledge of the chamber so soon as the interest and the safety of the state permit treaty of peace and of commerce treaty which impose a claim on the finances of the state those which relate to the personal status and property rights of french subject abroad do not become valid until they have be vote by the two chamber no cession exchange or increase of territory can take place except by virtue of a law such constitutional provision may be good in they way and it may be that we should copy they but the question be one of secondary importance whether treaty must actually be ratify by parliament or merely lay before parliament for a expression of its opinion as be commonly do in this country the parliament and people of great britain will have control over foreign policy just in the measure that they take a keen interest in it if they take a keen interest no statesman dependent for he position on the vote of the electorate will dare to embody in a treaty a policy of which they disapprove while if they do not take a adequate interest no amount of constitutional provision will enable they to exercise a intelligent control over the action of statesman the same may be say of another expedient adopt in many country namely the appointment by parliament of committee on foreign affair with power to call for papers and examine minister on they policy democratic government both in foreign and internal affair have hitherto rest on the idea that parliament should have adequate control over the principle on which policy be conduct but must to a large extent leave the detail of administration to the executive department which be control by the minister of the crown parliament whether through committee or otherwise will never be able to follow or control all diplomatic negotiation any more than it can control all the detail of the administration necessary to carry out a complicated law like the insurance act and committee of parliament however useful will have no influence unless the people of the country so recognize they responsibility in foreign politics that they will demand from the man whom they elect to parliament a judgment and a knowledge of foreign affair at least as sound and well base as they now require in the case of internal affair it will be see that this impose a very difficult task on the british electorate how be they to weigh foreign affair and internal affair against each other what be they to do if they approve the internal policy of a government but disapprove of its foreign policy or _ vice versa _ be we for instance to sacrifice what we believe to be we duty in foreign affair in order that we may keep in power a government which be carry out what we believe to be a sound policy of internal social reform it be here it would seem that some reform be really need there be one solution : namely to separate the control of domestic affair on the one hand and foreign affair on the other place domestic affair in the hand of a parliament and and a cabinet who will stand or fall by they internal policy alone and entrust foreign affair to a imperial parliament and a imperial cabinet form of representative not of great britain alone but of the whole british empire this be a idea which merit the most careful consideration by the people of the unite kingdom for it may well be doubt whether any real popular control of foreign policy be possible until some such division of function take place one word in conclusion if it be true that domestic policy and foreign policy be separate function of government it be also true that the domestic policy of a country in the long run determine its foreign policy international peace can never be attain between nation tear with internal dissension international justice will remain a dream so long as political party and school of thought dispute over the meaning of justice in domestic affair a true ideal of peace must embrace the class struggle as well as international war if we desire a concert of europe which shall be base on true freedom and not on tyranny it behove we to realize we ideal first in england and to raise we country itself above the political and social conflict and hatred which have form so large and so sordid a part of we domestic history for the last decade bibliography it be difficult to give a list of book illustrate foreign policy in general the list give in other chapter sufficiently illustrate the various problem with which foreign policy to-day have to deal the diplomacy of a century ago be well illustrate by the _ diary and correspondence of the earl of malmesbury _ 4 vol 1844 -lrb- out of print -rrb- for the diplomacy of the middle of the nineteenth century when the present national force of europe be be create the follow biography be useful : _ life of lord stratford de redcliffe _ by lane-poole 2 vol 1888 _ life of lord granville _ by lord fitzmaurice 2 vol 1905 _ life of lord clarendon _ by sir herbert maxwell 2 vol 1913 _ life of lord lyon _ by lord newton 2 vol 1898 _ life of cavor _ by roscoe thayer 2 vol 1911 _ bismarck 's reflection _ there be many study of the diplomatic problem of the present day but as they deal with history in the make they be to be read for the general survey they give of force at work rather than as authoritative statement a very comprehensive survey of all the complexity of international politics will be find in fullerton 's _ problem of power _ -lrb- 1913 -rrb- 7 6d net the actual workings of diplomacy may best be see in the white book of diplomatic correspondence periodically publish by the foreign office such for instance as the successive volume of _ correspondence respect the affair of persium _ perhaps the best idea of the actual labor of foreign relation can be gain by consult such compilation as hertslet 's _ commercial treaty _ -- 23 vol 1827-1905 -- which be a record of work actually complete on the staffing of the foreign office and the diplomatic service see the fifth report of the royal commission on the civil service -lrb- cd 7748 -rrb- just publish -lrb- 5-1\/2 d -rrb- chapter vii the issue of the war march ahead of the idea of you age and it will follow you : go with they and you can feel at ease : remain behind they and you be lose -- napoleon iii § 1 _ be there a idea behind the war _ -- the object of the precede chapter have be to provide the historic background without which it be impossible to understand either the motive of we opponent or the event which lead up to they quarrel it be now necessary to attempt a survey of the issue raise by the war both as concern europe as a whole and the individual nation which form its component part this be a task of no small difficulty for just as it be true to say that no war in the previous history of mankind have ever be wage on so huge a scale as this so it be also true to say that the issue raise by it be vaster and more varied than those of any previous european conflict it be as though by the pressure of a electric button some giant sluice have be open unchaining force over which mortal man can hardly hope to recover control and whose action it be wellnigh impossible to foresee yet complex as be the problem before we it be essential that we should face it bravely there be grave danger lest just as we have be rush into this war -lrb- through no fault of ours as the diplomatic correspondence abundantly prove -rrb- so we may at a give moment be rush out of it without have reach any very clear idea as to what issue be involve and how far we vital interest have be affect the essence of the problem before we be to discover whether there be a idea behind this war -- whether on we own side or on that of the enemy a dangerous question this -- a question pose again and again by the jingo and the fanatic of history and invariably answer accord to the dictate of they own convenience and yet a question which we dare not shirk a question which a carlyle a ruskin a william morri would not have hesitate to formulate do britain stand for a idea be it true that we be fight in the main for the cause of liberty and democracy for progress in europe and the world at large and if this be really true to-day how can we best ensure that it shall still be true at the close of this long war if as we hope and pray victory crown the arm of the ally it be a idea that nerve britain for the struggle against napoleon it be a idea that inspired germany in the great uprising of 1813 against napoleon it be a idea that bring the balkan league into be and carry its army in triumph to salonica and adrianople freedom unity liberation such be the form which that idea take : the determination of a free people to resist a upstart despot 's design of world-dominion the enthusiasm of a divided nation for the dream of national unity the longing of race which have but recently win they own freedom to emancipate they kinsman from a alien and oppressive yoke in each of these struggle error and even crime be commit by the victor and yet it be a thousand time true to assert that the victorious idea represent in each case the triumph of civilisation to-day the position be equally clear in oppose germany 's claim to override international treaty obligation to suit the convenience of she military strategist in associate ourselves with belgium and serbium in they vindication of the rights of the smaller nation we be not merely resist a fresh bid for world-dominion on the part of a single power but be challenge the theory that might be superior to right in the political world § 2 _ the aim of british statesmanship _ -- mr asquith on September 19 define as follow the three main aim of british statesmanship in enter upon war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- to vindicate the sanctity of treaty obligation and what be properly call the public law of europe -lrb- 2 -rrb- to assert and to enforce the independence of free state relatively small and weak against the encroachment and the violence of the strong and -lrb- 3 -rrb- to withstand as we believe in the best interest not only of we own empire but of civilisation at large the arrogant claim of a single power to dominate the development of the destiny of europe in speak thus mr asquith have no intention of place britain upon a moral pedestal or of suggest that we have ever enjoy a monopoly of political right deal every nation have blot upon its scutcheon and the cynic may point to the irish union the destruction of the danish fleet the cyprus convention as proof that we have richly earn the name of perfidious albion let we forego the patriotic retort which would fling in prussium 's tooth such incident as the conquest of silesium the partition of poland the em telegram the seizure of kiaochau but let we while admit we shortcoming in the past nail we color to the mast and insist that this war shall never degenerate into one of mere revenge or aggrandisement that the fate of the nation of europe shall be decide so far as possible in accordance with they own aspiration rather than the territorial ambition of dynasty or racial clique be it then possible when consider the line of settlement to lay down any general principle the europe which we have know have go beyond recall the new europe which be come to birth will be scarcely recognisable to those who have know its predecessor its political racial social economic outlook will be radically change let we then meet fate halfway and admit boldly that we _ want _ a new europe but let we bear in mind the fiery process by which a huge bell be forge and the fate which befall the impatient apprentice who open the furnace door too soon the prussian leader to whom war be a ideal and a program be entitle if fortune should desert they to maneuver for a draw for they would console themselves with the hope of win a subsequent match but to we who regard war as a hateful necessity from which we do not shrink but which we do everything in we power to avert -- to we there can be no thought of relinquish we task until there be a reasonable prospect of a really lasting settlement we should need no prompt from we statesman to realize that this must be a fight to a finish there must be no reversion to the _ status quo _ that accurse device of a worn-out diplomacy with its inevitable seed of new quarrel and yet another armageddon public law nationality and a general reduction of armament -lrb- as distinguish from complete disarmament -rrb- be the three foundation stone of the new era as already envisage in the public utterance of those who have some right to speak for the triple entente let we then endeavor to apply these principle to the various problem raise by the war it be obvious that they application depend upon the victory of the ally if we be defeat public law will have lose its value for the german will have assert they right to violate its fundamental provision the idea of nationality will have receive its death-blow for not only will the independence of several of the smaller nation have be destroy but germany will have reassert she right to dominate she own minor nationality and to drain the life-blood of the 26 million slav of austria-hungary in a conflict with they own slavonic kinsman finally all hope of reduce armament will have be explode since the theory of blood and iron will have attain its fullest expression in the virtual domination of a single power on land and sea regret or misgiving we may have but the time for they utterance have long since pass the british nation must have no illusion defeat mean the downfall of the empire and the reduction of britain to the position of a second-rate power either we shall emerge victorious or for all practical purpose we shall not emerge at all even if _ we _ shrink from a fight to a finish we enemy can be rely upon to persist to the bitter end it be for this reason only and not because i underestimate for a moment the vast resource the splendid organization the military valor of germany that i restrict myself in the follow page to a consideration of the possible effect of victory rather than of defeat it would be the height of folly to anticipate victory before it be achieve but it be essential that we should be prepare for all possible contingency and this involve a careful survey of the various factor in a extraordinarily complicated situation § 3 _ britain and germany _ -- in the forefront of the discussion stand we quarrel with germany what be to be we future relation with germany after the war if there be anything in the assertion that we be fight for the cause of liberty and progress it can only mean that we be fight a system rather than a nation -- prussian militarism and bureaucracy but not german civilisation we have to go still further and consider the motive power behind that iron system sit in we little island we be apt to forget what it mean to possess a purely artificial frontier of 400 mile and to see just beyond it a neighbor numbering 171000000 inhabitant in a earlier stage of civilisation and capable of be set in motion by cause which no longer operate in the western world if the final settlement be to be just and last the demand of the victor must be adjust to the minimum not the maximum of they own vital interest for britain the central problem must inevitably be : what be to be the position of the german navy if we be successful in this war be anything even remotely resemble disarmament to be attain unless that navy be render innocuous be it conceivable that even if britain accept the _ status quo _ a victorious russium could ever tolerate a situation which secure to germany the naval supremacy of the baltic and the possibility of bottle russian sea-trade even the opening month of the war have show what ought always to have be obvious that sea-power differ from land-power in one vital respect : military supremacy can be share between several powerful state but naval supremacy be one and indivisible in this war we shall either maintain and reassert we command of the sea or we shall lose it : share it with germany we shall not because we can not again what be to be the fate of german shipping and german colony can we not curtail germany 's war navy while respect she mercantile marine be it either expedient or necessary to exact the uttermost farthing in the colonial sphere in the event of victory it be obvious that just as germany offer to respect french territory in europe at the expense of the french colonial empire so the ally if victorious might divide the german colony between they by so do however we shall provide in the eye of the german nation a complete justification of william ii 's naval policy one of the most widespread argument among educate german -lrb- include those friendly to this country -rrb- have always be that german colony and shipping be at the mercy of a stronger sea-power and that therefore germany only hold she sea-trade on sufferance if as a result of the war we take from she all that we can we shall ingrain this point of view in every german we should thus tend to perpetuate the old situation with its intolerable competition of armament unless indeed we could reduce germany to complete bankruptcy -- a thing which be almost inconceivable to those who know she resource and which would deprive we of one of we most valuable customer on the other hand we must of course remember that any extra-european territorial change depend not merely upon the attitude of britain and she ally but upon the wish of the dominion even in the event of victory it be still not london alone that will decide the fate of new guinea of samoa or of german south-west africa the last word will probably be speak by australium new zealand and south africa and it be improbable that any one of the three will consent to the restoration of territory which they have occupy it be only in the case of german colony which border upon british crown colony _ -lrb- eg _ togoland cameroon or east africa -rrb- that the decision will rest entirely with the european government at this stage it would be absurd to suggest even the bare outline of a settlement but it be well to emphasize the fact that it involve not only the unite kingdom but the dominion and that on its solution depend the future development of the british empire in other word the war can only result in the downfall of the empire or in the achievement of imperial federation and a further democratisation of the central government § 4 _ nationality and the german empire _ -- finally there be a still graver question be germany if defeat to lose territory _ in europe _ and if so would it be either possible or expedient to compensate she in other direction for such a loss the application of the principle of nationality to the german empire would affect its territory in three direction -- alsace-lorraine schleswig-holstein and posen let we very briefly consider these three problem -lrb- illustration : the franco-german frontier _ boundary of france 1815-1871 _ and _ boundary of france 1871-1914 _ -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the population of the two province of alsace and lorraine be mainly german by race and language but none the less it have become by 1870 almost entirely french in feeling as the result of its long union with france the german in reannex the province after the war be actuate almost equally by reason of sentiment and strategy they welcome the recovery of a section of they race which have be wrest from they by the brutal aggression of loui xiv and the dynastic policy of he successor they also desire to secure they western frontier against the possible attack of france which under the third empire be still most emphatically a aggressive power in draw the new frontier they include for purely strategic reason a small portion of western lorraine round the fortress of metz which be admittedly as french as champagne or picardy from 1871 till 1911 alsace-lorraine be govern as a direct appanage of the imperial crown in the latter year it receive a constitution but nothing even remotely resemble self-government contrary to the expectation of most german the two province have not become german in sentiment indeed the unconciliatory method of prussium have steadily increase they estrangement despite they share in the commercial prosperity of the empire those who know intimately the undercurrent of feeling in alsace-lorraine be unanimous in assert that if before last July a impartial plebiscite without fear of the consequence could have be take among the inhabitant a overwhelming majority would have vote for reunion with france but have once be the battleground of the two nation and live in permanent dread of a repetition of the tragedy the leader of political thought in alsace and lorraine favor a less drastic solution they know that germany would not relinquish she hold nor france renounce she aspiration without another armed struggle but they believe that the grant of real autonomy within the empire such as would place they on a equal footing with würtemberg or baden would render they position tolerable and by remove the chief source of friction between france and germany create the groundwork for more cordial and lasting relation between germany and the two western power -lrb- 1 -rrb- now that the nightmare of war have once more fall upon they the situation have radically change and there can be no question that in the event of a french victory the province would elect to return to france the fact that several of they lead politician have flee to france and identify themselves with the french cause be symptomatic though doubtless not conclusive that the government of the republic if victorious will make the retrocession of alsace-lorraine its prime condition of peace be as certain as anything can be certain in the seething pot to which triumphant militarism have reduce unhappy europe it may then seem merely pedantic to refer to a alternative solution and yet there be unquestionably a great deal to be say in favor of form the two province into a independent state or better still unite they in federal union with luxemburg and belgium thus would be realize that middle kingdom which so many effort have be make to create from the day of charlemagne onward henceforward the fate of alsace-lorraine would be neither french nor german they would become a neutral clearing-house for the two culture which have both come to be so inextricably bind up with the life and tradition of the border race at the same time the most fertile source of friction between france and germany would be remove and the two country would no longer glare at each other across a frontier bristle with fortification -lrb- footnote 1 : this ideal be be actively pursue by many thoughtful people on both side of the frontier only last June i be discuss it at some length with a prominent alsatian deputy and various other friend in berlin -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- the problem of schleswig-holstein present far less difficulty if treat on a basis of nationality much have be write about the enormity of prussium 's treatment of denmark in 1848 and 1863 but the plain truth be that the great majority of the population of the two duchy be as enthusiastic in favor of union with they german kinsman farther south as the population of alsace-lorraine be reluctant to be tear from france the whole of holstein and much the greater part of schleswig always be and be pure german by race unfortunately prussium in annex territory which be as german as kent be english also acquire a portion of north schleswig which be as unquestionably danish alike by blood and by sentiment hence a complete revision of frontier on a racial basis would certainly involve the cession to denmark of the extreme eastern portion of schleswig as far as and include the port of flensburg to-day however this question be complicate by strategic consideration due to the creation of the kiel canal as a almost impregnable naval base the suggestion have already be seriously put forward that denmark should be allow in the event of germany 's defeat to extend she territory as far as the north bank of the canal which would thus become a international highway for peaceful commerce possibly under a general guarantee of neutrality whether such a present might not prove a very grave embarrassment to denmark and whether the guarantee would be more effectual than the treaty which secure belgian independence be question which depend mainly upon the mood of the people of europe after they be tire of shed each other 's blood but it be well to realize that the question of the kiel canal be one which may very possibly lead to a prolongation of the war and which as i have already hint russium will not allow to rest even if britain should hesitate to complete the work -lrb- 3 -rrb- the third point at which on a basis of racial redistribution a defeat germany must inevitably suffer territorial loss be the polish district on she eastern frontier the present kingdom of prussium include 3328750 pole among its subject mainly in the former duchy of posen but also in silesium and along the southern edge of west and east prussium -lrb- know as mazurian and kasubian -rrb- the pronouncedly anti-polish policy pursue by the german government for over twenty year past have arouse deep and insurmountable hatred against prussium in the heart of the pole who even in the day when berlin be relatively conciliatory towards they have never relinquish they passionate belief in the resurrection of they country above all the attempt to denationalise the eastern march by expropriation colonisation of german and other still cruder method have not only be in the main unsuccessful but it have rouse the pole to formidable counter-effort in the sphere of finance and agrarian co-operation this coincide with remarkable change in russian poland which have rapidly become the chief industrial center of the russian empire economic cause have tone down the bitterness which russium 's cruel repression of polish aspiration have inspire and to-day prussium be unquestionably regard by every pole as a far more deadly enemy than even the russian autocracy the more so as the conviction have steadily gain ground that the polish policy of petrograd have be unduly subject to the direction of berlin while then the pole look upon the promise from either of these two capital with pardonable suspicion and reserve it be certain that to-day such hope as they may entertain from foreign aid center more and more upon russium any attempt to reconstruct the kingdom of poland whether as a independent state or as seem more practicable as a autonomous unit within the empire of the tsar would inevitably deprive prussium of the greater part of the duchy of posen -lrb- except the three or four western kreise or district in which the german element predominate -rrb- a strip of eastern silesium from the upper reach of the vistulum northwards and a further strip of territory in east prussium extend from near the fortress of thorn along the mazurian lake -lrb- in fact the scene of the opening battle of the present war -rrb- polish extremist however not content with these indubitably polish district be already lay claim to the lower reach of the vistulum and to danzig as the port of the historical poland and there be a further tendency in certain russian circle to regard the whole province of east prussium as part of the natural spoil of war and yet it be obvious that the annexation of danzig -lrb- 1 -rrb- one of the bulwark of the old hanseatic league and of königsberg the cradle of the prussian crown and of modern german philosophy would be a flagrant violation of that principle of nationality which the ally have inscribe upon they banner the province of which königsberg be the capital be to-day whatever it may have be in the twelfth century as german as any portion of the german empire moreover it be the stronghold of junkerdom that arrogant but virile squirearchy which still form the backbone of the old prussian system and while it be doubtless the desire to undermine this caste by rob it of hearth and home that prompt such drastic scheme of conquest it can not be too clearly realize that we should not only be guilty of a monstrous injustice in lend we support but should be sowing the seed of a new and even thornier problem than that of alsace-lorraine it would moreover be a superfluous injustice since it be perfectly possible to create on broad racial line a new frontier at least as natural as that which divide russium and germany to-day -lrb- footnote 1 : strictly speak danzig though under polish suzerainty till 1772 have always be a german town enjoy complete autonomy it share the fame of hamburg and lübeck as one of the greatest of the mediaeval hansa town -rrb- such be the change which a application of the principle of nationality involve let we then be under no illusion they be change such as can only be extract from a germany which have virtually cease to exist as a military power -- a contingency which be still remote to-day and which can only be attain by enormous sacrifice in blood and resource it be only by readjustment and compensation in other direction that the german nation could be induce even to consider a revision of frontier and from the nature of thing such compensation can only have one meaning -- the break-up of austria-hungary § 5 _ the future of austria-hungary _ -- for many year this break-up have be foretell by political pessimist inside and outside the habsburg dominion and by many interested agitator both in central and in western europe the present writer on the other hand have always regard austria-hungary as a organism full of infinite possibility of progress and culture a state model upon that diversity of type which lord acton hold to be the surest guarantee of liberty those who affect to treat it as moribund under-estimated both the underlie geographical basis of its existence and its great natural resource they emphasise what separate rather than what unite in short they see the rivalry between the two motto divide et impera and viribus unitis and lay undue stress upon the former just because they realize the extraordinarily complicated nature of the racial problem involve they tend to overlook the steady advance make in recent year by austrium in the conception of political and constitutional freedom but at every turn hungary have be austrium 's evil genius : the influence of the magyar oligarchy have give a reactionary flavor alike to internal and to foreign policy have hamper every reform and poison the relation of the state with its southern neighbor -lrb- illustration : austria-hungary : political division -rrb- for a short time the aggressive balkan policy of count aehrenthal as exemplify in the annexation of bosnium and the diplomatic duel with russium be hail as worthy of the bismarckian tradition but it soon become clear that he be far from be the genius whose advent the monarchy be so anxiously await in recent year then despite many hopeful sign and despite increase activity in almost every sphere of life a kind of progressive paralysis have take hold upon the body-politic three main cause may be note -- the lack of any great man capable of counteract the emperor 's lack of initiative which be always very marked but have be accentuate by advance old age the superficial and malicious outlook of the capital and the class which control it the alliance between the magyar oligarchy and the jewish press and haute finance work in a pronouncedly anti-slav direction the wheel still go round but the machine of state make less and less progress : stagnation and aimlessness be everywhere apparent on all side it be recognize that the exist system have become unworkable and that a catastrophe could only be avert by speedy reform to many far-seeing patriot the last hope of salvation for the state seem to lie with the late heir-apparent not perhaps as the ideal prince but as a man of courage and force of character possess the necessary energy to carry through drastic political change he removal be a crush blow to all who still hope against hope in the regeneration of the monarchy he place be fill by a young man lack both experience and prestige never be there less sign of the heaven-born genius who alone could save a desperate situation in the life of nation and state as in that of individual there sometimes come a moment when it be possible to make the great refusal of which dante sing and history teach that those who decline or prove unworthy of the lead rôle which be offer to they be trodden mercilessly underfoot in close the german edition of my book with these word i express the conviction that for a state such as austrium there could only be one choice but unhappily she statesman have prefer the fatal alternative -lrb- 1 -rrb- the historic mission of the house of habsburg be the vindication of equal rights and liberty for all race commit to its charge the abandonment of this mission would endanger the very existence of a great power upon the middle danube -lrb- 2 -rrb- austrium have prove untrue to this mission and the inexorable force of history seem at this moment to be work she destruction nation like individual sometimes commit suicide and those who have most earnestly warn they against such a crime be leave as mourner in the funeral procession -lrb- footnote 1 : in July 1911 i dedicate _ the southern slav question _ to that austrian statesman who shall have the courage and the genius necessary to solve the southern slav question in April 1913 in publish a german edition i add the word at the twelfth hour this dedication be repeat in November 1914 it be unhappily only too evident that that hour have already strike -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ racial problem in hungary _ conclude sentence -rrb- the war-fever which seize upon the populace of vienna and budapest last July typify the feeling of the three dominant race in the monarchy the german the magyar and the jew but it be no criterion for the attitude of large mass of the population in fact the war have accentuate the centrifugal tendency which be so marked a feature of recent year and which the introduction of universal suffrage and the annexation of bosnium arrest but fail to eradicate a stringent censorship may conceal but can not alter this fact disaffection be rife in portion of the army and affect its power of resistance while the financial and economic crisis grow from week to week cynic have try to define the mutual relation of germany and austria-hungary by compare the former to a strong man carry a corpse upon he shoulder and the course of the war during the first three month would seem to confirm this view so far as austria-hungary be concern its two outstanding feature have be the signal failure of the punitive expedition against serbium and the debacle of auffenberg 's army in galicium friendly observer be prepare for a break-down in the higher command and be aware that many slav regiment could not be rely upon but they have expect more from the german and magyar section of the army and from the very efficient officer ' corps as a stiffen element it be now know that despite the aggressive policy of its chief the austro-hungarian army be far from ready and that its commissariat and sanitary arrangement utterly break down the evident failure to profit by the experience of two general mobilisation within the previous six year be in itself a proof that there be something rotten in the state and it be already obvious that only a complete and crush victory of germany can extricate austria-hungary from the war without loss of prestige and actual territory unless the russian can be not merely defeat but drive out it be absolutely certain that they will retain the province of galicium or at least the eastern portion with its ruthene or ukrainian population unless the serbian army can be overwhelmed bosnium and at least some portion of dalmatium will fall into the hand of serbium this would be a eminently unsatisfactory solution or rather it would be no solution at all for it would solve neither the polish the ukraine nor the southern slav question i merely refer to it as a possible outcome of one form of stalemate it be hardly necessary to add that from every point of view stalemate be the result which be most to be dread since it inevitably involve fresh war in the immediate future whatever happen the effete dual system in its present form be doom for while a austrian defeat mean dissolution a austrian victory mean the absorption of serbium and montenegro and in either case the balance between austrium and hungary will be fatally disturbed and a new constitutional arrangement render inevitable it be thus a tragic paradox that while the attempt to bolster up the dual system be undoubtedly one of the great underlying cause of the war its first effect be likely to be the collapse of that very system the dual system once abolish it might seem reasonable to aim at a reconstruction of austria-hungary on a modify federal basis but this be essentially a peace-ideal the war far from kindle a common patriotism which in austria-hungary be so conspicuous by its absence have place a gulf of blood between race and race and render they continue existence under the same roof not only difficult but undesirable even in the event of only relative failure on the part of austria-hungary a much more radical solution may be expect while the effect of she complete defeat would be to place the solution of the whole austrian problem in the hand of the entente power and of she own disaffected population in that case there be two probable alternative one more radical than the other both depend to a large extent upon the development of the military situation and upon as yet incalculable economic influence but it be possible to indicate they broad outline indeed this be the best means of illustrate the conflict fear and aspiration which the great conflict have still further intensify in the racial whirlpool of central europe let we consider the less drastic of the two first austrium as distinguish from hungary consist of seventeen province of which galicium be the largest and most populous yet there be many austrian who have long regard its possession as anything but a unmixed blessing for the monarchy as a whole and would scarcely regret its loss it have always occupy a peculiar autonomous position of its own its political social and economic condition be at least a century behind those of the neighbouring province and have give rise to many gross scandal it have be a hot-bed of agrarian unrest electoral corruption and international espionage instead of pay its own way it have be financially a heavy drag upon the state while racially it provide in the polish-ruthene conflict a object-lesson on the disagreeable fact that a oppressed race can become a oppressor when occasion arise but the argument which weigh most with the german of austrium be that the pole of galicium have for a whole generation hold in they hand the political balance in the austrian parliament and that the disappearance of the polish and ruthene deputy would destroy the slav majority and correspondingly strengthen the german the magyar in they turn would no doubt view with some alarm the extension of the russian frontier to the line of the carpathian but the change would bring to they certain obvious compensation since it would greatly increase the relative importance of hungary inside what be leave of the habsburg monarchy in short it be by no means impossible that if the russian succeed in hold galicium austria-hungary may show a sudden alacrity to buy peace by disgorge a province which have never wholly fit into she geographical or political system it be obvious that the fate of the small province of bukovina be bind up with that of galicium and in such circumstance as we have just indicate it would doubtless be divide between russium and roumanium on broad ethnographical line the northern district be ruthene the southern roumanian this however must depend upon the attitude of the kingdom of roumanium to which reference will be make later there be one other direction in which austrium could afford to surrender territory without serious loss save that of prestige the southern portion of tirol -- the so-called trentino the district round the town of trent -- be purely italian by race and its union with the kingdom of italy have long be the chief point in the program of the italian irredentist or extreme nationalist it be a poor and mountainous country which belong geographically to its southern rather than to its northern neighbor the pronouncedly italian sympathy of its inhabitant have complicate the problem of government and have be a permanent source of friction between austrium and italy the elaborate fortification along the exist frontier would have to be sacrifice but the new racial frontier could soon be make equally satisfactory from a strategic point of view it should then be bear in mind that at a later stage of the war a attempt may be make by austrium to buy off italy with the offer of the trentino whether the latter would seriously consider such a offer if make will doubtless depend upon future event but it be clear that italy if she diplomatist be sufficiently adroit have a fair prospect of acquire the trentino whichever side win and consequently that a much more tempting bait will be require in order to induce she to abandon she neutrality these two loss the one already probable the other hypothetical would still leave austrium in the unquestioned position of a great power the problem of she future relation with she balkan neighbor raise a infinitely more complicated issue let we consider the southern slav and roumanian question first separately and then in they bearing upon each other § 6 _ the southern slav question _ -- the southern slav question as have already be argue in a earlier chapter can only be treat satisfactorily as a organic whole and it may be take for grant that austria-hungary in the event of victory will annex the two independent serb kingdom and unite the whole serbo-croat race under habsburg rule the task of govern they when once she have overcome they resistance will be one of extraordinary difficulty and will involve a complete revision of she own standard of government and administration she record and that of hungary in the slavonic south do not inspire one with confidence as to the result moreover it be not too much to assert that the destruction of serb independence -- a task which the present writer unhesitatingly regard as beyond the power of austrium -- will in no way solve the southern slav problem but merely transfer its center of gravity the task of southern slav liberation would pass to bulgarium and austria-hungary would be involve in a ever-widening field of hostility hence even if serbium 's independence be not now inextricably bind up with the success of the british arm it would still be essential that every effort should be make to heal what have long be a open sore upon the face of europe people in this country be only too apt to ignore the question altogether or at best to say oh yes of course if the ally win the serb will get bosnia those who talk thus have not grasp the element of the great problem of which bosnium like serbium itself be only one section the idea that to transfer bosnium alone from austro-hungarian to serbian hand would settle anything whatever fatally ignore alike the law of geography and those consideration of national sentiment which dominate politics in south-eastern europe in every respect bosnia-herzegovina and dalmatium complement each other so long as there be no railway in the balkan and bosnium stagnate under turkish rule so long as the national consciousness of the serbo-croat slumber or run in purely provincial channel the separation between coast and hinterland be possible though even then unnatural but with the advent of modern economic idea the situation radically change it be above all the possession of the dalmatian seaboard that tempt austrium to occupy bosnium and so conversely the acquisition of bosnium by serbium would at once compel the latter willy-nilly -lrb- quite apart from all racial affinity or sentiment -rrb- to aspire to dalmatia as well geographically it be inconceivable that to-day dalmatium should be in different hand from bosnia-herzegovina herzegovina do actually touch the sea at two place -- for a few mile at the swampy mouth of the narenta below metkovié and for a mile at castelnuovo-zelenika inside the bocche di cattaro it be obvious that to allow serbium these two outlet while leave they surroundings to another state would create immediate and intolerable friction whereas to assign the southern half of dalmatium to bosnium but to leave the northern half in other hand would be keenly resent by the dalmatian themselves as a outrage alike upon they national and they local tradition when we consider the population of dalmatium we must apply the rival test of history and of race on the grounds of historical sentiment italy might claim dalmatium for its chief town -lrb- zara sebenico trau spalato lesina curzolum -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- be venetian colony and not only they but even the republic of ragusa which always maintain a independent existence be saturate with italian culture and ideal but on ethnical grounds dalmatium be now overwhelmingly slavonic in 1900 only 31 per cent of its population -- in other word about 15000 out of a total of 584000 -- be italian the remain 97 per cent be serbo-croat the census of 1910 be even more unfavourable to the italian probably unduly so it be of course true that the italian element though numerically negligible represent a higher percentage of the educate and culture class but while this would entitle italy to demand guarantee for the maintenance of exist italian school and institution it can not conceivably be employ as a argument in favor of a italian occupation not only would it bring she inevitably into collision with the southern slav who already be and be likely to remain a military power of no mean order it would lead she on into the false and hopeless path of attempt to assimilate a hostile population by the aid of a insignificant minority which only exist in half a dozen town and in all the rest of the province be simply non-existent the price pay would be the eternal enmity of all slav the jeopardising of italian interest in the balkan the sacrifice of many of the benefit which the new trans-balkan railway route -lrb- odessa-bucarest-kladovo-sarajevo-spalato -rrb- would naturally bring to italy a challenge to one of the finest maritime race in europe -- the croat of dalmatium croatium and istrium -- a challenge which would sooner or later involve the creation of a southern slav navy against italy so far as britain be concern to separate dalmatium from bosnium be not only to prevent even the beginning of a solution of the southern slav question but to obscure the naval situation in the mediterranean to alienate russium in a matter in which we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by accommodate she but even when bosnium and dalmatium have be unite to serbium and montenegro the southern slav problem will still be far from solution dalmatium be alike in constitutional theory and in political fantasy though not in sober fact a integral portion of the triune kingdom of croatia-slavonia-dalmatium and it be unthinkable that serbo-croat opinion could ever consent to the liberation of the one without the other no solution have any chance of permanence which ignore agram as the center of croat political and religious life of education art and historic memory the dalmatian croat as the most virile and stubborn element in the race have always form the vanguard of political thought but it be to agram that they have always turn for the necessary backing and it be the peasantry of croatium who have always bear the brunt of every attempt at repression latterly the dalmatian have be the soul of the student movement which play so vital a part in recent political development -lrb- footnote 1 : in the west they be only know under they italian name but at home they be know as zadar sibenik trogir split hvar korculum and dubrovnik -lrb- ragusa -rrb- -rrb- croatia-slavonium be a vital part of the problem indeed from a national point of view perhaps more vital than bosnium and dalmatium but even this be not enough no settlement will be complete which ignore the slovene of eastern istrium carniolum and southern carinthium and styrium : they must share the fate of they croat and serb kinsman so far then as the southern slav be concern the triumph of the ally ought to mean the creation of a new state on the eastern adriatic the expansion of gallant serbium into jugoslavium -lrb- jug be the slav word for south -rrb- and the achievement of unity by the three kindred race serb croat and slovene on the north it would be comparatively easy to draw a new frontier correspond to the main requirement of ethnography geography and strategy with only very slight deviation this would follow the racial line between slovene and german from the present italian frontier as far as the little town of radkersburg in styrium thence the course of the river mur and drave as far as the latter 's junction with the danube it be only in the banat -- that portion of the great hungarian plain which face belgrade across the danube -- that a artificial frontier will be inevitable if the serb district of hungary be to be include in the new state and if the serb capital be to be render immune from the danger of future bombardment the weak spot in so drastic a solution be the inclusion of the slovene district which -- in view of they geographical position cut off the german province of austrium from the sea -- be unthinkable save in the event of a complete collapse of the monarchy all depend upon the number of leaf which be pull off the artichoke if only a few of the outer row be take a situation may arise in which it would be necessary to sacrifice the slovene and to rest satisfied with the acquisition of bosnium dalmatium and croatium -- in other word with the frontier which at present divide croatium from austrium and from hungary proper but this it must be remember would leave the work of southern slav unity incomplete and be only to be regard as a _ pi aller _ the slovene section of the southern slav problem be further complicate by the attitude of italy who can not be indifferent to the fate of trieste and polum on historic grounds italy can not lay claim to trieste which have be a possession of the house of habsburg since 1386 -lrb- 400 year longer than dalmatium -rrb- but if as before we apply the principle of nationality it be indisputable that trieste be a italian town though the whole surrounding country up to the very suburb be purely slovene on the other hand the commercial interest of trieste be entirely bind up with its hinterland by which be mean not only the alpine province but upper and lower austrium and bohemia on the one hand and even south germany -lrb- bavarium -rrb- on the other any settlement then must be a compromise between national and economic interest as a ancient center of italian culture trieste would welcome the flag of the regno upon its municipality as the surest guarantee that the town would remain italian in character to all time but any attempt to include trieste within the tariff system of the kingdom of italy would produce fatal result and the obvious solution be to proclaim the city as a free commercial port of course from a purely southern slav point of view the fate of the town of trieste -lrb- as distinct from the district -rrb- ought to be a matter of complete indifference though of course the extremist claim it it be however well to bear in mind that the inclusion of trieste in italy 's tariff system would mean the speedy economic ruin of a great and flourishing commercial center commercially then trieste be unthinkable save either as the port of austrium or as a _ porto franco _ under italian suzerainty so far as istrium be concern there would be no insurmountable difficulty in draw a satisfactory frontier on ethnographical line the western portion include capodistrium rovigno and polum be overwhelmingly italian while the interior of the little province and the eastern shore -lrb- with abbazium lovrana etc -rrb- be as overwhelmingly slavonic -lrb- croat and slovene mixed -rrb- any redistribution of territory on the basis of nationality must therefore inevitably assign western istrium to italy and no reasonable southern slav would raise any valid objection once more the essential fact to consider be that the acquisition of trieste and polum by italy presuppose the disappearance of austria-hungary otherwise it be not even remotely possible hence it be no exaggeration to assert that the fate of trieste be one of the central issue in the whole european settlement once make trieste a free port under the italian flag and _ ipso facto _ the austro-hungarian navy cease to exist and with it all need for italian naval activity in the adriatic in other word such a settlement would lead to a almost idyllic reduction of naval armament in the adriatic since both italy and the new jugoslavium could afford to restrict themselves to a minimum of coast defense it be obvious however that the dismantlement of polum -- to-day a almost impregnable fortress -- would be a essential condition to neighbourly relation between the two the more so since under such altered circumstance a italian naval base at polum could only have one objective there be a unfortunate tendency in italy to misread the whole situation on the eastern adriatic to ignore the transformation which the revival of southern slav consciousness have work in land which once own the supremacy of venice a short-sighted distrust of the slav blind many italian to the double fact that he have come to stay and that he friendship be to be have for the ask the commercial future of dalmatium bosnium and serbium be intimately bind up with italy and italy herself will be the chief loser if she close she eye to so patent a truth the fate of trieste and istrium be a triangular issue between teuton slav and latin the italian if he claim be too ambitious or exacting may succeed in prevent the slav from obtain he share of the spoil but only by leave they all in the hand of a still more dangerous rival in other word by a crude policy of dog-in-the-manger one thing be certain in all this interplay of force -- that it be too late in the day to suppress southern slav national consciousness and that there can never be durable peace and contentment on the eastern adriatic until the unity of the race have be achieve it would be premature to discuss the exact form which the new state would assume but when the time come it will be find that the people of bosnia-herzegovina dalmatium croatia-slavonium istrium and carniolum will acclaim they liberation at the hand of free serbium and montenegro they watchword however will be not conquest from without but free and voluntary union from within -- a union which will preserve they exist political institution and culture as a worthy contribution to the common southern slav fund the natural solution be a federal union under which the sovereign would be crown not only as king of serbium but with the crown of zvonomir as king of the triune kingdom of croatia-slavonia-dalmatium thus revive historic tradition date from the tenth century and never abandon or forget the croatian parliament would continue in agrani parallel with the serb parliament in belgrade but both would be represent in a central federal parliament the only question be whether the exist provincial division should be allow to survive the diet of bosnium dalmatium istrium and carniolum thus form conjointly with the serbian montenegrin and croatian parliament the unit on which the new constitution be base or whether complete unification should be attempt the latter would be the ideal arrangement but in view of the great divergence of local custom and institution it would probably be premature and it might therefore be wiser to preserve the smaller unit until they be ripe for fusion rather than to compromise by create a dual state of serbium and croatium § 7 _ the roumanian question _ -- i have dwell at some length upon the southern slav problem because it be as complicate as it be unfamiliar to public opinion in this country it have be the _ causa causans _ of the present struggle and if neglect or mismanage at the final settlement may again plunge europe into trouble at some future date parallel with any solution of the southern slav question must come the solution of the roumanian question which represent the other half of austria-hungary 's balkan policy the kingdom of roumanium be alike in territory population and resource the leading power in the balkan peninsula but over five million roumanian include the very cream of the race still live under foreign domination of these at least 3500000 be in austria-hungary the great majority under the grossly oppressive rule of the magyar and the redemption of transylvanium and the neighbouring county of hungary have always be the ideal of all patriotic roumanian even of those who look to a distant future for its realisation russium 's short-sighted policy in 1878 in annex the roumanian province of bessarabium as a reward for they valiant support at plevna drive the roumanian into the arm of austria-hungary and for a whole generation not even the perpetual irritant of magyar tyranny in transylvanium could avail to shake the _ entente _ between vienna and bucarest strengthen as it be by the personal friendship of the emperor franci joseph and king charle but the spell be break by austrium 's attitude during the balkan war the imperious force of circumstance bring the interest of roumanium and serbium into line for it be obvious that any blow aim against serbium 's independent existence must threaten roumanium also just as any weakening of the serbo-croat element in the monarchy must react unfavourably on that of the roumanian and other nationality of hungary the growth of national feeling within the two neighbor race have proceed for some time past on parallel line and even before the war there be manifest sign that the roumanian of hungary whose economic and cultural progress since the beginning of the century have be very rapid be at length near the end of they patience the bomb outrage at debreczen last February -- a event which be without parallel in roumanian history -- be the first muttering of the gathering storm roumanium occupy a position of extreme delicacy she natural tendency would be to espouse the cause of the ally since they obviously have more to offer she than they rival but the somewhat equivocal attitude of she statesman have be determine not merely by a astute desire to win the spoil of war without make the necessary sacrifice -- a policy which be apt to overreach itself -- but also by a very pardonable anxiety as to the attitude of bulgarium and turkey roumanium have hitherto be the foremost upholder of the treaty of bucarest and it be only in the event of drastic territorial change farther west that she be likely to consent to its be tear up she have make no secret of the fact that she would not tolerate naked aggression against the greek whether from the turkish or bulgarian side in view of the political record of king ferdinand of bulgarium and he present prime minister the roumanian may perhaps be excuse for adopt a attitude of vigilant reserve for they statesman suspect that bulgarium be only wait until the roumanian army have cross the carpathian in order to reoccupy the southern dobrudja certain it be that roumanium while decline all temptation to join the central power have also reject the russian invitation to occupy the bukovina and have actually approach hungary with a view to secure the restoration of transylvanian autonomy the magyar on they part have try to buy off roumanium by introduce the roumanian language of instruction in many of the state school of transylvanium -- a wholly inadequate concession which would none the less have be inconceivable four short month ago unfortunately the realisation of roumanian unity inevitably involve the inclusion in the new state of considerable magyar and saxon minority amount in all to not less than 600000 inhabitant there be no means of overcome the hard fact of geography but it be essential that roumanium while incorporate magyar and saxon islet in the roumanian racial sea should guarantee the exist institution of the two race and the fullest possible linguistic freedom in church -lrb- 1 -rrb- school and press the saxon in particular have preserve they identity for over seven century in this little corner of the carpathian and have contribute far more than they share to the cause of culture and progress in hungary it would be a cry irony of fate if they be allow to perish in the twentieth century at the hand of those who have pledge themselves to vindicate the rights of smaller nationality -lrb- footnote 1 : the szekel -lrb- magyar -rrb- district of transylvanium be mainly calvinist the saxon lutheran to a man while the roumanian be divide between the orthodox and the roumanian uniate church transylvanium be also the center of a interesting sect of unitarian who be for the most part magyar by race -rrb- it must not be forget that the dream of roumanian unity can only be fully realize if russium restore at least a portion of bessarabium which contain not less than a million and a quarter roumanian a victorious russium might well afford such a concession for it would involve no strategic danger and would especially if convey in the graceful form of a wedding dowry triumphantly efface the last trace of russophobe feeling that still linger in roumanium but it would be absurd to expect such magnanimity on the part of russium unless roumanium 's action be prompt and vigorous the abstract theory of nationality must be reinforce by the more practical argument of sterling service render to a common cause § 8 _ can the dual monarchy be replace _ -- the result of apply the principle of nationality to the southern slav and roumanian would thus be to create two powerful national state at the expense of the habsburg monarchy and here it be well to repeat that such drastic territorial change be only possible if the military power of austrium suffer a almost complete eclipse but even the loss of galicium bukovina transylvania the trentino and the serbo-croat province would still leave austria-hungary a state of very considerable area with a population of 32 million there be no reason why such a state should not continue to exist provide that it retain the necessary access to the sea at trieste and polum and this would involve the exclusion of the slovene from the new jugo-slav state under such circumstance it would be possible to reconstruct the state on a federal basis with five main racial unit the german the czech and slovak the magyar the slovene and the italian certain unimportant racial minority would still be leave but these could unquestionably be deal with by a law of guarantee similar to those which have play so conspicuous a part in the theory but sometimes also in the practice of the dual monarchy so many severe amputation might however prove too much for the vitality of the patient and in any case we may assume that either austria-hungary will be able to prevent the operation or that the ally if they can once bring matter thus far will insist upon complete the process by a drastic post-mortem inquiry any sympathetic qualm be likely to be outweigh by the consideration that a state of this hybrid nature would tend to be more than ever a vassal of germany moreover there can be no doubt that one of the surest means of bring germany to she knee be by crush she most formidable ally and thus tap some of the source of she own military and economic strength it be safe to assume that this consideration play a important part in the military plan of russium and for many reason -- political strategic and economic -- a russian occupation of bohemia must be regard as the essential prelude to a decisive victory of the ally the war have throw the dual monarchy into the melting-pot but it be not enough to accept the possibility of its disappearance from the map it be also necessary to consider what new organism would take its place a complete partition would as we have see remove the last obstacle to a unify southern slav state the dream of italium irredenta and greater roumanium would be realize western galicium and a part of silesium would be unite to autonomous poland as reconstitute by the russian tsar eastern galicium northern bukovina and the ruthene district of hungary as far as ungvár and munkács would be incorporate in the russian empire though it be to be hope that a early result of this change would be the grant of a certain modify autonomy or at least of special linguistic and religious privilege to the ukraine population thus unite after century of partition in a single body politic § 9 _ bohemia and hungary _ -- but the most striking result of the partition would be the revival of the famous mediaeval kingdom of bohemia and hungary as independent state thus would be realize the dream of two race the czech and magyar whose national revival form one of the most romantic incident of the nineteenth century but it be difficult to imagine a greater contrast than they respective development in bohemia the czech after lose they religious and civic liberty and endure for two century the domination of the german raise themselves once more in the course of two generation by sheer force of character and tireless industry to a position of equality and reorganise they national life on a essentially democratic basis in hungary the magyar thanks to they central position they superior political sense and they possession of a powerful aristocracy succeed in concentrate all government and administration in they own hand and reduce the other race of the country who have always form a majority of the population to a state of veritable political helotry and just as they evolution have be on very different line so must be they future fate in bohemia all be activity and political progress in hungary the sterility of a corrupt and reactionary system stake the future upon the hollow credit of a long-vanished past the czech be beyond all question the most progressive the most highly civilised the most democratic of all slavonic nation the stubborn spirit of john hus be still alive among they to-day and they recent achievement in music art and industry be in every way worthy of the nation which have produce comenius and dvorák and first light the torch of reformation in europe the ancient city of prague contain all the element of culture necessary for the regeneration of bohemia and the mineral riches and industrial resource of the country be infinitely greater than those of many european state which have successfully lead a separate national existence but the liberation of the czech would not be complete unless they close kinsman the slovak be include in the new bohemian state and every reason alike of politics race and geography tell overwhelmingly in favor of such a arrangement the slovak who would to the last man welcome the change have long suffer from the gross tyranny of magyar rule they school and institution have be ruthlessly suppress or reduce in number they press muzzle they political development arrest they culture and tradition -- far more truly autochthonous than those of the conquer magyar invader -- have be discourage and hamper at every turn the slovak be a race whose artistic and musical gift whose innate sense of color and poetry have win the sympathy and admiration of all who know they and they systematic oppression at the hand of the magyar oligarchy be one of the greatest infamy of the last fifty year in this war britain have proclaim herself the champion of the small nation and none be more deserving of she sympathy than the slovak unless we statesman renounce that principle of nationality which they have so loudly proclaim the slovak can not be abandon to they fate for they form a essential part of the bohemian problem without they the new kingdom could not stand alone isolate as it would be among hostile or indifferent neighbor in every way the slovak district form the natural continuation of bohemia and be the necessary link between it and russium upon whose moral support the new state must rely in the first critical year of its existence the main difficulty would be the fate of racial minority for minority there still must be no matter how the frontier may be draw at first sight the natural solution would be to pare down bohemia by assign to the neighbouring province of germany the german fringe which almost completely surround the czech kernel so far as the south-west and north-east district of bohemia -lrb- near budwei and along the german silesian border -rrb- be concern the historic boundary might fairly be revise on ethnographic line and in the same way the line of demarcation between bohemia and hungary could in the main be make to follow the racial boundary between slovak and magyar and later between slovak and ruthene but in the north of bohemia there be insurmountable objection to any revision of the historic frontier of the kingdom for not merely be its industrial life concentrate to a very considerable degree in the german district but this fact be responsible for the existence of important czech industrial minority which it would be difficult to sacrifice so far as there be to be any sacrifice it must be make by the loser rather than by the winner in this war but it ought to be possible under the rule of some carefully select western prince as ruler of bohemia to devise proper administrative guarantee for the linguistic rights of minority in every mixed district of bohemia whether it be czech or german the case of hungary be different that the ally if victorious should perpetuate the racial hegemony of the magyar and with it many of the abuse which have contribute towards the present war be as unthinkable as that they should once more bolster up the turkish régime if the habsburg monarchy should break up hungary be fully entitle to she independence she will become a national magyar state but in a sense very different from that which she jingo politician have intend -- not by assimilate the non-magyar race of the country but by lose to the other national state by which she will be surround all but the purely magyar district of the central plain hungary will then be more fully than before a danubian state she rich alluvial land will be develop and a check will be put upon the unnecessary stream of magyar emigration which the present political and economic situation favor the chief gainer by the change will be the magyar peasantry who have in they own way be exploit by the ruling oligarchy as cruelly as they non-magyar neighbor one result of the war will be to discredit the policy and method of this oligarchy and to hasten the break-up of the vast latifundium of the great magnate and the church and those other drastic land reform without which hungary can not hope to attain she full economic value as the granary of central europe hitherto the government of the day have secure a parliamentary majority by corrupt and terrorise the non-magyar constituency of the periphery and thus out-vote the radical magyar stalwart of the great plain and with the loss of the slovak ruthene and roumanian district this system would automatically collapse the result might be a genuine strengthening of democratic element and the dawn of a new era for the magyar race § 10 _ germany and austrium _ -- one final problem connect with austria-hungary remain what be to be the fate of the german province of austrium if the map of europe be to be recast on a basis of nationality we obviously can not withhold from the great german nation that right to racial unity which we accord to the czech the pole and many minor race the seven german province -- upper and lower austrium styrium carinthium tirol salzburg and vorarlberg -- reconstitute perhaps as a kingdom of austrium under the house of habsburg and augment by the german population of western hungary would then become a additional federal unit in the german empire such a event it can not be too often repeat be inconceivable except as the result of a complete defeat of the central power but if on that assumption germany lose alsace-lorraine and posen the loss would be make good by the incorporation of german austrium the result of this in figure would be the subtraction of six million inhabitant and the addition of eight million other -- a transaction which need not unduly alarm the british jingo and at the same time might render defeat less galling to the german patriot whether this fulfillment of the pan-german aspiration would meet with unqualified enthusiasm on either side of the present frontier be a question on which it be not altogether easy to answer the idea of admit eight million additional catholic subject into germany would certainly arouse misgiving in prussium both among the stricter protestant and among the far more active section of intellectual who merely regard protestantism as a political asset in the struggle against latin and slavonic influence from a political point of view they admission would unquestionably transform the whole parliamentary situation and force the imperial government to revise its whole attitude for the austrian voter would greatly strengthen the two party to whose existence prussium have never become reconcile -- the clerical center and the social democratic left -- while contribute little or nothing to the party of the conservative junker or the middle-class liberal in other word the new element might prove to be a effective leaven which would permeate the whole lump all the argument which induce bismarck to expel austrium from germany in 1868 would still be uphold by the advocate of preussen-deutschland -lrb- see p 65 -rrb- and the prussian hegemony but after a unsuccessful war and territorial loss the chance of make these good by the achievement of national unity would probably sweep away the dissentient who would no longer represent a triumphant system but a beaten and discredited caste the old idea of the seventy-million empire which appeal so strongly to the liberal of frankfurt in 1848 should prove irresistible under these circumstance the influence of austrian german already so marked in literature art music and above all in political theory might make itself feel in other sphere also meanwhile in view of the wild talk in which certain section of the press be already indulge it can not be too strongly emphasise that only the german can reform they political institution and that any attempt at external interference will not merely fail lamentably but produce the very opposite effect from that which be intend if the german emperor insist upon confuse the relative position of the deity and some of he self-styled vicegerent upon earth only the german people can restore he to a sense of proportion and modesty all believer in human progress hope that after this war the monstrous theory of divine right propound by the house of hohenzollern will be relegate to the lumber-room of a vanish past but the sooner reference to st helena as a residence for depose emperor be dismiss as arrant nonsense the better the future of german dynasty as of german unity rest with the german people itself and those who challenge this statement repudiate _ ipso facto _ the two principle of nationality and international law which we have officially adopt as we program for the future the fate of the german province of austrium be one of the central problem raise by this war since it be the link between the fate of two empire the present writer most emphatically disclaim all idea of prophecy but he feel that the time have come for outline some of the possible alternative which confront the statesman of the new europe so far as austria-hungary be concern it be clear that the splendid dream of a monarchical switzerland as conceive by many serious political thinker have already die a violent death but it would be quite premature to dogmatise on the future grouping of the race of the dual monarchy at a moment when its ultimate fate have still to be decide on the field of battle § 11 _ italian aspiration _ -- we have already allude to italy 's position in connection with the southern slav question and have point out that a settlement which follow even approximately the line of nationality would assign the trentino the town of trieste -lrb- as a free port -rrb- and a strip of western istrium to italy but the remainder of the coast from cape promontore to the bojana river to the new jugoslavium there be however other direction in which italy may claim compensation for she friendly attitude towards the triple entente she have already occupy the rocky islet of saseno opposite valona and in the event of the collapse of austria-hungary she may demand the whole bay of valona as the strategic key to the adriatic and even a general protectorate of the embryo albanian state the establishment of a miniature gibraltar on the eastern side of the strait of otranto be a step which neither france nor britain would oppose if italy should insist upon it but it may be question whether she would not thereby be lay up store of trouble for a distant future altogether incommensurate with any possible advantage which might accrue indeed italy would probably be well advise to abandon all idea of a albanian adventure -lrb- which originally conceive as a counterstroke to austrian aggression would lose its point if austrium disappear from the scene -rrb- to leave the greek a free hand in south epirus to cede to they rhode and the other island occupy during the tripolitan war and then to secure during the partition of turkey the reversion of cilicium and the gulf of alexandretta it be in any case clear that the power of the triple entente will raise no objection to such action on the part of italy and be resolve to show every consideration to a power whose great and vital interest in the mediterranean in no way conflict with they own § 12 _ the balkan situation : bulgarium and greece _ -- the creation of a greater roumanium and of a new southern slav state would transform the whole balkan situation and therefore obviously involve material concession to bulgarium and greece -lrb- a -rrb- if roumanium succeed in redeem she kinsman across the northern frontier she can not be so ungenerous as to insist upon retain territory whose population be overwhelmingly bulgarian and the least which might be expect from she would be the retrocession to bulgarium of she bloodless acquisition during the second balkan war this mean a reversion to the boundary define under russian arbitration at petrograd in January 1913 -- except outside the fortress of silistrium where strategic reason demand its rectification it be in the relation of bulgarium and serbium however that the key to the balkan situation be to be find the serbo-bulgarian treaty of February 1912 which form the groundwork of the balkan alliance have limit serbium 's sphere of influence to northern macedonium and refer to the arbitration of the russian tsar any dispute arise from conquest to the south of a certain specify line serbium be tacitly give a free hand in she attempt to reach the sea in northern albania the action of austria-hungary in veto she access to the adriatic forced serbium to turn she eye from west to south and to seek she economic outlet to the sea down the valley of the vardar to salonica and the aegean the cession of monastir ochrida and the vardar valley to bulgarium would have render this impossible for it would not merely have drive a wedge between serbium and greece but would have place two custom frontier the bulgarian and the greek between serbium and the sea instead of only one the turkish as hitherto shut in upon all side with all hope of expansion block by the powerful dual monarchy to north and west and by a big bulgarium to east and south serbium would have find herself in a worse position than before the war the bulgarian intoxicate by they victory over the turk and seduce by the prompting of the austrian tempter turn a deaf ear to the argument of they serbian ally and insist upon they pound of flesh they fail to realize that the most effective way of induce the serb to evacuate macedonium be to give they adequate backing in they demand for a adriatic port every fresh intrigue of sofium with vienna confirm belgrade in its view of the vital necessity for retain the vardar valley the hoary argument that circumstance alter case appear anew in the garb of the bismarckian theory that all treaty be subject to the provision _ rebus sic stantibus _ -- a theory which many great international lawyer have unhesitatingly endorse in this form it appeal as irresistibly to the serb as do the rival shibboleth of the treaty the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty to the bulgarian it be impossible to absolve either side from blame for the serb in formally denounce a treaty into which they have voluntarily enter be do exactly what they have so bitterly resent in austria-hungary 's treatment of bosnium while the bulgarian in flout the tsar whom they have name as arbiter and in attempt to uphold the treaty by brute force and treachery abandon the ground of law and place themselves openly in the wrong the event of the great war have already modify the problem the one unanswerable argument of the serb in decline to surrender macedonium be the plea that they would then have nothing to offer bulgarium for she neutrality or she support when they own inevitable day of reckon with austrium should arrive in short vele monastir and ochrida be widely regard as a pledge to be hold until bosnium and dalmatium could be redeem but then to be hand over to the bulgarian it be true that the serbo-bulgar war of 1913 and the passion which it arouse have convert this feeling into one of reluctance to sacrifice what be buy at such a fearful price but the moment have now arrive to translate a instinct into a reality if southern slav unity be to be achieve a binding promise under the guarantee of the entente power must be give to bulgaria that in proportion as the work of serbo-croat unification be achieve the macedonian frontier will be revise in favor of bulgarium it be possible that bulgarium may prefer a different formulum accord to which the tsar with the approval of he western ally should arbitrate upon the original serbo-bulgar treaty any such concession to bulgarian sentiment ought not to be resent in serbium in view of the great issue involve it be obvious that serbium can not hope to achieve she national unity unless bulgarium abstain from hostile action or to consolidate she new position when win unless she can win bulgarium 's active friendship the latter by she intervention could at any moment turn the scale against turkey or against serbium and it be thus essential that the ally should treat she now with a generosity proportionate to the callous neglect with which europe leave she to she fate in September 1913 the tendency to look down upon the balkan state from the fancied height of a superior culture have never be so marked in france or britain as in germany where the press be now engage in compare they own cultural exploit in belgium with the lack of culture display by the bandit and assassin of serbium and where a man of such scientific distinction as werner sombart can describe the heroic kingdom of montenegro as nothing but a bad joke in the history of the world -lrb- 1 -rrb- but even here the habit of condescension linger and amidst the threaten collapse of western civilisation it be well to remember the essential distinction between primitive and savage the balkan nation have grow to manhood while we sleep and must henceforth be regard as equal in the european commonwealth -lrb- footnote 1 : _ berliner tageblatt _ cite by _ observer _ November 8 1914 -rrb- -lrb- b -rrb- such territorial change as have be outline above would vitally affect the position of greece who be also fully entitle to claim compensation for any serious disturbance of the balance of power the first and most obvious form which compensation would take be the final occupation of southern epirus no objection will be raise to this by the entente power and it be probable that italy have already make she own bargain with the cabinet of athen on this very point it be to be hope that italy may also consent to hand over rhode and the neighbouring island to greece in return for a free hand in southern asia minor in the event of the turkish empire break up by far the thorniest problem be provide by the future ownership of kavalum which the treaty of bucarest assign to greece in August 1913 but which from a economic point of view be bulgarium 's port on the aegean and as vital a necessity for she future development as it be a superfluous luxury to greece the statesman of petrograd be not blind to these consideration but the scale be turn at bucarest by the active intervention of the german emperor who under the plea of second he brother-in-law king constantine skilfully provide a permanent bone of contention between bulgarium and greece he action may not unfairly be compare to that of the hungarian premier count tisza in foment the quarrel between serbium and bulgarium two month earlier serbium 's cession of central macedonium to bulgarium could not fail to be distasteful to the greek for it would automatically render they tenure of kavala highly precarious it be to be hope however that they may be bring to realize that its surrender and the consequent improvement of greco-bulgarian relation be in the highest interest of greece and the whole hellenic race here again the break-up of the turkish empire may enable the greek to compensate themselves on the shore of asia minor but the real key to the problem of kavalum and thus indirectly to the revival of the balkan league and all the far-reaching effect which that would have upon the fate of europe lie in the hand of britain it could instantly be solve by the cession of cyprus to greece on condition that kavalum and the valley of the strymon be restore to bulgarium neither strategically nor economically be cyprus of any value to britain thirty-five year ago it be take over by disraelus as a sort of fee for oppose russium a foolish habit which we have abandon long before the present war with turkey its population be predominantly greek and the hellenic national movement be steadily gain ground anything that we might gain by its retention be more than counterbalance by its value as a instrument of barter § 13 _ the future of turkey _ -- the entry of turkey into the great war mark a further stage in the winnowing process from which we hope that a regenerated europe will emerge two of the main cause of the war be the turk and the magyar whose effete and tyrannous system have each in its own manner and degree long keep south-eastern europe in a ferment of unrest and reaction it be a matter of profound regret that two infinitely more virile and progressive race the german and the jew should be fight they battle for they and indeed bolster up cause which would otherwise speedily collapse by reason of they own inward rottenness it be the triple alliance which have make it possible for the iniquitous racial hegemony of the magyar to survive in hungary it be the joint policy of vienna budapest and berlin which have hamper the progress of the balkan state and above all the development of every slavonic nation and in this they most valuable ally have be the jewish press and the jewish _ haute finance _ of germany austrium and hungary just as we hope and believe that one result of this war will be the emancipation of germany and german culture from the corrode influence of militarist doctrine so there be good grounds for hope that it will also give a new and healthy impetus to jewish national policy grant freer play to they many splendid quality and enable they to shake off the false shame which have lead man who ought to be proud of they jewish race to assume so many alien disguise and to accuse of anti-semitism those who refuse to be deceive by mere appearance it be high time that the jew should realize that few thing do more to foster anti-semite feeling than this very tendency to sail under false color and conceal they true identity the zionist and the orthodox jewish nationalist have long ago win the respect and admiration of the world no race have ever defy assimilation so stubbornly and so successfully and the modern tendency of individual jew to repudiate what be one of they chief glory suggest a almost comic resolve to fight against the course of nature these cryptic tendency of pseudo-national as oppose to national judaism have play a great part in the young turkish movement and the destruction which it be bring upon turkey the committee of union and progress at first enjoy the moral and financial support of many man both christian and jew to whom its method and secret current be a seal book for a time the young turk like the magyar farther west deceive foreign opinion by claptrap phrase from the repertory of modern democracy but murder will out and the committee -- despite the tiny group of able and in certain case honorable man who control its destiny -- have gradually be reveal in its true color as a parasitic growth upon the body politic preserve the worst fault of the old régime and blend with it much of the decadence which lie like froth along the backwater of western civilisation since 1908 then the fate of turkey have pass from the control of the turk and be be decide by a alien clique of infidel renegade political freemason -lrb- 1 -rrb- and jew in whose hand the caliph be a helpless tool and to whom the teaching of christ and of mohamm be mere worn-out superstition in fact the committee be in its essence non-turkish and non-moslem in the name of a secret society base openly upon the subversive idea of the wilder french jacobin and not shrink from assassination as a convenient political weapon a jehad or holy war be to be preach against the british empire and the most sacred interest of islam be to be exploit in the interest of germany what bitter irony be in the fact that william ii who risk universal war to avenge the murder of he friend the archduke franci ferdinand should now find himself closely ally with enver pasha the military adventurer who barely two year ago foully assassinate he own commander-in-chief nazim pasha and who therefore represent everything that be anathema to the prussian war lord with he exaggerated idea of military discipline and personal loyalty -lrb- footnote 1 : not to be confuse for a moment with the very different form of freemasonry which prevail in this country -rrb- the die have be cast and even those who most regret turkey 's action can not shut they eye to the fact that it inevitably raise the whole question of constantinople and the dardanelle if germany should emerge victorious turkey be likely to fall under a more or less veil german protectorate in the event of the victory of the ally turkey may continue to exist as a asiatic power but there be little doubt that she will be eliminate from europe the only real question be who be to replace she bulgarium will it be to be hope recover adrianople and the enos-midia line of which she be so cruelly rob last year the fact that the turk on they re-entry systematically wipe out the entire bulgarian population of northern thrace do not weaken but enormously strengthen the case for its restoration but to offer constantinople to bulgarium would be a fatal gift she have absolutely no historic claim to the great city of the caesar -lrb- tsarigrad as it be rightly know to every slav -rrb- nor be there even any considerable bulgarian population which could rally round the new government the administrative task be obviously far beyond the power of a small peasant state most of whose present leader be bear under a foreign yoke nor be greece a serious candidate for the vacant post the greek of course unlike the bulgarian have a definite claim base on the tradition of the byzantine empire and there be a large greek population in the city -- at present close upon 350000 though they number be likely to be materially reduce before this war be over but in they case also constantinople would be a fatal gift the resource even of the enlarged hellenic kingdom would inevitably prove unequal to the task moreover it must not be forget that a greek occupation would be oppose on many grounds by the entire commercial community of every other nation in europe in some way the ideal arrangement would be that roumanium should assume the administration of the city as trustee for a reconstitute balkan league with proper guarantee for the commercial rights of all the power but it be to be fear that such a solution would please nobody perhaps not even roumania herself a league of the five balkan king with roumanium as _ primus inter pare _ be the dream of a remote future and until it can be realize constantinople can not assume its natural position as capital of the balkan peninsula § 14 _ russium and constantinople _ -- in short as matter stand to-day there be only one power which can replace the turk as master of constantinople and that power be russia the russian could not of course incorporate the city in they empire for reason of geography and this fundamental fact destroy at a blow the numerous objection which might have tell against the occupation if constantinople have be contiguous to the russian dominion it would obviously be necessary to establish a special autonomous administration under a russian governor it be by no means impossible that russium would be satisfy with the expulsion of the turk and the internationalisation of constantinople as a free port under a christian prince or a commission of the power but though admirable in theory such a solution would give rise to endless complication and dispute unless the western power can trust russium sufficiently to leave she in full possession they must make up they mind to bolster up the impossible turk for a further period of year such a surrender to the unreasoning and ignorant prejudice of a previous generation would be a sure prelude to the collapse of we alliance with russium which it be the vital interest of all british patriot to uphold at all cost happily the fear of russium as of a strange and unknown colossus be die out vague fancy inevitably yield to the hard logic of fact the disraeli policy in the near east must give place once and for all to the broader conception of gladstone temper by the cautious statesmanship of salisbury the greatest of the christian power must be allow to replace the cross upon the dome of saint sofia the religious appeal of such a change be clear enough nor need there be any anxiety on economic grounds there be nothing to prevent constantinople from become a free port under the russian flag and fill a similar place to that which the free port of trieste would occupy under the flag of unite italy indeed it may be confidently assume that the change would give a extraordinary impetus to trade in the whole eastern mediterranean the recent history of batum and baku be a faint indication of what might be expect the fate of the dardanelle can not be separate from that of the capital both must be in the same hand at the same time a reasonable compensation for they cession to russium would be the dismantlement of they fort in any case whatever they fate may be it be clear that a end must be put to the galling restriction upon russium 's black sea fleet the essential point to bear in mind be that if the war go well with the ally and if russium express a definite desire to occupy constantinople and the strait resistance on we part would be alike difficult pointless and undesirable those who oppose have no argument so long as the special international need and condition of the city be properly recognize and guarantee with true oriental fatalism the turk have always regard he ultimate disappearance from europe as a certainty the superstition which lead the inhabitant of stamboul to prefer burial across the strait in asia have its parallel in the alarm arouse in the bazaar by the young turk ' decision to exterminate the pariah dog which have for century supply the place of scavenger in the street of the capital to-day the prophecy which make they removal the prelude to the departure of they master seem on the point of fulfillment and all who believe in the retributive justice of history will re-echo mr asquith 's hope that the fall of ottoman rule will remove the blight which for generation have wither some of the fairest region of the world § 15 _ asiatic turkey _ -- what then will be the subsequent fate of the turk if they be once drive bag and baggage across the strait the sultan will doubtless transfer he capital to brussa or even to konieh but can the khalifate survive such a loss of prestige on the part of the ottoman dynasty it would be altogether premature to discuss in anything approach detail the vast issue of the fate of turkey 's asiatic dominion but it be necessary to indicate that even after settle the fate of the strait we shall still be confront by issue of appalling magnitude it be the conjunction of the spiritual and temporal power in a single person which have give the khalifate its importance and its expulsion from the golden horn would transform its whole political status above all it be necessary to reckon with the arab nationalist movement which be already a reality and a factor of permanent importance here too the principle of nationality must be apply though in a very different sense for national feeling be of course at a much earlier stage of development among the arab than in central europe hitherto they have accept the khalifate of the house of othman though without enthusiasm but recent event be likely to bring to a head the resentment with which they view the spectacle of the khalif as the helpless tool of a clique which in no way represent islam will they repudiate he and restore the khalifate to some more authentic descendant of the prophet be there to be a independent arab power will it be practicable to create a central authority amid the virtual anarchy of so vast and primitive a country or will britain as the chief mahommedan power be oblige to assume a loose protectorate over arabium and mesopotamium if so will she share this with the french in syrium and will lebanon be able to preserve its autonomy only the course of event can provide a answer to such question only one fixed point emerge from the surrounding uncertainty -- the firm pledge of the british government that the holy place of islam shall be respect even this do not exhaust the possibility of the immediate future be palestine to become a jewish land in recent year there have be a steady emigration of moslem and christian and a equally marked jewish immigration and among other factor in the movement the potentiality of jewish nationalism in the united state deserve especial notice america be full of nationality which while accept with enthusiasm they new american citizenship none the less look to some center in the old world as the source and inspiration of they national culture and tradition the most typical instance be the feeling of the american jew for palestine which may well become a focus for he _ déclassé _ kinsman in other part of the world the jew quite realize that they can have no exclusive claim to the possession of such a religious center as jerusalem and it be clear that whatever happen to the holy land as a whole the city itself must be subject to a impartial administration which would be neither jewish catholic orthodox protestant nor moslem in any exclusive sense but would secure free play to the religious and educational aspiration of they all herzl himself the founder of modern zionism dream of jerusalem as the shrine of all religion and never look forward to the day when it would be a purely jewish city lastly what be to be the fate of asia minor there can be no question that the russian must be allow to occupy and retain the whole of turkish armenia they will thus be confer a benefit upon humanity and end one of the most grind and barbarous tyranny that the modern world have ever see the progress make by the armenian under russian rule during the past twenty year be a happy augury for the future of this race when once unite in common allegiance to the tsar under a wise system of local autonomy but will the ottoman empire be able to survive when shear of its european possession of its armenian and arab population will not italy demand she share of the spoil and side by side with the french in syrium assume in friendly rivalry the protectorate of cilicium from a point east of adalium as far as the gulf of alexandretta will it be possible to arrest the process of disintegration even at this stage will not greece attempt to annex smyrna and at least a portion of its hinterland or have she not at least as good a title as any other competitor here again it would be absurd to attempt any answer for the present but we must at least be prepare for the possibility of a transformation as rapid and as overwhelming in asiatic turkey as that which free the balkan from the turkish nightmare two short year ago in asia as in europe the war be the prelude to a new era and britain be face with the alternative of weakly abandon she imperial mission or assume still greater responsibility the turkish empire have commit suicide and dig with its own hand its grave and to britain will fall more fully than ever before the leadership of the mahommedan world the loyalty and devotion of the moslem community in indium can best be repay by the most scrupulous and sympathetic attention to the interest of islam throughout the world § 16 _ russium and poland _ -- it be no mere accident that germany austria-hungary and turkey should be range on the same side in the great european struggle for they represent each in its own way those false conception of nationality which have so long envenom the public life of europe and which for want of better word have be describe as germanisation magyarisation and turkification it would however be flagrantly untrue to suggest that those three state enjoy a monopoly of racial intolerance for the idea on nationality which dominate official russium under the old absolutist régime and which so rapidly regain the upper hand under stolypin and the triumphant bureaucracy strike at the very root of tolerance and political liberty but recent year have reveal a subtle change of attitude the policy of russification have not be abandon indeed in finland and the ukraine it survive in its most odious form but it be none the less possible to detect a grow note of interrogation even among the bureaucracy and still more a increase movement of impatient protest on the part of think russian without in any way ignore what have happen in persium we have every right to point to the essential fact that russium have of she own accord raise the question of nationality and thus set in motion vast force which be already shake europe to its foundation in proclaim as one of she foremost aim the restoration of polish unity russium do not it be true commit herself to any concrete project of autonomy but whether she action represent genuine feeling on the part of the tsar and he adviser as m gabriel hanotaux so positively assert or whether it be originally a mere maneuver to prevent the polish question be raise against she it be at least certain that russium have enter upon a new path from which it will be very difficult if not impossible to recede the russian pole under the leadership of m dmowskus have rally loyally round the tsar and there be many sign that the long-deferred russo-polish _ rapprochement _ be at length on the point of fulfillment here economic interest play they part for in recent year the district between warsaw and lodz have become one of the chief industrial centre of the russian empire and its annexation to austria or to prussia would place a tariff wall between it and the south russian market upon which it chiefly depend the pole of galicium have enjoy the utmost liberty under austrian rule have naturally be almost immune from the discontent so noticeable among they kinsman in russium and prussium and have indeed for a generation past form the backbone of all parliamentary majority in the austrian reichsrat but even among they the first faint sign of russophil feeling have be noticeable in the last two year this be partially due to the encouragement give by the austrian government to the ruthene in galicium but also to the disintegrate effect of universal suffrage upon the polish political party the growth of democratic tendency at the expense of the austrophil nobility and the consequent increase influence of the pole of warsaw though the polish party in galicium issue declaration of loyalty to austria at the beginning of the war and though they _ franc-tireurs _ be fight in the austrian rank there be a grow perception of the fact that the only serious prospect of attain polish unity lie in a russian victory austria they argue might if successful unite the russian and austrian section -lrb- at the expense of the former 's economic future -rrb- but never the prussian and prussium out of loyalty to she ally could at best add _ russian _ poland to she own territory : russium alone can hope in the event of a victory to unite all three fragment in a single whole however profoundly they may differ on point of detail all pole agree that the first essential be the attainment of that unity without which they may at any moment become as now the battleground of three great empire and which provide the key with which they themselves can unlock the portal of they future destiny should they dream be fulfil the valley of the vistulum restore to geographical unity may soon play a important part in the political and economic life of europe russium then be face by one of the greatest choice in history a opportunity will present itself after this war for solve she own racial question which have in the past present scarcely less grave embarrassment than the parallel problem of austria-hungary and which if leave unsolved may at no distant date endanger the unity and welfare of the empire the grant of polish autonomy the restoration of the finnish constitution the recognition of the special position of the ukraine or ruthene language and cultural tradition the relaxation of linguistic restriction among the lesser race of the empire and the adoption of a humaner attitude towards the jew of the pale -- these be step which follow logically from the proclamation of the grand duke nichola and indeed from the alliance with the western power incidentally much will depend upon the attitude adopt by the russian government towards its new catholic subject its relation with the vatican will require to be place upon a entirely new footing and due respect must be accord to the uniate catholic church of the four million ruthene of galicium in this respect the concordat sign a few week before the outbreak of war between serbium and the vatican should form a very valuable precedent for the whole future relation of the catholic and orthodox church relation which be likely to assume increase importance in the not too far distant future and here it be worth while to emphasise for the benefit of those who still regard russium with misgiving or dislike the indisputable fact that it be just the most democratic and enlighten of the smaller slavonic state and the most intellectual and enlighten politician and thinker in those state who have always look with the greatest confidence and enthusiasm to russium and who to-day be most unanimous in welcome she as the herald of a new era of humanity and progress § 17 _ general aim _ -- it would lead we much too far afield to consider the possible effect of the war upon colonial development and upon the political and commercial development of the far east here again the central fact to remember be that we may indeed that we must defeat germany or perish in the attempt but that a nation of 65 million inhabitant can not be efface or permanently reduce to impotence after the war the two nation will have to live peaceably side by side once more and repair so far as possible the wreckage to which this gigantic struggle have reduce they political social and commercial intercourse any peace settlement will be good only so far as it avoid place obstacle in the path of so difficult a achievement it will be the first duty of we statesman to watch over the alliance between russium and the western power seal as it be by the fiery ordeal of war and to neutralise the occult influence which be even now work to undermine it to the advantage of interest which be anything but british but it will also be they duty to create a situation which while safeguard the empire 's vital interest shall not render improved relation with the central european power impossible from the very outset it be one thing to abandon we ally and friend it be quite another thing to perpetuate a feud which though convert by circumstance into a struggle between two unanimous nation be in the first instance the work of mischievous if powerful minority the final settlement will inevitably bring many disappointment and error in its train we can best guard against such a result by prepare ourselves for all eventuality and give the most careful consideration to each of the many problem at issue we obvious aim must be a settlement which show some reasonable prospect of permanence and this can best be achieve if we respect so far as possible the wish of the population concern the principle of nationality be not a talisman which will open all gate for in some part of europe the different race be so inextricably intermingle as to defy all effort to create ethnographic boundary this do not however affect the central fact that nationality be the best salve for exist wound and that its application will enormously reduce the infected area but if the people be to make they wish feel there must be a regeneration of diplomatic method throughout europe attempt will be make to revive the pernicious principle of the congress of vienna by which a few autocrat and aristocrat carve out the fate of million accord to they dynastic appetite or fancy and thus tie a whole series of unnecessary knot for subsequent war to sever a healthy and informed public opinion -- especially in the west -- must watch over the doings of those who represent it at the fateful congress accord loyal support to they declare policy but promptly check the reactionary tendency which be certain to reveal themselves it be still unhappily possible for the arrogant impatience of a single ruler or the persistent intrigue and misrepresentation of a ambassador to embroil the european situation unless the nation in council can devise some practical check upon irresponsible meddle the flower of they manhood will have massacre each other in vain the antecedent of sir edward gray and more especially he attitude during the crisis which lead to war justify we in the hope that he entire influence will be employ in the right direction when the decisive moment arrive and that he will insist upon such crucial question as the reduction of armament the substitution of citizen for conscript army the control of armament firm and they occult influence the effective extension of arbitration and the elimination of impossible time-limit be discuss in all seriousness and not merely dismiss with a few ironic platitude and expression of hypocritical goodwill we must not be unduly discourage if some of these ideal prove impossible of realisation for it would be childish to suppose that when the great war be over the nation will at once convert they sword into ploughshare and proclaim for the first time in history the sway of right over might but it be obvious that in a world which have long cease to be merely european the european power can not long continue with impunity such internecine strife and that unless some real shape and substance can be give to the concert of europe -- so long and so justly a byword among all think man -- we continent -lrb- and with it these island -rrb- will inevitably forfeit the leadership which have hitherto be theirs and surrender the direction of the world 's affair into the hand of the extra-european power it will be remember that sir edward gray in a last despairing effort to preserve peace -lrb- 1 -rrb- broach the idea of some more definite rapprochement between the power and though admittedly hitherto too utopian to form the subject of definite proposal it may be hope that the enormous difficulty of the task will not deter he from plead before the future congress the outraged cause of international goodwill -lrb- footnote 1 : white paper no 101 -rrb- chapter viii social and economic aspect of the war and the economic ravages of war be also much greater with civilised nation than with barbarian a war nowadays may have stern fearful consequence especially through the destruction of the ingenious credit system -- treitschke those who have fall have consecrate death they have take they part in the making of a new europe a new world i can see sign of its come in the glare of the battlefield the people will gain more by this struggle in all land than they comprehend at the present moment a great flood of luxury and of sloth which have submerge the land be recede and a new britain be appear we can see for the first time the fundamental thing that matter in life and that have be obscure from we vision by the tropical growth of prosperity -- mrd lloyd george it be obvious that a great war must profoundly disturb every side of the national life of the people take part in it and that these disturbance must react upon neutral state the exact character and extent of these change however be by no means easy to understand and the present chapter do not pretend to offer a exhaustive treatment of they it be impossible to appreciate the full significance of the immediate social and economic reaction of the war whilst a attempt to state the ultimate effect of the war lead we along the slippery path of prophecy nevertheless we be not likely to grasp the importance of the various phenomenon which have follow so closely upon the heel of the declaration of war nor to adapt ourselves to the new situation which will arise out of the war unless we give we attention to the thing which be happen around we unfortunately we can gain little guidance from the past the south african war inevitably disturb the normal course of we industrial life but it involve we in conflict with a nation of relatively little general economic importance and so costly and prolonged though it be it bear no comparison in its magnitude and in the character of its main issue to the present war in europe the crimean war of sixty year ago though wage between four european nation -- great britain france turkey and russium -- cost great britain much less in money than the boer war the issue so far as this country be concern be not so momentous and industry and commerce though important be not then nearly so highly develop and complicate as they be now the napoleonic war though comparable to the present war in fundamental importance last for a generation which the war of to-day can hardly do the effect of the war with napoleon be complicate by the industrial revolution the industrial system and the commercial fabric erect on it be then only in process of formation and the power of the people be small these difference enable we to see the new factor which have come into play during the past century the present war be be fight under condition which be non-existent during the struggle with napoleon -- condition which on the one hand add to the waste and loss and misery of war but on the other give rise to the hope that many of its evil consequence may be avert firstly industry and commerce be world-wide the remotest country be bind together by economic tie invisible cord link the belgian iron worker with the london docker and the clyde shipwright the californian fruit grower with the malay tin miner and the german dye worker the economic effect of modern warfare therefore reverberate throughout the whole world and widespread dislocation ensue in the next place the gigantic scale on which war between great power be conduct though it tend to shorten the duration of war increase the intensity of the shock to human society but besides these new material condition modern warfare be carry on under the eye of more enlighten people than in the past the struggle which be now be pursue be the first great war watch by a conscious or at any rate partly conscious democracy it be the first modern war wage -lrb- except in we own case -rrb- by national army constitute practically the entire fit male population the mass of the people have in most civilised country some measure of political power and though to the elector diplomacy and the conduct of foreign affair be a closed book war once declare be war by the people and they voice must be hear in matter connect with it and arise out of it then further in the past the aftermath of war be in many way as horrible as war itself whilst the period during war witness a enormous amount of privation and suffering among non-combatant almost as ghastly as that of the battlefield this be due not so much to inaction result from callousness as to unwise action and ignorance during the past century political science and economic inquiry have make vast stride and consequently the injurious social effect of warfare may be minimize though not avert and a considerable body of public opinion far more enlighten than during any previous european war be almost certain to exercise some pressure in the direction of wise and far-reaching action both during the war and after it be end these consideration must be bear in mind in discuss both the present position and possible future development it be clear that four great european power and some smaller one can not engage in war without shake the fabric of european civilisation to its foundation the tramp of fifteen million armed man be the greatest social and economic fact of the present day and indeed of the present generation these million of combatant have to be clothe feed armed transport and tend in health and in sickness they be non-producer for the time consuming in large quantity the staple commodity of life and call in addition for all the paraphernalia of war sooner or later they will desire to return to the plough and the mine the factory and the railroad these two fact alone be of tremendous importance but besides this the activity of those who stay at home be call into play in a thousand different way and economic and social life leave they well-trodden path in answer to the imperious call of national necessity social institution of all kind be inevitably lead into new field of thought and action and state be drive to untried experiment in communal activity the usual channel of thought dry up the flood of new idea and of old idea throb with a new life rush on unconfined here in the shallows there in the deep presently to overflow into the old channel cleanse they bed and give they a new direction and link up in fruitful union but remotely connect stream when fight cease and there come the calm of peace society will tend to revert to its normal function base on peace but the society of yesterday can never return social life can not be the same as it be before not merely because those activity call forth by the war may persist in some form but because of the growth of new idea under the stimulus of the war the struggle will almost certainly set in progress train of think not only connect with question of war and peace but with the wider question of human destiny come to a closer view of the question we must distinguish between the immediate effect of the war which be already in evidence and the ultimate effect which will but begin to unfold themselves after the return of peace some of the latter result will grow out of the immediate effect other will be more directly due to the event follow on the conclusion of the war it will also be advisable to distinguish between the economic reaction of the war and the broader social consequence at such a early stage it would be presumptuous and tempting providence to attempt to forecast the future in any detail or to try to trace the play and interplay of the various force go towards the making of the future this chapter will be concern with broad tentative generalisation on quite simple line one of the thing which strike the intelligent work man during the early day of the war be the rapidity with which the state act in the face of the crisis in next to no time large measure of state control and action be put successfully into operation and those who have advocate co-operative action in the past with but indifferent success be amaze at the swiftness with which the nation can act in the hour of need the drastic action of the state can not be better illustrated than by the step which be take to meet the sudden commercial deadlock which the war precipitate a discussion of these financial measure will at the same time enable we to understand how through credit war strike at the industry and trade of the modern world a state action in industry and commerce the austrian ultimatum to servium be follow by the paralysis of the world 's international system of finance before the end of July many important stock exchange be close and by the 31st the london stock exchange for the first time in its history be also compel to close the remittance market collapse and with it the fabric of international trade widespread bankruptcy and ruin seem imminent so serious do the state of affair become that moratorium be declare not only in several european country but in part of america and in many continental country specie payment be suspend in a word the possibility of war have throw the delicately poise credit system of the commercial world out of gear the declaration of war have bring it to a standstill into a explanation of its work it be not possible to enter it be sufficient for we immediate purpose to realize that the foreign exchange machinery by which the supply of commodity from other country become practicable on a large scale be for a time altogether unworkable london as the financial center of the world have immense sum owe to it and in its turn owe large sum the ultimate effect of the collapse of credit which depend on confidence be that london could neither receive nor make payment the big finance house who have accept bill of exchange and render themselves liable to meet the payment for the thing they represent on the understanding that the means to pay they be to be promptly despatch find that these means be not forthcoming they own resource be far from sufficient to meet these payment utter ruin stare they in the face at home also a run on the bank seem probable which would have mean ruin to large number of people in this grave crisis the state act with commendable promptness the bank holiday be extend state note for 10 and # 1 be issue a moratorium be declare legalise the postponement of the due payment of debt with certain exception the bank of england under a guarantee from the government that the latter would meet the loss begin discount or buy for cash approve bill of exchange accept before war be declare many of which be hardly likely to be meet by the people liable for payment these step be take swiftly and boldly and allay the panic but more be need such measure be not in themselves sufficient to put the machinery of foreign exchange into operation again and the suspension of this method of settle international indebtedness be have serious effect to carry on international trade and to supply ourselves with the produce on which the very existence of the community depend without the machinery be a thousand time more difficult than to conduct we home trade by means of direct barter without go into technical detail it may be say that the purchase of bill by the bank of england whilst relieve the last holder from loss do not extinguish the liability of person whose name have appear on the bill as acceptor endorser and drawer this be true of trader and commercial people not only in this country but also in other part of the world in the face of these liability in most case unexpected it be hardly likely that they would increase they liability under new bill consequently the remittance come to london shrink to next to nothing as bill of exchange -- or they equivalent -- be the means by which both importer and exporter get pay for they goods the difficulty of get pay naturally begin to have a serious effect on trade as the figure of foreign trade during August show cargo be be hold up it be clear therefore that if this country be to continue to receive supplies of corn and meat of cotton and wool of hide and timber something further must be do the question the government have to decide be what step could be take to safeguard the food of the people and to avoid a crush volume of unemployment through the lack of the raw material of industry the produce be there what be need be to start the flow of the particular kind of currency -- credit money -- which would expedite exchange the course take by the state be to advance money to the large bill banker or accept house in london to allow of the due payment of the enormous number of bill fall due in the three month succeed the outbreak of war the audacity of the step will be understand when it be realize that probably something like # 300000000 of bill fall due over a period of three month -lrb- 1 -rrb- the necessary money be lend without security the government promise not to demand repayment until twelve month after the end of the war a proportion of this advance will be in the nature of a loss though how much it be quite impossible to say by this measure in the event of the bill not be meet by those who have promise to pay they -- the acceptor -- the liability which would ordinarily have fall upon the drawer and endorser through whose hand the bill have pass have be remove the state have advance to the commercial community a huge sum of money risk the total loss of some part of it in order to set in motion the machinery of international exchange further step however be take the general moratorium expire on November 4 useful as it have be it still leave many trader in financial difficulty because of the impossibility of collect debt owe to they in enemy and other country the government therefore appoint a committee represent the treasury the bank of england the joint stock bank and the association of chamber of commerce of the unite kingdom to authorise advance in approve case to british trader carry on a export business in respect of debt outstanding in foreign country and colony include unpaid foreign and colonial accept bill which can not be collect for the time be it be safe to say that no government ever take such gigantic measure to meet a great crisis -lrb- 2 -rrb- the prime minister speaking at the guildhall on November 9 1914 summarise as follow the effect of the step take : the foreign exchange be work in the case of most country quite satisfactorily and the gold reserve at the bank of england which be 40 million on July 22 and which have fall on August 7 to 27 million now stand at the unprecedented figure of 69-1\/2 million the central gold reserve of the country after three month of the war amount to # 80000000 almost exactly twice the amount at which it stand at the beginning of the crisis the bank rate which rise as you know to 10 per cent have now come down to 5 a figure i think not in excess of that at which it stand this time last year food price have be keep at a fairly normal level and though trade have be curtail in some direction unemployment have be rather below than above the average -lrb- footnote 1 : mr jm keyne -lrb- _ economic journal _ sept 1914 -rrb- estimate the aggregate value of outstanding bill in london at # 350000000 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in addition to these various financial measure the state have lend belgium # 10000000 and the union of south africa # 7000000 whilst it have also guarantee # 5000000 of the new egyptian cotton loan -rrb- but this be by no mean the only example of state action the government have establish temporarily a state-aided system of marine insurance by undertake 80 per cent of the war risk in order to encourage overseas trade it have give substantial aid to the joint-stock bank for the sole purpose that they might be fit to aid in every way possible the country 's trade and finance -lrb- 1 -rrb- it make arrangement for the direct purchase of forage and vegetable etc from farmer -lrb- 2 -rrb- it take over the control of the railway when owe to panic there be a rush for the purchase of food-stuff which be use to force up price unduly the government intervene to prevent exorbitant charge particularly interesting be the action of the state regard sugar two-third of we supply of which come from germany and austrium in the day immediately follow the declaration of war wholesale price be treble the government therefore decide to take upon itself the task of ensure a adequate supply of sugar and a royal commission be appoint the lead refiner be approach and a arrangement be make with the whole body of refiner that they should stand aside from the market for raw sugar leave it free for the operation of the government the royal commission pledge the refiner to buy they sugar from the commission _ ie _ from the state sugar be to be offer to they at a fix price and the refiner be to sell the refined product to the dealer also at a fix price sufficient to yield the refiner a fair profit on manufacture as a result of the corner a big rise in the price of sugar which be not only a important domestic commodity but the raw material of several industry be avert this merit the description give of it in _ the nation _ -- a really dashing experiment in state socialism -lrb- 3 -rrb- on the other hand it have do nothing to increase the world 's supply of sugar but have merely commandeer a part of the exist stock the aid of the state have be invoke in other direction already the government have assist experimental cultivation of beet in this country the suggestion have be make that the state should build two beet-sugar factory which would cost about # 200000 each in this way it be suggest that we home supply of sugar would in the future be assure and that agriculture would benefit considerably -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ round table _ sept 1914 p 705 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : this be do through the board of agriculture for the war office on the other hand in the purchase of clothing boot blanket etc the war office approach the producer directly instead of through the board of trade -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : it be report in the press on October 8 1914 that the home secretary have purchase 900000 ton of sugar at about # 20 per ton the transaction involve a outlay of about # 18000000 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : see a article by mr robertson scott in _ the nineteenth century _ October 1914 -rrb- sir charle macara have put forward a scheme of state aid for the cotton industry owe to the war a third of the total cotton crop -lrb- usually take by the continental country -rrb- be throw on the market price naturally fall and there be a danger that the cotton planter might not be able to pay the debt they have contract to enable they to grow they crop in which case there would be a likelihood of the land be use for other saleable commodity and the effort which have be make in the past to increase the cotton crop would be nullify in the meantime the surplus cotton on the market create a uncertainty regard price and buy come to a standstill with the result that the position of the industry as a whole become very critical the suggestion of sir charle macara be that the government of this country and the united state act in conjunction should take the temporarily unsaleable surplus of raw cotton off the market and store it for use in year when the crop be short in other word it be propose to establish a permanent national cotton reserve it be estimate that the cost of the scheme would mean a outlay of sixty to seventy million sterling if the plan be put into operation however it be claim that it would restore confidence prevent the wholesale stoppage of mill and at the same time establish a cotton reserve to counteract the fluctuation of crop in the future -lrb- 1 -rrb- these matter need but to be state as example of the remarkable adaptability of the state and the possibility of drastic action under the pressure of imperative need -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it should be point out that the serious condition of the cotton industry be not due to the war the overstocking of the eastern and indian market during the trade boom of 1913 together with the financial crisis in indium last year have reduce the demand for cotton goods the war have merely emphasise a depression which have already fall on the industry sir charle macara 's scheme whilst it may be desirable on other grounds can not compensate for the shrinkage in the demand for lancashire product the government it be interesting to note have commission certain firm in alexandrium to buy cotton extensively from small proprietor at a reasonable rate on government account to be store until the arrival of more prosperous time -lrb- press association telegram _ daily press _ nov 2 1914 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the voluntary gift of different part of the empire should not be overlook besides these other step have be take the australian government for example in order to induce farmer to extend the area of cultivation have guarantee a fix minimum price of 4 for all wheat grow on the newly cultivate land -lrb- reuter 's correspondent _ daily press _ oct 27 1914 -rrb- -rrb- the course of event have show the temporary collapse of economic individualism in the face of the european crisis the economic system which work during time of peace could not meet successfully the crush effect of a european war it lack not only adequate resource but the necessary power of corporate action and co-ordination immediate state action seem to be the only way to avert disaster in a month britain come nearer than ever before to be a co-operative commonwealth it have be realize that industry and commerce be not primarily intend as a field for exploitation and profit but be essential national service in as true a sense as the army and navy the complexity of the modern economic world and the large individual gain which have be make in it have obscure the fact that the economic structure exist to serve the need of the community it be recognize by the government at any rate to some extent that the success of we army in the field would be nullify if in the economic sphere the production of commodity and service be seriously diminish and if they interchange be hamper in a large degree people have feel that the spinner the miner the weaver the machinist be all by follow they occupation perform a valuable service to the community how far this attitude of mind will persist after the war when normal condition in industry and commerce gradually return remain to be see b immediate social and economic effect of the war 1 _ foreign trade _ -- the effect of the war on industry and commerce will be complicate and far reach the british and german empire together transact about two-fifth of the international trade of the world the british empire do over a quarter and germany almost exactly a eighth between they they own over half the merchant shipping of the world a war in which they be both engage therefore must have serious consequence not only to these country themselves but to the country with whom they carry on business relation and through they in a lesser degree to all other commercial country but this be not all : france have a foreign trade amount to # 615000000 a year belgium 's be value at # 326000000 russium 's at # 275000000 and austria-hungary 's at # 256000000 besides a gigantic foreign trade there be a domestic trade which be on a larger scale than the external trade of these country let we consider in more detail the case of germany half she foreign trade be transact with the nation now engage in the great war the trade of britain russium and france with the german empire be now at a standstill except possibly for a very small amount transact via neutral country she trade with austria-hungary must seriously decline moreover she import from neutral country and she export to they have dwindle very considerably and must remain small as long as british naval supremacy continue more than one half of germany 's total import be raw material for manufacture about two-third of she export be manufacture goods assume that she continue o conduct foreign trade through norway and sweden denmark holland switzerland and austria-hungary the volume will be small and even if she whole trade with neutral country could be maintain she would still be without the trade of she enemy for example in 1913 this country sell goods to the value of # 40000000 to germany and purchase from she goods to the value of # 80000000 -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the follow list indicate some of the chief article of trade between the two country : german import into the unite | british export to germany 1912 kingdom 1912 | | # million | # million sugar 6 · 2 | cotton and yarn 8 · 3 cotton and yarn 5 · 9 | woollens and yarn 6 · 6 iron and steel and | coal coke etc 4 · 4 manufacture 5 · 7 | herring 2 · 4 woollens and yarn 2 · 6 | ironwork 2 · 1 machinery 2 · 4 | machinery 2 · 1 glass and manufacture 1 · 1 | it be not true as dr rg usher say that germany be literally self-sufficing -lrb- _ pan germanism _ p 65 -rrb- -rrb- in great britain economic activity have be develop on the assumption of continued peace in germany however though there be those who would base all economic policy on a imaginary permanent peace -lrb- 1 -rrb- the government have have in view the possibility of war every conscientious government write von bülow seek to avoid -lrb- war -rrb- so long as the honor and vital interest of the nation permit of so do but every state department should be organise as if war be go to break out tomorrow this apply to economic policy as well -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be with this idea in mind that the german government have strive to maintain the importance of agriculture economic policy must foster peaceful development but it must keep in view the possibility of war and for this reason above all must be agrarian in the best sense of the word -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be hold that in the event of war the home market in germany would be a important factor in maintain intact the fabric of industry the home market we be tell be of very great importance it would be call upon to replace the foreign market if in time of war we national frontier should be wholly or partly close but in the home market agriculture be by far the most important customer of industry only if agriculture be able to buy if it earn enough itself to enable other to earn too will it be able in critical time to consume a part of the product which can not be dispose of abroad the old proverb if the peasant have money then every one else have too be literally true as soon as industry be force to a greater extent than be necessary in time of peace to find its customer at home -lrb- 4 -rrb- as in time of war industry be dependent on the buying power of agriculture the productive power of agriculture be a vital question for the nation -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ by prince bernhard von bülow p 221 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ ibid _ p 220 see also bernhardi _ germany and the next war _ pp 157-159 and 260 _ et seq _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : _ imperial germany _ pp 220-221 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ imperial germany _ p 219 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ ibid _ p 221 -rrb- the importance of agriculture in germany be undoubtedly great it may be as bülow say that the value of its produce be equal to that of the produce of industry or even surpass it -lrb- 1 -rrb- but if the demand for it be to shrink because the industrial population lose they work through a shortage of raw material or in any other way agriculture would also suffer the population at present engage in agriculture will in time of peace buy up to the practical limit of its purchase power and be hardly likely especially in the early stage of a war to consume a part of the product which can not be dispose of abroad except in so far as they buy german goods -lrb- the production of which the declaration of the war may have seriously impede -rrb- instead of commodity produce abroad but it be questionable whether they will be able to maintain they aggregate purchasing power prince bülow ignore the fact that production for the home market will be hamper by the possible non-arrival of foreign raw material in war time yet germany import raw cotton to the value of over # 29000000 in 1913 she foreign purchase of hide and skin amount to over # 22500000 and of wool to # 10000000 with even a partial suspension of import of these and similar commodity industry dependent on foreign product must be severely hit unemployment must increase and the purchase power of the urban worker diminish the agricultural community must suffer also and in all likelihood will not be able to take they normal share of goods off the market it be true of course that germany buy large quantity of food-stuff from abroad and that home produce will be require to take they place but they can not be grow immediately in the interval industrial disorganisation must result and before agriculture can begin to profit by the lack of foreign supplies the harm will have be do moreover agriculture must be impede as owe to the size of the german empire the transport of troops must seriously interfere with the conveyance of goods to the larger centre of population it would seem therefore that the policy of develop german agriculture at the same time that she dependence on foreign commerce be increase be not a effective reply to the british navy the position in germany then be that she must for the present be satisfy with a much smaller amount of import food-stuff and of the raw material of industry and that in any case even if the industrial machine could be keep at work there will be practically no outlet for goods abroad commercially isolate she must therefore suffer a industrial and commercial collapse on the other hand the total volume of unemployment which would have be enormous during the first week of the war have of course be considerably reduce by the withdrawal of great mass of man to join the color and by the stimulus which the war have give to industry supply the need of the german army then also rotterdam through which germany do a great deal of its trade remain open whilst a fraction of she foreign trade be be carry on through denmark scandinavium and switzerland nevertheless the amount of economic distress within a very few week after the outbreak of war especially in the large town be considerable even on the showing of german newspaper -lrb- 2 -rrb- the amount of distress be increase and intensify by steadily rise price as the rise have take place not only in commodity of which there be a shortage but in other such as sugar it may be conclude that it be due largely to the inflation of the currency owe to the adoption of the fatally easy expedient of issue large mass of paper money -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ibid _ p 217 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : let we imagine say bernhardi the endless misery which a protracted stoppage or definite destruction of we oversea trade would bring upon the whole nation and in particular on the mass of the industrial class who live on we export trade _ -lrb- germany and the next war _ p 232 -rrb- accord to _ the time _ -lrb- sept 18 1914 -rrb- the german nautical newspaper _ hansa _ on sept 12 admit

for year the _ neue freie presse _ of vienna on sept 11 admit that the activity of the exporter in germany have be cripple accord to _ the time _ -lrb- oct 7 -rrb- the german socialist paper _ vorwaert _ state that the state of want have reach a alarming extent even though we be now only at the beginning of the catastrophe which have befall the people of europe mass of unemployment grow every month -rrb- austria-hungary which be not a advanced industrial country will not suffer quite so keenly though even here the german newspaper admit that trade have come almost to a standstill -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the western theater of war the fighting have centre largely round the franco-belgian coalfield on or near which stand on both side of the frontier many industrial town lille nancy epinal belfort reim amien and valencienne on one side and liège and charlerous on the other be all of economic importance even apart from the actual destruction due to the war which in some of these town have be serious the mere presence of the contend army will have a more or less paralysing effect on industrial and commercial life in both france and belgium -lrb- 2 -rrb- the position in belgium however be much more serious than in france it may best be describe in the word of professor sarolea write after a visit of five week to he native country other belligerent nation may suffer from unemployment in belgium alone there have be create a whole nation of unemployed in other country trade and industry be dislocate in belgium they have come to a complete standstill out of a population of eight million seven million be under the heel of the invader railwayman be starve for railway have cease to work office clerk be starve for bank and office be close public official be starve for no salary can be pay journalist and printer be starve for newspaper and book have cease to appear mill hand and coal miner and ironworker be starve for mill and coal mine and iron work be close -lrb- 3 -rrb- bad as this be the condition of affair be somewhat relieve so far as france and belgium be concern by the fact that the sea be open to they but even then we must add these area to germany and austria-hungary as region where industry and trade be at the best severely hamper region all of which be important factor in the market of europe and whose commercial paralysis will re-echo through the whole commercial world -lrb- footnote 1 : the shortage of raw material notably cotton wool jute and petroleum be greatly restrict production in many branch of manufacture in austria-hungary accord to official estimate the supplies of some of the most necessary raw product be barely sufficient for two more month factory be close down and the number of unemployed be steadily increase -lrb- reuter 's telegram from venice oct 21 1914 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : for example the probable number of french factory in a position to produce sugar in 1914-15 will be 82 or 83 as against 206 during the year 1913-14 _ -lrb- time _ nov 3 1914 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : letter to the press date sept 12 1914 mr jh whitehouse mp who visit belgium say the whole life of the nation have be arrest -rrb- the most fortunately situate combatant in europe be russium and great britain the former cover half the area of europe have almost limitless resource and be much more easily capable of be self-supporting than any of the other great power engage in the war this country still have the sea open to it -lrb- 1 -rrb- the state subsidy to marine insurance have encourage overseas trade and the re-establishment of the remittance market have remove a obstacle to the flow of export and import still it be true that the financial world can not recover all at once it be like a man whose nervous system have be shatter by a great shock tonic and stimulant may save he from complete collapse but real recovery be a matter of month and even year -lrb- 2 -rrb- further the work hitherto do and the service perform for germany and austrium be now no longer call for we ally in the west of europe be suffer acutely from the immediate economic effect of the war and the large destruction of capital we neutral customer have not escape scot-free it would seem therefore that in spite of the british command of the sea production must necessarily be seriously curtail and that therefore the volume of unemployment must be very considerable on the other hand though production in france belgium and russium may diminish in many direction what goods they do produce for export will find no market in germany and austria-hungary and a proportion of they will find they way to this country such commodity will not only be valuable as food and raw material for industry but will set up a flow of british goods in payment for they further the production of commodity need for the prosecution of the war will increase the volume of employment goods of all kind be require not only for the british army but for the ally generally the manner and extent to which these factor have influence unemployment will be consider presently -lrb- footnote 1 : accord to a admiralty statement correct up to sept 23 1914

the other hand 387 german vessel have be detain or capture the total tonnage be 1140000 accord to _ the time _ -lrb- oct 9 1914 -rrb- up to date 16 per cent of the tonnage register in the unite kingdom have be lose the figure for germany and austrium be 18 and 13 per cent respectively the committee which prepare the state war insurance scheme estimate that the loss during the first six month of the war might be about 10 per cent of all british steamer employ in foreign trade -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ round table _ sept 1914 p 704 -rrb- now the demand for the goods hitherto supply by germany to she foreign customer though abate will still continue as we have see she can not for the present supply they by whom will she be supersede -lrb- 1 -rrb- the government of this country early in the war take step to co-operate with british trader in a attempt to obtain some share of this trade and the united state also strive to make the fullest use of the opportunity in this country goods previously import from germany will if still need either be buy from the next cheapest importer or produce at home commodity which we have in the past produce for german consumption be not now require from we if they continue to be make it must be for other country in other word whether the volume of british foreign trade remain the same or not a proportion of it will be divert into new channel during the progress of the war in a less degree the trade of other state will be deflect from its accustomed channel beyond this special influence will be feel in the case of certain new country as for example canada canada 's annual balance of trade be probably about # 60000000 against she : # 30000000 be the excess of she trade import over she trade export and the remain # 30000000 represent she annual payment on money borrow she have balance she account hitherto by borrow very large sum of money now she will be unable to do that any longer nor will she at present at any rate obtain the immigrant on which she be count to enable she to pay she interest she can not redeem the balance due by the export of gold the burden would be too great in any case and moreover she have suspend specie payment a part of the balance due may be cover by the higher value of she export such as wheat the remainder she can only meet either by increase she export or by reduce she import the latter she have already begin to do -lrb- 2 -rrb- this new readjustment may be accompany by great economic loss in any case the dislocation will be harmful for the time not only to the new country but to the country with whom they trade it be clear that foreign trade generally will during the war gradually be readjust to the new condition of the time to what extent the various stream of the world 's trade will be direct into new channel it be impossible to say the readjustment will be partly temporary and partly permanent -lrb- 3 -rrb- this redistribution of production if it lead to production under less favourable condition than before will tend to raise price and thereby probably diminish the power to buy other commodity if it lead to the substitution of a well organised and well pay industry by a industry of a less skilled kind there will be in effect a net lowering of wages the widespread effect of the war on industry and commerce must therefore have a profound effect on the whole of the economic world -lrb- footnote 1 : towards the end of August the tin-plate and steel-sheet trade in this country which have suffer badly on the outbreak of war revive and several mill be reopen owe to the obtain of order which formerly go to germany -lrb- _ board of trade labor gazette _ sept 1914 p 330 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ round table _ sept 1914 pp 708-9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : this of course do not mean that great britain will capture german trade and increase its foreign commerce by the amount of its value -rrb- 2 _ unemployment and short time _ -- we be now able to understand how the war have affect the individual workman as we have see the panic cause by the outbreak of war and the collapse of the remittance market mean in many industry the hold up of production and the stoppage of the workman 's wages if it have not be possible to restart the machinery of exchange starvation would have walk through the land and the industry dependent on foreign raw material would have close down altogether as it be the inevitable dislocation increase the amount of unemployment -lrb- 1 -rrb- whereas the trade union percentage -lrb- 2 -rrb- of unemployment amongst they member be only 28 at the end of July it have reach 71 by the end of August this figure however be considerably below the percentage of unemployed during many period of trade depression the average for the whole of 1908 be 78 and for 1909 77 whilst during the month of march 1912 it rise to 113 as a result of the coal strike -lrb- footnote 1 : note that unemployment prior to the war be show a tendency to increase -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it should be observe that these figure relate only to about a million trade unionist no non-unionist be include further they ignore short time -rrb- the volume of unemployment during August vary considerably from trade to trade in the cotton industry which however appear to be in for a bad time anyhow 177 per cent of the trade union member be return as unemployed during August 1914 whilst in coal mining the percentage be 13 as compare with the previous month of July there be a general decline in all industry except shipbuilding which benefit by increase activity on government work the contraction in the volume of employment be specially mark in the case of tin-plate work and in the textile furnishing and woodworking and pottery trade again in the trade where the government scheme of compulsory unemployment insurance apply the volume of unemployment at the end of July be 36 per cent but at the end of August it have reach 62 per cent or double the volume record in August 1913 -lrb- 1 -rrb- beyond this there be during the month of August a enormous amount of short time in several industry for which particulars be available thousand of workpeople be work half-time or less -lrb- 2 -rrb- the rise which take place in the price of certain food-stuff especially during the first part of August intensify the evil by reduce real wages -lrb- footnote 1 : the gradual increase during the month may be observe from the weekly return : -- aug 7 40 per cent aug 14 51 per cent aug 21 58 per cent aug 28 62 per cent -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the board of trade receive monthly report from employer and other in different industry these return though they do not cover the whole of the industry be sufficiently reliable to indicate the widespread character of short time during August 1914 in slate quarry and china clay work there be a good deal of short time and some unemployment in consequence of the war in tin-plate and sheet-steel work short time be very general in some case discharge be obviate by the sharing of work at the mill remain open the decrease in employment be to be attribute to the effect of the war and in particular to the general restriction of the european market some branch of the engineering trade particularly agricultural and textile machinery and the motor car and cycle trade be disorganise by the war many discharge take place and a large amount of short time be work in the miscellaneous metal trade except in the manufacture of article require for military and naval purpose much short time be report in the cotton industry the trade as a whole be work less than three day a week and large number of workpeople be entirely unemployed in the woollen trade about 60 per cent of the workpeople cover by the return receive be on short time include over 20 per cent who be work half-time or less the return show a decrease of 215 per cent in the amount of wages pay compare with a month ago in the worst industry about 65 per cent of the workpeople cover by the return be work short time during the month include over 30 per cent who be work only half time or less the return show a decrease of 265 per cent in the amount of wages pay compare with a month ago in the linen trade short time be report generally in the hosiery industry short time be report by firm employ over 40 per cent of the operative cover by the return in the silk trade a great deal of short time be work in all the district in the lever and curtain branch of the lace industry the majority of the operative be only work half time and large number be altogether unemployed in the carpet trade short time be general most district work only half the usual hour in the furnish trade short time be work in almost every district short time be very generally report in printing in the glass trade short time be report in several district in the pottery most of the firm be run short time -lrb- see the _ board of trade labor gazette _ sept 1914 -rrb- -rrb- during the month of September however employment revive -lrb- 1 -rrb- besides government work in shipbuilding yard certain branch of the woollen industry be work at full pressure on the production of blanket and cloth for uniform the leather and boot and shoe industry on some side receive a impetus from the large order place for army boot hosiery and knit goods be require in large quantity speak generally industry whose product be require for the army and navy be strain to the extent of they resource but each industry supply a large variety of goods of many different grade and machinery and work equipment can not always be easily convert to the production of other class of commodity so that even in the woollen and boot trade for example the whole industry be not uniformly busy the many industry however to which the war bring no order enjoy but a slight recovery and in some case none at all as the month of September proceed the newspaper triumphantly refer to the fall in the percentage of unemployment the truth be that the decline be by no means general or uniform but be bring about not so much by the gradual revival of normal activity but by the rush of government order for instance the cotton industry remain in the trough of a deep depression and the furniture and piano make trade profit little further no account be take of the prevalence of short time though over a large field it be widespread especially amongst woman what the real position of the labor market be after we have be at war two month can not be precisely determine but it be certainly more serious than the board of trade percentage would seem to indicate -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the percentage of unemployment at the beginning of October in the trade compulsorily insure against unemployment be 51 as compare with 63 at the beginning of the previous month -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : certain confidential statistical enquiry on a large scale be say to support the inference to be draw from the figure publish by the board of trade that at least 10 per cent of the fifteen million wage-earner in the unite kingdom be not at work at all whilst quite as large a proportion be on short time but out of more than a million man whose service the employer have thus temporarily dispense with some nine hundred thousand be be clothe or be go to be clothe in khaki and give government pay thus the actual unemployment among man be except in -lrb- certain -rrb- black patch only sporadic and scarcely more than we be accustom to very different be the situation of the woman wage-earner of these apparently half a million be now unemployed and twice as many be work only short time though the industrial situation be considerably better than would have be predict for the end of the second month of a world war it be in fact worse than it have be at any time during the past quarter of a century _ -lrb- new statesman _ oct 3 1914 -rrb- -rrb- the month of October see a further recovery and a more normal state of affair the percentage of unemployment in insured trade continue to decline -lrb- 1 -rrb- but whilst the number of man on the labor exchange register fell -lrb- from 28664 on October 2 to 24690 on October 30 -rrb- the number of woman register remain almost stationary at the end of three month from the beginning of the war the condition of man 's employment be about normal but woman be suffer from excessive unemployment whilst short time be still common in many industry in which woman be largely employ -lrb- footnote 1 : the percentage be as follow : oct 2 511 oct 9 480 oct 16 446 oct 23 429 oct 30 416 -rrb- the large volume of unemployment which it have be anticipate would accompany a great war be avoid partly because of prompt state action in maintain the fabric of commerce and finance and therefore the supply of raw material and partly because of the large demand for commodity for the army and navy -- a war demand vastly in excess of that in any previous war in other word state intervention and the navy have place great britain in a much superior economic position to that of she adversary 3 _ trade union co-operative society and distress _ -- before the outbreak of the war there be sign that the wave of industrial activity which reach a high point in 1913 be recede and that unemployment be begin to increase but the trade union do not anticipate that the ordinary ebb and flow of trade be to be disturb by a great war within a very short time after the declaration of war the trade union experience a heavy drain on they fund in respect of unemployment benefit it be of course obvious that the accumulate fund of trade union be never intend as a subsidy to the community during a time of war which be what in point of fact they become it be true that the union make effort to conserve they resource in various way not least by advise they younger member without dependant to join the army it be true also that most of they profit under section 106 of the national insurance act by the state refund of one-sixth of they payment to they unemployed member but these measure -- and other -- be inadequate to maintain the union in a sound financial condition and many union tremble on the verge of bankruptcy -lrb- 1 -rrb- such a condition of affair be view with apprehension not only by the trade union movement but by the state with the result that at the beginning of October the government subsidy of one-sixth be under certain condition increase -lrb- 2 -rrb- but even with this assistance many union will undoubtedly experience considerable difficulty in avoid financial disaster speak generally the trade union movement as a whole will emerge from the war in straitened circumstance some union may have collapse and amongst other the movement in favor of amalgamation may have receive a impetus owe to financial embarrassment -lrb- footnote 1 : speak generally it can not be say that the trade union face the crisis with either wisdom or courage they attitude on the whole be one of utter bewilderment the lack of the power of adaptability to new circumstance together with the fact that sufficient pressure be not bring to bear upon the government in the first week of the war account for the unfortunate position in which the trade union find themselves -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the scheme apply only to union suffer from abnormal unemployment there be also condition that they should not pay unemployment benefit above a maximum rate of 17 per week include any sum pay by way of state unemployment benefit and that they should agree while in receipt of the emergency grant to impose levy over and above the ordinary contribution upon those member who remain fully employ the amount of the emergency grant in addition to the refund of one-sixth already payable will be either one-third or one-sixth of the expenditure on out-of-work pay depend on the amount of the trade union levy under special condition the grant be to be retrospective it be therefore possible for trade union to be subsidise so far as unemployment benefit be concern to the extent of one-half they payment but this scheme do nothing to assist trade union -lrb- of which there be many -rrb- which get no unemployment benefit -rrb- the decrease in earnings accompany short time and they total stoppage in the case of unemployment mean amongst the worker a restriction of purchase power the shrinkage in the total wages bill especially in lancashire must lead to a diminution in the income of small trader and the co-operative society where trade be very bad the society will be severely hit smaller purchase will mean smaller profit which where there be no large reserve to fall back upon will in turn mean the declaration of a smaller dividend the divi receive by the worker will be less and the purchase which the thrifty housewife of the north usually make with it in the way of clothing and replacement of household article will be less also where the divi have be leave in the society it will in a large number of case be use to supplement the scanty wages earn on short time or to provide the necessaries of life where the breadwinner be altogether unemployed in place where time become very bad the co-operative society during the war and for some time after will suffer because of the conversion of the cash order which ordinarily go to the co-op into credit order at the shop round the corner on the whole however the co-operative society will probably come better out of the war than many class of small shop-keeper the small tailor draper earthenware dealer etc and other who sell all but indispensable commodity will see a shrinkage in they sale especially if price rise the co-operative society will also lose in this respect but they will lose less on the whole owe to the fact that a good deal of they capital be use in the sale of food-stuff the consumption of which will be restrict last but admit this they can not expect to escape unscathed and the blow they suffer will be feel on other side of they activity such as they educational work the income for which usually fluctuate with the prosperity of the society the diminution of the purchase power of the work people because of the restriction of the national wages bill however may be minimize by common action the national relief fund and the woman 's employment fund be intend really for this purpose the establishment of woman 's training workshop and of maintenance grant on condition of attendance at school and class be step in the same direction the government have increase the disgracefully low payment make to dependant of soldier on active service and its scale of pension for widow of soldier and sailor and for those totally or partially disabled in the performance of military or naval duty arrangement have be make for the payment of allowance of half wages up to a maximum of # 1 a week to dependant of sailor employ on insured british merchant ship capture or detain by the enemy more important from the point of view of industry as a whole be the step which have be take to minimize the effect of a diminution in the volume of employment by the development of new opening the government through the board of trade take the lead in the attempt to secure a share of the trade hitherto do by germany and austrium special effort be make to develop the manufacture of toy and other industrial experiment be begin by the central committee on woman 's employment the government appoint a chemical product supply committee with a view to stimulate the production of dye and drug at home these proposal be in the main a attempt to divert the trade of foreign country especially germany into british channel the second line of action be fuller provision of home need which can not be satisfy by foreign producer but be essentially domestic such need be housing public park road etc between August 4 and September 21 1914 the local government board receive over 600 application from local authority for power to borrow money amount in all to over # 2500000 about a fifth of this amount it be intend to expend on housing during this period the board sanction loan amount in the aggregate to more than # 3500000 as compare with rather under # 2000000 in the same period in 1913 the road board arrange to put in hand the construction of certain new highway arrange for before the beginning of the war in addition in the first seven week of the war the board arrange to make grant amount to about # 450000 in aid of new road construction and road improvement in many different part of the country which will involve a total expenditure of about a million sterling the development commission begin to consider scheme for the construction of light railway for the improvement of the navigation of river etc in order that work of this kind should be ready to be put into operation when the necessity arise the board of agriculture have urge that where practicable the acreage under wheat should be increase this suggestion be of course valuable but will not greatly affect the industrial situation even if the scheme sanction by the local government board and those adopt by the road board be put into operation immediately which be almost impossible they would not make a very appreciable difference to the total wages bill of the country but perhaps it be think by the government that the state of employment be not sufficiently grave to warrant a greater expenditure at the present time in spite of the insistence on forestall destitution there be still among local authority much confusion of charity and relief work with anticipation of future need call for employment through the ordinary channel of trade on the whole the government have not meet the domestic problem of the war with the unanimity and boldness which have characterise its action in the actual prosecution of the war and in deal with the financial crisis 4 _ the new spirit _ -- the broader social effect which show themselves in the early day of the war be illustrate by the remarkable growth of state socialism the nation become a community unite in a single purpose breach which many imagine to be permanent cleavage which be think to be fundamental no longer exist none be for a party all be for the state the three political party form a parliamentary recruiting committee and altogether impossible team of people appear on public platform with a common aim mr ben tillett in word that might have fall from the lip of a tory ex-cabinet minister declare that every resource at we command must be utilise for the purpose of preserve we country and nation the anti-militarist trade union movement earnestly appeal to those of its member who be ex-non-commissioned officer to re-enlist the queen and miss mary macarthur be member of the same committee this unanimity which have push into the background for the present cause of difference have lead the vast majority of people to submit cheerfully to the will of the state the unity of to-day must necessarily make its influence feel even when the reason of its existence have pass away in the meantime it be assist in the growth of a new spirit which the war itself have foster the social outlook of the people and they attitude towards the larger problem of life be change and patriotism have take a deeper meaning so far we have devote we attention to some of the immediate effect of the war but on the return of peace there will be new influence at work the immediate and ultimate effect of which will powerfully affect the course of future development the european war will mark a era in international politics it may also stand as a landmark in the history of the social and economic life of western europe it be not unlikely that in this respect it will surpass in its importance all the war of the past the reason be to be find in the magnitude and costliness of the war the highly develop character and the inter-relatedness of foreign commerce the possibility of new industrial force come into play and the influence of the war on the political and social idea of the european people it may be that in this country the war will let loose economic force destine to modify industrial organization very profoundly and that social force especially on the continent will be liberate to work towards fuller political freedom these thing lie in the veil future and prophecy be dangerous we may however turn to consider some of the probable effect the war will leave behind it c after the war 1 _ general effect _ -- when the war come to a end a immediate revival of commercial relation between the combatant state and a general revival of foreign trade can not be reasonably expect after the napoleonic war english manufacturer assume the eagerness of continental people to buy they goods be meet with the obvious fact that impoverished nation be not good customer when peaceful relation be resume in europe we shall recognize very vividly the extent to which industry and commerce on the continent have be close down even assume that british production continue germany belgium and austrium will have little to send we in exchange the closing of the overseas market of germany and the consequent shrinkage in production the disruption of normal industrial life by the withdrawal of million of man to join the color and the abnormal character of exist trade due to the need of the army in the field be not condition favourable to the easy resumption of normal commercial relation the dislocation of the mechanism of industry and commerce in europe on a much larger scale than ever before -- a mechanism which have with grow international relation and interdependence become more complicated and more sensitive in recent year -- can not be immediately remedy by a stroke of the pen or the fiat of a emperor the credit system upon which modern industry and commerce be build depend upon mutual confidence this confidence will not be restore among the combatant nation immediately on the cessation of war it will require time to grow further europe during the war have be spend its substance and must emerge much poorer this apply not only to combatant state but to neutral country some of which have float loan to meet the abnormal expenditure throw upon they by prolonged mobilisation the capital and credit of a large number of people will have suffer great loss or have vanish into thin air house shop and building of all kind produce manufacture and unmanufactured bridge ship railway station and stock of enormous value will have be destroy the community will have be impoverish not only by the expenditure of great army and the destruction of wealth but by the utilisation for immediate consumption of wealth which would have be use as new capital and by the withdrawal of probably close upon fifteen million man from production during the period of the war even if we assume that the world have lose the production of only twelve million man -lrb- 1 -rrb- the loss be enormous if each man be capable of produce on the average wealth to the value of # 100 per year the loss of production per year during the continuance of the war would be about # 1200000000 the effect of these factor will be heighten by the fact that the million of man whose need during the war have be satisfy by they non-combatant fellow-countryman will be throw upon they own resource and though europe will still need to be feed and clothe and house the effectual demand of the population for the goods and service it need a demand which it be able to satisfy because of its possession of exchangeable wealth will be smaller than before the war the demand will be more or less stifle until the credit system be re-established and mutual confidence restore and until industry and commerce have adjust themselves to the new situation the volume of employment in this country during the war will have be swollen by temporary demand for war supplies which will cease when the war end foreign trade will be uncertain a larger number of soldier will be throw on the labor market than ever before it would seem therefore that in the absence of special step the volume of unemployment at the close of the war will be a good deal greater than during the progress of the war -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the number must be larger than this as the mobilisation of the army of neutral state should be take into account -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it be think by some that the war will be follow by a short boom when europe will make good the necessity of industry and civilised life but it be at least doubtful whether there will be a rapid reproduction of these commodity owe to the condition already describe which will obtain at the close of the war in any case however it will be merely a flash in the pan and there will follow the gloom of a deep depression unless there be clear-sighted state action -rrb- it be just conceivable though one hope not probable that the economic effect of the war will be complicate by the imposition of war indemnity the indemnity be really a means of obtain booty from a vanquished state and have be look upon as a justifiable means of further humiliating a already beat enemy it have be point out -lrb- 1 -rrb- however that the advantage derive from a indemnity be not a unmixed gain the indemnity recoil on the head of those who impose it it be unnecessary here to enter into a consideration of the detailed effect of huge payment by defeat nation though it may be remark that the ramification of such payment be so intricate and often so incapable of measurement whilst other economic influence be at work at the same time that it be impossible to draw a accurate conclusion as to the net advantage or disadvantage of indemnity to the state which levy they but the point to be bear in mind be that the addition of a great debt to the already large burden of a unsuccessful war react upon all country with which the defeat state enter into business relation the loss due to this cause will not necessarily be counterbalance by gain from increase trade with the country receive the indemnity and even if they be the latter trade might be of a different character in any case country not party to the indemnity will be affect by it in some way or other war indemnity like war do not pass by neutral country and leave they untouched -lrb- footnote 1 : see norman angell _ the great illusion _ part i chap vi -rrb- it be important to remember that though modern warfare be much more costly and more exhausting than in the past there be another side to the matter society have also gain remarkably in its power of recuperation the blight of war be not as terrible as might be expect the accumulate knowledge the vastly increase productivity of industry and the high organising ability which have make the modern industrial and commercial world will not be obliterate by the war and though there will be difficulty in the way of they full operation when peace return they will aid powerfully in shorten the period of recovery the force which have transform mediaeval into modern city in a few short year will still exist though they can hardly be expect to overcome all the many factor likely to restrain economic activity they may be rely on to stimulate the revival of normal economic life indeed the knowledge of science and the faculty of organization be likely to be apply more extensively than in the past to productive process after the war when the state of europe begin to tread the path of peace again one of the first thing to be do will be to repair as far as possible the damage do by the war take belgium as a extreme example leave aside the irreparable destruction of historic building and priceless treasure there be many million pound ' worth of house and farm building shop warehouse factory public building ship railway station and bridge to be replace this work will take precedence over other kind of production sugar motor car glass etc will still be manufacture but chiefly in order to buy the requisite raw material and finish goods for the replacement of the wealth destroy by the ravages of the war speak generally belgium will probably consume less food than ordinarily wear less clothes and consume less luxury savings which would normally have be devote to new industrial development will be need to make good the loss in exist industrial establishment it be clear therefore that the economic growth of belgium will be retard in a great degree -lrb- 1 -rrb- the same hold good of germany though probably not to the same extent unless the theater of war be extend to cover a considerable part of the empire in the case of we own country provide it remain free from invasion there will not be such a large replacement of lose wealth and capital destroy by the war except in the case of shipping but in common with other state there will be the war to pay for and certain obligation to meet regard the maim and the relative of the slay taxation will be heavy and therefore on this ground alone the accumulation of new capital will be retard industrial organization have be re-arranged and modify to meet the requirement of the war period will not resume its old form without a good deal of creak and jolting and even if it could it will not be able to face the new condition arise out of the war at all rapidly there be every prospect therefore of a time of great difficulty after the war be over before the normal course of industrial and commercial activity be fully resume in all likelihood we shall find that the relative importance of we various industry will have alter to some extent and that the nature of we trade will have be modify also then also the relative position of we home and foreign trade may shift in other word if the war last sufficiently long for new industry to develop and become efficient they may survive the competition of foreign goods after the war in which case the goods which have hitherto be produce to buy the foreign goods will not now be require for foreign trade it may be that on the return of peace some european state in order to give they industry a opportunity to recover from the effect of the war will inaugurate new tariff there be indeed a strong possibility that on these grounds and because of the dependence of the unite kingdom on the product of germany the tariff reform movement here may be electrify into life -lrb- footnote 1 : if germany be require to compensate belgium for the damage do these effect will in large part disappear though the burden would still remain the difference would be that it would be more widely distribute -rrb- 2 _ possible industrial development _ -- but industrial change will not be confine to the direction and form which economic activity will take as have be suggest above there may be far-reaching change in the method of production it have be say that there be only one way by which the wealth of the world will be quickly replace after the war and that be by work the country whose worker show the greatest capacity for productiveness will be the country which will most rapidly recuperate -lrb- 1 -rrb- the question go deeper than the replacement of wealth the position after the war will be that production will be retard because of the diminution in the rate of accumulation of new capital since the beginning of the war there will be a certain amount of leeway to make up consequently there will be every incentive towards the greatest possible efficiency in production it be here that the worker be likely to be affect have labor reach its maximum efficiency it have be show by the application of what be call scientific management that the output of labor can be increase to a remarkable extent for instance instead of shovel 16 ton a day a man can shovel 59 ton a man load pig-iron increase he total load per day from 12-1\/2 to 47-1\/2 ton the day 's tale of brick lay have be raise from 1000 to 2700 the list could be extend to cover operative work at machine in the endeavor to screw up industry to a maximum of production it be not likely that the expedient of scientific management will long remain untried already the system be make considerable headway in the united state and it be not altogether unknown in this country it be not possible to enter into a full explanation of the method of scientific management briefly by a process of scientific selection it put each worker in the job for which he be best fit and teach he exactly how to use the most efficient tool with which he would be provide the method of teaching may be illustrate from mr fw taylor 's own example : schmidt start to work and all day long and at regular interval be tell by the man who stand over he with a watch ` now pick up a pig and walk now sit down and rest now walk -- now rest ' etc he work when he be tell to work and rest when he be tell to rest and at half-past five in the afternoon have he 47-1\/2 ton load on the car -lrb- 2 -rrb- by elaborate experiment the exact shape and size of a shovel be determine by long observation useless and awkward movement of a workman be eliminate or replace by the correct movement give the maximum return for the minimum of effort in this way and by a bonus on wages a largely increase output be obtain it be clear that the adoption of such method give the scientific manager great power it also seem inevitable that the workman should degenerate into a automaton it be obvious that in the hand of employer ignorant of the principle underlie it and see merely a new and highly profitable method of exploitation it will be open to serious abuse as experience have already show in america -lrb- footnote 1 : _ round table _ sept 1914 p 708 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ scientific management _ by fw taylor p 47 -rrb- so far the tremendous significance of scientific management have not be fully recognize properly understand it be the complement to the industrial revolution which by the more extensive use of machinery etc increase the efficiency of capital the present movement aim at a similar increase in the efficiency of labor as a agent of production the new revolution in industry have as yet merely begin because employer in spite of the motive of self-interest be conservative but it will receive a enormous impetus from the condition arise out of the war like the introduction of machinery and factory industry a century and a half ago and onward it may be accompany by widespread evil and cruel exploitation indeed there be every likelihood that the method will be distorted and misuse by they careful application there be no doubt that the output of the labourer can be increase without the expenditure of greater effort than before but even then there would be the tendency towards become de-humanised this however might be overcome by shorter hour and higher wages which would raise the standard of comfort and widen the worker 's interest unwisely use scientific management will become a instrument for shackle the worker and increase at a great rate the wealth of the capitalist it will be freely admit that anything that will increase the productivity of the labourer and therefore the wealth of the community be advantageous provide there be a equitable distribution of the product and that the effect on the work member of the state be not socially injurious but the hidden evil that may manifest themselves be very real and it be important that not only the worker but the state should be prepare to save the good and prevent the evil there will however be large number of employer of labor who will not avail themselves of the new-fangled method and who will endeavor to increase production by the old policy of drive and even without drive wage-earning labor under present condition may be carry on under circumstance unfavourable to industrial efficiency and for hour inimical to the welfare of the community and actually injurious to industrial productivity in the future the state will be more closely concern with industry and commerce than hitherto there will probably be a more clearly define state policy aim at the encouragement of production its view will be wider than that of the individual employer and we may expect therefore provide there be no serious reaction after the strain of the war that the state will impose work condition which will favor maximum production in the long run it will be to the interest of the community to maximize the efficiency of the industrial system and enlighten statesmanship will overhaul we exist code of industrial law to achieve this object as far as possible as well as to guard the community against the evil inherent in a misapplication of the principle of scientific management -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see a article on next step in factory and workshop reform by arthur greenwood in the _ political quarterly _ for September 1914 -rrb- after the war unemployment be likely to increase the work of new production will be put into operation only gradually there will be every inducement to economise the use of labor as far as possible wages during the depression will most probably fall there will be disaffection in the rank of the trade unionist the possible consolidation of industry into the hand of fewer employer will increase the strength of the master the fund of the trade union will be deplete by the heavy strain on they resource and subject to a further drain after the war the outlook of the trade union movement be therefore far from bright it will be generally agree that the bankruptcy or serious impoverishment of the union of this country would be nothing less than a national disaster but unless action of some kind be take they will become greatly weaken and almost impotent and one great bulwark against unjust encroachment upon the rights of labor will be remove it be not improbable however that the community will indirectly assist the trade union by the step take to mitigate the evil which the war will leave in its train the army instead of be immediately disband may be gradually dismiss over a period of say five year the widow and dependant of soldier and sailor and those who have return maim and cripple from the war may be adequately provide for and together with child of twelve and thirteen keep off the labor market the larger scheme of the development commission may be put into operation the legal minimum wage may be extend to all low-paid trade in these and other way the community may deal comprehensively with the problem it have to face the difficulty of the aftermath period will call for both clear-sighted action and public spirit and if it be to be bridge over successfully the transition from a war to a peace footing must be gradual the community must continue its state of mobilisation in order to meet the enemy within the gate provide the unite wisdom of the nation be throw into the task the evil after-effect of the war may be if not altogether avoid restricted within narrow limit at the bottom therefore the future course of event depend upon the temper and spirit of the people at the close of the war 3 _ social effect and the new outlook _ -- the european conflict will probably exercise a strong sobering influence upon the mind of the people the gravity of the crisis whatever victory may crown we arm will be reflect in the gravity of the people a new dignity a greater self-respect a deeper earnestness may arise among the mass of the people to which the conduct of we soldier in the field will contribute high quality of leadership win they admiration but for they they claim no credit the army be officer for the most part by people of a higher social standing whose quality they will willingly admit but the social gulf debar they from gain inspiration from they achievement in the case of the rank and file largely draw from they own class the effect be different the tommy be flesh of they flesh and blood of they blood the quality he display reflect credit upon he class the work man be not unmindful of the high opinion in which the british private have be hold by a line of continental soldier from napoleon to bernhardi the exploit of he fellow in the field have give the lie to story of deterioration and work people be experience a sense of pride in they class which may have no inconsiderable effect on they attitude regard social development in the future already the national temper have not submit without protest to the disgraceful sweating of we troops merely because they patriotism have lead they to sacrifice they life which be beyond all money payment but the feeling in favor of the war and the spirit of trust in the government have up to the present overridden serious criticism the result have be that the government have often remain inactive when action be need and have act unwisely and ignorantly at time for example in the case of the local government board circular state that the army council be prepare to issue allowance through the soldier ' and sailor ' family association or the local representation committee it have be say that the whole system be a outrage on democratic principle the state sweat its servant and then compel they to take the niggardly wages it allow they from a charitable society -lrb- 1 -rrb- this type of action may pass muster during a time of stress but whether the spirit of the people will accept it after the war be over and there be the dependant of the slay to be maintain and the permanently cripple to be provide for be a different matter not merely justice but the new pride of the people will rebel against it these be but phase of the larger social problem there be the question of poverty in all its ramification for the moment economic injustice and social evil have fall into the back of people 's mind and the new and abnormal cause of destitution be call forth special measure of assistance after the war the ever-present deep-seated poverty will reassert its presence and in the heart of many people the question will arise as to whether the community which courageously and whole-heartedly fight the enemy without the gate will turn with equal courage and determination when the time come to fight the enemy within the gate the experience of the war time the willingness to embark on great project in face of a national crisis will not be forget but will inspire in social reformer the hope that the country may also face the internal national peril in a similar spirit the national -- as oppose to the individual -- poverty which the war will cause may itself be a force make for good as mr lloyd george well say a great flood of luxury and of sloth which have submerge the land be recede and a new britain be appear we can see for the first time the fundamental thing that matter in life and that have be obscure from we vision by the tropical growth of prosperity -lrb- 2 -rrb- there seem a prospect of a era of social growth and regeneration follow the war in other european country there may be equally important

impoverished and there will be a heavy burden of taxation in spite of some probable relief from the burden of armament still social evil and injustice will be more obvious than ever there will be many new national and imperial problem clamour to be face the intellectual ferment which have have its source in the war will remain at work to widen the mental outlook and deepen the social consciousness on the whole it will probably be true to say that though circumstance may postpone it there will sooner or later arise a great movement pledge to cleanse we national life of those feature which bar the way to human freedom and happiness it also seem undeniable that the deep interest take by large number of people in the war will rouse they to a sense of the importance of problem of government

foundation of justice and liberty on the wreck of every power which exist not for a principle but for a dynastic interest -- mazzinus in 1867 the greatest triumph of we time a triumph in a region loftier than that of electricity or steam will be the enthronement of this idea of public right as the govern idea of european policy as the common and precious inheritance of all land but superior to the pass opinion of any the foremost among the nation will be that one which by its conduct shall gradually engender in the mind of the other a fixed belief that it be just -- gladstone § 1 _ the two issue _ -- the war of 1914 be not simply a war between the dual alliance and the triple entente : it be for great britain and germany especially a war of idea -- a conflict between two different and irreconcilable conception of government society and progress a attempt will be make in this chapter to make clear what these conception be and to discuss the issue between they as impartially as possible from the point of view not of either of the combatant power but of human civilisation as a whole there be really two great controversy be fight out between great britain and germany : one about the end of national policy and another about the means to be adopt towards those or any other end the latter be the issue raise by the german chancellor 's plea -- not so unfamiliar on the lip of we own countryman as we be now tempt to believe -- that necessity know no law it be the issue of law and scrap of paper against force against what some apologist have call the philosophy of violence but which in its latest form the french ambassador have more aptly christen the pedantry of barbarism that issue have lately be bring home in its full reality to the british public from the course of event in belgium and elsewhere and need not here be elaborate further word would be waste a power which recognize no obligation but force and no law but the sword which mark the path of its advance by organised terrorism and devastation be the public enemy of the civilised world but it be a remarkable and significant fact that the policy in which this ruthless theory be embody command the enthusiastic and united support of the german nation how can this be explain it must be remember in the first place that the german public do not see the fact of the situation as we do on the question of belgian neutrality and the event which precipitate the british ultimatum what we know to be a false version of the fact be current in germany as be evident from the publish statement of the leader of german thought and opinion and it may be many year before its currency be displaced this difficulty should serve to remind we how defective the machinery of civilisation still be one of the chief function of law be not merely to settle dispute and to enforce its decision but to ascertain the true fact on which alone a settlement can be base the fact that no tribunal exist for ascertain the true fact in dispute between sovereign government show how far mankind still be from a established rule of law in international affair not only be the hague powerless to give and still more to enforce its decision on the question at issue between the european power it have not even the machinery for ascertain the fact of the case and bring they to the notice of neutral government and people in the name of civilisation as a whole but apart from divergent belief as to the fact it be remarkable that think germany should be in sympathy with the spirit and tone of german policy which lead as it appear to we by a inexorable logic to the violation of belgian neutrality and the collision with great britain but the fact we be tell admit of easy explanation think germany have fall a victim to the teaching of treitschke and nietzsche -- treitschke with he macchiavellian doctrine that power be the end-all and be-all of a state nietzsche with he contempt for pity and the gentler virtue he admiration for valor and he disdain for christianity this explanation be too simple to fit the fact it may satisfy those who know no more of treitschke 's brilliant and careful work than the extract cull from he occasional writings by general von bernhardus and the late professor cramb it may gratify those who with so many young german student forget that nietzsche like many other prophet write in allegory and that when he speak of valor he be think not of shine armor but of spiritual conflict but careful enquirer who would disdain to condemn macaulay on passage select by undiscriminating admirer from he _ essay _ or carlyle for he frank admiration of thor and odin and the virtue of valhallum will ask for a more satisfying explanation even if all that be say about treitschke and nietzsche be true it would still remain a unsolved question why they and they idea should have take intellectual germany by storm but it be not true what be true and what be far more serious both for great britain and for europe be that man like harnack eucken and wilamowitz who would repudiate all intellectual kinship with macchiavellus and nietzsche -- man who be leader of european thought and with whom and whose idea we shall have to go on living in europe -- publicly support and encourage the policy and standpoint of a government which accord to british idea have act with criminal wickedness and folly and so totally misunderstand the conduct and attitude of great britain as honestly to regard we as hypocritically treacherous to the highest interest of civilisation that be the real problem and it be a far more complex and difficult one than if we have to do with a people which have consciously abandon the christian virtue or consciously embark on a conspiracy against belgium or great britain the utter failure of even the most eminent german to grasp british politics british institution and the british point of view point to a fundamental misunderstanding a fundamental divergence of outlook between the political ideal of the two country it be the conflict between these ideal which form the second great issue between germany and great britain and on its outcome depend the future of human civilisation § 2 _ culture _ -- what be the german ideal what do german thinker regard as germany 's contribution to human progress the answer come back with a monotonous reiteration which have already sicken we of the word it be _ kultur _ or as we translate it culture germany 's contribution to progress consist in the spread of she culture _ kultur _ be a difficult word to interpret it mean culture and a great deal more besides its primary meaning like that of culture be intellectual and aesthetic : when a german speak of kultur he be think of such thing as language literature philosophy education art science and the like child in german school be teach a subject call _ kulturgeschichte _ -lrb- culture-history -rrb- and under that head they be tell about german literature german philosophy and religion german painting german music and so on so far the english and the german use of the word roughly correspond we should probably be surprise if we hear it say that shakespeare have make a contribution to english culture : but on consideration we should admit that he have though we should not have choose that way of speak about he but there be a further meaning in the word _ kultur _ which explain why it be so often on german lip it mean not only the product of the intellect or imagination but the product of the disciplined intellect and the disciplined imagination _ kultur _ have in it a element of order of organization of civilisation that be why the german regard the study of the culture of a country as part of the study of its history english school child be begin to be teach social and industrial history in addition to the king and queen and battle and constitution which use to form the staple of history lesson they be be teach that be to see the history of they country and of its civilisation in the light of the life and livelihood of its common people the german outlook be different they look at they history in the light of the achievement of its great mind which be regard as be at once the proof and the justification of its civilisation to the question what right have you to call yourselve a civilised country a englishman would reply look at the sort of people we be and at the thing we have do and would point perhaps to the extract from the letter of private soldier print in the newspaper or to the story of the growth of the british empire a german would reply -lrb- as german be indeed reply now -rrb- look at we achievement in scholarship and science at we university at we system of education at we literature we music and we painting at we great man of thought and imagination : at luther dürer goethe beethoven kant _ kultur _ then mean more than culture : it mean _ culture consider as the most important element in civilisation _ it imply the disciplined education which alone in the german view make the difference between the savage and the civilised man it imply the heritage of intellectual possession which thanks to order institution a nation be able to hand down from generation to generation we be now begin to see where the british and german attitude towards society and civilisation diverge broadly we may say that the first difference be that germany think of civilisation in term of intellect while we think of it in term of character germany ask what do you know what have you learn and regard we prisoner as uncivilised because they can not speak german and great britain as a traitor to civilisation because she be ally with russium a people of ignorant peasant we ask what have you do what can you do and tend to undervalue the importance of systematic knowledge and intellectual application but we have find no reason as yet for a conflict of ideal many english writer such as matthew arnold have emphasise the importance of culture as against character yet matthew arnold 's view be widely different from those of the german professor of to-day if they sense of the importance of culture stop short at this point we should have much to learn from germany as indeed we have and no reason to oppose she what be there then in the german admiration for culture which involve she in a conflict with british ideal § 3 _ culture as a state product _ -- the conflict arise out of the alliance between german culture and the german government what british public opinion resent in the german attitude be not culture in itself about which it be little concerned but what we feel to be its unnatural alliance with military power it seem to we wicked and hypocritical for a government which proclaim the doctrine of the mail fist and like the ancient spartan glory in the perfecting of the machinery of war to be at the same time protest its devotion to culture and pose as a patron of the peaceful art it be the kaiser 's speech and the behavior of the german government which have put all of we out of heart with german talk about culture this bring we to a fundamental point of difference between the two people the close association between culture and militarism between the best mind of the nation and the mind of the government do not seem unnatural to a modern german at all on the contrary it seem the most natural thing in the world it be the bedrock of the german system of national education culture to a german be not only a national possession it be also to a degree difficult for we to appreciate a state product it be a national possession deliberately hand on by the state from generation to generation hall-marked and guarantee as it be for the use of its citizen when we use the word culture we speak of it as a attribute of individual man and woman german on the other hand think of it as belong to nation as a whole in virtue of they system of national education that be why they be so sure that all german possess culture they have all have it at school and it be all the same brand of culture because no other be teach it be the culture with which the government wish its citizen to be equip that be why all german tend not only to know the same fact -lrb- and a great many fact too -rrb- but to have a similar outlook on life and similar opinion about goethe shakespeare and the german navy culture like military service be a part of the state machinery here we come upon the connect link between culture and militarism both be part of the great german system of state education side by side with the influence of german education write dr sadler in 1901 -lrb- 1 -rrb- be to be trace the influence of german military service the two set of influence interact on one another and intermingle german education impregnate the german army with science the german army predispose german education to idea of organization and discipline military and educational discipline go hand in hand both be preserved and fortify by law and custom and by administrative arrangement skilfully devise to attain that end but behind all the form of organization -lrb- which would quickly crumble away unless uphold by and express some spiritual force -rrb- behind both military and educational discipline lie the fundamental principle adopt by scharnhorst 's committee on military organization in prussium in 1807 : ` all the inhabitant of the state be its defender by birth ' -lrb- footnote 1 : _ board of education special report _ vol ix p 43 -rrb- at last we have reach the root of the matter it be not german culture which be the source and center of the idea to which great britain be oppose : nor yet be it german militarism we real opponent be the system of training and education out of which both german culture and german militarism spring it be the organization of german public life and the spiritual force of which that organization be the outward and visible expression § 4 _ german and british ideal of education _ -- let we look at the german ideal more closely for it be worthy of careful study it be perhaps best express in word write in 1830 by coleridge who like other well-known englishman of he day -lrb- and we own -rrb- be much under the influence of german idea coleridge in word quote by dr sadler define the purpose of national education as to form and train up the people of the country to obedient free useful and organisable subject citizen and patriot live to the benefit of the state and prepare to die in its defense in accordance with this conception prussium be the first of the larger state in europe to adopt a universal compulsory system of state education and the first also to establish a universal system of military service for its young man the rest of europe perforce follow suit nearly every state in europe have or profess to have a universal system of education and every state except england have a system of universal military service the europe of school and camp which we have know during the last half century be the most striking of all the victory of german culture discipline efficiency duty obedience public service these be quality that excite admiration everywhere -- in the classroom in the camp and in the wider field of life there be something almost monumentally impressive to the outsider in the german alliance of school and army in the service of the state since the day of sparta and rome there have be no such wonderful governmental disciplinary machine it be not surprising that german organization and german method should have stimulate interest and emulation throughout the civilised world discipline seem to many to be just the one quality of which we drift world be in need if this war have be postpone a hundred or even fifty year write a philosophic english observer in a private letter prussia would have become we rome worship shakespeare and byron as pompey or tiberius worship greek literature and discipline we have not it ever strike you what a close parallel there be between germany and rome -lrb- here follow a list of bad quality which be better omit -rrb- the good side of it be the discipline and the modern world not have any power external to itself which it acknowledge and no man -lrb- in mass -rrb- have yet succeed in be a law to themselves need discipline above everything i do not see where you will get it under these condition unless you find some one with a abstract love of discipline for itself and where will you find he except in prussium after all it be a testimony to she that unlovely as she be she give the law to germany and that the south german though he dislike she accept the law as good for he and to show that he appreciate the full consequence of he word he add : if i have to live under ramsay macdonald -lrb- provide that he act as he talk -rrb- or under lieutenant von förstner -lrb- the hero of zabern -rrb- odious as the latter be for my soul 's good i would choose he : for i think that in the end i should be less likely to be irretrievably ruin here be the prussian point of view express by a thoughtful englishman with a wide experience of education and a deep concern for the moral welfare of the nation what have we on the british side to set up against he argument in the first place we must draw attention to the writer 's candor in admit that a nation can not adopt prussianism piecemeal it must take it as a whole its lieutenant include or not at all lieutenant von förstner be as typical a product of the prussian system as the london policeman be of we own and if we adopt prussian or spartan method we must run the risk of be rule by he no other nation say dr sadler by imitate a little bit of german organization can hope thus to achieve a true reproduction of the spirit of german institution the fabric of its organization practically form one whole that be its merit and its danger it must be take all in all or else leave unimitated and it be not a mere matter of external organization national institution must grow out of the need and character -lrb- and not least out of the weakness -rrb- of the nation which possess they but take the system as a whole there be it seem to I three great flaw in it -- flaw so serious and vital as to make the word education as apply to it almost a misnomer the prussian system be unsatisfactory firstly because it confuse external discipline with self-control secondly because it confuse regimentation with corporate spirit thirdly because it conceive the nation 's duty in term of culture rather than of character let we take these three point in detail the first object of national education be -- not anything national at all but simply education it be the training of individual young people it be the gradual leading-out -lrb- e-ducation -rrb- unfold expand of they mental and bodily power the help of they to become not soldier or missionary of culture or pioneer of empire or even british citizen but simply human personality the purpose of the public elementary school say the opening word of we english code be to form and strengthen the character and to develop the intelligence of the child entrust to it in the performance of this task external discipline be no doubt necessary obedience and consideration for other be not learn in a day but the object of external discipline be to form habit of self-control which will enable they possessor to become a independent and self-respecting human being -- and incidentally a good citizen if i have to _ live under _ ramsay macdonald or the prussian lieutenant say we writer i would choose the latter for my soul 's good but we british system of education do not proceed on the assumption that its pupil be destine to live under any one we ideal be that of the free man train in the exercise of he power and in the command and control of he faculty who like wordsworth 's happy warrior -lrb- a poem which embody the best british educational tradition -rrb- : through the heat of conflict keep the law in calmness make and see what he foresee neglect for the claim of human personality both amongst pupil and teacher be the chief danger of a state system of education the state be always tempt to put its own claim first and those of its citizen second -- to regard the citizen as exist for the state instead of the state for its citizen it be one of the irony of history that no man be more alive to this danger than wilhelm von humboldt the gifted creator of the prussian system of education as the motto of one of he writings he adopt the word _ against the governmental mania the most fatal disease of modern government _ and when contrary to he own early principle he undertake the organization of prussian education he insist that headmaster should be leave as free a hand as possible in all matter of teaching and organization but the prussian system be too strong for he and he successor and he excellent principle now survive as no more than pious opinion the fact be that in a undemocratic and feudal state such as germany then be and still largely be respect for the personality of the individual be confine to the upper rank of society i do not know how it be in foreign country say one of goethe 's hero -lrb- 1 -rrb- but in germany it be only the nobleman who can secure a certain amount of universal or if i may say so _ personal _ education a ordinary citizen can learn to earn he living and at the most train he intellect but do what he will he lose he personality he be not ask ` what be you ' but only ` what have you what attainment what knowledge what capacity what fortune ' the nobleman be to act and to achieve the common citizen be to carry out order he be to develop individual faculty in order to become useful and it be a fundamental assumption that there be no harmony in he be nor indeed be any permissible because in order to make himself serviceable in one way he be force to neglect everything else the blame for this distinction be not to be attribute to the adaptability of the nobleman or the weakness of the common citizen it be due to the constitution of society itself much have change in germany since goethe write these word but they still ring true and they have not be entirely without they echo in great britain itself -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : wilhelm meister 's _ lehrjahre _ book v chapter iii -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the contrast which have be draw in the precede page as working-class reader in particular will understand be between the _ aim _ not the achievement of german and british education the german aim be far more perfectly achieve in practice than the british neither the law nor the administration of british education can be acquit of neglect for the claim of human personality the opening word of the english code quote on p 359 above be alas not a statement of fact but a aspiration we have hardly yet begin in england to realize the possibility of educational development along the line of the british ideal both as regard young people and adult if we learn the lesson of the present crisis aright the war so far from be a set-back to educational progress should provide a new stimulus for effort and development -rrb- but man can not live for himself alone he be a corporate be and personality or no personality he have to fit into a world of fellow-men with similar human claim the second charge against the german system be that it ignore the value of human fellowship it regard the citizen of a country as useful and organisable subject rather than as fellow-member of a democracy bind together by all the various social tie of comradeship and intercourse the prussian system with its elaborate control and direction from above dislike the free play of human grouping and discourage all spontaneous or unauthorised association schoolboy society for instance be in germany a evil to be deplore and extirpate not as with we a symptom of health and vigor to be sympathetically watch and encourage instead there be a direct inculcation of patriotism a strenuous and methodical training of each unit for he place in the great state machine we do not so read human nature we british tendency be to develop habit of service and responsibility through a devotion to smaller and more intimate association to build on a foundation of lesser loyalty and duty we do not conceive it to be the function of the school to _ teach _ patriotism or to _ teach _ fellowship rather we hold that good education _ be _ fellowship _ be _ citizenship in the deepest meaning of those word that to discover and to exercise the responsibility of membership in a smaller body be the best training for a larger citizenship a school a ship a club a trade union any free association of englishman be all england in miniature to be attach to the subdivision to love the little platoon we belong to in society say burke long ago be the first principle the germ as it be of public affection it be the first link in the series by which we proceed towards a love to we country and mankind we begin we public affection in we family no cold relation be a zealous citizen we pass on to we neighborhood to we habitual provincial connection these be inn and resting-place so many image of the great country in which the heart find something which it could fill -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ reflection on the french revolution _ pp 292 494 -lrb- of vol iii of _ collect work _ ed 1899 -rrb- -rrb- there be one fairly safe test for a system of education : what do its victim think of it in prussium say dr sadler a schoolboy seem to regard he school as he might regard a railway station -- a convenient and necessary establishment generally ugly to look at but also for its purpose efficient the illustration be a apt one : for a prussian school be too often like a railway station simply a point of departure something to be get away from as soon as possible in england a boy who be at a good secondary school care for it as a officer care for he regiment or as a sailor care for he ship or we may add as a boy scout care for he troop -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ special report _ ix p 113 dr sadler 's article deal with secondary school only unfortunately no one can claim that the idea of fellowship be as prominent in english elementary school or even in all secondary school as the quotation might suggest -rrb- democracy and discipline fellowship and freedom be in fact not incompatible at all they be complementary : and each can only be at its best when it be sustain by the other only a disciplined and self-controlled people can be free to rule itself and only a free people can know the full meaning and happiness of fellowship § 5 _ german and british ideal of civilisation _ -- lastly the german system regard national culture rather than national character as the chief element in civilisation and the justification of its claim to a dominant place in the world this view be so strange to those who be use to present-day british institution that it be hard to make clear what it mean civilisation be a word which with we be often misuse and often misunderstand sometimes we lightly identify it with motor car and gramophone and other western contrivance with which individual trader and traveller dazzle and bewilder the untutored savage yet we be seldom tempt to identify it like the german with anything narrowly national and in we serious moment we recognize that it be too universal a force to be the appanage of either nation or individual for to we when we ask ourselves its real meaning civilisation stand for neither language nor culture nor anything intellectual at all it stand for something moral and social and political it mean in the first place the establishment and enforcement of the rule of law as against anarchy on the one hand and tyranny on the other and secondly on the basis of order and justice the task of make man fit for free institution the work of guide and train they to recognize the obligation of citizenship to subordinate they own personal interest or inclination to the common welfare the commonwealth that be what be mean when it be claim that great britain have do a civilising work both in indium and in backward africa the german reproach and despise we we be tell -lrb- 1 -rrb- for we failure to spread english culture in indium that have not be the purpose of british rule and englishman have be foolish in so far as they have presume to attempt it : england have to learn from indian culture as indium from ours but to have lay for indium the foundation on which alone a stable society could rest to have give she peace from foe without and security within to have teach she by example the kinship of power and responsibility to have awaken the social conscience and claim the public service of indian in the village the district the province the nation towards the community of which they feel themselves to be member to have find indium a continent a chaos of tribe and caste and to have help she to become a nation -- that be not a task of english culture : it be a task of civilisation -lrb- footnote 1 : for evidence of this see cramb 's _ germany and england _ p 25 -rrb- law justice responsibility liberty citizenship -- the word be abstraction philosopher ' phrase destitute it might seem of live meaning and reality there be no such thing as english justice english liberty english responsibility the quality that go to the making of free and order institution be not national but universal they be no monopoly of great britain they be free to be the attribute of any race or any nation they belong to civilised humanity as a whole they be part of the higher life of the human race as such the german if they recognize they at all probably regard they they could not see in they the binding power to keep a great community of nation together they could not realize that justice and responsibility if they rightly typify the character of british rule must also typify the character of british ruler and that community of character express in they institution and work into the fiber of they life may be a stronger bond between nation than any mere consideration of interest educate indian would find it hard to explain exactly why on the outbreak of the war they find themselves eager to help to defend british rule but it seem clear that what stir they most be not any consideration of english as against german culture or any merely material calculation but a sudden realisation of the character of that new indium which the union between great britain and indium between western civilisation and eastern culture be bring into be and a sense of the indispensable need for the continuance of that partnership -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the reader will again understand that it be british aim rather than british achievement which be speak of that british rule be indispensable to indian civilisation be indeed a literal fact to which indian opinion bear testimony and it be the conduct and character of generation of british administrator which have help to bring this sense of partnership about but individual englishman in indium be often far from understand or realize in practice the purpose of british rule similarly the growth of a sense of indian nationality particularly in the last few year be a striking and important fact but it would be unwise to underestimate the gigantic difficulty with which this grow national consciousness have to contend the greatest of these be the prevalence of caste-division render impossible the free fellowship and social intercourse which alone can be the foundation of a sense of common citizenship apart from this there be accord to the census forty-three race in indium and twenty-three language in ordinary use -rrb- it be just this intimate union between different nation for the furtherance of the task of civilisation which it seem so difficult for the german mind to understand culture with all its intimate association its appeal to language to national history and tradition and to instinctive patriotism be so much simpler and warmer a conception : it seem so much easier to fight for germany than to fight for justice in the abstract or for justice embody in the british commonwealth that be why even serious german thinker blind by the idea of culture expect the break-up of the british empire they could imagine indian give they life for indium boer for a dutch south africa irishman for ireland or ulsterman for ulster but the deeper moral appeal which have thrill through the whole empire down to its remotest island dependency lay beyond they ken let we look a little more closely at the german idea of national culture rather than national character as the chief element in civilisation we shall see that it be directly contrary to the ideal which inspire and sustain the british commonwealth and practically prohibit that association of race and people at vary level of social progress which be its peculiar task culture in the german idea be the justification of a nation 's existence nationality have no other claim goethe luther kant and beethoven be germany 's title-deed a nation without a culture have no right to a place in the sun history say wilamowitz in a lecture deliver in 1898 know nothing of any right to exist on the part of a people or a language without a culture if a people become dependent on a foreign culture -lrb- _ ie _ in the german idea on a foreign civilisation -rrb- it matter little if its lower class speak a different language : they too must eventually go over to the dominant language wisely to further this necessary organic process be a blessing to all party violent haste will only curb it and cause reaction importunate insistence on nationality have never anywhere bring true vitality into be and often destroy vitality but the superior culture which sure of its inner strength throw she door wide open can win man 's heart -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the light of a passage like this from the most distinguished representative of german humanism it be easier to grasp the failure of educate germany to understand the sequel of the south african war or the aspiration of the slav people or to stigmatise the folly of they statesman in poland denmark alsace-lorraine and belgium importunate insistence on nationality -- the word come home to we now with a new meaning when we learn that in belgium now perforce dependent on a foreign culture baby be register under german name and newspaper print in the dominant language and that already forty newspaper vendor in brussels have be sentence to long term of hard labor in german prison for sell english french and belgian

behold nothing but conflict -- eternal conflict between rival national culture each seek to impose its domination in the struggle between nationality write prince bülow -lrb- 1 -rrb- in defense of he polish policy put into a cruder form the philosophy of wilamowitz one nation be the hammer and the other the anvil one be the victor and the other the vanquish it be a law of life and development in history that where two national civilisation meet they fight for supremacy -lrb- footnote 1 : _ imperial germany _ p 245 -lrb- 1st ed -rrb- -rrb- here we have the necessary and logical result of the philosophy of culture in the struggle between culture no collaboration no compromise even be possible german be german : flemish be flemish : polish be polish : french be french who be to decide which be the more civilised which be the fitter to survive force alone can settle the issue a luther and goethe may be the puppet pit in a contest of culture against maeterlinck and victor hugo but it be krupp and zeppelin and the war-lord that pull the string as wilamowitz remind we it be the roman legion not virgil and horace that stamp out the celtic language and romanised western europe it be the german army two thousand year later that be to germanise it it be a old old theory prussium do not invent it nor even rome you know as well as we do say the athenian in 416 bc to the representative of a small people of that day -lrb- 1 -rrb- that right as the world go be only in question between equal in power while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must and they go on like the kaiser to claim the favor of the god neither we pretension nor we conduct be in any way contrary to what man believe of the god or practice amongst themselves there be in fact to be no law between nation but the rule of the stronger -lrb- footnote 1 : _ thucydide _ book v 89 and 105 -rrb- § 6 _ the principle of the commonwealth _ -- such seem to many the meaning of the present european situation -- a stern conflict between nation and culture to be decide by force of arm the bridge between the nation seem break down and no one can tell when they will be repair the hope that have gather round international movement the cosmopolitan dream of common action between the people across the barrier of state and government seem to have vanish into limbo and the enthusiastic dreamer of yesterday be the disillusioned soldier and spectator of to-day nationality that strange inarticulate unanalysable force that can call all man to she tent in the hour of crisis and danger seem to have overthrow the international force of to-day the socialist the pacifist and strongest of all the capitalist as it overthrow napoleon and he dream of empire a hundred year ago what law be there but force that can decide the issue between nation and nation and in the absence of a law what become of all we hope for international action for the future of civilisation and the higher life of the human race but in truth the disillusionment be as premature as the hope that precede it we be still far off from the world-state and the world-law which form the misty ideal of cosmopolitan thinker but only those who be blind to the true course of human progress can fail to see that the day of the nation-state be even now draw to a close in the west there be in fact at present work in the world a higher law and a better patriotism than that of single nation and culture a law and a patriotism that override and transcend the claim of nationality in a greater a more compelling and a more universal appeal the great state or power of to-day great britain the united state france and -lrb- if they have eye to sec it -rrb- russium germany and austria-hungary be not nation-state but composite state -- state compacted of many nationality unite together by a common citizenship and a common law great britain the united state the german empire and austria-hungary bear in they very name the reminder of the diverse element of which they be compose but france with she great african empire and russium with she multitudinous population from poland to the pacific from finland to the caucasus be equally composite in each of these great state nation have be unite under a common law and where the wisdom of the central government have not break the bruise reed or quench the smoking flax of national life the nation have be not only willing but anxious to join in the work of they state nation like man be make not to compete but to work together and it be so easy so simple to win they good-hearted devotion it take all sort of man say the old proverb to make a world it take all sort of nation to make a modern state the combination of different nation in one state be as necessary a condition of civilised life as the combination of man in society it be in the cauldron of the state that the fusion take place by which the vigor the knowledge and the capacity of one portion of mankind may be communicate to another if we take the establishment of liberty for the realisation of moral duty to be the end of civil society we must conclude that those state be substantially the most perfect which like the british and austrian empire include various distinct nationality without oppress they so write lord acton the great catholic historian fifty year ago when the watchword of nationality be on all man 's lip add in word that be prophetic of the failure of the austrian and the progress of the british commonwealth of nation : the coexistence of several nation under the same state _ be a test _ as well as the best security _ of its freedom _ it be also one of the chief instrument of civilisation and as such it be in the natural and providential order and indicate a state of greater advancement than the national unity which be the ideal of modern liberalism -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : essay on nationality in _ the history of freedom and other essay _ pp 290 298 -rrb- of the great power which between they control the destiny of civilisation great britain be at once the freest the largest and the most various if the state be a cauldron for mingle the vigor the knowledge and the capacity of the portion of mankind -- or if to use a apter metaphor it be a body whose perfection consist in the very variety of the function of its several member -- there have never be on the earth a political organism like the british empire its 433 million inhabitant from great britain to polynesium from indium and egypt to central africa be draw from every division of the human race cut a section through mankind and in every layer there will be british citizen live under the jurisdiction of british law here be something to hearten those who have look in vain to the hague while international law have be bring to a standstill through the absence of a common will and a common executive great britain have throw a girdle of law around the globe § 7 _ the future of civilisation _ -- what hope dare we cherish in this hour of conflict for the future of civilisation the great the supreme task of human politics and statesmanship be to extend the sphere of law let other labor to make man culture or virtuous or happy these be the task of the teacher the priest and the common man the statesman 's task be simpler it be to enfold they in a jurisdiction which will enable they to live the life of they soul ' choice the state say the greek philosopher be the foundation of the good life but its crown rise far above mere citizenship there where the state end cry nietzsche -lrb- 1 -rrb- echo aristotle and the great tradition of civilised political thought there _ man begin _ there where the state end look thither my brother do you not see the rainbow and the bridge to the overman ever since organise society begin the standard of the individual the ideal of priest and teacher the doctrine of religion and morality have outstrip the practice of statesmanship for the polestar of the statesman have not be love but law he not the task of exhort man to love one another but the simpler duty of enforce the law thou shalt not kill and in that simple strenuous necessary task statesman and political thinker have watch the slow extension of the power of law from the family to the tribe from the tribe to the city from the city to the nation from the nation to the commonwealth when will law take its next extension when will warfare which be murder between individual and rebellion between group of citizen be equally preventable between nation by the common law of the world -lrb- footnote 1 : _ also sprach zarathustra _ speech xi -lrb- end -rrb- -rrb- the answer be simple when the world have a common will and have create a common government to express and enforce that will in the sphere of science and invention of industry and economics as norman angell and other have teach we the world be already one great society for the merchant the banker and the stockbroker political frontier have be break down trade and industry respond to the reaction of a single world-wide nervous system shock and panic pass as freely as airman over border and custom-house and not big business only but the humblest citizen in he search for a livelihood find himself catch in the mesh of the same world-wide network the widow who take in

word they will be crush the industrial revolution of the past century steam-power and electricity the railway and the telegraph have knit mankind together and make the world one place -lrb- footnote 1 : _ the great society _ -lrb- 1914 -rrb- p 4 -rrb- but this new great society be as yet formless and inarticulate it be not only devoid of common leadership and a common government it lack even the beginning of a common will a common emotion and a common consciousness of the great society consciously or unconsciously we must all perforce be member but of the great state the great world-commonwealth we do not yet discern the rudiment the economic organization of the world have outstrip the development of its citizenship and government : the economic man with he farsighted vision and scientific control of the resource of the world must sit by and see the work of he hand lay in ash by contend government and people no man can say how many generation must pass before the platitude of the market and the exchange pass into the current language of politics § 8 _ the two road of advance : inter-state action and common citizenship _ -- in the great work which lie before the statesman and people of the world for the extension of law and common citizenship and the prevention of war there be two parallel line of advance one road lie through the development of what be know as international but should more properly be call _ inter-state law _ through the revival on a firmer and broader foundation of the concert of europe conceive by the congress of vienna just a hundred year ago -- itself a revival on a secular basis of the great mediaeval ideal of a international christendom hold together by christian law and christian ideal that ideal fade away for ever at the reformation which group europe into independent sovereign state rule by man responsible to no one outside they own border it will never be revive on a ecclesiastical basis can we hope for its revival on a basis of modern democracy modern nationality and modern educate public opinion can inter-state law hitherto a mere shadow of the majestic name it bear almost a matter of convention and etiquette with no permanent tribunal to interpret it and no government to enforce it be enthrone with the necessary power to maintain justice between the people and government of the world such a law the statesman of great britain and russium seek to impose on europe in 1815 to maintain a state of affair which history have show to have be intolerable to the european people there be those who hope that the task can be resume on a better basis at the next congress shall we try again write professor gilbert murray -lrb- 1 -rrb- to achieve castlereagh 's and alexander 's ideal of a permanent concert pledge to make collective war upon the peace-breaker surely we must we must at all cost and in spite of all difficulty because the alternative means such unspeakable failure we must learn to agree we civilised nation of europe or else we must perish i believe that the chief council of wisdom here be to be sure to go far enough we need a permanent concert perhaps a permanent common council in which every awkward problem can be deal with before it have time to grow dangerous and in which outvote minority must accustom themselves to give way -lrb- footnote 1 : _ hibbert journal _ oct 1914 p 77 -rrb- other utterance by public man such as mr roosevelt and we own prime minister might be cite in the same sense but professor murray 's have be choose because he have have the courage to grasp the nettle in he word the true position be quite clearly set forth if inter-state law be to become a reality we must be sure to go far enough there be no half-way house between law and no law between government and no government between responsibility and no responsibility if the new concert be to be effective it must be able to compel the submission of all awkward problem and cause of quarrel to its permanent tribunal at the hague or elsewhere and it must be able to enforce the decision of its tribunal employ for the purpose if necessary the armed force of the signatory power as a international police out-vote minority must accustom themselves to give way it be a bland and easy phrase but it involve the whole question of world-government man must accustom themselves not to demand a eye for a eye and a tooth for a tooth the earliest law-giver might have say when the state first intervene between individual to make itself responsible for public order peace between the power as between individual be no doubt a habit to which cantankerous power must accustom themselves but they will be sure to do so if there be a law arm with the force to be they schoolmaster towards peaceable habit in other word they will do so because they have surrender one of the most vital element in the independent life of a state -- the right of conduct its own policy -- to the jurisdiction of a higher power a inter-state concert with a judiciary of its own and a army and navy under its own order be in fact not a inter-state concert at all it be a new state : it be in fact the world-state there be no middle course between law and no law : and the essence of statehood as we have see be a common law will this new state have the other attribute of government -- a common legislature and a common executive -- as well as a common judiciary let we go back to professor murray 's word he speak of outvote minority let we suppose the refractory country to be great britain outvote on some question relate to sea-power of whom will the outvote minority consist of the british member on the common council of the concert but the question at once arise what be the credentials of these british member whom do they represent to whom be they responsible if they be the representative of the british people and responsible to the democracy which send they how can they be expect to accustom themselves to give way -- perhaps to a majority compose of the representative of undemocratic government they responsibility be not to the concert but to they own government and people they be not the minority member of a democratically-elected council of they own fellow-citizen they be the minority member of a heterogeneous council towards which they owe no allegiance and recognize no binding responsibility there be no half-way house between citizenship and no citizenship between responsibility and no responsibility no man and no community can serve two master when the point of conflict arise man and nation have to make the choice where they duty lie not the representative of great britain on the international concert but the people of great britain themselves would have to decide whether they real allegiance as citizen be due to the world-state or to they own commonwealth : they would find themselves at the same awful parting of the way which confront the people of the southern state in 1861 when at the outbreak of the civil war general lee be offer by lincoln the commandership of the northern army and refuse it to become the commander-in-chief on the side of the south he do so because he believe as he tell congress after the war that the act of virginium in withdraw herself from the united state carry he along with it as a citizen of virginium and that _ she _ law and act be bind on he in other word unless the propose common council be to be make something more than a council of the delegate of sovereign state -lrb- as the southern state believe themselves to be till 1861 -rrb- a deadlock sooner or later be almost inevitable and the terrible and difficult question -- so familiar to american and recently to ourselves on the smaller stage of ulster -- of the right of secession and the coercion of minority will arise but if the common council be frame in accordance with a constitution which bind its representative to accept its decision and obey its government then the world-state with a world-executive will already have come into be there will be no more war but only rebellion and treason such be the real meaning of proposal to give a binding sanction to the decision of a inter-state concert anything short of this -- treaty and arbitration-agreement base upon inter-state arrangement without any executive to enforce they -- may give relief for a time and pave the way for further progress but can in itself provide no permanent security no satisfactory justification for the neglect of defensive measure by the various sovereign government on behalf of they people mr bryan for the united state have within the last eighteen month conclude twenty-six general arbitration treaty with different government and may yet succeed in he ambition of sign treaty with all the remainder yet no one imagine that when the immunity of the united state from attack be guarantee by the promise of every government in the world america will rely for she defense upon those promise alone in discuss proposal for a european council then we must be quite sure to face all that it mean but let we not reject professor murray 's suggestion off-hand because of its inherent difficulty : for that man should be discuss such scheme at all mark a significant advance in we political thought only let we be quite clear as to what they presuppose they presuppose the supremacy in the collective mind of civilised mankind of law over force a definite supremacy of what may be call the civilian as against the military ideal not in a majority of state but in every state powerful enough to defy coercion they presuppose a world map definitely settle on line satisfactory to the national aspiration of the people they presuppose a _ status quo _ which be not simply maintain like that after 1815 because it be a legal fact and its disturbance would be inconvenient to the exist ruler but because it be inherently equitable -lrb- 1 -rrb- they presuppose a similar democratic basis of citizenship and representation among the component state they presuppose lastly a educate public opinion incomparably less selfish less ignorant less unsteady less materialistic and less narrowly national than have be prevalent hitherto let we work and hope for these thing : let we use we best effort to remove misunderstanding and promote a sense of common responsibility and common trusteeship for civilisation between the people of all the various sovereign state but meanwhile let we work also with better hope of immediate if less ambitious success along the other parallel road of advance -lrb- footnote 1 : the same apply to proposal for ensure permanent peace in the industrial sphere neither capital nor labor will abide by scrap of paper if they do not feel the _ status quo -lrb- ie _ the condition under which wage-contract be make -rrb- to be equitable and inherently just -rrb- the other road may seem in this hour of dream and disaster of extreme of hope and disillusionment a long and tedious track : it be the old slow high road of civilisation not the short cut across the field it look forward to abide result not through the mechanical co-operation of government but through the growth of a organic citizenship through the education of the nation themselves to a sense of common duty and a common life it look forward not to the definite establishment in we day of the world-state but only to the definite refutation of the wicked theory of the mutual incompatibility of nation it look forward to the expression in the outward order of the world 's government of what we may call the principle of the commonwealth of lord acton 's great principle of the state compose of free nation of the state as a living body which live through the organic union and free activity of its several national member and it find its immediate field of action in the deepen and extension of the obligation of citizenship among the people of the great free just peace-loving supra-national commonwealth whose patriotism have be build up not by precept and doctrine but on a firm foundation of older loyalty the principle of the commonwealth be not a european principle : it be a world-principle it do not proceed upon the expectation of a united state of europe for all the great power of europe except austria-hungary -lrb- and some of the smaller such as holland belgium and portugal -rrb- be extra-european power also indeed if we contract we view with gladstone and bismarck and the statesman of the last generation to european issue alone we shall be ignore the chief political problem of we age -- the contact of race and nation with wide variety of social experience and at different level of civilisation it be this great and insistent problem -lrb- call it the problem of east and west or the problem of the colour-line -rrb- in all its difficult ramification political social and above all economic which make the development of the principle of the commonwealth the most pressing political need of we age for the problem arise out of the contact of race and nation can never be adjust either by the wise action of individual or by conflict and warfare they can only be solve by fair and deliberate statesmanship within the bosom of a single state through the recognition by both party of a higher claim than they own sectional interest -- the claim of a common citizenship and the interest of civilisation -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be here in the union and collaboration of diverse race and people that the principle of the commonwealth find its peculiar field of operation without this principle and without its expression however imperfect in the british empire the world would be in chaos to-day -lrb- footnote 1 : the most recent example of this be the settlement of the very difficult dispute between indium and south africa -rrb- we can not predict the political development of the various great power who between they control the destiny of civilisation we can not estimate the degree or the manner in which france free at last from nearer preoccupation will seek to embody in she vast dominion the great civilising principle for which she republic stand we can not foretell the issue of the conflict of idea which have sway to and fro in russium between the british and the prussian method of deal with the problem of nationality germany italy japan -- here too we be face by enigma one other great commonwealth remain besides the british upon the united state already lie the responsibility voluntarily assume and except during a time of internal crisis -lrb- 1 -rrb- successfully discharge of secure peace from external foe for score of million of inhabitant of the american continent yet with the progress of event she responsibility must yearly enlarge : for both the immigrant nationality within and the world-problem without she border seem to summon she to a deeper education and to wider obligation -lrb- footnote 1 : french occupation of mexico 1862 during the american civil war when the monroe doctrine be temporarily in abeyance -rrb- but upon the vast ramify and inchoate commonwealth of great britain lie the heaviest responsibility it be a task unequally share between those of she citizen who be capable of discharge it she task within the commonwealth be to maintain the common character and ideal and to adjust the mutual relation of one quarter of the human race she task without be to throw she weight into the scale of peace and to uphold and develop the standard and validity of inter-state agreement it be a task which require even at this time of crisis when by the common sentiment of she citizen the real nature and purpose of the commonwealth have become clear to we the active thought of all political student for to bring home to all within she border who bear rule and responsibility from the village headman in indium and nigeria the basutu chief and the south sea potentate to the public opinion of great britain and the self-governing dominion the nature of the british commonwealth and the character of its citizenship and ideal and to study how those ideal may be better express in its working institution and executive government -- that be a task to which the present crisis beckon the mind of british citizen a task which britain owe not only to herself but to mankind _ note _ -- a friendly critic who see this chapter in m remark : i think the author have be very successful in ignore some of the shady method by which the british empire have be extend the criticism be not strictly relevant to the subject of the chapter but as it may occur to other reader it may be well to deal with it in a brief note i would answer : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the shady method of which he speak be not the result of british imperialism or of a desire for conquest on the part of the british state they be the result melancholy but inevitable of the contact of individual and race at different level of development this contact between the stronger and the weaker -lrb- which can be illustrate from what be say about the sandalwood trader in the new hebride on p 215 above -rrb- be the direct result of the exploration of the sixteenth century which throw the sea of the world open to western pioneer and trader the extension of the authority of western _ government _ -lrb- spanish portuguese dutch french and british -rrb- and the collision between they follow inevitably on the activity of they citizen as have be point out on p 216 above all the western government have make mistake in deal with this unfamiliar situation but the wise course for democratic public opinion instead of railing at imperialism would seem to be to familiarise itself with its problem and control its injurious tendency -lrb- 2 -rrb- in any case the mistake of the past do not entitle we to wash we hand of responsibility in the present this war have show that the non-self-governing part of the commonwealth be not as we enemy suppose a weakness to great britain in time of trouble but a strength in other word whatever may have happen in the past great britain have now win the consent of the rule to the fact -- not necessarily to the method -- of british rule to use what be doubtless unduly constitutional language we be now face in indium and elsewhere not with a revolutionary movement but with a opposition that be a great incentive to further development book the philosophy of violence bernhardus _ germany and the next war _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- have become familiar but this be only one _ application _ of a doctrine which have find expression in many sphere as for example in the writings of the french syndicalist who claim to be copy the _ method _ of capitalism and the _ principle _ of bergson 's philosophy -- with what justification must be leave to the reader to determine see g sorel _ reflexion sur la violence _ -lrb- pari marcel rivière 1910 5 franc -rrb- and sorel 's other writings bernhardi-ism be in fact not a german product : it have be before the public for some year under the name of militancy in connection with various cause though it have never be put into execution on so tremendous a scale as by the prussian government nor be its philosophical basis to be find only if at all in nietzsche kultur the insistence on culture as the main factor in the life and development of people be to be find in practically every german history and in a great many non-german writer it have receive a additional vogue from the development of the study of _ sociology _ which naturally seek out in trace the development of society in the past the element which lend themselves to measurement and description and these be inevitably from the nature
