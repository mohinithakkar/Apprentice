produce by afra ullah and pg distribute proofreader the positive school of criminology three lecture give at the university of naple italy on April 22 23 and 24 1901 by enrico ferrus translate by ernest untermann chicago charle h kerr & company 1908 the positive school of criminology i my friend : when in the turmoil of my daily occupation i receive a invitation several month ago from several hundred student of this famous university to give they a brief summary in short special lecture of the principal and fundamental conclusion of criminal sociology i gladly accept because this invitation fall in with two ideal of mine these two ideal be stir my heart and be the secret of my life in the first place this invitation chime with the ideal of my personal life namely to diffuse and propagate among my brother the scientific idea which my brain have accumulate not through any merit of mine but thanks to the lucky prize inherit from my mother in the lottery of life and the second ideal which this invitation call up before my mind 's vision be this : the ideal of young people of italy unite in moral and intellectual pursuit feel in they social life the glow of a great aim it would matter little whether this aim would agree with my own idea or be oppose to they so long as it should be a ideal which would lift the aspiration of the young people out of the fatal grasp of egoistic interest of course we positivist know very well that the material requirement of life shape and determine also the moral and intellectual aim of human consciousness but positive science declare the follow to be the indispensable requirement for the regeneration of human ideal : without a ideal neither a individual nor a collectivity can live without it humanity be dead or die for it be the fire of a ideal which render the life of each one of we possible useful and fertile and only by its help can each one of we in the more or less short course of he or she existence leave behind trace for the benefit of fellow-being the invitation extend to I prove that the student of naple believe in the inspiring existence of such a ideal of science and be anxious to learn more about idea with which the entire world of the present day be occupy and whose life-giving breath enter even through the window of the dry courtroom when they door be close against it \* \* \* \* \* let we now speak of this new science which have become know in italy by the name of the positive school of criminology this science the same as every other phenomenon of scientific evolution can not be shortsightedly or conceitedly attribute to the arbitrary initiative of this or that thinker this or that scientist we must rather regard it as a natural product a necessary phenomenon in the development of that sad and somber department of science which deal with the disease of crime it be this plague of crime which form such a gloomy and painful contrast with the splendor of present-day civilization the 19th century have win a great victory over mortality and infectious disease by means of the masterful progress of physiology and natural science but while contagious disease have gradually diminish we see on the other hand that moral disease be grow more numerous in we so-called civilization while typhoid fever smallpox cholera and diphtheria retreat before the remedy which enlighten science apply by means of the experimental method remove they concrete cause we see on the other hand that insanity suicide and crime that painful trinity be grow apace and this make it very evident that the science which be principally if not exclusively engage in study these phenomenon of social disease should feel the necessity of find a more exact diagnosis of these moral disease of society in order to arrive at some effective and more humane remedy which should more victoriously combat this somber trinity of insanity suicide and crime the science of positive criminology arise in the last quarter of the 19th century as a result of this strange contrast which would be inexplicable if we could not discover historical and scientific reason for its existence and it be indeed a strange contrast that italy should have arrive at a perfect theoretical development of a classical school of criminology while there persist on the other hand the disgraceful condition that criminality assume dimension never before observe in this country so that the science of criminology can not stem the tide of crime in high and low circle it be for this reason that the positive school of criminology arise out of the very nature of thing the same as every other line of science it be base on the condition of we daily life it would indeed be conceit on we part to claim that we who be the originator of this new science and its new conclusion deserve alone the credit for its existence the brain of the scientist be rather a sort of electrical accumulator which feel and assimilate the vibration and heart-beat of life its splendor and its shame and derive therefrom the conviction that it must of necessity provide for definite social want and on the other hand it would be a evidence of intellectual short-sightedness on the part of the positivist man of science if he do not recognize the historical accomplishment which he predecessor on the field of science have leave behind as indelible trace of they struggle against the unknown in that brilliant and irksome domain for this reason the adherent of the positive school of criminology feel the most sincere reverence for the classic school of criminology and i be glad today in accept the invitation of the student of naple to say that this be another reason why they invitation be welcome to I it be now 16 year since i give in this same hall a lecture on positive criminology which be then in its initial stage it be in 1885 when i have the opportunity to outline the first principle of the positive school of criminology at the invitation of other student who precede you on the periodic wave of the intellectual generation and the renewal of this opportunity give I so much moral satisfaction that i could not under any circumstance decline you invitation then too the neapolitan atheneum have maintain the reputation of the italian mind in the 19th century also in that science which even foreign scientist admit to be we specialty namely the science of criminology in fact aside from the two terrible book of the digest and from the practical criminologist of the middle age who continue the study of criminality the modern world open a glorious page in the progress of criminal science with the modest little book of cesare beccarium this progress lead from cesare beccarium by way of francesco carrara to enrico pessina enrico pessina alone remain of the two giant who conclude the cycle of classic school of criminology in a lucid moment of he scientific consciousness which soon revert to the old abstract and metaphysical theory he announce in a introductory statement in 1879 that criminal justice would have to rejuvenate itself in the pure bath of the natural science and substitute in place of abstraction the living and concrete study of fact naturally every scientist have he function and historical significance and we can not expect that a brain which have arrive at the end of its career should turn towards a new direction at any rate it be a significant fact that this most renowned representative of the classic school of criminology should have point out this need of he special science in this same university of naple one year after the inauguration of the positive school of criminology that he should have look forward to a time when the study of natural and positive fact would set to rights the old juridical abstraction and there be still another precedent in the history of this university which make scientific propaganda at this place very agreeable for a positivist it be that six year before that introductory statement by pessina giovannus bovio give lecture at this university which he publish later on under the title of a critical study of criminal law giovannus bovio perform in this monograph the function of a critic but the historical time of he thought prevent he from take part in the construction of a new science however he prepare the ground for new idea by point out all the rift and weakness of the old building bovio maintain that which giobertus ellero confortus tissol have already maintain namely that it be impossible to solve the problem which be still the theoretical foundation of the classic school of criminology the problem of the relation between punishment and crime no man no scientist no legislator no judge have ever be able to indicate any absolute standard which would enable we to say that equity demand a definite punishment for a definite crime we can find some opportunistic expedient but not a solution of the problem of course if we could decide which be the gravest crime then we could also decide on the heaviest sentence and formulate a descend scale which would establish the relative fitting proportion between crime and punishment if it be agree that patricide be the gravest crime we meet out the heaviest sentence death or imprisonment for life and then we can agree on a descend scale of crime and on a parallel scale of punishment but the problem begin right with the first stone of the structure not with the succeed step which be the greatest penalty proportional to the crime of patricide neither science nor legislation nor moral consciousness can offer a absolute standard some say : the greatest penalty be death other say : no imprisonment for life still other say : neither death nor imprisonment for life but only imprisonment for a time and if imprisonment for a time be to be the highest penalty how many year shall it last -- thirty or twenty-five or ten no man can set up any absolute standard in this matter giovannus bovio thus arrive at the conclusion that this internal contradiction in the science of criminology be the inevitable fate of human justice and that this justice struggle in the grasp of this internal contradiction must turn to the civil law and ask for help in its weakness the same thought have already be illumine by a ray from the bright mind of filangierus who die all too soon and we can derive from this fact the historical rule that the most barbarian condition of humanity show a prevalence of a criminal code which punish without healing and that the gradual progress of civilization will give rise to the opposite conception of healing without punish thus it happen that this university of naple in which the illustrious representative of the classic school of criminology realize the necessity of its regeneration and in which bovio foresee its sterility have younger teacher now who keep alive the fire of the positivist tendency in criminal science such as penta zuccarellus and other whom you know nevertheless i feel that this faculty of jurisprudence still lack oxygen in the study of criminal law because its thought be still influence by the overwhelming authority of the name of enrico pessina and it be easy to understand that there where the majestic tree spread out its branch towards the blue vault the young plant feel deprive of light and air while it might have grow strong and beautiful in another place the positive school of criminology then be bear in we own italy through the singular attraction of the italian mind toward the study of criminology and its birth be also due to the peculiar condition we country with its great and strange contrast between the theoretical doctrine and the painful fact of a ever increase criminality the positive school of criminology be inaugurate by the work of cesare lombroso in 1872 from 1872 to 1876 he open a new way for the study of criminality by demonstrate in he own person that we must first understand the criminal who offend before we can study and understand he crime lombroso study the prisoner in the various penitentiary of italy from the point of view of anthropology and he compile he study in the report of the lombardian institute of science and literature and publish they later together in he work criminal man the first edition of this work -lrb- 1876 -rrb- remain almost unnoticed either because its scientific material be meager or because cesare lombroso have not yet draw any general scientific conclusion which could have attract the attention of the world of science and law but simultaneously with its second edition -lrb- 1878 -rrb- there appear two monograph which constitute the embryo of the new school supplement the anthropological study of lombroso with conclusion and systematization from the point of view of sociology and law raffaele garofalo publish in the neapolitan journal of philosophy and literature a essay on criminality in which he declare that the dangerousness of the criminal be the criterion by which society should measure the function of its defense against the disease of crime and in the same year 1878 i take occasion to publish a monograph on the denial of free will and personal responsibility in which i declare frankly that from now on the science of crime and punishment must look for the fundamental fact of a science of social defense against crime in the human and social life itself the simultaneous publication of these three monograph cause a stir the teacher of classic criminology who have take kindly to the recommendation of pessina and ellero urge they to study the natural source of crime meet the new idea with contempt when the new method make a determine and radical departure and become not only the critic but the zealous opponent of the new theory and this be easy to understand for the struggle for existence be a irresistible law of nature as well for the thousand of germ scatter to the wind by the oak as for the idea which grow in the brain of man but persecution calumny criticism and opposition be powerless against a idea if it carry within itself the germ of truth moreover we should look upon this phenomenon of a repugnance in the average intellect -lrb- whether of the ordinary man or the scientist -rrb- for all new idea as a natural function for when the brain of some man have feel the light of a new idea a sneering criticism serve we a touchstone for it if the idea be wrong it will fall by the wayside if it be right then criticism opposition and persecution will cull the golden kernel from the unsightly shell and the idea will march victoriously over everything and everybody it be so in all walk of life -- in art in politics in science every new idea will rouse against itself naturally and inevitably the opposition of the accustomed thought this be so true that when cesare beccarium open the great historic cycle of the classic school of criminology he be assault by the critic of he time with the same indictment which be bring against we a century later when cesare beccarium print he book on crime and penalty in 1774 under a false date and place of publication reflect the aspiration which give rise to the impending hurricane of the french revolution when he hurl himself against all that be barbarian in the mediaeval law and set loose a storm of enthusiasm among the encyclopedist and even some of the member of government in france he be meet by a wave of opposition calumny and accusation on the part of the majority of jurist judge and light of philosophy the abbé jachincus publish four volume against beccarium call he the destroyer of justice and morality simply because he have combat the torture and the death penalty the torture which we incorrectly ascribe to the mental brutality of the judge of those time be but a logical consequence of the contemporaneous theory it be feel that in order to condemn a man one must have the certainty of he guilty and it be say that the best means of obtain tin certainty the queen of proof be the confession of the criminal and if the criminal deny he guilt it be necessary to have recourse to torture in order to force he to a confession which he withhold from fear of the penalty the torture soothe so to say the conscience of the judge who be free to condemn as soon as he have obtain a confession cesare beccarium rise with other against the torture thereupon the judge and jurist protest that penal justice would be impossible because it could not get any information since a man suspect of a crime would not confess he guilt voluntarily hence they accuse beccarium of be the protector of robber and murderer because he want to abolish the only means of compelling they to a confession the torture but cesare beccarium have on he side the magic power of truth he be truly the electric accumulator of he time who gather from its atmosphere the presage of the come revolution the stir of the human conscience you can find a similar illustration in the work of daquin in savoy of pinel in france and of hach take in england who strive to bring about a revolution in the treatment of the insane this episode interest we especially because it be a perfect illustration of the way travel by the positive school of criminology the insane be likewise consider to blame for they insanity at the dawn of the 19th century the physician hernroth still write that insanity be a moral sin of the insane because no one become insane unless he forsake the straight path of virtue and of the fear of the lord and on this assumption the insane be lock up in horrible dungeon load down with chain tortured and beat for lo they insanity be they own fault at that period pinel advance the revolutionary idea that insanity be not a sin but a disease like all other disease this idea be now a commonplace but in he time it revolutionize the world it seem as though this innovation inaugurate by pinel would overthrow the world and the foundation of society well two year before the storm of the bastile pinel walk into the sanitarium of the salpetriere and commit the brave act of free the insane of the chain that weigh they down he demonstrate in practice that the insane when free of they chain become quieter instead of create wild disorder and destruction this great revolution of pinel chiarugus and other change the attitude of the public mind toward the insane while formerly insanity have be regard as a moral sin the public conscience thanks to the enlighten work of science henceforth have to adapt itself to the truth that insanity be a disease like all other that a man do not become insane because he want to but that he become insane through hereditary transmission and the influence of the environment in which he live be predispose toward insanity and become insane under the pressure of circumstance the positive school of criminology accomplish the same revolution in the view concern the treatment of criminal that the above name man of science accomplish for the treatment of the insane the general opinion of classic criminalist and of the people at large be that crime involve a moral guilt because it be due to the free will of the individual who leave the path of virtue and choose the path of crime and therefore it must be suppress by meet it with a proportionate quantity of punishment this be to this day the current conception of crime and the illusion of a free human will -lrb- the only miraculous factor in the eternal ocean of cause and effect -rrb- lead to the assumption that one can choose freely between virtue and vice how can you still believe in the existence of a free will when modern psychology arm with all the instrument of positive modern research deny that there be any free will and demonstrate that every act of a human being be the result of a interaction between the personality and the environment of man and how be it possible to cling to that obsolete idea of moral guilt accord to which every individual be suppose to have the free choice to abandon virtue and give himself up to crime the positive school of criminology maintain on the contrary that it be not the criminal who will in order to be a criminal it be rather necessary that the individual should find himself permanently or transitorily in such personal physical and moral condition and live in such a environment which become for he a chain of cause and effect externally and internally that dispose he toward crime this be we conclusion which i anticipate and it constitute the vastly different and opposite method which the positive school of criminology employ as compare to the lead principle of the classic school of criminal science in this method this essential principle of the positive school of criminology you will find another reason for the seemingly slow advance of this school that be very natural if you consider the great reform carry by the idea of cesare beccarium into the criminal justice of the middle age you will see that the great classic school represent but a small step forward because it leave the penal justice on the same theoretical and practical basis which it have in the middle age and in classic antiquity that be to say base on the idea of a moral responsibility of the individual for beccarium for carrara for they predecessor this idea be no more nor less than that mention in book 47 and 48 of the digest : the criminal be liable to punishment to the extent that he be morally guilty of the crime he have commit the entire classic school be therefore nothing but a series of reform capital punishment have be abolish in some country likewise torture confiscation corporal punishment but nevertheless the immense scientific movement of the classic school have remain a mere reform it have continue in the 19th century to look upon crime in the same way that the middle age do : whoever commit murder or theft be alone the absolute arbiter to decide whether he want to commit the crime or not this remain the foundation of the classic school of criminology this explain why it could travel on its way more rapidly than the positive school of criminology and yet it take half a century from the time of beccarium before the penal code show sign of the reformatory influence of the classic school of criminology so that it have also take quite a long time to establish it so well that it become accept by general consent as it be today the positive school of criminology be bear in 1878 and although it do not stand for a mere reform of the method of criminal justice but for a complete and fundamental transformation of criminal justice itself it have already go quite a distance and make considerable conquest which begin to show in we country it be a fact that the penal code now in force in this country represent a compromise so far as the theory of personal responsibility be concern between the old theory of free will and the conclusion of the positive school which deny this free will you can find a illustration of this in the eloquent contortion of phantastic logic in the essay on the criminal code write by a great advocate of the classic school of criminology mario pagano this admirable type of a scientist and patriot who do not lock himself up in the quiet egoism of he study but feel the ideal of he time stir within he and give up he life to it he have write three line of a simple nudity that reveal much in which he say : a man be responsible for the crime which he commit if in commit a crime he will be half free he be responsible to the extent of one-half if one-third he be responsible one-third there you have the uncompromising and absolute classic theorem but in the penal code of 1890 you will find that the famous article 45 intend to base the responsibility for a crime on the simple will to the exclusion of the free will however the italian judge have continue to base the exercise of penal justice on the suppose existence of the free will and pretend not to know that the number of scientist deny the free will be grow now how be it possible that so terrible a office as that of sentence criminal retain its stability or vacillate accord to whether the first who deny the existence of a free will deprive this function of its foundation truly it be say that this question have be too difficult for the new italian penal code and for this reason it be think best to base the responsibility for a crime on the idea that a man be guilty simply for the reason that he want to commit the crime and that he be not responsible if he do not want to commit it but this be a eclectic way out of the difficulty which settle nothing for in the same code we have the rule that involuntary criminal be also punish so that involuntary killing and wounding be punish with imprisonment the same as voluntary deed of this kind we have hear it say in such case that the result may not have be intend but the action bring it about be if a hunter shoot through a hedge and kill or wound a person he do not intend to kill and yet he be hold responsible because he first act the shooting be voluntary that statement apply to involuntary crime which be commit by some positive act but what about involuntary crime of omission in a railway station where the movement of train represent the daily whirl of traffic in man thing and idea every switch be a delicate instrument which may cause a derailment the railway management place a switchman on duty at this delicate post but in a moment of fatigue or because he have to work inhumanly long hour of work which exhaust all he nervous elasticity or for other reason the switchman forget to set the switch and cause a railroad accident in which people be kill and wound can it be say that he intend the first act assuredly not for he do not intend anything and do not do anything the hunter who fire a shot have at least have the intention of shooting but the switchman do not want to forget -lrb- for in that case he would be indirectly to blame -rrb- he have simply forget from sheer fatigue to do he duty he have have no intention whatever and yet you hold he responsible in spite of all that the fundamental logic of you reasoning in this case correspond to the logic of the thing do it not happen every day in the administration of justice that the judge forget about the neutral expedient of the legislator who devise this relative progress of the penal code which pretend to base the responsibility of a man on the neutral and naive criterion of a will without freedom of will do they not follow they old mental habit in the administration of justice and apply the obsolete criterion of the free will which the legislator think fit to abandon we see then as a result of this imperfect and insincere innovation in penal legislation this flagrant contradiction that the magistrate assume the existence of a free will while the legislator have decide that it shall not be assume now in science as well as in legislation we should follow a direct and logical line such as that of the classic school or the positive school of criminology but whoever think he have solve a problem when he give we a solution which be neither fish nor fowl come to the most absurd and iniquitous conclusion you see what happen every day if to-morrow some beastly and incomprehensible crime be commit the conscience of the judge be trouble by this question : be the person who commit this crime morally free to act or not he may also invoke the help of legislation and he may take refuge in article 46 -lrb- a -rrb- or in that compromise of article 47 -lrb- b -rrb- which admit a responsibility of one-half or one-third and he would decide on a penalty of one-half or one-third all this may take place in the case of a grave and strange crime and on the other hand go to the municipal court or to the police court where the magic lantern of justice throw its ray upon the nameless human being who have steal a bundle of wood in a hard winter or who have slap some one in the face during a brawl in a saloon and if they should find a defend lawyer who would demand the appointment of a medical expert watch the reception he would get from the judge when justice be surprise by a beastly and strange crime it feel the entire foundation of its premise shake it halt for a moment it call in the help of legal medicine and reflect before it sentence but in the case of those poor nameless creature justice do not stop to consider whether that microbe in the criminal world who steal under the influence of hereditary or acquire degeneration or in the delirium of chronic hunger be not worthy of more pity it rather reply with a mephistophelian grin when he beg for a humane understanding of he case -lrb- a -rrb- article 46 : a person be not subject to punishment if at the moment of he deed he be in a mental condition which deprive he of consciousness or of the freedom of action but if the judge consider it dangerous to acquit the prisoner he have to transfer he to the care of the proper authority who will take the necessary precaution -lrb- b -rrb- article 47 : if the mental condition mention in the foregoing article be such as to considerably decrease the responsibility without eliminate it entirely the penalty fix upon the crime commit be reduce accord to the follow rule : i in place of penitentiary imprisonment for not less than six year ii in place of the permanent loss of civic rights a loss of these rights for a stipulate time iii whenever it be a question of a penalty of more than twelve year it be reduce to from three to ten year if of more than six year but not more than twelve it be reduce to from one to five year in other case the reduction be to be one-half of the ordinary penalty iv a fine be reduce to one-half v if the penalty would be a restriction of personal liberty the judge may order the prisoner to a workhouse until the proper authority object when the remainder of the sentence be carry out in the usual manner it be true that there be now and then in those hall of justice which remain all too frequently close to the living wave of public sentiment some more intelligent and serene judge who be touch by this painful understanding of the actual human life then he may under the illogical condition of penal justice with its compromise between the exactness of the classic and that of the positive school of criminology seek for some expedient which may restore he to equanimity in 1832 france introduce a penal innovation which seem to represent a advance on the field of justice but which be in reality a denial of justice : the expedient of _ extenuate circumstance _ the judge do not ask for the advice of the court physician in the case of some forlorn criminal but condemn he without a word of rebuke to society for its complicity but in order to assuage he own conscience he grant he extenuate circumstance which seem a concession of justice but be in reality a denial of justice for you either believe that a man be responsible for he crime and in that case the concession of extenuate circumstance be a hypocrisy or you grant they in good faith and then you admit that the man be in circumstance which reduce he moral responsibility and thereby the extenuate circumstance become a denial of justice for if you conviction concern such circumstance be sincere you would go to the bottom of they and examine with the light of you understand all those innumerable condition which contribute toward those extenuate circumstance but what be those extenuate circumstance family condition take it that a child be leave alone by its parent who be swallow up in the whirl of modern industry which overthrow the law of nature and forbid the necessary rest because steam engine do not get tired and day work must be follow by night work so that the setting of the sun be no longer the signal for the laborer to rest but to begin a new shift of work take it that this apply not alone to adult but also to human being in the grow stage whose muscular power may yield some profit for the capitalist take it that even the mother during the period of sacred maternity become a cog in the machinery of industry and you will understand that the child must grow up leave to its own resource in the filth of life and that its history will be inscribe in criminal statistics which be the shame of we so-called civilization of course in this first lecture i can not give you even a glimpse of the positive result of that modern science which have study the criminal and he environment instead of he crime and i must therefore limit myself to a few hint concern the historical origin of the positive school of criminology i ought to tell you something concern the question of free will but you will understand that such a momentous question which be worthy of a deep study of the many-sided physical moral intellectual life can not be sum up in a few short word i can only say that the tendency of modern natural science in physiology as well as psychology have overrule the illusion of those who would fain persist in watch psychological phenomenon merely within themselves and think that they can understand they without any other means on the contrary positive science back by the testimony of anthropology and of the study of the environment have arrive at the follow conclusion : the admission of a free will be out of the question for if the free will be but a illusion of we internal be it be not a real faculty possess by the human mind free will would imply that the human will confront by the choice of make voluntarily a certain determination have the last decisive word under the pressure of circumstance contend for and against this decision that it be free to decide for or against a certain course independently of internal and external circumstance which play upon it accord to the law of cause and effect take it that a man have insult I i leave the place in which i have be insult and with I go the suggestion of forgiveness or of murder and vengeance and then it be assume that a man have he complete free will unless he be influence by circumstance explicitly enumerate by the law such as minority congenital deaf-muteness insanity habitual drunkenness and to a certain extent violent passion if a man be not in a condition mention in this list he be consider in possession of he free will and if he murder he be hold morally responsible and therefore punish this illusion of a free will have its source in we inner consciousness and be due solely to the ignorance in which we find ourselves concern the various motive and different external and internal condition which press upon we mind at the moment of decision if a man know the principal cause which determine a certain phenomenon he say that this phenomenon be inevitable if he do not know they he consider it as a accident and this correspond in the physical field to the arbitrary phenomenon of the human will which do not know whether it shall decide this way or that for instance some of we be of the opinion and many still be that the come and go of meteorological phenomenon be accidental and could not he foresee but in the meantime science have demonstrate that they be likewise subject to the law of causality because it discover the cause which enable we to foresee they course thus weather prognosis have make wonderful progress by the help of a network of telegraphically connect meteorological station which succeed in demonstrate the connection between cause and effect in the case of hurricane as well as of any other physical phenomenon it be evident that the idea of accident apply to physical nature be unscientific every physical phenomenon be the necessary effect of the cause that determine it beforehand if those cause be know to we we have the conviction that that phenomenon be necessary be fate and if we do not know they we think it be accidental the same be true of human phenomenon but since we do not know the internal and external cause in the majority of case we pretend that they be free phenomenon that be to say that they be not determine necessarily by they cause hence the spiritualistic conception of the free will imply that every human be in spite of the fact that they internal and external condition be necessarily predetermine should be able to come to a deliberate decision by the mere fiat of he or she free will so that even though the sum of all the cause demand a no he or she can decide in favor of yes and vice versa now who be there that think when deliberate some action what be the cause that determine he choice we can justly say that the greater part of we action be determine by habit that we make up we mind almost from custom without consider the reason for or against when we get up in the morning we go about we customary business quite automatically we perform it as a function in which we do not think of a free will we think of that only in unusual and grave case when we be call upon to make some special choice the so-called voluntary deliberation and then we weigh the reason for or against we ponder we hesitate what to do well even in such case so little depend on we will in the deliberation which we be about to take that if any one be to ask we one minute before we have decide what we be go to do we should not know what we be go to decide so long as we be undecided we can not foresee what we be go to decide for under the condition in which we live that part of the psychic process take place outside of we consciousness and since we do not know its cause we can not tell what will be its effect only after we have come to a certain decision can we imagine that it be due to we voluntary action but shortly before we could not tell and that prove that it do not depend on we alone suppose for instance that you have decide to play a joke on a fellow-student and that you carry it out he take it unkindly you be surprised because that be contrary to he habit and you expectation but after a while you learn that you friend have receive bad news from home on the precede morning and be therefore not in a condition to feel like joking and then you say : if we have know that we should not have decide to spring the joke on he that be equivalent to say that if the balance of you will have be incline toward the decide motive of no you would have decide no but not know that you friend be distressed and not in he habitual frame of mind you decide in favor of yes this sentence : if i have know this i should not have do that be a outcry of we internal consciousness which deny the existence of a free will on the other hand nothing be create and nothing destroy either in matter or in force because both matter and force be eternal and indestructible they transform themselves in the most diversified manner but not a atom be add or take away not one vibration more or less take place and so if be the force of external and internal circumstance which determine the decision of we will at any given moment the idea of a free will however be a denial of the law of cause and effect both in the field of philosophy and theology saint augustine and martin luther furnish irrefutable theological argument for the denial of a free will the omnipotence of god be irreconcilable with the idea of free will if everything that happen do so because a superhuman and omnipotent power want it _ -lrb- not a single leaf fall to the ground without the will of god -rrb- _ how can a son murder he father without the permission and will of god for this reason saint augustine and martin luther have write _ de servo arbitrio _ but since theological argument serve only those who believe in the concept of a god which be not give to we by science we take recourse to the law which we observe in force and matter and to the law of causality if modern science have discover the universal link which connect all phenomenon through cause and effect which show that every phenomenon be the result of cause which have precede it if this be the law of causality which be at the very bottom of modern scientific thought then it be evident that the admission of free thought be equivalent to a overthrow of this law accord to which every effect be proportionate to its cause in that case this law which reign supreme in the entire universe would dissolve itself into naught at the foot of the human being who would create effect with he free will not correspond to they cause it be all right to think so at a time when people have a entirely different idea of human being but the work of modern science and its effect on practical life have result in trace the relation of each one of we with the world and with we fellow being and the influence of science may be see in the elimination of great illusion which in former century sway this or that part of civilized humanity the scientific thought of copernicus and galileus do away with the illusion which lead people to believe that the earth be the center of the universe and of creation take cicero 's book _ de officiís _ or the _ divina commedium _ of dante and you will find that to they the earth be the center of creation that the infinite star circle around it and that man be the king of animal : a geocentric and anthropocentric illusion inspire by immeasurable conceit but copernicus and galileus come and demonstrate that the earth do not stand still but that it be a grain of cosmic matter hurl into blue infinity and rotate since time unknown around its central body the sun which originate from a immense primitive nebula galileus be subject to torture by those who realize that this new theory strike down many a religious legend and many a moral creed but galileus have speak the truth and nowadays humanity no longer indulge in the illusion that the earth be the center of creation but man live on illusion and give way but reluctantly to the progress of science in order to devote themselves arduously to the ideal of the new truth which rise out of the essence of thing of which mankind be a part after the geocentric illusion have be destroy the anthropocentric illusion still remain on earth man be still suppose to be king of creation the center of terrestrial life all species of animal plant and mineral be suppose to be create expressly for he and to have have from time immemorial the form which we see now so that the fauna and flora live on we planet have always be what they be today and cicero for instance say that the heaven be place around the earth and man in order that he might admire the beauty of the starry firmament at night and that animal and plant be create for he use and pleasure but in 1856 charle darwin come and summarize the result of study that have be carry on for a century destroy in the name of science the superb illusion that man be the king and center of creation he demonstrate amid the attack and calumny of the lover of darkness that man be not the king of creation but merely the last link of the zoological chain that nature be endowed with eternal energy by which animal and plant life the same as mineral life -lrb- for even in crystal the law of life be at work -rrb- be transform from the invisible microbe to the highest form man the anthropocentric illusion rebel against the word of darwin accuse he of lower the human life to the level of the dirt or of the brute but a disciple of darwin give the right answer while propagate the darwinian theory at the university of jena it be haeckel who conclude : for my part and so far as my human consciousness be concerned i prefer to be a immensely perfect ape rather than to be a degenerate and debase adam gradually the anthropocentric illusion have be compel to give way before the result of science and today the theory of darwin have become establish among we idea but another illusion still remain and science working in the name of reality will gradually eliminate it namely the illusion that the nineteenth century have establish a permanent order of society while the geocentric and anthropocentric illusion have be dispel the illusion of the immobility and eternity of class still persist but it be well to remember that in holland in the sixteenth century in england in the seventeenth in europe since the revolution of 1789 we have see that freedom of think in science literature and art for which the bourgeoisie fight triumph over the tyranny of the mediaeval dogma and this condition instead of be a glorious but transitory stage be suppose to be the end of the development of humanity which be henceforth condemn not to perfect itself any more by further change this be the illusion which serve as a fundamental argument against the positive school of criminology since it be claim that a penal justice enthrone on the foundation of beccarium and carrara would be a revolutionary heresy it be also this illusion which serve as a argument against those who draw the logical consequence in regard to the socialistic future of humanity for the science which take its departure front the work of copernicus galileus and darwin arrive logically at socialism socialism be but the natural and physical transformation of the economic and social institution of course so long as the geocentric and anthropocentric illusion dominate it be natural that the lore of stability should impress itself upon science and life how could this live atom which the human being be undertake to change that order of creation which make of the earth the center of the universe and of man the center of life not until science have introduce the conception of a natural formation and transformation of the solar system as well as of the fauna and flora do the human mind grasp the idea that thought and action can transform the world for this reason we believe that the study of the criminal and the logical consequence therefrom will bring about the complete transformation of human justice not only as a theory lay down in scientific book but also as a practical function apply every day to that living and suffer portion of humanity which have fall into crime we have the undaunted faith that the work of scientific truth will transform penal justice into a simple function of preserve society from the disease of crime divest of all relic of vengeance hatred and punishment which still survive in we day as live reminder of the barbarian stage we still hear the public vengeance invoke against the criminal today and justice have still for its symbol a sword which it use more than the scale but a judge bear of a woman can not weigh the moral responsibility of one who have commit murder or theft not until the experimental and scientific method shall look for the cause of that dangerous malady which we call crime in the physical and psychic organism and in the family and the environment of the criminal will justice guide by science discard the sword which now descend bloody upon those poor fellow-being who have fall victim to crime and become a clinical function whose prime object shall be to remove or lessen in society and individual the cause which incite to crime then alone will justice refrain from wreak vengeance after a crime have be commit with the shame of a execution or the absurdity of solitary confinement on the one hand human life depend on the word of a judge who may err in the case of capital punishment and society can not end the life of a man unless the necessity of legitimate self-defense demand it on the other hand solitary confinement come in with the second current of the classic school of criminology when at the same time in which beccarium promulgate he idea john howard travel all over europe describe the unmentionable horror of mass imprisonment which become a center of infection for society at large then the classic school go to the other extreme of solitary confinement after the model of america whence we adopt the system of philadelphium and harrisburg in the first half of the nineteenth century isolation for the night be also we demand but we object to continuous solitary confinement by day and night pasquale mancinus call solitary confinement a living grave in order to reassure the timorous when in the name of the classic school whose valiant champion he be he demand in 1876 the abolition of capital punishment yet in he swan song he recognize that the future would belong to the positive school of criminology and it be this living grave against which we protest it can not possibly be a act of human justice to bury a human be in a narrow cell within four wall to prevent this be from have any contact with social life and to say to he at the end of he term : now that you lung be no longer accustom to breathe the open air now that you leg be no longer use to the rough road go but take care not to have a relapse or you sentence will be twice as hard in reality solitary confinement make of a human be either a stupid creature or a rave beast and s ` io dico il vero l'effeto nol nasconde -- if i speak the truth the fact will also reveal it -- for criminality increase and expand honest people remain unprotected and those who be strike by the law do not improve but become ever more antisocial through the repeat relapse and so we have that contrast which i mention in the beginning of my lecture that the theoretical side of criminal science be so perfect while criminal condition be painfully in evidence the inevitable conclusion be the necessity of a progressive transformation of the science of crime and punishment of criminology ii we see yesterday in a short historical review that the classic cycle of the science of crime and punishment originate by cesare beccarium more than a century ago be follow in we country some twenty year since by the scientific movement of the positive school of criminology let we see today how this school study the problem of criminality reserve for tomorrow the discussion of the remedy proposal by this school for the disease of criminality when a crime be commit in some place attract public attention either through the atrocity of the case or the strangeness of the criminal deed -- for instance one that be not connect with bloodshed but with intellectual fraud -- there be at once two tendency that make themselves feel in the public conscience one of they pervade the overwhelming majority of individual conscience ask : how be this what for why do that man commit such a crime this question be ask by everybody and occupy mostly the attention of those who do not look upon the case from the point of view of criminology on the other hand those who occupy themselves with criminal law represent the other tendency which manifest itself when acquaint with the news of this crime this be a limited portion of the public conscience which try to study the problem from the standpoint of the technical jurist the lawyer the judge the official of the police ask themselves : what be the name of the crime commit by that man under such circumstance must it be class we murder or patricide attempt or incompleted manslaughter and if direct against property be it theft or illegal appropriation or fraud and the entire apparatus of practical criminal justice forget at once the first problem which occupy the majority of the public conscience the question of the cause that lead to this crime in order to devote itself exclusively to the technical side of the problem which constitute the juridical anatomy of the inhuman and antisocial deed perpetrate by the criminal in these two tendency you have a photographic reproduction of the two school of criminology the classic school which look upon the crime as a juridical problem occupy itself with its name its definition its juridical analysis leave the personality of the criminal in the background and remember it only so far as exceptional circumstance explicitly state in the law book refer to it : whether he be a minor a deaf-mute whether it be a case of insanity whether he be drunk at the time the crime be commit only in these strictly define case do the classic school occupy itself theoretically with the personality of the criminal but ninety time in one hundred these exceptional circumstance do not exist or can not be show to exist and penal justice limit itself to the technical definition of the fact but when the case come up in the criminal court or before the juror practice demonstrate that there be seldom a discussion between the lawyer of the defense and the judge for the purpose of ascertain the most exact definition of the fact of determine whether it be a case of attempt or merely project crime of find out whether there be any of the juridical element define in this or that article of the code the judge be rather face to face with the problem of ascertain why under what condition for what reason the man have commit the crime this be the supreme and simple human problem but hitherto it have be leave to a more or less perspicacious more or less gifted empiricism and there have be no scientific standard no methodical collection of fact no observation and conclusion save those of the positive school of criminology this school alone make a attempt to solve in every case of crime the problem of its natural origin of the reason and condition that induce a man to commit such and such a crime for instance about 3000 case of manslaughter be register every year in italy now open any work inspire by the classic school of criminology and ask the author why 3000 man be the victim of manslaughter every year in italy and how it be that there be not sometimes only as many as say 300 case the number commit in england which have nearly the same number of inhabitant as italy and how it be that there be not sometimes 300000 such case in italy instead of 3000 it be useless to open any work of classical criminology for this purpose for you will not find a answer to these question in than no one from beccarium to carrara have ever think of this problem and they could not have ask it consider they point of departure and they method in fact the classic criminologist accept the phenomenon of criminality as a accomplished fact they analyze it from the point of view of the technical jurist without ask how this criminal fact may have be produce and why it repeat itself in greater or smaller number from year to year in every country the theory of a free will which be they foundation exclude the possibility of this scientific question for accord to it the crime be the product of the fiat of the human will and if that be admit as a fact there be nothing leave to account for the manslaughter be commit because the criminal want to commit it and that be all there be to it once the theory of a free will be accept as a fact the deed depend on the fiat the voluntary determination of the criminal and all be say but if on the other hand the positive school of criminology deny on the ground of research in scientific physiological psychology that the human will be free and do not admit that one be a criminal because he want to be but declare that a man commit this or that crime only when he live in definitely determine condition of personality and environment which induce he necessarily to act in a certain way then alone do the problem of the origin of criminality begin to be submit to a preliminary analysis and then alone do criminal law step out of the narrow and arid limit of technical jurisprudence and become a true social and human science in the highest and noblest meaning of the word it be vain to insist with such stubbornness as that of the classic school of criminology on juristic formula by which the distinction between illegal appropriation and theft between fraud and other form of crime against property and so forth be determine when this method do not give to society one single word which would throw light upon the reason that make a man a criminal and upon the efficacious remedy by which society could protect itself against criminality it be true that the classic school of criminology have likewise its remedy against crime -- namely punishment but this be the only remedy of that school and in all the legislation inspire by the theory of that school in all the country of the civilized world there be no other remedy against crime but repression but bentham have say : every time that punishment be inflict it prove its inefficacy for it do not prevent the committal of that crime therefore this remedy be worthless and a deeper study of the cause of crime demonstrate that if a man do not commit a certain crime this be due to entirely different reason than a fear of the penalty very strong and fundamental reason which be not to be find in the threat of legislator these threat if nevertheless carry out by police and prison keeper run counter to those condition a man who intend to commit a crime or who be carry away by a violent passion by a psychological hurricane which drown he moral sense be not check by threat of punishment because the volcanic eruption of passion prevent he from reflect or he may decide to commit a crime after due premeditation and preparation and in that case the penalty be powerless to check he because he hope to escape with impunity all criminal will tell you unanimously that the only thing which impel they when they be deliberate a crime be the expectation that they would go scot free if they have but the least suspicion that they might be detect and punish they would not have commit the crime the only exception be the case in which a crime be the result of a mental explosion cause by a violent outburst of passion and if you wish to have a very convincing illustration of the psychological inefficacy of legal threat you have but to think of that curious crime which have now assume a frequency never know to former century namely the making of counterfeit money for since paper money -- from want or for reason of expediency -- have become a substitute of metal coin in the civilized country the making of counterfeit paper money have become very frequent in the nineteenth century now a counterfeiter in commit he crime must compel he mind to imitate closely the inscription of the bill letter for letter include that threatening passage which say : _ the law punish counterfeit _ etc can you see before you mind 's eye a counterfeiter in the act of engrave on the stone or the other may ignore the penalty that await they but he can not this illustration be convince for in case of other crime one may always assume that the criminal act without thinking of the future even when he be not in a transport of passion but in the case of the counterfeiter the very act of commit the crime remind he of the threat of the law and yet he be imperturbable while perpetrate it crime have its natural cause which lie outside of that mathematical point call the free will of the criminal aside from be a juridical phenomenon which it would be well to examine by itself every crime be above all a natural and social phenomenon and should be study primarily as such we need not go through so hard a course of study merely for the purpose of walk over the razor edge of juristic definition and to find out for instance that from the time romagnosus make a distinction between incompleted and attempted crime river of ink have be spill in the attempt to find the distinguishing element of these two degree of crime and finally when the german legislator conclude to make no distinction between incompleted and attempted crime and to recognize only the complete crime in he code of 1871 we witness the spectacle of carrara praise that legislator for leave that subtile distinction out of he code a strange conclusion on the part of a science which cudgel its brain for a century to find the mark of distinction between attempted and incompleted crime and then praise the legislator for ignore it and another classic jurist buccellatus propose to do away with the theory of attempted crime by simply define it as a crime by itself or as -- a violation of police law a science which come to such conclusion be a science which move in metaphysical abstraction and we shall see that all these finespun question which abound in classical science lose all practical value before the necessity of save society from the plague of crime the method which we on the other hand have inaugurate be the following : before we study crime from the point of view of a juristic phenomenon we must study the cause to which the annual recurrence of crime in all country be due these be natural cause which i have classify under the three head of anthropological telluric and social every crime from the smallest to the most atrocious be the result of the interaction of these three cause the anthropological condition of the criminal the telluric environment in which he be live and the social environment in which he be bear living and operate it be a vain beginning to separate the mesh of this net of criminality there be still those who would maintain the one-sided standpoint that the origin of crime may be trace to only one of these element for instance to the social element alone so far as i be concerned i have combat this opinion from the very inauguration of the positive school of criminology and i combat it today it be certainly easy enough to think that the entire origin of all crime be due to the unfavorable social condition in which the criminal life but a objective methodical observation demonstrate that social condition alone do not suffice to explain the origin of criminality although it be true that the prevalence of the influence of social condition be a incontestable fact in the case of the greater number of crime especially of the lesser one but there be crime which can not be explain by the influence of social condition alone if you regard the general condition of misery as the sole source of criminality then you can not get around the difficulty that out of one thousand individual live in misery from the day of they birth to that of they death only one hundred or two hundred become criminal while the other nine hundred or eight hundred either sink into biological weakness or become harmless maniac or commit suicide without perpetrate any crime if poverty be the sole determine cause one thousand out of one thousand poor ought to become criminal if only two hundred become criminal while one hundred commit suicide one hundred end as maniac and the other six hundred remain honest in they social condition then poverty alone be not sufficient to explain criminality we must add the anthropological and telluric factor only by means of these three element of natural influence can criminality be explain of course the influence of either the anthropological or telluric or social element vary from case to case if you have a case of simple theft you may have a far greater influence of the social factor than of the anthropological factor on the other hand if you have a case of murder the anthropological element will have a far greater influence than the social and so on in every case of crime and every individual that you will have to judge on the bench of the criminal the anthropological factor it be precisely here that the genius of cesare lombroso establish a new science because in he search after the cause of crime he study the anthropological condition of the criminal this condition concern not only the organic and anatomical constitution but also the psychological it represent the organic and psychological personality of the criminal every one of we inherit at birth and personify in life a certain organic and psychological combination this constitute the individual factor of human activity which either remain normal through life or become criminal or insane the anthropological factor then must not be restrict as some layman would restrict it to the study of the form of the skull or the bone of the criminal lombroso have to begin he study with the anatomical condition of the criminal because the skull may be study most easily in the museum but he continue by also study the brain and the other physiological condition of the individual the state of sensibility and the circulation of matter and this entire series of study be but a necessary scientific introduction to the study of the psychology of the criminal which be precisely the one problem that be of direct and immediate importance it be this problem which the lawyer and the public prosecutor should solve before discuss the juridical aspect of any crime for this reveal the cause which induce the criminal to commit a crime at present there be no methodical standard for a psychological investigation although such a investigation be introduce into the scope of classic penal law but for this reason the result of the positive school penetrate into the lecture room of the university of jurisprudence whenever a law be require for the judicial arraignment of the criminal as a living and feeling human being and even though the positive school be not mention all profess to be study the material furnish by it for instance its analysis of the sentiment of the criminal he moral sense he behavior before during and after the criminal act the presence of remorse which people judge the criminal after they own feeling always suppose the criminal to feel while in fact it be seldom present this be the anthropological factor which may assume a pathological form in which case article 46 and 47 of the penal code remember that there be such a thing as the personality of the criminal however aside from insanity there be thousand of other organic and psychological condition of the personality of criminal which a judge might perhaps lump together under the name of extenuate circumstance but which science desire to have thoroughly investigate this be not do today and for this reason the idea of extenuate circumstance constitute a denial of justice this same anthropological factor also include that which each one of we have : the race character nowadays the influence of race on the destiny of people and person be much discuss in sociology and there be one-sided school that pretend to solve the problem of history and society by means of that racial influence alone to which they attribute a absolute importance but while there be some who maintain that the history of people be nothing but the exclusive product of racial character there be other who insist that the social condition of people and individual be alone determine the one be as much a one-sided and incomplete theory as the other the study of collective society or of the single individual have result in the understanding that the life of society and of the individual be always the product of the inextricable net of the anthropological telluric and social element hence the influence of the race can not be ignore in the study of nation and personality although it be not the exclusive factor which would suffice to explain the criminality of a nation or a individual study for instance manslaughter in italy and although you will find it difficult to isolate one of the factor of criminality from the network of the other circumstance and condition that produce it yet there be such eloquent instance of the influence of racial character that it would be like deny the existence of daylight if one try to ignore the influence of the ethnical factor on criminality in italy there be two current of criminality two tendency which be almost diametrically oppose to one another the crime due to hot blood and muscle grow in intensity from northern to southern italy while the crime against property increase from south to north in northern italy where movable property be more develop the crime of theft assume a greater intensity while crime due to condition of the blood be decrease on account of the lesser poverty and the result lesser degeneration of the people in the south on the other hand crime against property be less frequent and crime of blood more frequent still there also be in southern italy certain case where criminality of the blood be less frequent and you can not explain this in any other way than by the influence of racial character if you take a geographical map of manslaughter in italy you will see that from the minimum from lombardy piedmont and venice the intensity increase until it reach its maximum in the insular and peninsular extreme of the south but even there you will find certain case in which manslaughter show a lesser intensity for instance the province of benevent be surround by other province which show a maximum of crime due to condition of blood while it register a smaller number naple again show a considerably smaller number of such case than the province surround it but it have a greater number of unpremeditated case of manslaughter messina catanium and syracuse have a remarkably smaller number of blood crime than trapani girgentus and palermo it have be attempt to claim that this difference in criminality be due to social condition 's because the agricultural condition in eastern sicily be less degrading than those of girgentus and trapanus where the sulphur mine compel the miner to live miserably but we should like to ask the follow question in opposition to this idea : why and in what respect be the agricultural condition in some province better than in other this condition be merely itself a result not a cause of the first degree since the theory of historical materialism which i prefer to call economic determinism have demonstrate that political moral and intellectual phenomenon be reaction on the economic condition of any time and place the attempt have be make to interpret this theory very narrowly and to pretend that the economic condition of a nation be a primary cause and not determine by any other for my part ever since i have demonstrate the perfect accord between the marxian and the darwinian theory i have say : very well the economic condition of a nation explain its political moral intellectual condition but the economic condition be in its turn the result of other factor for instance how can the industrialism of england in the nineteenth century be explain take away the coal mine -lrb- the telluric environment -rrb- and you could not have the economic condition of england as they be for the economic condition be a result of favorable or unfavorable telluric condition which be act upon by the intelligence and energy of a certain race catanium messina syracuse be in a better economic condition because they have better geographical condition and a different race -lrb- of grecian blood -rrb- than the other sicilian province so it be in apulium and naple which have likewise a considerable mixture of grecian blood the northern tourist be still attract by we art and visit the ruin of taormina or pesto which be the relic of the grecian race and it be the grecian blood which explain the lesser frequency of bloody crime in those province this be therefore evidently the influence of the race and i maintain that the same fact be due in the province of benevent to the admixture of langobardian blood for the duchy of benevent have have a influx of langobardian element since the seventh century and as we know that the german and anglo-saxon race have the smallest tendency towards bloody crime the beneficial influence of this racial character in benevent explain itself on the other hand there be much saracen blood in the western and southern province of sicily and this explain the greater number of bloody crime there it be evident that the organic character of the inhabitant of that island where you may still see the brutal and barbarian feature of the saracen by the side of those of the blond cool and quiet norman contain a transfusion of the blood of diverse race but it be also true that wherever a certain race have be predominant there its influence be leave behind in the individual and collective life let this be enough so far as the anthropological factor of criminality be concern there be furthermore the telluric factor that be to say the physical environment in which we live and to which we pay no attention it require much philosophy say rousseau to note the thing with which we be in daily contact because the habitual influence of a thing make it more difficult to be aware of it this apply also to the immediate influence of the physical condition on human morality notwithstanding the spiritualist prejudice which still weigh upon we daily life for instance if it be claim in the name of supernaturalism and psychism that a man be unhappy because he be vicious it be equivalent to make a one-sided statement for it be just as true to say that a man become vicious because he be unhappy want be the strongest poison for the human body and soul it be the fountain head of all inhuman and antisocial feeling where want spread out its wing there the sentiment of love of affection of brotherhood be impossible take a look at the figure of the peasant in the far-off arid campagna the little government employee the laborer the little shop-keeper when work be assure when live be certain though poor then want cruel want be in the distance and every good sentiment can germinate and develop in the human heart the family then live in a favorable environment the parent agree the child be affectionate and when the laborer a bronzed statue of humanity return from he smoky shop and meet he white-haired mother the embodiment of half a century of immaculate virtue and heroic sacrifice then he can tired but assure of he daily bread give room to feeling of affection and he will cordially invite he mother to share he frugal meal but let the same man in the same environment be haunt by the spectre of want and lack of employment and you will see the moral atmosphere in he family change as from day into night there be no work and the laborer come home without any wages the wife who do not know how to feed the child reproach she husband with the suffering of he family the man have be turn away from the door of ten office feel he dignity as a honest laborer assail in the very bosom of he own family because he have vainly ask society for honest employment and the bond of affection and union be loosen in that family its member no longer agree there be too many child and when the poor old mother approach she son she read in he dark and agitate mien the lack of tenderness and feel in she mother heart that she boy poison by the spectre of want be perhaps cast evil look at she and harbor the unfilial thought : better a open grave in the cemetery than one mouth more to feed at home it be true that want alone be not sufficient to prepare the soil in the environment of that suffering family for the root of real crime and to develop it want will weaken the love and mutual respect among the member of that family but it will not be strong enough alone to arm the hand of the man for a matricidal deed unless he should get into a pathological mental condition which be very exceptional and rare but the conclusion of the positive school be confirm in this case as in any other in order that crime may develop it be necessary that anthropological social and telluric factor should act together we generally forget the condition of the physical environment in which we live because supernatural prejudice tell we that the body be a beast which we must forget in order to elevate ourselves into a spiritual life manzonus could designate the middle age by the term dirty because they neglect the demand of elementary hygiene and thus of human morality for where the requirement of we physical body be neglect or offend there no flower can bloom the telluric environment have a great influence on we physical activity by way of we nervous system we feel differently disposed accord to whether a south or a north wind blow when garibaldus be on the pampas he observe that he companion be irascible and prone to violent quarrel when the pampero blow and that they behavior change when this wind cease the great founder of criminal statistics quetelet and guerry observe that the change of season carry with it a change in criminality sexual crime be less frequent in winter than in spring and summer and with reference to this point i have maintain and still maintain that it be due to the combined effect of temperature and social condition if crime against property increase in winter for lack of employment the want of food and shelter intensify the misery and lead to attack on property on the other hand the cold by itself reduce sexual crime and personal assault and those who claim that the longer intercourse between people in summer time have also a social influence be also partly in the right the most eloquent fact in this respect be mention by murro when he point out that this change in the frequency of bloody crime greater in the warm month than in winter apply also to prisoner statistics show that breach of discipline be most frequent in hot season the social factor do not enter there because the social life be there the same in winter and in summer this be therefore a practical proof of the influence of climate and it be re-enforce by the fact that delirium and epilepsy in insane asylum be also more frequent in hot than in cold month the influence of the telluric factor then can not be deny and the influence of the social factor intensify it as i have already show by its most drastic and characteristic example that of want one can therefore understand that a man whose morality have be shake by the pressure of increase want may be lead to commit a crime against property or person it be certainly quite evident that economic misery have a undeniable influence on criminality and if you consider that about 300000 criminal be sentence in italy every year 180000 of they for minor crime and 120000 for crime which belong to the gravest class you can easily see that the greater part of they due mainly to social condition for which it should not be so very difficult to find a remedy the work of the legislator may be slow difficult and inadequate so far as the telluric and anthropological factor be concerned but it could surely be rapid efficacious and prompt so far as the social factor influence criminality be concern we have now demonstrate that crime have its natural source in the combined interaction of three class of cause the anthropological -lrb- organic and psychological -rrb- factor the telluric factor and the social factor and by this last factor we must not only mean want but any other condition of administrative instability in political moral and intellectual life every social condition which make the life of man in society insincere and imperfect be a social factor contribute towards criminality the economic factor be in evidence in we civilization wherever the law of free competition which be but a form of disguised cannibalism establish the rule : _ you death be my life _ the competition of laborer for a limited number of place be equivalent to say that those who secure a living do so at the expense of those who do not and this be a disguised form of cannibalism while it do not devour the competitor as primitive mankind do it paralyze he by calumny recommendation protection money which secure the place for the best bargainer and leave the most honest talented and self-respecting to the pang of starvation moreover the economic factor exert its crime-breeding influence also under the form of a superabundance of wealth indeed in we present society which be in the downward stage of transition from glorious bourgeois civilization which constitute a golden page of human history in the 19th century wealth itself be a source of crime for the rich who do not enjoy the advantage of manual or intellectual work suffer from the corruption of leisure and vice gambling throw they into a unhealthy fever the struggle and race for money poison they daily life and although the rich may keep out of reach of the penal code still they have condemn themselves to a life devote to hypocritical ceremony which be devoid of moral sentiment and this life lead they to a sportive form of criminality to cheat at gambling be the inevitable fate of these parasite in order to kill time they give themselves up to game of chance and those who do not care for that devote themselves to the sport of adultery which in that class be a pastime even among the best friend on account of sheer mental poverty and all because man 's mind unoccupied be the devil 's own forge as the english poet say we have now survey briefly the natural genesis of crime as a natural social phenomenon bring about by the interaction of anthropological telluric and social influence which in any determine moment act upon a personality standing on the cross road of vice and virtue crime and honesty this scientific deduction give rise to a series of investigation which satisfy the mind and supply it with a real understanding of thing far better than the theory that a man be a criminal because he want to be no a man commit crime because he find himself in certain physical and social condition from which the evil plant of crime take life and strength thus we obtain the origin of that sad human figure which be the product of the interaction of those factor a abnormal man a man not adapt to the condition of the social environment in which he be bear so that emigration become a ever more permanent phenomenon for the greater portion of man for whom the accident of birth will less and less determine the course of they future life and the abnormal man who be below the minimum of adaptability to social life and bear the mark of organic degeneration develop either a passive or a aggressive form of abnormality and become a criminal among these abnormal human being two group must be particularly distinguish limit we observation to those who be true aggressively antisocial abnormal that be to say who be not adapt to a certain social order and attack it by crime we must distinguish those who for egoistic or ferocious reason attack society by atavistic form of the struggle for existence by commit socalled common crime in the shape of fraud or violence thereby oppose or abolish condition in which they fellow being may live this be the atavistic type of criminal which represent a involutionary or retrogressive form of abnormality due to a arrest development or a atavistic reversion to a savage and primitive type these constitute the majority in the world of criminal and must be distinguish from the minority who be evolutionary or progressive abnormal that may also commit crime in a violent form but must not be confound with the other because they do not act from egoistic motive but rebel from altruistic motive against the injustice of the present order these altruistic criminal feel the suffering and horror due to the injustice surround they and may go so far as to commit murder which must always be condemn but which must not be confound with atavistic or egoistic murder recourse to personal violence be always objectionable from the point of view of higher manhood which desire that human life should always be hold in respect but the reason for such a crime be different be egoistic in the one and altruistic in the other case the evolutionary abnormal be often a instrument of human progress not in the form of criminality but in that of intellectual and moral rebellion against condition which be sanction by law that frequently punish such a evolutionary rebellion harder than atavistic crime as they do in russium where capital punishment have be abolish for common crime but retain for political violation of the law we be live in a epoch of transition from the old to the new and contemporaneous humanity have a uneasy moral conscience in this critical time the ruling class be lose they clearness of vision so that they promise monument to those political murderer who promote they own historical victory but would condemn like any common criminal he who now devote he soul to a revolutionary ideal would throw into prison the pioneer of new human ideal just as russium be excommunicate the rebel tolstous i mention leo tolstous advisedly for the purpose of give a precise illustration of my heterodox thought in reference to this question we be oppose to any form of personal violence -lrb- with the sole exception of self-defense -rrb- we can not approve of any form of personal assault no matter what may be its motive therefore we can not have word of praise or excuse for political murder though it may be inspire by altruistic motive we can demand that the legislator should distinguish between the psychological source of these two form of murder the egoistic and the altruistic form but we condemn they both because they be inhuman form of violence idea do not make victorious headway by force of arm idea must be combat by idea and it be only by the propaganda of the idea that we can prepare humanity for its future violence be always a means of prevent the sincere and fruitful diffusion of a idea we do not say this merely for the abnormal of the lower class we refer with scientific serenity also to the upper class who would suppress by violence every manifestation of revolt against the social iniquity every affirmation of faith in a better future this be the conception of we science which thus succeed in distinguish trait of character even among the unlucky and forlorn people of the criminal world while the classic school of criminology regard a criminal as a sort of abstract and normal man with the exception of case of minor deaf mute inebriate and maniac in fact the classic school of criminology regard all thief as the thief all murderer as the murderer and the human shape disappear in the mind of the legislator while it re-appear before the judge before the essayist and legislator the criminal be a sort of move dummy on whose hack the judge may paste a article of the penal code if you leave out of consideration the established case of exceptional and rare human psychology mention in the penal code all other case serve the judge merely as a excuse to select from the criminal code the number of that article which will fit the criminal dummy and if he should paste 404 instead of 407 on its back the court of appeal would resist any change of number and if this dummy come to life and say : the question of my number may be very important for you but if you would study all the condition that compel I to take other people 's thing you would realize that this importance be very diagrammatic the judge would answer : that be all right for the justice of the future but it be not now you be number 404 of the criminal code and after leave this court room with this number paste legally on you back you will receive another number for you will enter prison as number 404 and will exchange it for entry number 1525 or some other because you personality as a man disappear entirely before the enactment of social justice and then it be pretend that this man whose personality be thus absurdly ignore should leave prison cure of all degeneration and if he fall back into the path of thorn of he misery and commit another crime the judge simply paste another article over the other by add number 80 or 81 which refer to case of relapse to number 404 in this way the classic school of criminology come to its unit of punishment which it herald as its great progress in the middle age the diversity of punishment be greater but in the 19th century the classic school of criminology combat dishonoring punishment corporeal punishment confiscation professional punishment capital punishment with its ideal of one sole penalty the only panacea for crime and criminal _ prison _ we have indeed prohibitory measure and fine even today but in substance the whole punitive armory be reduce to imprisonment since fine be likewise convertible into so many day or month of imprisonment solitary confinement be the ideal of the classic school of criminology but experience prove that this penalty have as much effect on the disease of criminality as the remedy of a physician would have who would sit in the door of a hospital and tell every patient seek relief : whatever may be you disease i have only one medicine and that be a decoction of rhubarb you have heart trouble well then the problem for I be simply -- how big a dose of rhubarb decoction shall i give you and measure dose of penalty be the foundation of the criminal code that be so true that this code be in its last analysis but a table of criminal logarithm for figure out penalty woe to the judge who make a mistake in sentence a 19 year old offender who be drunk when he sin but have premeditate he deed woe to the judge if he miss he calculation in add or subtract the third or sixth or one half correspond to the prescribe extenuating or aggravating circumstance if he make a miscalculation the court of appeal be invoke by the defendant and the inexorable court of appeal tell the judge : figure this over again you have be unjust the only question for the judge be this : add you sum and subtract you deduction and the prisoner be sentence to one year seven month and thirteen day not one day more or less but the human spectator ask : if the criminal should happen to be reform before the expiration of he term should he be retain in prison the judge reply : i do not care he stay in one year seven month and thirteen day then the human spectator say : but suppose the criminal should not yet be fit for human society at the expiration of he term the judge reply : at the expiration of he term he leave prison for when he have absolve he last day he have pay he debt this be the same case as that of the imaginary physician who say : you have heart trouble then take a quart of rhubarb decoction and stay twelve day in the hospital another patient say : i have break my leg and the doctor : all right take a pint of rhubarb decoction and 17 day in the hospital a third have inflammation of the lung and the doctor prescribe three quart of rhubarb decoction and three month in the hospital but if my inflammation be cure before that time no matter say the doctor you stay in three month but if i be not cure of my lung trouble after three month no matter say the doctor you leave after three month to such result have wise man be lead by a system of penal justice which be a denial of all elementary common sense they have forget the personality of the criminal and occupied themselves exclusively with crime as a abstract juristic phenomenon in the same manner the old style medicine occupy itself with disease as such as a abstract pathological phenomenon without take into account the personality of the patient the ancient physician do not consider whether a patient be well or ill nourished young or old strong or weak nervous or fullblooded they cure fever as fever pleurisy as pleurisy modern medicine on the other hand declare that disease must be study in the live person of the patient and the same disease may require different treatment if the condition of the patient be different criminal justice have take the same historical course of development as medicine the classic school of criminology be still in the same stage in which medicine be before the middle of the 19th century it deal with theft murder fraud as such but that which claim so much of the attention of society have be forget by the classic school for that school have forget to study the murderer the thief the forger and without that study they crime can not be understand crime be one of the condition require for the study of the criminal but the same crime may require the application of different remedy to the personality of different criminal accord to the different anthropological and social condition of the various criminal there be a fundamental distinction between the anthropological and social type of criminal whom i have divide into five category which be today unanimously accept by criminalist anthropologist since the geneva congress offer a opportunity to explain the misapprehension which lead some foreign scientist to believe that the italian school regard one of these type -lrb- the bear criminal -rrb- merely as a organic anomaly just a word concern each one of these five type the _ bear criminal _ be a victim of that which i will call -lrb- see that science have not yet solve this problem -rrb- criminal neurosis which be very analogous to epileptic neurosis but which be not in itself sufficient to make one a criminal we adversary have the idea that the mere possession of a crooked nose or a slanting skull stamp a man as predispose by birth to murder or theft but a man may he a bear criminal that be to say he may have some congenital degeneration which predispose he toward crime and yet he may die at the age of 80 without have commit any crime because he be fortunate enough to live in a environment which do not offer he any temptation to commit crime again be not many predispose toward insanity without ever become insane if the same individual be to live under unfavorable condition without any education if he be to find himself in unhealthy telluric surroundings in a mine a rice field or a miasmatic swamp he would become insane but if instead of live in condition that condemn he to lunacy he be to be under no necessity to struggle for he daily bread if he could live in affluence he might exhibit some eccentricity of character but would not cross the threshold of a insane asylum the same happen in the case of criminality one may have a congenital predisposition toward crime but if he live in favorable surroundings he will live to the end of he natural life without violate any criminal or moral law at any rate we must drop the prejudice that only those be criminal on whose back the judge have paste a number for there be many scoundrel at large who commit crime with impunity or who brush the edge of the criminal law in the most repulsive immorality without violate it this misunderstanding be explain at the congress of geneva by the statement that the interaction of the social and telluric environment be require also in the case of the bear criminal and now we may take it for grant that my classification of five type be everywhere accept these be the following : the _ bear criminal _ who have a congenital predisposition for crime the _ insane criminal _ suffering from some clinical form of mental alienation and whom even we exist penal code have to recognize the _ habitual criminal _ that be to say one who have acquire the habit of crime mainly through the ineffective measure employ by society for the prevention and repression of crime a common figure in we large industrial center be that of the abandon child which have to go beg from its earliest youth in order to collect a income for the enterprising boss or for its poor family without a opportunity to educate its moral sense in the filth of the street it be punish for the first time by the law and send to prison or to a reformatory where it be inevitably corrupt then when such a individual come out of prison he be stigmatize as a thief or forger watch by the police and if he secure work in some shop the owner be indirectly induce to discharge he so that he must inevitably fall back upon crime thus one acquire crime as a habit a product of social rottenness due to the ineffective measure for the prevention and repression of crime there be furthermore the _ occasional criminal _ who commit very insignificant criminal act more because he be lead astray by he condition of life than because the aggressive energy of a degenerate personality impel he if he be not make worse by a prison life he may find a opportunity to return to a normal life in society finally there be the _ passionate criminal _ who like the insane criminal have receive attention from the positive school of criminology which however do not come to any definite conclusion regard he such as may be gather by means of the experimental method through study in prison insane asylum or in freedom the relation between passion and crime have so far be study on a field in which no solution be possible for the classic school consider such a crime accord to the greater or smaller intensity and violence of passion and come to the conclusion that the degree of responsibility decrease to the extent that the intensity of a passion increase and vice versa the problem can not be solve in this way there be passion which may rise to the highest degree of intensity without reduce the responsibility for instance be one who murder from motive of revenge a passionate criminal who must be excuse the classic school of criminology say no and for my part i agree with they francesco carrara say : there be blind passion and other which be reasonable blind passion deprive one of free will reasonable one do not blind and excusable passion be fear honor love reasonable and inexcusable one be hatred and revenge but how so i have study murderer who kill for revenge and who tell I that the desire for revenge take hold of they like a fever so that they forget even to eat hate and revenge can take possession of a man to such a extent that he become blind with passion the truth be that passion must be consider not so far as its violence or quantity be concerned but rather as to its quality we must distinguish between social and anti-social passion the one favor the condition of life for the species and collectivity the other antagonistic to the development of the collectivity in the first case we have love injured honor etc which be passion normally useful to society and aberration of which may be excuse more or less accord to individual case on the other hand we have inexcusable passion because they psychological tendency be to antagonize the development of society they be antisocial and can not be excuse and hate and revenge be among they the positive school therefore admit that a passion be excusable when the moral sense of a man be normal when he past record be clear and when he crime be due to a social passion which make it excusable we shall see tomorrow what remedy the positive school of criminology propose for each one of these category of criminal in distinction from the measuring of dose of imprisonment advocate by the classic school we have thus exhaust in a short and general review the subject of the natural origin of criminality -- to sum up crime be a social phenomenon due to the interaction of anthropological telluric and social factor this law bring about what i have call criminal saturation which mean that every society have the criminality which it deserve and which produce by means of its geographical and social condition such quantity and quality of crime as correspond to the development of each collective human group thus the old saying of imetelet be confirm : there be a annual balance of crime which must be pay and settle with greater regularity than the account of the national revenue however we positivist give to this statement a less fatalistic interpretation since we have demonstrate that crime be not we immutable destiny even though it be a vain beginning to attempt to attenuate or eliminate crime by mere scheme the truth be that the balance of crime be determine by the physical and social environment but by change the condition of the social environment which be most easily modify the legislator may alter the influence of the telluric environment and the organic and psychic condition of the population control the greater portion of crime and reduce they considerably it be we firm conviction that a truly civilized legislator can attenuate the plague of criminality not so much by means of the criminal code as by means of remedy which be latent in the remainder of the social life and of legislation and the experience of the most advanced country confirm this by the beneficent and preventive influence of criminal legislation rest on efficacious social reform we arrive then at this scientific conclusion : in the society of the future the necessity for penal justice will be reduce to the extent that social justice grow intensively and extensively iii in the precede two lecture i have give you a short review of the new current in scientific thought which study the painful and dangerous phenomenon of criminality we must now draw the logical conclusion in theory and practice from the teaching of experiment science for the removal of the gangrenous plague of crime under the influence of the positive method of research the old formulum science for science 's sake have give place to the new formulum science for life 's sake for it would be useless for the human mind to retreat into the vault of philosophical concentration if this intellectual mastery do not produce as a counter-effect a beneficent wave of real improvement in the destiny of the human race what then have the civilized world to offer in the way of remedy against criminality the classic school of criminology be unable to locate in the course of its scientific and historical mission the natural cause of crime as i have show in the precede lecture be not in a position to deal in a comprehensive and far-seeing manner with this problem of the remedy against criminality some of the classic criminologist such as bentham romagnosus or ellero with a more positive bent of mind than other may have give a little of they scientific activity to the analysis of this problem namely the prevention of crime but ellero himself have to admit that the classic school of criminology have write volume concern the death penalty and torture but have produce but a few page on the prevention of criminality the historical mission of that school consist in a reduction of punishment for be bear on the eve of the french revolution in the name of individualism and natural rights it be a protest against the barbarian penalty of the middle age and thus the practical and glorious result of the classic school be a propaganda for the abolition of the most brutal penalty of the middle age such as the death penalty torture mutilation we in we turn now follow up the practical and scientific mission of the classic school of criminology with a still more noble and fruitful mission by add to the problem of the _ diminution of penalty _ the problem of the _ diminution of crime _ it be worth more to humanity to reduce the number of crime than to reduce the dread suffering of criminal punishment although even this be a noble work after the evil plant of crime have be permit to grow in the realm of life take for instance the philanthropic awakening due to the congress of geneva in the matter of the red cross society for the care treatment and cure of the wound in war however noble and praiseworthy this mission may be it would be far nobler and better to prevent war than to heal the mutilate and wound if the same zeal and persistence which have be expend in the work of the red cross society have be devote to the realization of international brotherhood the weary road of human progress would show far better result it be a noble mission to oppose the ferocious penalty of the middle age but it be still nobler to forestall crime the classic school of criminology direct its attention merely to penalty to repressive measure after crime have be commit with all its terrible moral and material consequence for in the classic school the remedy against criminality have not the social aim of improve human life but merely the illusory mission of retributive justice meet a moral delinquency by a corresponding punishment in the shape of legal sentence this be the spirit which be still pervade criminal legislation although there be a sort of eclectic compromise between the old and the new the classic school of criminology have substitute for the old absolutist conception of justice the eclectic theory that absolute justice have the right to punish but a right modify by the interest of civilized life in present society this be the point discuss in italy in the celebrated controversy between pasquale stanislao mancinus and terencio mamianus in 1847 this be in substance the theory follow by the classic criminologist who revise the penal code which public opinion consider incapable of protect society against the danger of crime and we have but to look about we in the reality of contemporaneous life in order to see that the criminal code be far from be a remedy against crime that it remedy nothing because either premeditation or passion in the person of the criminal deprive the criminal law of all prohibitory power the deceptive faith in the efficacy of criminal law still live in the public mind because every normal man feel that the thought of imprisonment would stand in he way if he contemplate tomorrow commit a theft a rape or a murder he feel the bridle of the social sense and the criminal code lend more strength to it and hold he back from criminal action but even if the criminal code do not exist he would not commit a crime so long as he physical and social environment would not urge he in that direction the criminal code serve only to isolate temporarily from social intercourse those who be not consider worthy of it and this punishment prevent the criminal for a while from repeat he criminal deed but it be evident that the punishment be not impose until after the deed have be do it be a remedy direct against effect but it do not touch the cause the root of the evil we may say that in social life penalty have the same relation to crime that medicine have to disease after a disease have develop in a organism we have recourse to a physician but he can not do anything else but to reach the effect in some single individual on the other hand if the individual and the collectivity have obey the rule of preventive hygiene the disease would have be avoid 90 time in 100 and would have appear only in extreme and exceptional case where a wound or a organic condition break through the law of health lack of providence on the part of man which be due to insufficient expression of the force of the intellect and pervade so large a part of human life be certainly to blame for the fact that mankind choose to use belated remedy rather than to observe the law of health which demand a greater methodical control of one 's action and more foresight because the remedy must be apply before the disease become apparent i say occasionally that human society act in the matter of criminality with the same lack of forethought that most people do in the matter of tooth-ache how many individual do not suffer from tooth-ache especially in the great city and yet any one convinced of the miraculous power of hygiene could easily clean he tooth every day and prevent the microbe of tooth rot from thrive thereby save he tooth from harm and pain but it be tedious to do this every day it imply a control of one 's self it can not be do without the scientific conviction that induce man to acquire this habit most people say : oh well if that tooth rot i 'll bear the pain but when the night come in which they can not sleep for toothache they will swear at themselves for not have take precaution and will run to the dentist who in most case can not help they any more the legislator should apply the rule of social hygiene in order to reach the root of criminality but this would require that he should bring he mind and will to bear daily on a legislative reform of individual and social life in the field of economics and moral as well as in that of administration politics and intelligence instead of that the legislator permit the microbe of criminality to develop they pathogenic power in society when crime become manifest the legislator know no other remedy but imprisonment in order to punish a evil which he should have prevent unfortunately this scientific conviction be not yet root and potent in the mind of the legislator of most of the civilized country because they represent on a average the backward scientific conviction of one or two previous generation the legislator who sit in parliament today be the university student of 30 year ago with a few very rare exception he be supply only with knowledge of outgrow scientific research it be a historical law that the work of the legislator be always behind the science of he time but nevertheless the scientist have the urgent duty to spread the conviction that hygiene be worth as much on the field of civilization as it be in medicine for the public health this be the fundamental conviction at which the positive school arrive : that which have happen in medicine will happen in criminology the great value of practical hygiene especially of social hygiene which be greater than that of individual hygiene have be recognize after the marvelous scientific discovery concern the origin and primitive cause of the most dangerous disease so long as pasteur and he disciple have not give to the world they discovery of the pathogenic microbe of all infectious disease such as typhoid fever cholera diphtheria tuberculosis etc more or less absurd remedy be demand of the science of medicine i remember for instance that i be compel in my youth during a epidemic of cholera to stay in a closed room in which fumigation be carry on with substance irritate the bronchial tube and lung without kill the cholera microbe as be prove later on it be not until the real cause of those infectious disease be discover that efficient remedy could be employ against they a aqueduct give to a center of population like naple be a better protection against cholera than drug even after the disease have take root in the midst of the people of naple this be the modern lesson which we wish to teach in the field of criminology a field which will always retain its repressive function as a exceptional and ultimate refuge because we do not believe that we shall succeed in eliminate all form of criminality hence if a crime manifest itself repression may be employ as one of the remedy of criminology but it should be the very last not the exclusively dominate one as it be today it be this blind worship of punishment which be to blame for the spectacle which we witness in every modern country the spectacle that the legislator neglect the rule of social hygiene and wake up with a start when some form of crime become acute and that they know of no better remedy than a intensification of punishment meet out by the penal code if one year of imprisonment be not enough we 'll make it ten year and if a aggravation of the ordinary penalty be not enough we 'll pass a law of exception it be always the blind trust in punishment which remain the only remedy of the public conscience and which always work to the detriment of morality and material welfare because it do not save the society of honest people and strike without cure those who have fall a prey to guilt and crime the positive school of criminology then aside from the greater value attribute to daily and systematic measure of social hygiene for the prevention of criminality come to radically different conclusion also in the matter of repressive justice the classic school have for a cardinal remedy against crime a preference for one kind of punishment namely imprisonment and give fix and prescribe dose of this remedy it be the logical conclusion of retributive justice that it travel by way of a illusory purification from moral guilt to the legal responsibility of the criminal and thence on to a corresponding dose of punishment which have be previously prescribe and fix we on the other hand hold that even the survive form of repression which will be inevitable in spite of the application of the rule of social prevention should be widely different on account of the different conception which we have of crime and of penal justice in the majority of case compose of minor crime commit by people belong to the most numerous and least dangerous class of occasional or passionate criminal the only form of civil repression will be _ the compensation of the victim for he loss _ accord to we this should he the only form of penalty impose in the majority of minor crime commit by people who be not dangerous in the present practice of justice the compensation of the victim for he loss have become a laughing stock because this victim be systematically forget the whole attention of the classic school have be concentrate on the juridical entity of the crime the victim of the crime have be forget although this victim deserve philanthropic sympathy more than the criminal who have do the harm it be true every judge add to the sentence the formulum that the criminal be responsible for the injury and the cost to another authority but the process of law put off this compensation to a indefinite time and if the victim succeed a few year after the passing of the sentence in get any action on the matter the criminal have in the meantime have a thousand legal subterfuge to get away with he spoil and thus the law itself become the breeding ground of personal revenge for filangierus say aptly that a innocent man grasp the dagger of the murderer when the sword of justice do not defend he let we say at this point that the rigid application of compensation for damages should never be displace by imprisonment because this would be equivalent to sanction a real class distinction for the rich can laugh at damages while the proletarian would have to make good a sentence of 1000 lira by 100 day in prison and in the meantime the innocent family that tearfully wait for he outside would be plunge into desperate strait compensation for damages should never take place in any other way than by means of the labor of the prisoner to a extent satisfactory to the family of the injure it have be attempt to place this in a eclectic way on we law book but this proposition remain a dead letter and be not apply in italy because a stroke of legislator 's pen be not enough to change the fate of a entire nation these practical and efficient measure would be take in the case of lesser criminal for the graver crime commit by atavistic or congenital criminal of by person incline toward crime from acquire habit or mental alienation the positive school of criminology reserve segregation for a indefinite time for it be absurd to fix the time beforehand in the case of a dangerous degenerate who have commit a grave crime the question of indeterminate sentence have be recently discuss also by pessina who combat it of course because the essence of the classic school of criminology be retribution for a fault by means of corresponding punishment we might reply that no human judge can use any other but the grossest scale by which to determine whether you be responsible to the extent of the whole one half or one third and since there be no absolute or objective criterion by which the ratio of crime to punishment can be determine penal justice become a game of chance but we content ourselves by point out that segregation for a indefinite time have so much truth in it that even the most orthodox of the classic school admit it for instance in the case of criminal under age now if a indeterminate sentence be a violation of the principle of the classic school i can not understand why it can be admit in the case of minor but not in the case of adult this be evidently a expedient impose by the exigency of practical life and only the positive school of criminology can meet they by a logical systematization for the rest indefinite segregation such as we propose for the most dangerous atavistic criminal be a measure which be already in use for ordinary lunatic as well we for criminal lunatic but it may be say that this be a administrative measure not a court sentence well if any one be so fond of formula as to make this objection he may get all the fun out of they that he like but it be a fact that a insane person who have commit a crime be send to a building with iron bar on its gate such as a prison have you may call it a administrative building or a penal institute the name be unessential for the substance alone count we maintain that congenital or pathological criminal can not be lock up for a definite term in any institution but should remain there until they be adapt for the normal life of society this radical reform of principle carry with it a radical transformation of detail give a indeterminate segregation there should be organ of guardianship for person so secluded for instance permanent committee for the periodical revision of sentence in the future the criminal judge will always secure ample evidence to prove whether a defendant be really guilty for this be the fundamental point if it be certain that he have commit the crime he should either be exclude from social intercourse or sentence to mate good the damage provide the criminal be not dangerous and the crime not grave it be absurd to sentence a man to five or six day imprisonment for some insignificant misdemeanor you lower he in the eye of the public subject he to surveillance by the police and send he to prison from whence he will go out more corrupted than he be on enter it it be absurd to impose segregation in prison for small error compensation for injury be enough for the segregation of the graver criminal the management must be as scientific as it be now in insane asylum it be absurd to place a old pensioned soldier or a hardened bureaucrat at the head of a penal institution it be enough to visit one of those compulsory human beehive and to see how a military discipline carry a brutal hypocrisy into it the management of such institution must be scientific and the care of they inmate must be scientific since a grave crime be always a manifestation of the pathological condition of the individual in america there be already institution such as the elmira reformatory where the application of the method of the positive school of criminology have be solemnly promise the director of the institution be a psychologist a physician when a criminal under age be bring in he be study from the point of view of physiology and psychology the treatment serve to regenerate the plant who be young may still be straighten up scientific therapeutics can do little for relapsed criminal the present repression of crime rob the prisoner of he personality and reduce he to a number either in mass imprisonment which corrupt he completely or in solitary confinement which will turn he into a stupid or raving beast these method be also gradually introduce in the insane asylum i must tell you a little story to illustrate this when i be a professor in pisa eight year ago i take my student to the penitentiary and the asylum for the criminal insane in montelupo as i always use to do dr algieri the director of this asylum show we among other a very interesting case this be a man of about 45 whose history be shortly the following : he be a bricklayer living in one of the city of toscana he have be a normal and honest man a very good father until one unlucky day come in which a brick fall from a factory break a part of he skull he fall down unconscious be pick up carry to the hospital and cure of he external injury but lose both he physical and moral health he become a epileptic and the lesion to which the loss of the normal function of he nervous system be due transform he from the docile and even-tempered man that he have be into a quarrelsome and irritable individual so that he be less regular in he work less moral and honest in he family life and be finally sentence for a grave assault in a saloon brawl he be condemn as a common criminal to i do not know how many year of imprisonment but in prison the exceptional condition of seclusion bring on a deterioration of he physical and moral health he epileptic fit become more frequent he character grow worse the director of the prison send he to the asylum for the insane criminal at montelupo which shelter criminal suspect of insanity and insane criminal dr algierus study the interesting case and come to the diagnosis that there be splinter of bone in the man 's brain which have not be notice in the treatment at the hospital and that this be the cause of the epilepsy and demoralization of the prisoner he trepan a portion of the skull around the old wound and actually find a bone splinter lodge in the man 's brain he remove the splinter and put a platinum plate over the trepan place to protect the brain the man improve the epileptic fit cease he moral condition become as normal as before and this bricklayer -lrb- how about the free will -rrb- be dismiss from the asylum for he have give proof of normal behavior for about five or six month thanks to the wisdom of the doctor who have relieve he of the lesion which have make he epileptic and immoral if this asylum for insane criminal have not be in existence he would have end in a padded cell the same as another man whom i and my student see a few year ago in the ancona penitentiary the director a old soldier say to I : professor i shall show you a type of human beast he be a man who pass four fifth of the year in a padded cell after call six attendant because we must be careful we go to the cell and i say to that director : please leave this man to I i have little faith in the existence of human beast keep the attendant at a distance no reply the director my responsibility do not permit I to do that but i insist the cell be open and the man come out of it really like a wild beast with bulge eye and distorted face but i meet he with a smile and say to he kindly : how be you this change of treatment immediately change the attitude of the man he first have a nervous fit and then break into tear and tell I he story with the eloquence of suffer he say that he have some day in which he be not master of himself but he recognize that he be good whenever the attack of temper be over without say so he thus invoke the wisdom of human psychology for better treatment there be indeed a physician in those prison but he treat generally only the ordinary disease and be not familiar with special psychological knowledge there may be exception and in that case it be a lucky coincidence but the prison doctor have also he practice outside and hurry through he prison work they simulate sickness in order to get out of prison he say and this will be so all the more that the physician of we time have not sufficient training in psychology to enable they to do justice to the psychology of the criminal you must therefore give a scientific management to these institution and you will then render humane even the treatment of those grave and dangerous criminal whose condition can not be meet by a simple compensation of the injury they have do to other this be the function of repression as we look upon it a inevitable result of the positive datum regard the natural origin of crime we believe in other word that repression will play but a unimportant role in the future we believe that every branch of legislation will come to prefer the remedy of social hygiene to those symptomatic remedy and apply they from day to day and thus we come to the theory of the prevention of crime some say : it be better to repress than to prevent other say : it be better to prevent than to repress in order to solve this conflict we must remember that there be two widely different kind of repression there be the immediate direct empirical repression which do not investigate the cause of criminality but wait until the crime be about to be commit that be police prevention there be on the other hand a social prevention which have a indirect and more remote function which do not wait until crime be about to be commit but locate the cause of crime in poverty abandon child trampdom etc and seek to prevent these condition by remote and indirect means in italy prevention be anonymous with arrest that be to say by repression be understand only police repression under these circumstance it be well to take it for grant that some of the expect crime will be carry out for crime be not commit at fix period after first inform the police the damage do by criminality and especially by political and social criminality against which police repression be particularly direct will be smaller than that do by the abuse inseparably connect with police power in the case of atavistic criminality prevention do not mean handcuffing of the man who be about to commit a crime but devise such economic and educational measure in the family and administration as will eliminate the cause of crime or attenuate they precisely because punishment be less effective than prevention in other word in order to prevent crime we must have recourse to measure which i have call substitute for punishment and which prevent the development of crime because they go to the source in order to do away with effect bentham narrate that the postal service in england in the 18th century be in the hand of stage driver but this service be not connect with the carrying of passenger as become the custom later and then it be impossible to get the driver to arrive on time because they stop too often at the inn fine be impose imprisonment be resort to yet the driver arrive late the penalty do not accomplish any result so long as the cause remain then the idea be conceive to carry passenger on the postal stage and that stop the driver from be late because whenever they make a halt the passenger who have a interest in arrive on time call the driver and do not give they much time to linger this be a illustration of a substitute for punishment another illustration in the middle age up to the eve of we modern civilization piracy be in vogue be there anything that be not try to suppress piracy the pirate be persecute like wild beast whenever they be catch they be condemn to the most terrible form of death yet piracy continue then come the application of steam navigation and piracy disappear as by magic and robbery and brigandage they withstand the death penalty and extraordinary raid by soldier and we witness today the spectacle of a not very serious contest between the police who want to catch a brigand musolino and a brigand who do not wish to be catch wherever the wood be not traverse by railroad or tramway brigandage carry on its criminal trade but wherever railroad and tramway exist brigandage be a form of crime which disappear you may insist on death penalty and imprisonment but assault and robbery will continue because it be connect with geographical condition use on the other hand the instrument of civilization without sentence any one and brigandage and robbery will disappear before its light and if human being in large industrial center be herd together in tenement and slum hotel how can a humane judge aggravate the penalty against sexual crime how can the sense of shame develop among people when young and old of both sex be crowd together in the same bed in the same corrupted and corrupting environment which rob the human soul of every noble spark i might stray pretty far if i be to continue these illustration of social hygiene which will be the true solution of the problem and the supreme systematic daily humane and bloodless remedy against the disease of criminality however we have not the simple faith that in the near or far future of humanity crime can ever be wholly eradicate even socialism which look forward to a fundamental transformation of future society on the basis of brotherhood and social justice can not elevate itself to the absolute and naive faith that criminality insanity and suicide can ever fully disappear from the earth but it be we firm conviction that the endemic form of criminality insanity and suicide will disappear and that nothing will remain of they but rare sporadic form cause by lesion or telluric and other influence since we have make the great discovery that malaria which weigh upon so many part in italy be dependent for its transmission on a certain mosquito we have acquire the control of malarial therapeutics and be enable to protect individual and family effectively against malaria but aside from this function of protect people there must be a social prevention and since those malarial insect can live only in swampy district it be necessary to bring to those unreclaimed land the blessing of the hoe and plow in order to remove the cause and do away with the effect the same problem confront we in criminology in the society of the future we shall undertake this work of social hygiene and thereby we shall remove the epidemic form of criminality and nine-tenth of the crime will then disappear so that nothing will remain of they but exceptional case there will remain for instance such case as that of the bricklayer which i mention because there may always be accident no matter what may be the form of social organization and nervous disorder may thus appear in certain individual but you can see that these would be exceptional case of criminality which will be easily cure under the direction of science that will be the supreme and beneficent manager of institute for the segregation of those who will be unfit for social intercourse the problem of criminality will thus be solve as far as possible because the gradual transformation of society will eliminate the swamp in which the miasma of crime may form and breed if we wish to apply these standard to a example which today attract the attention of all italy to this noble city if we desire to carry we theory into the practice of contemporaneous life if science be to respond to the call of life let we throw a glance at that form of endemic criminality know as the camorra in this city which have take root here just as stab affray have in certain center of turin and the mafia in certain center of sicily in the first place we must not be wilfully blind to fact and refuse to see that the citizen will protect themselves if social justice do not do so and from that to crime there be but a shot step but which be the swampy soil in which this social disease can spread and persist like leprosy in tin collective organism it be the economic poverty of the mass which lend to intellectual and moral poverty you have lately have in naple a very fortunate struggle which seem to have overcome one of the representative of the high camorra but can we believe that the courageous work of a few public writer have touch the root of the camorra in this city it would be self-deception to think so for we see that plant blossom out again even after the most destructive hurricane have pass over they the healing of society be not so easy that a collective plague may be cure by the courageous act of one or more individual the process be much slower and more complicated nevertheless these episode be milestone of victory in the onward march of civilization which will paralyze the historical manifestation of social criminality here then we have a city in which some hundred thousand people rise every morning and do not know how to get a living who have no fixed occupation because there be not enough industrial development to reach that methodical application of labor which lift humanity out of the prehistoric forest truly the human race progress by two uplifting energy : war and labor in primitive and savage society when the human personality do not know the check of social discipline a military discipline hold the member of the tribe together but war while useful in primitive society lose its usefulness more and more because it carry within itself the cancer that paralyze it while war compel collective group to submit to the co-ordinating discipline of human activity it also decrease the respect for human life the soldier who kill he fellow man of a neighboring nation by a stroke of he sword will easily lose the respect for the life of member of he own social group then the second educational energy interfere the energy of labor which make itself feel at the decisive moment of prehistoric development when the human race pass from a pastoral hunting and nomadic life into a agriculture and settle life this be the historic stage in which the collective ownership of land and instrument of production be displace by communal property family property and finally individual property during these stage humanity pass from individual and isolate labor in collective associate co-ordinate labor the remains of the neolithic epoch show we the progress of the first workshop in which we ancestor gather and fashion they primitive tool and arm they give we a idea of associate and common labor which then become the great uplifting energy because unlike war it do not carry within itself a disdain or violation of the rights of other labor be the sole perennial energy of mankind which lead to social perfection but if you have 100000 person in a city like naple who do not enjoy the certainty and discipline of employment at methodical and common labor you need not wonder that the uncertainty of daily life a illfed stomach and a anemic brain result in the atrophy of all moral sentiment and that the evil plant of the camorra spread out over everything the process in the law court may attract the fleeting attention of public opinion of legislation of government to the disease from which this portion of the social organism be suffer but mere repression will not accomplish anything last the teaching of science tell we plainly that in such a case of endemic criminality social remedy must be apply to social evil unless the remedy of social reform accompany the development and protection of labor unless justice be assure to every member of the collectivity the courage of this or that citizen be spend in vain and the evil plant will continue to thrive in the jungle teach by the masterly and inflexible logic of fact we come to the adoption of the scientific method in criminal research and conclude that a simple and uniform remedy like punishment be not adequate to cure such a natural and social phenomenon as crime which have its own natural and social cause the measure for the preservation of society against criminality must be manifold complex and vary and must be the outcome of persevere and systematic work on the part of legislator and citizen on the solid foundation of a systematic collective economy let I take leave of you with this practical conclusion and give my heart freedom to send to my brain a wave of fervent blood which shall express my enduring gratitude for the reception which you have give I old in year but young in spirit and energetic aspiration to every high ideal i tender you my sincere thanks as a man and a citizen i thank you because these three lecture have be for I a fountain of youth of faith of enthusiasm thanks to they i return to the other field of my daily occupation with a greater faith in the future of my country and of humanity to you young italy i address these word of thanks glad and honor if my word have arouse in you soul one breath which will make you stronger and more confident in the future of civilization and social justice end of project gutenberg 's the positive school of criminology by enrico ferrus
