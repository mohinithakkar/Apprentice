fertile province of indium none can i think much excel that of behar for richness of soil diversity of race beauty of scenery and the energy and intelligence of its inhabitant stretch from the nepaul hill to the far distant plain of gya with the gunduch bogmuttee and other noble stream water its rich bosom and swell with they tribute the stately gange it include every variety of soil and climate and its various race with they strange costume creed and custom might afford material to fill volume the northern part of this splendid province follow the nepaulese boundary from the district of goruchpore on the north to that of purneah on the south in the forest and jungle along this boundary line live many strange tribe whose custom and even they name and language be all but unknown to the english public strange wild animal dispute with these aborigine the possession of the gloomy jungle solitude great tree of wondrous dimension and strange foliage rear they stately head to heaven and be mat and entwine together by creeper of huge size and tenacious hold to the south and east vast billow of golden grain roll in successive undulation to the mighty gange the sacred stream of the hindoo innumerable village nestle amid grove of plantain and feathery rustling bamboo send up they wreath of pale gray smoke into the still warm air at frequent interval the steely blue of some lovely lake where thousand of water-fowl disport themselves reflect from its polished surface the sheen of the noonday sun great mass of mango wood shew a sombre outline at interval and here and there the tower chimney of a indigo factory pierce the sky government road and embankment intersect the face of the country in all direction and vast sheet of the indigo plant refresh the eye with they plain of live green form a grateful contrast to the hard dry sun-baked surface of the stubble field where the rice crop have rustle in the breeze of the past season in one of the loveliest and most fertile district of this vast province namely chumparun i begin my experience as a indigo planter chumparun with its subdistrict of bettiah lie to the north of tirhoot and be bound all along its northern extent by the nepaul hill and forest when i join my appointment as assistant on one of the large indigo concern there there be not more than about thirty european resident altogether in the district the chief town mooteeharree consist of a long _ bazaar _ or market street beautifully situate on the bank of a lovely lake some two mile in length from the main street with its quaint little shop sheltered from the sun by makeshift verandah of tattered sack weather-stained shingle or rot bamboo mat various little lane and alley diverge lead one into a collection of tumble-down and ruinous hut set up apparently by chance and present the most incongruous appearance that could possibly be conceive one or two _ pucca _ house that be house of brick and masonry shew where some wealthy bunneah -lrb- trader -rrb- or usurious banker live but the majority of the house be of the usual mud and bamboo order there be a small thatched hut where the meal be cook and where the owner and he family could sleep during the rain another smaller hut at right angle to this give shelter to the family goat or if they be rich enough to keep one the cow all round the village in indium there be generally large patch of common where the village cow have free rights of pasture and all who can keep either a cow or a couple of goat the milk from which form a welcome addition to they usual scanty fare in this second hut also be store as much fuel consist of dry cow-dung straw maize-stalk leave etc as can be collect and a ragged fence of bamboo or _ rahur _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- stalk enclose the two unprotected side thus form inside a small court quadrangle or square this court be the native 's _ sanctum sanctorum _ it be keep scrupulously clean be sweep and garnish religiously every day in this the woman prepare the rice for the day 's consumption here they cut up and clean they vegetable or they fish when the adjacent lake have be drag by the village fisherman here the produce of they little garden capsicum indian corn onion or potato -- perchance turmeric ginger or other root or spice -- be dry and make ready for store in the earthen sun-baked repository for the reception of such produce appertaining to each household here the child play and be wash and tend here the maiden comb out she long black hair or decorate she bronzed visage with streak of red paint down the nose and a little antimony on the eyelid or myrtle juice on the finger and toe nail here too the matron or the withered old crone of a grandmother spin she cotton thread or in the old scriptural hand-mill grind the corn for the family flour and meal and the father and the young man -lrb- when the sun be high and hot in the heaven -rrb- take they noonday _ siesta _ or the day 's labor over cower round the smoking dung fire of a cold winter night and discuss the price rule in the bazaar the rise of rent or the last village scandal in the middle of the town and surround by a spacious fenced-in compound which slope gently to the lake stand the planter ' club a large low roofed bungalow with a roomy wide verandah in front here we meet when business or pleasure bring we to ` the station ' here be hold we annual ball or a occasional public dinner party to the north of the club stand a long range of barrack-looking building which be the opium godown where the opium be collect and store during the season face this again and at the extremity of the lake be the district jail where all the rascal of the surrounding country be confine its high wall tip at interval by a red puggree and flash bayonet wherever a jail sepoy keep he ` lonely watch ' near it sheltered in a grove of shady tree be the court house where the collector and magistrate daily dispense justice or where the native _ moonsiff _ disentangle knotty point of law here too come the session judge once a month or so to try criminal case and mete out justice to the law-breaker we have thus a small european element in we ` station ' consist of we magistrate and collector whose large and handsome house be build on the bank of another and yet lovelier lake which join the town lake by a narrow stream or strait at its southern end a opium agent a district superintendent of police and last but not least a doctor these form the official population of we little ` station ' there be also a nice little church but no resident pastor and behind the town lay a quiet churchyard rich in the dust of many a pioneer who far from home and friend have here be gather to he silent rest about twelve mile to the north and near the nepaul boundary be the small military station of legoulie here there be always a native cavalry regiment the officer of which be frequent and welcome guest at the factory in the district and be always glad to see they indigo friend at they mess in cantonment at rettiah still further to the north be a rich rajah 's palace where a resident european manager dwelt and have for he sole society a assistant magistrate who transact the executive and judicial work of the subdistrict these with some twenty-five or thirty indigo manager and assistant compose the whole european population of chumparun never be there a more united community we be all like brother each know all the rest the assistant frequently visit each other and the manager be kind and considerate to they subordinate hunting party be common cricket and hockey match be frequent and in the cold weather which be we slackest season fun frolic and sport be the order of the day we have a annual race meet when all the crack horse of the district meet in keen rivalry to test they pace and endurance during this high carnival we live for the most part under canvass and have friend from far and near to share we hospitality in a future chapter i must describe we racing meet -lrb- 1 -rrb- the _ rahur _ be a kind of pea grow not unlike we english broom in appearance it be sow with the maize crop during the rain and garner in the cold weather it produce a small pea which be largely use by the native and form the nutritive article of diet know as _ dhall _ chapter ii my first charge -- how we get we land -- we home farm -- system of farming -- collection of rent -- the planter 's duty my first charge be a small outwork of the large factory seeraha it be call puttihee there be no bungalow that be there be no regular house for the assistant but a little one-roomed hut build on the top of the indigo vat serve I for a residence it have neither door nor window and the rain use to beat through the room while the eaves be inhabit by countless swarm of bat who in the evening flash backwards and forwards in ghostly rapid flight and be a most intolerable nuisance to give some idea of the duty of a indigo assistant i must explain the system on which we get we land and how we grow we crop water of course be a _ sine qua non _ the first object in select a site for a factory be to have water in plenty contiguous to the propose building consequently puttihee be build on the bank of a very pretty lake shape like a horseshoe and cover with water lily and broad-leaved green aquatic plant the lake be keep by the native proprietor as a fish preserve and literally teem with fish of all sort shape and size i have not be long at puttihee before i have erect a staging lead out into deep water and many a happy hour i have spend there with my three or four rod out pull in the finny inhabitant have get water and a site the next thing be to get land on which to grow you crop by purchase by get a long lease or otherwise you become possess of several hundred acre of the land immediately surround the factory of course some factory will have more and some less as circumstance happen this land however be peculiarly factory property it be in fact a sort of home farm and go by the name of _ zeraat _ it be plough by factory bullock work by factory coolie and be altogether apart and separate from the ordinary land hold by the ryot and work by they -lrb- a ryot mean a cultivator -rrb- in most factory the zeraat be farm in the most thorough manner many now use the light howard 's plough and apply quantity of manure the field extend in vast unbroken plain all round the factory the land be work and pulverise and replough and harrow and clean till not a lump the size of a pigeon 's egg be to be see if necessary it be carefully weed several time before the crop be sow and in fact a fine clean stretch of zeraat in tirhoot or chumparun will compare most favourably with any field in the highest farming district of england or scotland the ploughing and other farm labor be do by bullock a staff of these vary of course with the amount of land under cultivation be keep at each factory for they support a certain amount of sugar-cane be plant and in the cold weather carrot be sown and _ gennara _ a kind of millet and maize both maize and gennara have broad green leaf and long juicy succulent stalk they grow to a good height and when cut up and mix with chop straw and carrot form a most excellent feed for cattle besides the bullock each factory keep up a staff of generally excellent horse for the use of the assistant or manager on which he ride over he cultivation and look generally after the farm some of the native subordinate also have pony or cabool horse or country-bred and for the feed of these animal some few acre of oats be sow every cold season in most factory too when any particular bit of the zeraat get exhaust by the constant repetition of indigo crop a rest be give it by take a crop of oil seed or oats off the land the oil seed usually sow be mustard or rape the oil be useful in the factory for oil the screw or the machinery and for other purpose the factory road through the zeraat be keep in most perfect order many of they be metal the ditch be clean once a year all thistle and weed by the side of the road and ditch be ruthlessly cut down the edge of all the field be neatly trim and cut useless tree and clump of jungle be cut down and in fact the zeraat round a factory shew a perfect picture of orderly thrift careful management and neat scientific and elaborate farming have get the zeraat the next thing be to extend the cultivation outside the land in indium be not as with we at home parcel out into large farm there be wealthy proprietor raja baboo and so on who hold vast tract of land either by grant or purchase or hereditary succession but the tenant be literally the child of the soil wherever a village nestle among its plantain or mango grove the land be parcel out among the villager a large proprietor do not reckon up he farm as a landlord at home would do but he count he village in a village with a thousand acre belong to it there might be 100 or even 200 tenant farm the land each petty villager would have he acre or half acre or four or five or ten or twenty acre as the case might be he hold this by a ` tenant right ' and can not be dispossess as long as he pay he rent regularly he can sell he tenant right and the purchaser on pay the rent become the _ bona fide _ possessor of the land to all intent and purpose if the average rent of the village land be let I say one rupee eight anna a acre the rent roll of the 1000 acre would be 1500 rupee out of this the government land revenue come certain deduction have to be make -- some ryot may be defaulter the village temple or the village brahmin may have to get something the road-cess have to be pay and so on take everything into account you arrive at a pretty fair view of what the rental be if the proprietor of the village want a loan of money or if you offer to pay he the rent by half-yearly or quarterly instalment you take all the risk of collect in turn from each ryot individually he be often only too glad to accept you offer and give you a lease of the village for whatever term may be agree on you step in as virtually the landlord and the ryot have to pay they rent to you in many case by careful management by remeasure land settle doubtful boundary and generally work up the estate you can much increase the rental and actually make a profit on you bargain with the landlord this department of indigo work be call zemindaree have then get the village in lease you summon in all you tenant shew they they rent account arrange with they for the punctual payment of they and get they to agree to cultivate a certain percentage of they land in indigo for you this percentage vary very considerably in some place it be one acre in five in some one in twenty it all depend on local circumstance you select the land you give the seed but the ryot have to prepare the field for sowing he have to plough weed and reap the crop and deliver it at the factory for the indigo he get so much per acre the price be as near as possible the average price of a acre of ordinary produce : take the average out-turn and price of say ten year it use formerly to be much less but the ryot nowadays get nearly double for he indigo what he get some ten or fifteen year ago and this although price have not rise for the manufactured article and the price of labor store machinery live stock etc have more than double in some part the ryot get pay so much per bundle of plant deliver at the vat but generally in behar at least in north behar he be pay so much per acre or _ beegah _ i use the word acre as be more easily understand by people at home than beegah the beegah vary in different district but be generally about two-third of a acre when he rent account then come to be make out the ryot get credit for the price of he indigo grow and deliver and this very often suffice not only to clear he entire rent but to leave a margin in hard cash for he to take home before the beginning of the indigo season however he come into the factory and take a cash advance on account of the indigo to be grow this be often a great help to he enable he to get he seed for he other land perhaps plough or to buy a cart or clothes for the family or to replace a bullock that may have die or to help to give a marriage portion to a son or daughter that he want to get marry you will thus see that we have cultivation to look after in all the village round about the factory which we can get in lease the ryot in return for he cash advance agree to cultivate so much indigo at a certain price for which he get credit in he rent such shortly be we indigo system in some village the ryot will estimate for we without we have the lease at all and without take advance he grow the indigo as he would grow any other crop as a pure speculation if he have a good crop he can get the price in hard cash from the factory and a great deal be grow in this way in both purneah and bhaugulpore this be call _ kooskee _ as against the system of advance which be call _ tuccaree _ the planter then have to be constantly over he village look out for good land give up bad field and take in new one he must watch what crop grow best in certain place he must see that he do not take land where water may lodge and on the other hand avoid those that do not retain they moisture he must attend also to the state of the other crop generally all over he cultivation as the punctual payment of rent depend largely on the state of the crop he must have he eye open to everything go on be able to tell the probable rent-roll of every village for mile around know whether the ryot be lazy and discontented or be industrious and hard-working up in the early morning before the hot blaze sun have climb on high he be off on he trusty nag through he zeraat with he greyhound and terrier pant behind he as he near a village the farm-servant in charge of that particular bit of cultivation come out with a low salaam to report progress or complain that so-and-so be not work up he field as he ought to do over all the land he go see where re-ploughing be necessary order harrowing here weed there or roll somewhere else he see where the ditch need deepen where the road want levelling or widen where a new bridge will be necessary where land must be throw up and new one take in he know nearly all he ryot and have a kind word for every one he pass ask after they crop they bullock or they land rouse up the indolent give a cheerful nod to the industrious order this one to be bring in to settle he account or that one to make greater haste with the preparation of he land that he may not lose he moisture in fact he have he hand full till the mount sun warn he to go back to breakfast and so with a rattle burst after a jackal or fox he get back to he bungalow to bathe dress and break he fast with fowl cutlet and curry and rice wash down with a wholesome tumbler of bass chapter iii how to get we crop -- the ` dangurs ' -- farm servant and they duty -- kassee rai -- hoe -- plough -- ` oustennie ' -- coolie at work -- sowing -- difficulty the plant have to contend with -- weed have now get we land water and building -- which latter i will describe further on -- the next thing be to set to work to get we crop manufacture be finish and the crop all cut by the beginning or middle of October when the annual rain be over it be of importance to have the land dig up as early as possible that the rich moisture on which the successful cultivation of the crop mainly depend may be secure before the hot west wind and strong sun of early spring lick it up attach to every factory be a small settlement of labourer belong to a tribe of aborigine call _ dangurs _ these originally i believe come from chota nagpoor which seem to have be they primal home they be a cheerful industrious race have a distinct language of they own and only intermarry with each other long ago when there be no post carriage to the hill and but few road the dangurs be largely employ as dale runner or postmen some few of they settle with they family on land near the foot of the hill in purneah and gradually other make they way northwards until now there be scarcely a factory in behar that have not its dangur tolum or village the man be tractable merry-hearted and faithful the woman betray none of the exaggerated modesty which be characteristic of hindoo woman generally they never turn aside and hide they face as you pass but look up to you with a merry smile on they countenance and exchange greeting with the utmost frankness in a future chapter i may speak at greater length of the dangurs at present it suffice to say that they form a sort of appanage to the factory and be in fact treat as part of the permanent staff each dangur when he marry get some grass and bamboo from the factory to build a house and a small plot of ground to serve as a garden for which he pay a very small rent or in many instance nothing at all in return he be always on the spot ready for any factory work that may be go on for which he have he daily wage some factory pay by the month but the general custom be to charge for hoe by piece-work and during manufacture when the work be constant there be pay a monthly wage in the close foggy morning of October and November long before the sun be up the dangur be hard at work in the zeraat turn up the soil with they _ kodaly _ -lrb- a kind of cut hoe -rrb- and you can often hear they merry voice rise through the mist as they crack joke with each other to enliven they work or troll one of they quaint native ditty they be preside over by a ` mate ' generally one of the oldest man and first settler in the village if he have have a large family he son look up to he and he son-in-law obey he order with the utmost fealty the ` mate ' settle all dispute present all grievance to the _ sahib _ and all order be give through he the indigo stubble which have be leave in the ground be perhaps about a foot high and as they cut it out they wife and child come to gather up the stick for fuel and this of course also help to clean the land by eleven o'clock when the sluggish mist have be dissipate by the ray of the scorching sun the day 's labor be nearly conclude you will then see the swarthy dangur with he favorite child on he shoulder wend he way back to he hut follow by he comely wife carry he hoe and a tribe of little one bring up the rear each carry bundle of the indigo stubble which the industrious father have dig up during the early hour of morning in the afternoon out come the _ hengha _ which be simply a heavy flat log of wood with a v shape cut or groove all along under its flat surface to each end of the hengha a pair of bullock be yoke and two man stand on the log and hold on by the bullock ' tail it be slowly drag over the field wherever the hoeing have be go on the lump and clod be catch in the groove on the under surface and drag along and break up and pulverize and the whole surface of the field thus get harrow down and form a homogeneous mass of light friable soil cover the weed and dirt to let they rot expose the least surface for the wind and heat to act on and thus keep the moisture in the soil now be a busy time for the planter up early in the cold raw fog he be over he zeraat long before dawn and round by he outlying village to see the ryot at work in they field to each eighty or a hundred acre a man be attach call a _ tokedar _ he duty be to rouse out the ryot see the hoe and plough at work get the weed do and be responsible for the state of the cultivation generally he will probably have two village under he if the village with its land be very extensive of course there will be a tokedar for it alone but frequently a tokedar may have two or more village under he charge in the village the head man -- generally the most influential man in the community -- also act with the tokedar help he to get plough bullock and coolie when these be wanted and under he the village _ chowkeydar _ or watchman see that stray cattle do not get into the field that the road bridge and fence be not damage and so on over the tokedar again be zillahdar a ` zillah ' be a small district there may be eight or ten village and three or four tokedar under a zillahdar the zillahdar look out for good land to change for bad one where this be necessary and where no objection be make by the farmer see that the tokedar do they work properly report rain blight locust and other visitation that might injure the crop watch all that go on in he zillah and make he report to the planter whenever anything of importance happen in he particular part of the cultivation over all again come the jemadar -- the head man over the whole cultivation -- the planter 's right-hand man he be generally a old experienced and trust servant he know all the land for mile round and the peculiar soil and product of all the village far and near he can tell what land grow the best tobacco what land be free from inundation what free from drought the temper of the inhabitant of each village and the history of each farm where be the best plough the best bullock and the best farming in what village you get most coolie for weed where you can get the best cart the best straw and the best of everything at the most favourable rate he come up each night when the day 's work be do and get he order for the morrow you be often glad to take he advice on sowing reap and other operation of the farm he know where the plant will ripen earliest and where the leaf will be thickest and to he you look for satisfaction if any screw get loose in the outside farm-work he generally accompany you in you morning ride show you you new land consult with you about throw up exhaust field and be generally a sort of farm-bailiff or confidential land-steward where he be a honest intelligent and loyal man he take half the care and work off you shoulder such man be however rare and if not very closely look after they be apt to abuse they position and often harass the ryot needlessly look more to the feathering of they own nest than the advancement of you interest the only jemadar i feel i could thoroughly trust be my first one at parewah a old rajpoot call kassee rai he be a fine ruddy-faced white-haired old man as independent and straightforward a old farmer as you could meet anywhere and i never have reason to regret take he advice on any matter i never find he out in a lie or in a dishonest or underhand action though over seventy year of age he be upright as a dart he could not keep up with I when we go out ride over the field but he would be out the whole day over the land and be always the first at he work in the morning and the last to leave off at night the ryot all love he and would do anything for he and when poor old kassee die the third year he have be under I i feel as if a old friend have go i never speak a angry word to he and i never have a fault to find with he when the hoeing have be finish in zeraat and zillah and all the upturned soil batten down by the _ hengha _ the next thing be to commence the plough you ploughman be mostly low caste man -- doosadhs churnar moosahurs gwallah _ et hoc genus omne _ the indian plough so like a big misshapen wooden pickaxe have often be describe it however turn up the light soft soil very well consider its pretension and those make in the factory workshop be generally heavier and sharper than the ordinary village plough we bullock too be strong and well feed the ploughing in the zeraat be generally good the ploughing be immediately follow up by the _ hengha _ which again triturate and break up the clod roll the stick leave and grass root together bring the refuse and dirt to the surface and again level the soil and prevent the wind from take away the moisture the land now look fine and fresh and level but very dirty a host of coolie be put on the field with small stick in they hand all the dangur woman and child be there with man woman and child of all the poorest class from the village round whom the attraction of wages or the exertion of headmen tokedar and zillahdar have bring together to earn they daily bread with the stick they beat and break up every clod leave not one behind the size of a walnut they collect all the refuse weed and dirt which be heap up and burn on the field and so they go on till the zeraat look as clean as a nobleman 's garden and you would think that surely this must satisfy the fastidious eye of the planter but no we work be not half begin yet it be rather a strange sight to see some four or five hundred coolie squat in a long irregular line chattering laugh shout or squabbling a dense cloud of dust rise over they and through the dim obscurity one hear the ceaseless sound of the thwack thwack as they stick rattle on the ground white dust lie thick on each swarthy skin they face be like face in a pantomime there be the flash eye and the grin row of white tooth all else be cloud in thick layer of dust with black spot and stencilling show here and there like a picture in sepia and chalk as they near the end of the field they redouble they thwack shuffle along like land-crab and while the mate peon and tokedar shout at they to encourage they they raise a roar loud enough to wake the dead the dust rise in denser cloud the noise be deafen a regular mad hurry-scurry a wild boisterous scramble ensue and amid much chaffing noise and laughter they scramble off again to begin another length of land and so the day 's work go on the planter have to count he coolie several time a-day or they would cheat he some come in the morning get count and they name put on the roll and then go off till paytime come round some come for a hour or two and send a relative in the evening when the pice be be pay out to get the wage of work they have not do all be pay in pice -- little copper bit of coin average about sixty-four to the rupee however you soon come to know the coolie by sight and after some experience be rarely ` take in ' but many young beginner get ` do ' most thoroughly till they become accustomed to the trick of the artless and unsophisticated coolie the type of feature along a line of coolie be as a rule a very forbid and degrade one they be mostly of the very poorest class many of they be plainly half silly or wholly idiotic not a few be deaf and dumb other be cripple or deform and number be leprous and scrofulous number of they be afflict in some district with goitre cause probably by bad drinking water all have a pinched withered wan look that tell of hard work and insufficient fare it be a pleasure to turn to the end of the line where the dangur woman and boy and girl generally take they place here be the loudest laughter and the sauciest face the child be merry chubby fat thing with well-distended stomach and pleasant look a merry smile ripple over they broad fat cheek as they slyly glance up at you the woman -- with huge earring in they ear and a perfect load of heavy brass ring on they arm -- chatter away make believe to be shy and show off a thousand coquettish air they very toe be bedizen with brass ring and long festoon of red white and blue bead hang pendent round they neck in the evening the line be re-formed before the bungalow a huge bag of copper coin be produce the old lallah or writer with spectacles on nose squat down in the middle of the assemble coolie and as each name be call the mate count out the pice and make it over to the coolie who forthwith hurry off to get he little purchase make at the village bunneah 's shop and so on a poor supper of parched pea or boil rice with no other relish but a pinch of salt the poor coolie crawl to bed only to dream of more hard work and scanty fare on the morrow poor thing a village coolie have a hard time of it during the hot month if rice be cheap and plentiful he can jog along pretty comfortably but when the cold night come on and he cower in he wretched hut hungry half naked cold and wearied he be of all object most pitiable it be however a fact little creditable to he more prosperous fellow-countryman that he get better pay for he labor in connection with factory work than he do in many case for task force on he by the lead ryot of the village in connection with they own field -lrb- illustration : coolie 's hut -rrb- this first cleaning of the field -- or as it be call _ oustennie _ -- be finish the land be all again re-ploughed re-harrowed and then once more re-cleaned by the coolie till not a weed or spot of dirt remain and till the whole surface be uniformly soft friable moist and clean we have now some breathing time and as this be the most enjoyable season of the year when the day be cool and roar wood fire at night remind we of home we hunt visit race dance and generally enjoy ourselves should heavy rain fall as it sometimes do about christmas and early in February the whole cultivation get beat down and cake over in such a case amusement must for a time be throw aside till all the land have be again re-ploughed of course we be never wholly idle there be always rent to collect matter to adjust in connexion with we village and tenantry law-suit to recover bad debt to enforce contract or protect manorial or other rights -- but generally speak when the land have be prepare we have a slack season or breathing time for a month or so arrangement have be make for the supply of seed which generally come from about the neighborhood of cawnpore as February draw near we make preparation for begin we sowing February be the usual month but it depend on the moisture and sometimes sowing may go on up till may and June in purneah and bhaugulpore where the cultivation be much rougher than in tirhoot the sowing be do broadcast and in bengal the sowing be often do upon the soft mud which be leave on the bank of the river at the retire of the annual flood in tirhoot however where the high farming i have be try to describe be practice the sowing be do by means of drill drill be get out overhaul and put in thorough repair bag of seed be send out to the village advance for bullock be give to the ryot and on a certain day when all seem favourable -- no sign of rain or high wind -- the drill be set at work and day and night the work go on till all the cultivation have be sow as the drill go along the hengha follow close behind cover the seed in the furrow and once again it be put over till the field be all level shine and clean wait for the first appearance of the young soft shoot these after some seven nine or perhaps fifteen day accord to the weather begin to appear in long line of delicate pale yellowish green this be a most anxious time should rain fall the whole surface of the earth get cake and hard and the delicate plant burn out or be chafe against the hard surface crust it withers and die if the wind get into the east it bring a peculiar blight which settle round the leaf and collar of the stem of the young plant choke it and sweep off mile and mile of it if hot west wind blow the plant get black discolor burn up and dead a south wind often bring caterpillar -- at least this pest often make its appearance when the wind be southerly but as often as not caterpillar find they way to the young plant in the most mysterious manner -- no one know whence they come daily nay almost hourly report come in from all part of the zillah : now you hear of ` lahee ' blight on some field now it be ` ihirka ' scorching or ` pilooa ' caterpillar in some place the seed may have be bad or cover with too much earth and the plant come up straggle and thin if there be abundant moisture this must be re-sow in fact there be never-ending anxiety and work at this season but when the plant have get into ten or fifteen leaf and be a inch or two high the most critical time be over and one begin to think about the next operation namely weed the coolie be again in requisition each come arm with a _ coorpee _ -- this be a small metal spatula broad-pointed with which they dig out the weed with amazing deftness sometimes they may inadvertently take out a single stem of indigo with the weed : the eye of the mate or tokedar espy this at once and the careless coolie be treat to a volley of hindoo billingsgate in which all he relation be abused to the seventh generation by the time the first weeding be finish the plant will be over a foot high and if necessary a second weeding be then give after the second weeding and if any rain have fall in the interim the plant will be fully two foot high it be now a noble-looking expanse of beautiful green wave foliage as the wind ruffle its myriad of leave the sparkle of the sunbeam on the undulating mass produce the most wonderful combination of light and shade feathery spray of a delicate pale green curl gracefully all over the field it be like a ocean of vegetation with billow of rich color chase each other and blending in harmonious hue the whole field look a perfect oasis of beauty amid the surround dull brown tint of the season it be now time to give the plant a light touch of the plough this ease the soil about the root let in air and light tend to clean the undergrowth of weed and give it a great impetus the operation be call _ bedaheunee _ by the beginning of June the tiny red flower be peep from its leafy sheath the lower leaf be turn yellowish and crisp and it be almost time to begin the grandest and most important operation of the season the manufacture of the dye from the plant to this you have be look forward during the cold raw foggy day of November when the plough be hard at work -- during the hot fierce wind of march and the still sultry breathless early day of June when the air be so still and oppressive that you could scarcely breathe these sultry day be the lull before the storm -- the pause before the moisture-laden cloud of the monsoon roll over the land ` rugged and brown ' and the wild rattle of thunder and the lurid glare of quiver never-ceasing lightning herald in the annual rain the manufacture however deserve a chapter to itself -lrb- illustration : indigo beat vat -rrb- chapter iv manufacture of indigo -- load the vat -- beating -- boil strain and press -- scene in the factory -- fluctuation of produce -- chemistry of indigo indigo be manufacture solely from the leaf when arrangement have be make for cut and cart the plant from the field the vat and machinery be all make ready and a day be appoint to begin ` mahye ' or manufacture the apparatus consist of first a strong serviceable pump for pump up water into the vat : this be now mostly do by machinery but many small factory still use the old persian wheel which may be shortly describe as simply a endless chain of bucket work on a revolving wheel or drum the machine be work by bullock and as the bucket ascend full from the well they be empty during they revolution into a small trough at the top and the water be convey into a huge masonry reservoir or tank situate high up above the vat which form a splendid open air bath for the planter when he feel inclined for a swim many of these tank call _ kajhana _ be capable of contain 40000 cubic foot of water or more below and in a line with this reservoir be the steep vat each capable of contain about 2000 cubic foot of water when full of course the vat vary in size but what be call a _ pucca _ vat be of the above capacity when the fresh green plant be bring in the cart with they load be range in line opposite these load vat the loading coolie ` bojhunneas ' -- so call from ' _ bojh _ ' a bundle -- jump into the vat and receive the plant from the cart-men stack it up in perpendicular layer till the vat be full : a horizontal layer be put on top to make the surface look even bamboo batten be then place over the plant and these be press down and hold in they place by horizontal beam work in upright post the upright have hole at interval of six inch a iron pin be put in one of the hole a lever be put under this pin and the beam press down till the next hole be reach and a fresh pin insert which keep the beam down in its place when sufficient pressure have be apply the sluice in the reservoir be open and the water run by a channel into the vat till it be full vat after vat be thus fill till all be finish and the plant be allow to steep from ten to thirteen or fourteen hour accord to the state of the weather the temperature of the water and other condition and circumstance which have all to be carefully note at first a greenish yellow tinge appear in the water gradually deepen to a intense blue as the fermentation go on froth form on the surface of the vat the water swell up bubble of gas arise to the surface and the whole range of vat present a frothing bubble sweltering appearance indicative of the chemical action go on in the interior if a torch be apply to the surface of a vat the accumulate gas ignite with a loud report and a blue lambent flame travel with amazing rapidity over the effervescent liquid in very hot weather i have see the water swell up over the mid wall of the vat till the whole range would be one uniform surface of frothing liquid and on apply a light the report have be as loud as that of a small cannon and the flame have leap from vat to vat like the flit will-o ' - the-wisp on the surface of some miasmatic marsh when fermentation have proceed sufficiently the temperature of the vat lower somewhat and the water which have be globular and convex on the surface and at the side now become distinctly convex and recede a very little this be a sign that the plant have be steep long enough and that it be now time to open the vat a pin be knock out from the bottom and the pent-up liquor rush out in a golden yellow stream tint with blue and green into the beating vat which lie parallel to but at a lower level than the load vat of course as the vat be load at different hour and the steep vary with circumstance they must be ready to open also at different interval there be two man specially engage to look after the open the time of load each one be carefully note the time it will take to steep be guess at and a hour for open write down when this hour arrive the _ gunta parree _ or time-keeper look at the vat and if it appear ready he get the pinman to knock out the pin and let the steeped liquor run into the beating vat where there be many vat this go on all night and by the morning the beating vat be all full of steeped liquor and ready to be beat the beating now be mostly do by machinery but the old style be very different a gang of coolie -lrb- generally dangurs -rrb- be put into the vat have long stick with a disc at the end with which standing in two row they throw up the liquor into the air the quantity force up by the one coolie encounter in mid air that send up by the man standing immediately opposite to he and the two jet meeting and mix confusedly together tumble down in broken frothy mass into the vat begin with a slow steady stroke the coolie gradually increase the pace shout out a hoarse wild song at interval till what with the swish and splash of the fall water the measure beat of the _ furrovah _ or beat rod and the yell and cry with which they excite each other the noise be almost deafen the water which at first be of a yellowish green be now begin to assume a intense blue tint this be the result of the oxygenation go on as the blue deepen the exertion of the coolie increase till with every muscle strain head throw back chest expand he long black hair drip with white foam and he bronzed naked body glisten with blue liquor he yell and shout and twist and contort he body till he look like a true ` blue devil ' to see eight or ten vat full of yell howling blue creature the water splash high in mid air the foam fleck the wall and the measure beat of the _ furrovah _ rise weird-like into the morning air be almost enough to shake the nerve of a stranger but it be music in the planter 's ear and he can scarce refrain from yell out in sympathy with he coolie and share in they frantic excitement indeed it be often necessary to encourage they if a vat prove obstinate and the color refuse to come -- a event which occasionally do happen it be very hard work beating and when this constant violent exercise be keep up for about three hour -lrb- which be the time generally take -rrb- the coolie be pretty well exhaust and require a rest -lrb- illustration : indigo beater at work in the vat -rrb- during the beat two process be go on simultaneously one be chemical -- oxygenation -- turn the yellowish green dye into a deep intense blue : the other be mechanical -- a separation of the particle of dye from the water in which it be hold in solution the beating seem to do this cause the dye to granulate in larger particle when the vat have be beat the coolie remove the froth and scum from the surface of the water and then leave the contents to settle the feculum or dye or _ mall _ as it be technically call now settle at the bottom of the vat in a soft pulpy sediment and the waste liquor leave on the top be let off through graduate hole in the front pin after pin be gradually remove and the clear sherry-coloured waste allow to run out till the last hole in the series be reach and nothing but dye remains in the vat by this time the coolie have have a rest and food and now they return to the work and either lift up the _ mall _ in earthen jar and take it to the mall tank or -- as be now more commonly do -- they run it along a channel to the tank and then wash out and clean the vat to be ready for the renew beating on the morrow when all the _ mall _ have be collect in the mall tank it be next pump up into the strain room it be here strain through successive layer of wire gauze and cloth till free from dirt sand and impurity it be run into the large iron boiler to be subject to the next process this be the boil this operation usually take two or three hour after which it be run off along narrow channel till it reach the straining-table it be a very important part of the manufacture and have to be carefully do the straining-table be a oblong shallow wooden frame in the shape of a trough but all compose of open woodwork it be cover by a large straining-sheet on which the mall settle while the waste water trickle through and be carry away by a drain when the mall have stand on the table all night it be next morning lift up by scoop and bucket and put into the press these be square box of iron or wood with perforated side and bottom and a removeable perforated lid the inside of the box be line with press cloth and when fill these cloth be carefully fold over the _ mall _ which be now of the consistence of starch and a heavy beam work on two upright three-inch screw be let down on the lid of the press a long lever be now put on the screw and the nut work slowly round the pressure be enormous and all the water remain in the _ mall _ be press through the cloth and perforation in the press-box till nothing but the pure indigo remain behind the press be now open and a square slab of dark moist indigo about three or three and a half inch thick be carry off on the bottom of the press -lrb- the top and side have be remove -rrb- and carefully place on the cut frame this frame correspond in size to the bottom of the press and be groove in line somewhat after the manner of a chess-board a stiff iron rod with a brass wire attach be put through the groove under the slab the wire be bring over the slab and the rod be pull smartly through bring the wire with it cut the indigo much in the same way as you would cut a bar of soap when all the slab have be cut into bar the wire and rod be next put into the groove at right angle to the bar and again pull through thus divide the bar into cubical cake each cake be then stamp with the factory mark and number and all be note down in the book they be then take to the dry house this be a large airy building with strong shelf of bamboo reach to the roof and have narrow passage between the tier of shelf on these shelf or _ mychan _ as they be call the cake be range to dry the dry take two or three month and the cake be turn and move at frequent interval till thoroughly ready for pack all the little piece and corner and chip be carefully put by on separate shelf and packed separately even the sweepings and refuse from the sheet and floor be all carefully collect mixed with water boil separately and make into cake which be call ` washing ' during the dry a thick mould form on the cake this be carefully brush off before packing and mixed with sweepings and tiny chip be all ground up in a hand-mill packed in separate chest and sell as dust in October when _ mahye _ be over and the preparation of the land go on again the packing begin the cake each of separate date be carefully scrutinise and place in order of quality the finest quality be pack first in layer in mango-wood box the box be first weigh empty re-weighed when full and the difference give the nett weight of the indigo the tare gross and nett weight be print legibly on the chest along with the factory mark and number of the chest and when all be ready they be send down to the broker in calcutta for sale such shortly be the system of manufacture during _ mahye _ the factory be a busy scene long before break of day the ryot and coolie be busy cut the plant leave it in green little heap for the cartman to load in the early morning the cart be see converge to the factory on every road crawl along like huge green beetle here a cavalcade of twenty or thirty cart there in cluster of two or three when they reach the factory the loader have several vat ready for the reception of the plant while other be take out the already steep plant of yesterday stagger under its weight as drip with water they toss it on the vast accumulate heap of refuse material down in the vat below the beating coolie be plash and shout and yell or the revolving wheel -lrb- where machinery be use -rrb- be scatter cloud of spray and foam in the blinding sunshine the fireman strip to the waist be feed the furnace with the dry stem of last year 's crop which form we only fuel the smoke hover in volume over the boiling-house the pinman be busy sort they pin roll hemp round they to make they fit the hole more exactly inside the boiling-house dimly discernible through the cloud of stifle steam the boilerman be see with long rod stir slowly the boiling mass of bubble blue the clank of the lever resound through the pressing-house or the hoarse guttural ` hah hah ' as the huge lever be strain and pull at by the press-house coolie the straining-table be be clean by the table

batch of cake on they head bear on board like a baker take he hot roll from the oven or like a busy swarm of ant take the spoil of the granary to they forest haunt everywhere there be a confused jumble of sound the plash of water the clank of machinery the creaking of wheel the roaring of the furnace mingle with the shout cry and yell of the excited coolie the vituperation of the driver as some terrify or obstinate bullock plunge madly about the objurgation of the ` mate ' as some lazy fellow ease he stroke in the beating vat the crack of whip as the bullock tear round the circle where the persian wheel creak and rumble in the damp dilapidated wheel-house the-dripping bucket revolve clumsily on the drum the arrive and depart cart the clang of the anvil as the blacksmith and he man hammer away at some huge screw which have be bent the hurry crowd of cartman and loader with they burden of fresh green plant or drip refuse -- form such a medley of sight and sound as i have never see equal in any other industry the planter have to be here there and everywhere he send cart to this village or to that accord as the crop ripen coolie must be count and pay daily the stubble must be plough to give the plant a start for the second growth whenever the weather will admit of it report have to be send to the agent and owner the boiling must be narrowly watch as also the beating and the strain he have a large staff of native assistant but if he _ mahye _ be to be successful he eye must be over all it be a anxious time but the constant work be grateful and when the produce be good and everything work smoothly it be perhaps the most enjoyable time of the whole year be it nothing to see the crop on which so much care have be expend which you have watch day by day through all the vicissitude of the season through drought and flood and blight be it nothing to see it safely harvest and you shelf fill day by day with fine sound cake the representative of wealth that will fill you pocket with commission and build up you name as a careful and painstaking planter ` what be you produce ' be now the first query at this season when planter meet calculation be make daily nay hourly to see how much be be get per beegah or how much per vat the press be calculate to weigh so much some day you will get a press a vat some day it will mount up to two press a vat and at other time it will recede to half a press a vat or even less cold wet weather reduce the produce warm sunny weather will send it up again short stunt plant from poor land will often reduce you average per acre to be again send up as fresh hardy leafy plant come in from some favorite village where you have new and fertile land or where the plant from the rich zeraat laden with broad strong leaf be tumble into the load vat so far as i know there seem to be no law of produce it be the most erratic and incomprehensible thing about plant one day you press be full to strain next day half of they lie empty no doubt the state of the weather the quality of you plant the temperature of the water the length of time steeping and other thing have a influence but i know of no planter who can entirely and satisfactorily account for the sudden and incomprehensible fluctuation and variation which undoubtedly take place in the produce or yield of the plant it be a matter of more interest to the planter than to the general public but all i can say be that if the circumstance attendant on any sudden change in the yield power of the plant be more accurately note if the chemical condition of the water the air and the raw material itself more especially in reference to the soil on which it grow the time it take in transit from the field to the vat and other point which will at once suggest themselves to a practical planter be more carefully methodically and scientifically observe some coherent theory result in plain practical result might be evolve planter should attend more to this i believe the chemical history of indigo have yet to be write the whole manufacture so far as chemistry be concern be yet crude and ill-digested i know that by careful experiment and close scientific investigation and observation the preparation of indigo could be much improve so far as the mechanical appliance for the manufacture go the last ten year have witness amazing and rapid improvement what be now want be that what have be do for the mere mechanical appliance should be do for the proper understanding of the chemical change and condition in the constitution of the plant and in the various process of its manufacture -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- since the above chapter be write mon pi michea a french chemist of some experience in indigo matter have patent a invention -lrb- the result of much study experiment and investigation -rrb- by the application of which a immense increase in the produce of the plant have be obtain during the last season in several factory where it have be work in jessore purneah kishnaghur and other place this increase vary accord to circumstance have in some instance reach the amazing extent of 30 to 47 per cent and so far from be attend with a deterioration of quality the dye produce be say to be finer than that obtain under the old crude process describe in the above chapter this show what a waste must have be go on and what may yet be do by properly organise scientific investigation i firmly believe that with a intelligent application of the principle of chemistry and agricultural science not only to the manufacture but to growth cultivation nature of the soil application of manure and other such department of the business quite a revolution will set in and a new era in the history of this great industry will be inaugurate less area for crop will be require work expense will be reduce a greater out-turn and a more certain crop secure and all class planter and ryot alike will be benefit -lrb- illustration : indian

curly ' ` brandy ' and ` nettle ' till spy a cat in the distance the whole pack with a whimper of excitement dash off at a mad scramble the hound strain meanwhile at the slip till he almost pull the _ mehter _ off he leg off go the cat round the corner of a hut with she tail puff up to fully three time its normal size round in mad eager pursuit rattle the terrier thirst for she blood the _ syce _ dash forward vainly hope to turn they from they quest now a village dog rouse from he morning nap bound out with a demoniac howl which be catch up and echo by all the cur in the village meanwhile the row inside the hut be fiendish the sleep family rudely rouse by the yelp pack utter the most discordant scream the woman with garment flutter behind they rush out beat they breast think the very devil be loose the wail of the unfortunate cat mingle with the short snap bark of the pack or a howl of anguish as puss inflict a caress on the face of some too careless or reckless dog a howling village cur have rashly venture too near ` pincher ' have he by the hind leg before you could say ` jack robinson ' leave the dead cat for ` toby ' and ` nettle ' to worry the whole pack now fiercely attack the luckless _ pariah _ dog a dozen of he village mate dance madly outside the ring but be too wise or too cowardly to come to closer quarter the kangaroo hound have now fairly tear the rope from the keeper 's hand and with one mighty bind be in the middle of the fight scatter the village dog right and leave the whole village be now in commotion the _ syce _ and keeper shout the name of the terrier in vain oath cry shout and scream mingle with the yelp and growl of the combatant till ride up i disperse the worrying pack with a few crack of my hunting whip and so on again over the zillah leave the woman and child to recover they scatter sens the old man to grumble over they broken slumber and the boy and young man to wonder at the pluck and dash of the _ belaitee kookoor _ or english dog the common pariah dog or village dog of indium be a perfect cur a mangy carrion-loving yellow-fanged howling brute a most unlovely and unloving beast as you pass he village he will bounce out on you with the fiercest bark and the most menacing snarl but lo if a terrier the size of a teacup but boldly go at he down go he tail like a pump-handle he turn white with fear and like the arrant coward that he be tumble on he back and fairly scream for mercy i have often be amuse to see a great hulk cowardly brute come out like a avalanche at ` pincher ' expect to make one mouthful of he what a look of bewilderment he would put on as my gallant little ` pincher ' with a short sharp defiant bark would go boldly at he the huge yellow brute would stop dead short on all four leg and as the rest of my pack would come scamper round the corner he would find himself the center of a ring of indomitable assailant how he curse he short-sighted temerity with one long howl of utter dismay and deadly fear he manage to get away from the pack leave my little doggie to come proudly round my horse with they mouth full of fur and each of they little tail as stiff as a iron ramrod that ` pincher ' in some respects be a very fiend incarnate there be no keep he in he be constantly get into hot water himself and lead the pack into all sort of mischief he be as bold as brass and as courageous as a lion he steal food worried sheep and goat and be never out of a scrape i try thrash he tie he up half starve he but all to no purpose he would be into every hut in a village whenever he have the chance overturn brass pot eat up rice and curry and throw the poor villager 's household into dismay and confusion he would never leave a cat if he once see it i have see he scramble through the roof of more than one hut and oust the cat from its fancied stronghold i put he into a indigo vat with a big dog jackal once and he whip the jackal single-handed he do not kill it but he worry it till the jackal sham dead and would not ` come to the scratch ' ` pincher 's ' ear be perfect shred and he scar be as numerous almost as he hair my gallant ` pincher ' he be a sad end he get eat up by a alligator in the ` dhan ' a sluggish stream in bhaugulpore i have all my pack in the boat with I the stream be swollen and full of weed a jackal give tongue on the bank and ` pincher ' bound over the side of the boat at once i try to ` grab ' he and nearly upset the boat in do so we boat be go rapidly down stream and ` pincher ' try to get ashore but get among the weed he give a bark poor gallant little dog for help but just then we see a dark square snout shoot athwart the stream a half-smothered sobbing cry from ` pincher ' and the bravest little dog i ever possess be go for ever there be another breed of large strong-limbed big-boned dog call rampore hound they be a cross breed from the original upcountry dog and the persian greyhound some call they the indian greyhound they seem to be breed principally in the rampore-bareilly district but one or more be generally to be find in every planter 's pack they be fast and strong enough but i have often find they bad at tackle and they be too fond of they keeper ever to make a affectionate faithful dog to the european another somewhat similar breed be the _ tazus _ this although not so large a dog as the rhamporee be a much pluckier animal and when well train will tackle a jackal with the utmost determination he have a wrinkled almost hairless skin but a very uncertain temper and he be not very amenable to discipline _ tazus _ be simply the persian word for a greyhound and refer to no particular breed the common name for a dog be _ kutta _ pronounce _ cootta _ but the tazus have certainly be a importation from the north-west hence the persian name the wander caboolee who come down to the plain once a year with dry fruit spice and other product of field or garden also bring with they the dog of they native country for sale and on occasion they bring lovely long-haired white persian cat very beautiful animal these caboolee dog be tall long-limbed brute generally white with a long thin snout very long silky-haired drooping ear and generally wear tuft of hair on they leg and tail somewhat like the feathering of a spaniel which make they look rather clumsy they can not stand the heat of the plain at all well and be difficult to tame but fleet and plucky hunting well with a english pack my neighbor anthony at meerpore have some very fine english greyhound and bulldog and many a rattle burst have we have together after the fox or the jackal imagine a wide level plain with one uniform dull covering of rice stubble save where in the center a mound rise some two acre in extent cover with long thatching grass a few scrubby acacia bush and other jungly brushwood all round the circular horizon be dense forest mass of sombre look foliage save where some clump of palm uprear they stately head or the white shine wall of some temple sacred to shiva or khristna glitter in the sunshine far to the leave a sluggish creek wind slowly along through the plain its bank fringe with acacia and wild rise jungle on the far bank be a small patch of _ sal _ forest jungle with a thick rank undergrowth of fern thistle and rank grass as i be slowly ride along i hear a shout in the distance and look round behold anthony advance at a rapid hand gallop he dog and mine be old friend rapidly fraternise and we determine on a hunt ` let 's try the old patch anthony ' ` all right ' and away we go make straight for the mound when we reach the grass the syce and keeper hold the hound at the corner outside while we ride through the grass urge on the terrier who quiver with excitement utter short bark and dash here and there among the thick grass all eager for a find ` go away go away ' shout anthony as a fleet fox dash out closely follow by ` pincher ' and half a dozen other the hound be slipped and away go the pack in full pursuit we on we horse ride along one on each side of the chase the fox have a good start but now the hound be near he when with a sudden whisk he double round the ridge encircle a rice field the hound overshoot he and ere they turn the fox have put the breadth of a good field between himself and he pursuer he be now make back again for the grass but encounter some of the terrier who have tail off behind with pant chest and loll tongue they be peg stolidly along when fortune give they this welcome chance redouble they effort they dash at the fox ` bravo tilly you tumble he over that time ' but he be up and away again dodge double-turning and twist he have nearly run the gauntlet and the friendly covert be close at hand but the hound be now up again and thirst for he blood ` hurrah minnie have he ' cry anthony and ride up we divest poor reynard of he brush pat the dog ease the girth for a minute and then again into the jungle for another beat this time a fat old jackal break to the left long before the dog be up yell to the _ mehter _ not to slip the hound we gather the terrier together and pound over the stubble and ridge he be go very leisurely cast a occasional scared look over he shoulder ` curly ' and ` leg ' two of my fastest terrier be now in full view they be lay themselves well to the ground and master jackal think it be high time to increase he pace he put on a spurt but condition tell he be fat and pursy and must have have a good feed last night on some poor dead bullock he be shew he tooth now curly make he rush and they both roll over together up hurry leg and the jackal get a grip give he a shake and then hobble slowly on the two terrier now hamper he terribly one minute they be at he heel and as soon as he turn they be at he ear or shoulder the rest of the pack be fast come up anthony have a magnificent bulldog broad-chested and a very goliath among dog he be call ` sailor ' sailor always pound along at the same steady pace he never seem to get flurry sit lazily at the door he seem too indolent even to snap at a fly he be a true philosopher and nought seem to disturb he serenity but see he after a jackal he big red tongue hang out he eye flash fire and he hair erect on he back like the bristle of a wild boar he look fiendish then and he be a true bulldog there be no flinch with sailor once he get he grip it be no use try to make he let go up come sailor now he have the jackal by the throat a hoarse rattle gasp yell and the jackal have go to the happy hunting grounds the sun be now mount in the sky the hound and terrier feel the heat so send they home by the keeper we diverge on we respective road ride over we cultivation see the ploughing and preparation generally till hot tired and dusty we reach home about 1130 tumble into we bath and feeling refresh sit down contentedly to breakfast if the _ dak _ or postman have come in we get we letter and papers and the afternoon be devote to office work and account hear complaint and report from the village or look over any labor that may be go on in the zeraat or at the workshop in the evening we ride over the zeraat again give order for the morrow 's work consume a little tobacco have a early dinner and after a little reading retire soon to bed to dream of far away friend and the happy memory of home many a evening it be very lonely work no friendly face and no congenial society within mile of you factory little wonder that the arrival of a brother planter send a thrill through the frame and that he advent be welcome as the most agreeable break to the irksome monotony of we lonely life chapter vi fishing in indium -- hereditary trade -- the boatman and fisherman of indium -- they village -- net -- mode of fishing -- curiosity relate thereto -- catch a alligator with a hook -- exciting capture-crocodile -- shoot a alligator -- death of the man-eater not only in the wild jungle on the undulating plain and among the withered brown stubble do animal life abound in indium but the river lake and creek teem with fish of every conceivable size shape and color the variety be legion from the huge black porpoise tumble through the turgid stream of the gange to the bright sparkling silvery shoal of delicate _ chillooah _ or _ poteeah _ which one see dart in and out among the rice stubble in every paddy field during the rain here a huge _ bhowarree _ -lrb- pike -rrb- or ravenous _ coira _ come to the surface with a splash there a _ raho _ the indian salmon with its round sucker-like mouth rise slowly to the surface suck in a fly and disappear as slowly as it rise or a _ pachgutchea _ a long sharp-nosed fish dart rapidly by a shoal of mullet with they head out of the water swim athwart the stream and far down in the cool depths of the tank or lake a thousand different variety disport themselves among the mazy labyrinth of the broad-leaved weed during the middle and about the end of the rain be the best time for fishing the whole country be then a perfect network of stream every rice field be a shallow lake with countless thousand of tiny fish dart here and there among the rice stalk every ditch teem with fish and every hollow in every field be a well stock aquarium round the edge of every lake or tank in the early morning or when the fierce heat of the day begin to get temper by the approach shades of evening one see number of boy and man of the poorer class each with a couple of rough bamboo rod stick in the ground in front of he watch he primitive float with the greatest eagerness and whipping out at interval some luckless fish of about three or four ounce in weight with a tremendous haul fit for the capture of a forty-pounder they get a coarse sort of hook in the bazaar rig up a roughly-twisted line tie on a small piece of hollow reed for a float and with a lively earth-worm for a bait they can generally manage in a very short time to secure enough fish for a meal with a short light rod a good silk line and a english hook attach to fine gut i have enjoy many a good hour 's sport at parewah i use to have a cane chair send down to the bank of the stream a _ punkah _ or hand fan plenty of cool drink and two coolie boy in attendance to remove the fish renew bait and keep the punkah in constant swing there i use to sit enjoy my cigar and pull in little fish at the rate sometimes of a couple a minute i remember hook a turtle once and a terrible job it be to land he my light rod bent like a willow but the tackle be good and after ten minute ' hard work i get the turtle to the side where my boy soon secure he he weigh thirteen pound sometimes you get among a colony of freshwater crab they be little brown brute and strip you hook of the bait as fast as you fling they in there be nothing for it in such a case but to shift you station many of the bottom fish -- the _ ghuraus _ the _ saourie _ the _ barnee _ -lrb- eel -rrb- and other make no effort to escape the hook you see they rest at the bottom and drop the bait at they very nose on the whole the hand fishing be uninteresting but it serve to wile away a odd hour when hunting and shooting be hardly practicable particular occupation in indium be restricted to particular caste all trade be hereditary for example a _ tatmah _ or weaver be always a weaver he can not become a blacksmith or carpenter he have no choice he must follow the hereditary trade the peculiar system of land-tenure in indium which secure as far as possible a bit of land for every one tend to perpetuate this hereditary selection of trade by enable every cultivator to be so far independent of he handicraft thus restrict competition there may be twenty _ lohar _ or blacksmith in a village but they do not all follow they call they till they land and be _ de facto _ petty farmer they know the rudiment of they handicraft but the actual blacksmith 's work be do by the hereditary smith of the village whose son in turn will succeed he when he die or if he leave no son he fellow caste man will put in a successor nearly every villager during the rain may be find on the bank of the stream or lake angling in a amateur sort of way but the fisherman of behar _ par excellence _ be the _ mull -lrb- = a -rrb- h _ they be also call _ gouhree beeu _ or _ muchooah _ in bengal they be call _ nikaree _ and in some part _ baeharee _ from the persian word for a boat in the same way _ muchooah _ be derive from _ much _ a fish and _ mullah _ mean boatman strictly speak rather than fisherman all boatman and fisherman belong to this caste and they village can be recognize at once by the instrument of they call lie all around perch high on some bank overlook the stream or lake you see innumerable festoon of net hang out to dry on tall bamboo pole or hang like lace curtain of very coarse texture from the roof and eaves of the hut haul up on the beach be a whole fleet of boat of different size from the small _ dugout _ which will hold only one man to the huge _ dinghy _ in which the big net and a dozen man can be stow with ease great heap of shell of the freshwater mussel show the source of great supplies of bait while overhead a great hover army of kite and vulture be constantly circle round eagerly watch for the slightest scrap of offal from the net when the rain have fairly set in and the fisherman have get they rice field all plant out they be at liberty to follow they hereditary avocation a day be fix for a drag and the big net be overhaul and get in readiness the head _ mullah _ a wary grizzled old veteran give the order the big drag-net be bundle into the boat which be quickly push off into the stream and at a certain distance from shore the net be cast from the boat be weight at the lower end it rapidly sink and buoy on the upper side with piece of cork it make a perpendicular wall in the water several long bamboo pole be now run through the rope along the upper side of the net to prevent the net be drag under water altogether by the weight of the fish in a great haul the little boat a crowd of which be in attendance now dart out surround the net on all side and the boatman beat they oar on the side of the boat create such a clatter as to frighten the fish into the circumference of the big net this be now be drag slowly to shore by strong and willing arm the woman and child watch eagerly on the bank at length the glittering haul be pull up high and dry on the beach the fish be divide among the man the woman fill they basket and away they hie to the nearest _ bazaar _ or if it be not _ bazaar _ or market day they hawk the fish through the nearest village like we fish-wife at home there be another common mode of fishing adopt in narrow lake and small stream which be let out to the fisherman by the zemindar or landholder a barricade make of light reed all mat together by string be stick into the stream and a portion of the water be fence in generally in a circular form the reed fence be quite flexible be gradually move in narrow the circle as the circle narrow the agitation inside be indescribable fish jump in all direction -- a move mass of glitter scale and fin the larger one try to leap the barrier and be catch by the attendant _ mulla _ who pounce on they with swift dexterity eagle and kite dart and swoop down bear off a captive fish in they talon the reed fence be double back on itself and gradually push on till the whole of the fish inside be jam together in a move mass the weed and dirt be then remove and the fish put into basket and carry off to market other again use circular casting net which they throw with very great dexterity gather the net into a bunch they rest it on the shoulder then with a circular sweep round the head they fling it far out be load it sink down rapidly in the water a string be attach to the center of the net and the fisherman haul it in with whatever prey he may be lucky enough to secure as the water recede during October after the rain have end each runlet and purling stream become a scene of slaughter on a most reckless and improvident scale the innumerable shoal of spawn and small fish that have be feed in the rice field warn by some instinct seek the lake and main stream as they try to get they way back however they find at each outlet in each ditch and field a deadly wicker trap in the shape of a square basket with a v-shaped opening lead into it through which the stream make its way after enter this basket there be no egress except through the narrow opening and they be trap thus in countless thousand other of the native in mere wantonness put a shelf of reed or rush in the bed of the stream with a upward slope as the water rush along the little fish be leave high and dry on this shelf or screen and the water run off below in this way scarcely a fish escape and as million be too small to be eat it be a most serious waste the attention of government have be direct to the subject and step may be take to stop such a reckless and wholesale destruction of a valuable food supply in some part of purneah and bhaugulpore i have see a most ingenious method adopt by the _ mulla _ a gang of four or five enter the stream and travel slowly downward stir up the mud at the bottom with they foot the fish ascend the stream to escape the mud get entangled in the weed the fisherman feel they with they foot amongst the weed and immediately pounce on they with they hand each man have a _ gilum _ or earthen pot attach by a string to he waist and float behind he in the water i have see four man fill they earthen pot in less than a hour by this ingenious but primitive mode of fishing some of they can use they foot almost as well for grasp purpose as they hand another mode of capture be by a small net a flat piece of net be spread over a hoop to which four or five piece of bamboo be attach rise up and meeting in the center so as to form a sort of miniature skeleton tent-like frame over the net the hoop with the net stretch tight across be then press down flat on the bottom of the tank or stream if any fish be beneath they effort to escape agitate the net the motion be communicate to the fisherman by a string from the center of the net which be roll round the fisherman 's thumb when the jerking of he thumb announce a captive fish he put down he left hand and secure he victim the _ bantur _ _ nepaulee _ and other jungle tribe also often use the bow and arrow as a means of secure fish seat on the branch of some overhang tree while he keen eye scan the depths below he watch for a large fish and as it pass he let fly he arrow with unerring aim and impale the luckless victim some tribe fish at night by torchlight spear the fish who be attract by the light in nepaul the bark of the _ hill sirre _ be often use to poison a stream or piece of water pound up and throw in it seem to have some uncommon effect on the fish after water have be treat in this way the fish seemingly quite stupefied rise to the surface on which they float in great number and allow themselves to be catch the strangest part of it be that they be perfectly innocuous as food notwithstanding this treatment fish form a very favorite article of diet with both mussulman and hindoo many of the latter take a vow to touch no flesh of any kind they be call _ kunthee _ or _ boghut _ but a _ boghut _ be more of a ascetic than a _ kunthee _ however the _ kunthee _ be glad of a fish dinner when he can get it they be restricted to no particular sect or caste but all who have take the vow wear a peculiar necklace make generally of sandal-wood bead or _ neem _ bead round they throat hence the name from _ kunth _ mean the throat the right to fish in any particular piece of water be let out by the proprietor on whose land the water lie or through which it flow the let be generally do by auction yearly the fishing be call a _ shilkur _ from _ shal _ a net it be generally take by some rich _ bunneah _ -lrb- grain seller -rrb- or village banker who sub-let it in turn to the fisherman in some of the tank which be not so let and where the native proprietor preserve the fish first-class sport can be have a common native poach dodge be this : if some oil cake be throw into the water a few hour previous to you fishing or better still ball make of roasted linseed meal mix with bruise leaf of the ` sweet basil ' or _ toolsee _ plant the fish assemble in hundred round the spot and devour the bait greedily with a good eighteen-foot rod fish of from twelve to twenty pound be not uncommonly catch and will give good play too fishing in the plain of indium be however rather tame sport at the best of time you have hear of the famous _ mahseer _ -- some of they over eighty or a hundred pound weight we have none of these in behar but the huge porpoise give splendid rifle or carbine practice as he roll through the turgid stream they be difficult to hit but i have see several kill with ball and the oil extract from they body be a splendid dress for harness but the most exciting fishing i have ever see be -- what do you think -- alligator fishing yes the formidable scaly monster with he square snout and terrible jaw he ponderous body cover with armor and he serrated tail with which he could break the leg of a bullock or smash a outrigger as easily as a whale could smash a jolly-boat i must try to describe one day 's alligator fishing when i be down in bhaugulpore i go out frequently fishing in the various tank and stream near my factory my friend pat who be a keen sportsman and very fond of angle write to I one day when he and he brother willie be go out to the teljuga ask I to join they party the teljuga be the boundary stream between tirhoot and bhaugulpore and its sluggish muddy water teem with alligator -- the regular square-nosed _ mugger _ the terrible man-eater the _ nakar _ or long-nosed species may be see in countless number in any of the large stream stretch out on the bank bask in the noonday sun go down the koosee particularly you come across hundred sometimes lie on one bank as the boat near they they slide noiselessly and slowly into the stream a large excrescence form on the tip of the long snout like a huge sponge and this be often all that be see on the surface of the water as the huge brute swim about wait for he prey these _ nakar _ or long-nosed specimen never attack human being -- at least such case be very very rare -- but live almost entirely on fish i remember see one catch a paddy-bird on one occasion near the junction of the koosee with the gange my boat be fasten to the shore near a slimy creek that come ooze into the river from some dense jungle near i be wash my hand and face on the bank and the boatman be fishing with a small hand-net for we breakfast number of attenuate melancholy-looking paddy-bird be stalk solemnly and stiltedly along the bank also fishing for _ theirs _ i notice one who be particularly greedy with he long leg half immerse in the water constantly dart out he long bill and bring up a hapless struggle fish all of a sudden a long snout and the ugly serrated ridgy back of a _ nakar _ be shoot like lightning at the hapless bird and right before we eye the poor paddy be crunch up as a rule however alligator confine themselves to a fish diet and be glad of any refuse or dead animal that may float they way but with the _ mugger _ the _ boach _ or square-nosed variety ` all be fish that come to he net ' he soul delight in young dog or live pork a fat duck come not amiss and impel by hunger he hesitate not to attack man once regale with the flavor of human flesh he take up he stand near some ferry or bathing ghaut where many hapless woman and child often fall victim to he unholy appetite before he career be cut short i remember shoot one ghastly old scaly villain in a tank near ryseree he have make this tank he home and with that fatalism which be so characteristic of the hindoo the usual ablutions and bathing go on as if no such monster exist several woman have be carry off however at short interval the villager ask I to try and rid they of they foe i take a ride down to the tank one Friday morning and find the bank a scene of great excitement a woman have be carry off some hour before as she be fill she water jar and the monster be now repose at the bottom of the tank digest he horrible meal the tank be cover with crimson water-lily in full bloom they broad brown and green leaf show off the crimson beauty of the open flower at the north corner some wild rise bush drop over the water cast a dense matted shade here be the haunt of the _ mugger _ he have excavate a huge gloomy-looking hole into which he retire when gorge with prey my first care be to cut away some of these bush and then find he be not at home we drive some bamboo stake through the bank to prevent he get into he _ manu _ which be what the native term the den or hole i then sit down under a _ goolar _ tree to wait for he appearance the _ goolar _ be a species of fig and the leaf be much relish by cattle and goat gradually the village boy and young man go off to they ploughing or grass cutting for the cow ' evening meal a woman come down occasionally to fill she waterpot in evident fear and tremble a swarm of _ mina _ -lrb- the indian starling -rrb- hop and twitter round my foot the cooing of a pair of amatory pigeon overhead nearly lull I to slumber a flock of green parrot come swiftly circle overhead make for the fig-tree at the south end of the tank a occasional _ raho _ lazily rise among the water-lily and disappear with a indolent flap of he tail the brilliant kingfisher resplendent in crimson and emerald sit on the withered branch of a prostrate mango-tree close by plume he feather and doubtless meditate on the vanity of life suddenly close by the massive post which mark the center of every hindoo tank a huge scaly snout slowly and almost imperceptibly rise to the surface then a broad flat forbid forehead top by two gray fishy eye with warty-looking callosity for eyebrow just then a eager urchin who have be squat by I for hour point to the brute it be enough down sink the loathsome creature and we have to resume we attitude of expectation and patient wait another hour pass slowly it be the middle of the afternoon and very hot i have send my _ tokedar _ off for a ` peg ' to the factory and be begin to get very drowsy when right in the same spot the repulsive head again rise slowly to the surface i have my trusty no 12 to my shoulder on the instant glance carefully along the barrel but just then only the eye of the brute be invisible a moment of intense excitement follow and then embolden by the extreme stillness he show he whole head above the surface i pull the trigger and a meade shell crash through the monster 's skull scatter he brain in the water and actually send one splinter of the skull to the opposite edge of the tank where my little hindoo boy pick it up and bring it to I there be a mighty agitation in the water the water-lily rock to and fro and the broad leave glitter with the water drop throw on they then all be still hear the report of my gun the native come flock to the spot and tell they they enemy be slay i depart leave instruction to let I know when the body come to the surface it do so three day later get some _ chumar _ and _ dome _ -lrb- two of the lowest caste as none of the higher caste will touch a dead body under pain of lose caste -rrb- we haul the putrid carcase to shore and on cut it open find the glass armlet and brass ornament of no less than five woman and the silver ornament of three child all in a lump in the brute 's stomach its skull be completely smash and shatter to piece by my shot its tooth be crust with tartar and worn almost to the very stump it measure nineteen foot but during this digression my friend pat and willie have be wait on the bank of the ` teljuga ' i reach they tent late at night find they both in high spirit after a good day 's execution among the duck and teal and preparation be make for catch a alligator next day up early in the morning we beat some grass close by the stream and rouse out a enormous boar that give we a three mile spin and a good fight after pat have give he first spear after breakfast we get we tackle ready this be a large iron hook with a strong shank to which be attach a stout iron ring to this ring a long thick rope be fasten and i notice for several yard the strand be all loose and detach and only knot at interval i ask pat the reason of this curious arrangement and be tell that if we be lucky enough to secure a _ mugger _ the loose strand would entangle themselves amongst he formidable tooth whereas be the rope in one strand only he might bite it through the knotting at interval be to give greater strength to the line we now get we bait ready on this occasion it be a live tame duck pass the bend of the hook round its neck and the shank under its right wing we tie the hook in this position with thread we then make a small raft of the soft pith of the plantain-tree tie the duck to the raft and commit it to the stream hold the rope as clear of the water as we could the poor quack duck float slowly down the muddy current make a occasional vain effort to get free we see at a distance a ugly snout rise to the surface for a instant and then noiselessly disappear ` there be one ' say pat in a whisper ` be sure and not strike too soon ' say willie ` look out there you lazy rascal ' this in hindostanee to the groom and servant who be with we again the black mass rise to the surface but this time nearer to the fate duck as if aware of its peril it now struggle and quack most vociferously nearer and nearer each time the black snout rise and then each time silently disappear beneath the turgid muddy stream now it appear again this time there be two and there be another at a distance attract by the quacking of the duck we on the bank cower down and go as noiselessly as we can sometimes the rope dip on the water and the huge snout and stare eye immediately disappear at length it rise within a few yard of the duck then there be a mighty rush two huge jaw open and shut with a snap like factory shears and amid a whirl of foam and water and surge mud the poor duck and the hideous reptile disappear and but for the eddy swirl and dense volume of mud that rise from the bottom nothing give evidence of the tragedy that have be enact the other two disappointed monster swim to and fro still further disturb the muddy current ` give he lot of time to swallow ' yell pat now fairly mad with excitement the groom and grass-cutter howl and dance willie and i dig each other in the rib and all generally act in a excited and insane way pat now put the rope over he shoulder we all take hold and with a ` one two three ' we make a simultaneous rush from the bank and as the rope suddenly tighten with a pull and strain that nearly jerk we all on we back we feel that we have hook the monster and we excitement reach its culminate point what a commotion now in the black depths of the muddy stream the water lash by he powerful tail surge and dash in eddy whirl he rise and dart backwards and forwards snap he horrible jaw move he head from side to side he eye glare with fury we hold stoutly on to the rope although we wrist be strain and we arm ache at length he begin to feel we steady pull and inch by inch struggle demoniacally he near the bank when once he reach it however the unite effort of twice we number would fail to bring he farther bleeding and foam at the mouth he horrid tooth glisten amid the frothy blood-flecked foam he plant he strong curved fore-leg against the shelve bank and tug and strain at the rope with devilish force and fury it be no use -- the rope have be test and answer bravely to the strain and now with a long boar spear pat cautiously descend the bank and give he a deadly thrust under the fore arm with a last fiendish glare of hate and defiance he spring forward we haul in the rope pat nimbly jump back and a pistol shot through the eye settle the monster for ever this be the first alligator i ever see hooked he measure sixteen and a half foot exactly but word can give no idea of half the excitement that attend the capture chapter vii native superstition -- charming a bewitch woman -- exorcise ghost from a field -- witchcraft -- the witchfinder or ` ojah ' -- influence of fear -- snake bite -- how to cure they -- how to discover a thief -- ghost and they habit -- the ` haddick ' or native bone-setter -- cruelty to animal by native the native as a rule and especially the lower class be excessively superstitious they be afraid to go out after nightfall believe that then the spirit of the dead walk abroad it be almost impossible to get a coolie or even a fairly intelligent servant to go a message at night unless you give he another man for company a belief in witch be quite prevalent and there be scarcely a village in behar that do not contain some withered old crone repute and firmly believe to be a witch other either young or old be believe to have the evil eye and as in scotland some century ago there be also witch-finder and sorcerer who will sell charm cast nativity give divination or ward off the evil effort of wizard and witch by powerful spell when a wealthy man have a child bear the brahmin cast the nativity of the infant on some auspicious day they fix on the name and settle the date for the baptismal ceremony i remember a man come to I on one occasion from the village of kuppoorpuckree he rush up to where i be sit in the verandah throw himself at my foot with tear stream down he cheek and amid loud cry for pity and help tell I that he wife have just be bewitch get he somewhat soothe and pacify i learn that a reputed witch live next door to he house that she and the man 's wife have quarrel in the morning about some capsicum which the witch be try to steal from he garden that in the evening as he wife be wash herself inside the _ angana _ or little courtyard appertain to he house she be seize with cramp and shiver fit and be now in a rage fever that the witch have be also bathing at the time and that the water from she body have splash over this man 's fence and part of it have come in contact with he wife 's body -- hence undoubtedly this strange possession he wish I to send peon at once and have the witch seize beat and expel from the village it would have be no use my try to persuade he that no witchcraft exist so i give he a good dose of quinine for he wife which she be to take as soon as the fit subside next i get my old _ moonshee _ or native writer to write some persian character on a piece of paper i then give he this paper mutter a bit of english rhyme at the time and tell he this be a powerful spell i tell he to take three hair from he wife 's head and a pare from she thumb and big toe nail and at the rising of the moon to burn they outside the wall of he hut the poor fellow take the quinine and the paper with the deepest reverence make I a most lowly _ salaam _ or obeisance and depart with a light heart he carry out my instruction to the letter the quinine act like a charm on the feverish woman and i find myself quite a famous witch-doctor there be a nice flat little field close to the water at parewah in which i think i could get a good crop of oats during the cold weather i send for the ` dangur ' mate and ask they to have it dig up next day they hum and haw and hesitate as i think in rather a strange manner but depart in the evening back they come to tell I that the dangurs would _ not _ dig up the field ` why ' i ask ` well you see sahib ' say old teerbouan who be the patriarch and chief spokesman of the village ` this field have be use for year as a burning ghaut ' -lrb- ie a place where the body of dead hindoo be bury -rrb- ` well ' say i ` well sahib my man say that if they disturb this land the bhoot -lrb- ghost -rrb- of all those who have be burn there will haunt the village at night and they hope you will not persist in ask they to dig up the land ' ` very well bring down the man with they digging-hoe and i will see ' accordingly next morning i go down on my pony find the dangurs all assemble but no digging go on i call they together tell they that it be a very reasonable fear they have but that i would cast such a spell on the land as would settle the ghost of the depart for ever i then get a branch of a _ bael _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- tree that grow close by dip it in the stream and walk backwards round the ground wave the drip branch round my head repeat at the same time the first gibberish that come into my recollection my incantation or spell be as follow a old scotch rhyme i have often repeat when a child at school -- ` eenerty feenerty fickerty feg ell dell domun 's egg irky birky story rock a tan toose jock black fish white troot gibbie gaw ye be oot ' it have the desire effect no sooner be my charm utter than after a few encouraging word to the man tell they that there be now no fear that my charm be powerful enough to lay all the spirit in the country and that i would take all the responsibility they set to work with a will and have the whole field dig up by the evening i have see many such case a blight attack the melon or cucumber bed a fierce wind rise during the night and shake half the mango off the tree the youngest child be attack with teethe convulsion the plough-bullock be accidentally lame or the favorite cow refuse to give milk in every case it be some ` dyne ' or witch that have be at work with she damnable spell and charm i remember a case in which a poor little child have bad convulsion the ` ojah ' or witch-finder in this case a fat greasy oleaginous knave be send for full of importance and blow like a porpoise he come and cause the child to be bring to he under a tree near the village i be pass at the time and stop out of curiosity he spread a tattered cloth in front of he and mutter some unintelligible gibberish unceasingly make strange pass with he arm he put down a number of article on he cloth -- which be villainously tattered and greasy -- a unripe plantain a handful of rice of parched pea a thigh bone two wooden cup some ball & c & c all of which he keep constantly lift and move about keep up the pass and mutter all the time the child be a sickly-looking pine sort of creature rock about in evident pain and moaning and fret just as sick child do gradually its attention get fix on the strange antic go on the ojah keep mutter away quicker and quicker constantly shift the bone and cup and other article on the cloth he body be suffuse with perspiration but in about half a hour the child have go off to sleep and attend by some dozen old woman and the anxious father be bear off in triumph to the house another time one of mr d 's female servant get bite by a scorpion the poor woman be in great agony with she arm swell up when a ojah be call in set she before he he begin he incantation in the usual manner but make frequent pass over she body and over the bitten place a gentle perspiration begin to break out on she skin and in a very short time the ojah have throw she into a deep mesmeric sleep after about a hour she awake perfectly free from pain in this case no doubt the ojah be a mesmerist the influence of fear on the ordinary native be most wonderful i have know dozen of instance in which native have be bring home at night for treatment in case of snake-bite they have arrive at the factory in a complete state of coma with closed eye the pupil turn back in the head the whole body rigid and cold the lip pale white and the tongue firmly lock between the tooth i do not believe in recovery from a really poisonous bite where the venom have be truly inject i invariably ask first how long it be since the infliction of the bite i would then examine the mark and as a rule would find they very slight when the patient have be bring some distance i know at once that it be a case of pure fright the native wrap themselves up in they cloth or blanket at night and lie down on the floor of they hut turn about or get up for water or tobacco or perhaps to put fuel on the fire they unluckily tread on a snake or during sleep they roll over on one the snake give they a nip and scuttle off they have not see what sort of snake it be but they imagination conjure up the very worst after the first outcry when the whole house be alarm the man sit down firmly possess by the idea that he be mortally bite gradually he fear work the effect a real poisonous bite would produce he eye get dull he pulse grow feeble he extremity cold and numb and unless forcibly rouse by the bystander he will actually succumb to pure fright not to the snake-bite at all my chief care when a case of this sort be bring I be to assume a cheery demeanor laugh to scorn the fear of the relative and tell they he would be all right in a few hour if they attend to my direction this not uncommonly work by sympathetic influence on the patient himself i believe so long as all round he think he be go to die and expect no other result the same effect be produce on he own mind as soon as hope spring up in the breast of all around he he spirit also catch the contagion as a rule he would now make a effort to articulate i would then administer a good dose of sal volatile brandy eau-de-luce or other strong stimulant cut into the suppose bite and apply strong nitric acid to the wound this generally make he wince and i would hail it as a token of certain recovery by this time some confidence would return and the suppose die man would soon walk back sound and whole among he companion after profuse expression of gratitude to he preserver i have treat dozen of case in this way successfully and only see two death one be a young woman my chowkeydar 's daughter the other be a old man who be already dead when they lift he out of the basket in which they have sling he i do not wish to be misunderstand i believe that in all these case of recovery it be pure fright work on the imagination and not snake-bite at all my opinion be share by most planter that there be no cure yet know for a cobra bite or for that of any other poisonous snake where the poison have once be fairly inject and allow to mix with the blood -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be another curious instance of the effect of fear on the native mind in the common method take by a ojah or brahmin to discover a suspect thief when a theft occur the ojah be send for and the suspect party be bring together after various _ muntra _ ie charm or incantation have be mutter the ojah who have meanwhile narrowly scrutinize each countenance give each of the suspect individual a small quantity of dry rice to chew if the thief be present he superstitious fear be at work and he conscience accuse he he see some terrible retribution for he in all these _ muntra _ and he heart become like water within he he tongue get dry he salivary gland refuse to act the innocent munch away at they rice contentedly but the guilty wretch feel as if he have ash in he mouth at a give signal all spit out they rice and he whose rice come out chew indeed but dry as summer dust be adjudge the thief this ordeal be call _ chowl chipao _ and be rarely unsuccessful i have know several case in my own experience in which a thief have be thus discover the _ bhoot _ or ghost be popularly suppose to have favorite haunt generally in some specially select tree the _ neem _ tree be suppose to be the most patronise the most intelligent native share this belief with the poorest and most ignorant they fancy the ghost throw stone at they cast evil influence over they lure they into quicksand and play other devilish trick and cantrip some road be quite shun and desert at night for no other reason than that a ghost be suppose to haunt the place the most tempting bribe would not make a native walk alone over that road after sunset besides the witchfinder another important village functionary who rely much on muntra and charm be the _ huddick _ or cow doctor he be the only veterinary surgeon of the native when he cow or bullock dislocate or break a limb or fall ill the huddick pass he hand over the affected part and mutter he _ muntra _ which have most probably descend to he from he father usually know a little of the anatomical structure of the animal he may be able to reduce a dislocation or roughly to set a fracture but if the ailment be internal a draught of mustard oil or some pounded spice and turmeric or neem leaf administer along with the _ muntra _ be suppose to be all that human skill and science can do the native be cruel to animal half-starved bullock be shamefully overworked when blow fail to make the ill-starred brute move they give a twist and wrench to the tail which must cause the animal exquisite torture and unless the hapless beast be utterly exhaust this generally induce it to make a further effort ploughman very often deliberately make a raw open sore one on each rump of the plough-bullock they goad the poor wretch on this raw sore with a sharp-pointed stick when he lag or when they think he need stir up pony too be always work far too young and they miserable leg get frightfully twisted and bent the petty shopkeeper seller of brass pot grain spice and other bazaar wares who attend the various bazaar or weekly and bi-weekly market transport they goods by means of these pony the pack of merchandise be sling on rough pack-saddle make of coarse sack shamble along with knee bent together sore on every joint and frequently a eye knock out the poor pony 's back get cruelly gall when the bazaar be reach he be hobble as tightly as possible the coarse rope cut into the flesh and he be then turn adrift to contemplate starvation on the burnt-up grass great open sore form on the back on which a plaster of moist clay or cowdung and pound leaf be roughly put the wretched creature get worn to a skeleton a little common care and cleanliness would put he right with a little kindly consideration from he brutal master but what do the _ kulwar _ or _ bunneah _ care he be too lazy this unfeeling cruelty and callous indifference to the suffering of the lower animal be a cry evil and every magistrate european and educate native might do much to ease they burden tremendous number of bullock and pony die from sheer neglect and ill treatment every year it be now become so serious a trouble that in many village plough-bullock be too few in number for the area of land under cultivation the tillage suffer the crop deteriorate this react on price the ryot sink lower and lower and get more into the grasp of the rapacious money-lender in many village i have see whole tract of land relapse into _ purtee _ or untilled waste simply from want of bullock to draw the plough severe epidemic like foot and mouth disease and pleuro occasionally sweep off great number but i repeat that annually the life of hundred of valuable animal be sacrifice by sheer sloth dirt inattention and brutal cruelty in some part of indium cattle poisoning for the sake of the hide be extensively practice the _ chumar _ that be the shoemaker furrier tanner and worker in leather and skin generally frequently combine together in place and wilfully poison cattle and buffalo there be actually a section in the penal code take cognisance of the crime the hindoo will not touch a dead carcase so that when a bullock mysteriously sicken and die the _ chumar _ haul away the body and appropriate the skin some luckless witch be blame for the misfortune when the rascally chumar themselves be all the while the real culprit the police however be pretty successful in detect this crime and it be not now of such frequent occurrence -lrb- 3 -rrb- highly as the pious hindoo venerate the sacred bull of shira he treatment of he mild patient beast of burden be a foul blot on he character be you to shoot a cow or be a mussulman to wind a stray bullock which might have trespass and be trample down he opium or he tobacco crop and ruin he field the hindoo would rise _ en masse _ to revenge the insult offer to they religion yet they scruple not to goad they bullock beat they half starve they and let they gaping wound fester and become corrupt when the poor brute become old and unable to work and he worn-out tooth unfit to graze he be ruthlessly turn out to die in a ditch and be tear to piece by jackal kite and vulture the higher class and well-to-do farmer show much consideration for high-priced well-conditioned animal but when they get old or unwell and demand redouble care and attention they be too often neglect till from sheer want of ordinary care they rot and die -lrb- 1 -rrb- the _ bael _ or wood-apple be a sacred wood with hindoo it be enjoin in the shastra that the body of the dead should be consume in a fire feed by log of bael-tree but where it be not procurable in sufficient quantity the native compound with they conscience by light the funeral pyre with a branch from the bael-tree it be a fine yellow-coloured pretty durable wood and make excellent furniture a very fine sherbet can be make from the fruit which act as a excellent corrective and stomachic -lrb- 2 -rrb- death from actual snake bite be sadly numerous but it appear from return furnish to the indian government that european enjoy a very happy exemption during the last forty year it would seem that only two european have be kill by snake bite at least only two well substantiate case the poorer class be the most frequent victim they universal habit of walk about unshod and sleep on the ground penetrate into the grass or jungle in pursuit of they daily avocation no doubt conduce much to the frequency of such accident a good plan to keep snake out of the bungalow be to leave a space all round the room of about four inch between the wall and the edge of the mat have this wash over about once a week with a strong solution of carbolic acid and water the smell may be unpleasant for a short time but it prove equally so to the snake and i have prove by experience that it keep they out of the room mat should also be all firmly fasten down to the floor with bamboo batten and furniture should be often move and keep raise a little from the ground and the space below carefully sweep every day at night a light should always be keep burning in occupied bedroom and on no account should one get out of bed in the dark or walk about the room at night without slipper or shoe -lrb- 3 -rrb- somewhat analogous to this be the custom which use to be a common one in some part of behar _ koombar _ and _ granns _ that be tile-makers and thatcher when trade be dull or rain impend would scatter pea and grain in the interstice of the tile on the house of the well-to-do the pigeon and crow in they effort to get at the pea would loosen and perhaps overturn a few of the tile the granns would be send for to replace these would condemn the whole roof as leaky and the tile as old and unfit for use and would provide a job for himself and the tile-maker the nefarious profit of which they would share together cultivator of thatching-grass have be know deliberately and wantonly to set fire to village simply to raise the price of thatch and bamboo chapter viii we annual race meet -- the arrival -- the camp -- the ` ordinary ' -- the course -- ` they be off ' -- the race -- the steeple-chase -- incident of the meet -- the ball we annual

and other game go on until dinner-time i could linger lovingly over a camp dinner the rare dish the sparkling conversation the racy anecdote and the general jollity and brotherly feeling but we must all dress for the ball and so about 9 pm the buggy be again in requisition for the ball room -- the fine large central apartment in the planter ' club the wall be festoon with flower gay curtain flag

hand-squeeze the ball go gaily on till the steward announce supper at this -- to the wall-flower -- welcome announcement we adjourn from the heated ball-room to the cool arbour-like supper tent where every delicacy that can charm the eye or tempt the appetite be spread out next morning early we be out with the hound and enjoy a rattle burst round by the racecourse where the horse be at exercise perchance we have hear of a boar in the sugar-cane and away we go with beater to rouse the grisly monster from he lair in the afternoon there be hockey on horseback or volunteer drill with we gallant adjutant put we through we evolution in the evening there be the usual drive dinner music and the ordinary and so the meet go on a constant succession of gaiety keep everyone alive till the time arrive for a return to we respective factory and another year 's hard work -lrb- 1 -rrb- in such a limited society every peculiarity be note all we antecedent be know personal predilection and little foible of character be marked eccentricity be watch and no one let he be as uninteresting as a miller 's pig be allow to escape observation and remark some little peculiarity be hit upon and a strange but often very happily expressive nickname stamp one 's individuality and photograph he with a word chapter ix pig-sticking in indium -- variety of boar -- they size and height -- ingenious mode of capture by the native -- the ` batan ' or buffalo herd -- pig charge -- they courage and ferocity -- destruction of game -- a close season for game the sport _ par excellence _ of indium be pig-sticking call it hog-hunting if you will i prefer the honest old-fashioned name with a good horse under one a fair country with not too many pitfall and ` lot of pig ' this sport become the most exciting that can be practice some prefer tiger shooting from elephant other like to stalk the lordly ibex on the steep himalayan slope but anyone who have ever enjoy a rattle after a pig over a good country will recall the fierce delight the eager thrill the wild mad excitement that flush he whole frame as he meet the infuriate charge of a good thirty-inch fighting boar and drive he trusty spear well home lay low the gallant gray tusker the indomitable unconquerable grisly boar the subject be well worn and though the theme be a noble one there be but few i fancy who have not read the record of some gallant fight where the highest skill the finest ride the most undaunted pluck and the cool keen daring of a practiced hand be not _ always _ successful against the headlong rush and furious charge of a bengal boar at bay a record of planter life in indium however such as this aim at be would be incomplete without some reference to the gallant tusker and so at the risk of tire my reader i must try to describe a pig-sticking party there be two distinct kind of boar in indium the black and the gray they disposition be very different the gray be fiercer and more pugnacious he be a vicious and implacable foe when rouse and always shew better fight than the black variety the great difference however be in the shape of the skull that of the black fellow be high over the frontal bone and not very long in proportion to height while the skull of the gray boar be never very high but be long and recede in proportion to height the black boar grow to a enormous size and the gray one be generally speak smaller make animal than the black the young of the two also differ in at least one important particular those of the gray pig be always bear striped but the young of the black variety be bear of that color and be not striped but a uniform black color throughout the two kind of pig sometimes interbreed but cross be not common and from the color size shape of the head and general behavior one can easily tell at a glance what kind of pig get up before he spear whether it be the heavy sluggish black boar or the veritable fiery vicious fighting gray tusker many story be tell of they enormous size and a ` forty-inch tusker ' be the established standard for a goliath among boar the best fighting boar however range from twenty-eight to thirty-two inch in height and i make bold to say that very few of the present generation of sportsman have ever see a veritable wild boar over thirty-eight inch high g who have have perhaps as much jungle experience as any man of he age in indium a careful observer and a finish sportsman tell I that the biggest _ boar _ he ever see be only thirty-eight inch high while the biggest _ pig _ he ever kill be a barren sow with three-inch tusk stick out of she gum she measure thirty-nine-and-a-half inch and fight like a demon i have shoot pig -- in heavy jungle where spear be impracticable -- over thirty-six inch high but the biggest pig i ever stick to my own spear be only twenty-eight inch and i do not think any pig have be kill in chumparun within the last ten or a dozen year at any rate over thirty-eight inch in some part of indium where pig be numerous and the jungle dense the native adopt a very ingenious mode of hunting i have frequently see it practice by the cowherd on the koosee _ derah _ ie the flat swampy jungle on the bank of the koosee when the annual flood have subside leave behind a thick deposit of mud wrack and brushwood the long thick grass soon shoot up to a amazing height and vast herd of cattle and tame buffalo come down to the jungle from the interior of the country where natural pasture be scarce they be attend by the owner and he assistant all generally belong to the _ guallum _ or cowherd caste although of course there be other caste employ the owner of the herd get leave to graze he cattle in the jungle by pay a certain fixed sum per head he fix on a high dry ridge of land where he run up a few grass hut for himself and man and there he erect line of grass and bamboo screen behind which he cattle take shelter at night from the cold south-east wind there be also a few hut of exceedingly frail construction for himself and he people this small colony in the midst of the universal jungle cover the country for mile round be call a _ batan _ at earliest dawn the buffalo be milk and then with they attendant herdsman they wend they way to the jungle where they spend the day and return again to the batan at night when they be again milk the milk be make into _ ghee _ or clarify butter and large quantity be send down to the town by country boat when we want to get up a hunt we generally send to the nearest _ batan _ for _ khubber _ ie news information the _ batanea _ or proprietor of the establishment be well post up every herdsman as he come in at night tell what animal he have see through the day and thus at the _ batan _ you hear where tiger and pig and deer be to be meet with where a unlucky cow have be kill in what ravine be the thickest jungle where the path be free from clay or quicksand what ford be safest and in short you get complete information on every point connect with the jungle and its wild inhabitant to these man the mysterious jungle reveal its most hidden secret surround by he herd of buffalo the _ guallum _ venture into the darkest recess and the most tangled thicket they have strange wild call by which they give each other notice of the approach of danger and when two or three of they meet each arm with he heavy iron-shod or brass-bound _ lathee _ or quarter staff they will not budge a inch out of they way for buffalo or boar nay they have be know to face the terrible tiger himself and fairly beat he away from the quiver carcase of some unlucky member of they herd they have generally some favorite buffalo on whose broad back they perch themselves as it browse through the jungle and from this elevated seat they survey the rest of the herd and note the incident of jungle life when they wish a little excitement or a change from they milk and rice diet there be hundred of pig around they have a broad sharp spear-head to which be attach a stout cord often make of twisted hide or hair into the socket of the spear be thrust a bamboo pole or shaft tough pliant and flexible the cord be wind round the spear and shaft and the loose end be then fasten to the middle of the pole have thus prepared he weapon the herdsman mount he buffalo and guide it slowly warily and cautiously to the haunt of the pig these be of course quite accustomed to see the buffalo grazing round they on all side and take no notice until the _ guallum _ be within striking distance when he have get close up to the pig he fancy he throw he spear with all he force the pig naturally bound off the shaft come out of the socket leave the spearhead sticking in the wound the rope uncoil of itself but be firmly fasten to the bamboo it bring up the pig at each bush and tear and lacerate the wound until either the spearhead come out or the wretched pig drop down dead from exhaustion and loss of blood the _ guallum _ follow upon he buffalo and frequently finish the pig with a few stroke of he _ lathee _ in any case he get he pork and it certainly be a ingenious and bold way of procure it wild pig be very destructive to crop during the night they revel in the cultivate field contiguous to the jungle and they destroy more by root up than by actually eat it be common for the ryot to dig a shallow pit and ensconce himself inside with he matchlock beside he he head be on a level with the ground he can discern any animal that come between he and the sky-line when a pig come in sight he wait till he be within sure distance and then put either a bullet or a charge of slug into he the pig be perhaps the most stubborn and courageous animal in indium even when pierce with several spear and bleed from numerous wound he preserve a sullen silence he disdain to utter a cry of fear and pain but maintain a bold front to the last and die with he face to the foe defiant and unconquered when hard press he scorn to continue he flight but wheeling round he make a determine charge very frequently to the utter discomfiture of he pursuer i have see many a fine horse fearfully cut by a charge pig and a determine boar over and over again break through a line of elephant and make good he escape there be no animal in all the vast jungle that the elephant dread more than a lusty boar i have see elephant that would stand the repeat charge of a wounded tiger turn tail and take to ignominious flight before the onset of a angry boar he thick short neck ponderous body and wedge-like head be admirably fit for crash through the thick jungle he inhabit and when he have make up he mind to charge very few animal can withstand he furious rush instance be quite common of he have make good he charge against a line of elephant cut and rip more than one severely he have be know to encounter successfully even the kingly tiger himself can it be wonder then that we consider he a ` foeman worthy of we steel ' to be a good pig-sticker be a recommendation that win acceptance everywhere in indium in a district like chumparun where nearly every planter be a ardent sportsman a good rider and spend nearly half he time on horseback pig-sticking be a favorite pastime every factory have at least one bit of likely jungle close by where a pig could always be find when i first go to indium we use to take out we pig-spear over the _ zillah _ with we as a matter of course as we never know when we might hit on a boar thing be very different now cultivation have much increase many of the old jungle have be reclaim and i fancy many more pig be shoot by native than formerly a gun can be have now for a few rupee and every loaf ` ne'er do weel ' in the village manage to procure one and wages indiscriminate warfare on bird and beast it be a grow evil and threaten the total extinction of sport in some district i can remember when nearly every tank be good for a few brace of mallard duck or teal where never a feather be now to be see save the ubiquitous paddy-bird jungle where a pig be a certain find only now contain a measly jackal and not always that and cover in which partridge quail and sometimes even florican be numerous be now only tenant by the great ground-owl or a colony of field rat i be far from wish to limit sport to the european community i would let every native that so wish sport he double barrel or handle he spear with the best of we but he should follow and indulge in he sport with reason the breed season of all animal should be respect and there should be no indiscriminate slaughter of male and female young and old until all true sportsman in indium unite in this matter the evil will increase and bye-and-bye there will be no animal leave to afford sport of any kind there be case where wild animal be so numerous and destructive that extraordinary measure have to be take for protection from they ravages but these be very rare i remember have once to wage a war of extermination against a colony of pig that have take possession of some jungle land near maharjnugger a village on the koosee i have a deal of indigo grow on clear patch at interval in the jungle and there the pig would root and revel in spite of watchman till at last i be force in sheer self-defence to begin a crusade against they we get a line of elephant and two or three friend come to assist and in one day and round one village only we shoot sixty-three full grown pig the villager must have kill and carry away nearly double that number of young and wound that be a very extreme case and in a pure jungle country but in settle district like tirhoot and chumparun the weaker sex should always be spare and a close season for winged game should be insist on to the credit of the planter be it say that this necessity be quite recognize but every pot-bellied native who can beg borrow or steal a gun or in any way procure one be constantly on the look out for a pot shot at some unlucky hen-partridge or quail a whole village will turn out to compass the destruction of some wretched sow that may have shewn she bristle outside the jungle in the daytime in district where cultivate land be scarce and population scatter it be almost impossible to enjoy pig-stick the break of open land between the jungle be too small and narrow to afford gallop space and though you turn the pig out of one patch of jungle he immediately find safe shelter in the next on the bank of some of the large river however such as the gunduch and the bagmuttee there be vast stretch of undulating sand cross at interval by narrow creek and spot by patch of close thick jungle here the gray tusker take up he abode with he harem when once you turn he out from he lair there be grand hunting room before he can reach the distant patch of jungle to which he direct he flight in some part the _ jowah _ -lrb- a plant not unlike broom in appearance -rrb- be so thick that even the elephant can scarcely force they way through but as a rule the beating be pretty easy and one be almost sure of a find chapter x kuderent jungle -- charge by a pig -- the biter bit -- ` mac ' after the big boar -- the horse for pig-sticking -- the line of beater -- the boar break -- ` away away ' -- first spear -- pig-sticking at peeprah -- the old ` lungra ' or cripple -- a boar at bay -- hurrah for pig-sticking there be a very fine pig jungle at a place call kuderent belong to a wealthy landowner who go by the name of the mudhobunny baboo we occasionally have a pig-sticking meet here and as the jungle be strictly preserve we be never disappoint in find plenty who give we glorious sport the jungle consist of great grass plain with thickly wooded patch of dense tree jungle intersect here and there by deep ravine with stagnant pool of water at interval the steep side all thickly clothe with thorny cluster of the wild dog-rose it be a difficult country to beat and we have always to supplement the usual gang of beater with as many elephant as we could collect in the center of the jungle be a eminence of considerable height whence there be a magnificent view of the surrounding country far in the distance the giant himalaya tower into the still clear air the guardian barrier of a unknown land the fret pinnacle and tremendous ridge clothe in they pure white mantle of everlasting snow make a magnificent contrast to the dark misty wooded mass form by the lower range of hill in the early morning when the first beam of the rise sun have but touch the mountain top leave the country below shroud in the dim mist and vapor of retire night the sight be most sublime in presence of such hill and distance such wondrous combination of color scenery on such a gigantic scale even the most thoughtless become impressed with the majesty of nature we camp be pitch on the bank of a clear run mountain stream brawling over rock and boulder and to eye so long accustom to the never end flatness of the rich alluvial plain and the terrible sameness of the rice swamp the stream be a source of unalloyed pleasure there be only a few place where the abrupt bank give facility for ford and when a pig have break fairly from the jungle and be make for the river -lrb- as they very frequently do -rrb- you would see the cluster of horseman scatter over the plain like a covey of partridge when the hawk swoop down upon they each make for what he consider the most eligible ford in hope of be first up with the pig on the further bank and secure the much coveted first spear when a pig be hard press and come to any natural obstacle as a ditch bank or stream he almost invariably get this obstacle between himself and he pursuer then wheeling round he make he stand show wonderful sagacity in choose the moment of all other when he have he enemy at most disadvantage experience hand be aware of this and often try to outflank the boar but the best man i have see generally wait a little till the pig be again under weigh and then clear the ditch or bank put they horse at full speed which be the best way to make good you attack the rush of the boar be so sudden fierce and determine that a horse at half speed or go slow have no chance of escape but a well trained horse at full speed meet the pig in he rush the spear be deliver with unerring aim and slightly swerve to the leave you draw it out as you continue you course and the poor pig be leave welter in he blood behind you on one occasion i be very rudely make aware of this trait it be a fine fleet young boar we be after and we have have a long chase but be now overhaul he fast i have a good horse under I and ` jamie ' and ` giblets ' be ride neck and neck there be a small mango orchard in front surround by the usual ditch and bank it be nothing of a leap the boar take it with ease and we could just see he top the bank not twenty spear length ahead i be slightly leading and full of eager anxiety and emulation jamie call on I to pull up but i be too excite to mind he i see he and giblets each take a outward wheel about and gallop off to catch the boar come out of the cluster of tree on the far side as i think i could not see he but i make no doubt he be in full flight through the tree there be plenty of ride room between the row so lift my game little horse at the bank i feel my heart bind with emulation as i think i be certain to come up first and take the spear from two such note hero as my companion i come up with the pig first sure enough _ he _ be wait for _ I _ and scarce give my horse time to recover he stride after the jump he come rush at I every bristle erect with a vicious grunt of spite and rage my spear be useless i have it crosswise on my horse 's neck i intend to attack first and find my enemy turn the table on I in this way be rather disconcerting i try to turn aside and avoid the charge but a branch catch I across the face and knock my _ puggree _ off in a trice the savage little brute be on I leap up fairly from the ground he get the heel of my ride boot in he mouth and tear off the sole from the boot as if it have be so much paper jamie and giblets be sit outside watch the scene laugh at my discomfiture fortunately the boar have poor tusk and my fine little horse be unhurt but i get out of that orchard as fast as i could and ever after hesitate about attack a boar when he have get a bank or ditch between he and I and be wait for I on the other side the far better plan be to wait till he see you be not press he he then go off at a surly sling trot and you can resume the chase with every advantage in you favor when the blood however be fairly up and all one 's sport instinct rouse it be hard to listen to the dictate of prudence or the suggestion of caution and experience the very same day we have another instance my manager ` young mac ' as we call he have start a huge old boar he be just over the boar and about to deliver he thrust when he horse stumble in a rat hole -lrb- it be very rotten ground -rrb- and come flounder to earth bring he rider with he nothing daunted mac pick himself up lose the horse but so eager and excited be he that he continue the chase on foot call to some of we to catch he horse while he stick he boar the old boar be quite blow and take in the altered aspect of affair at a glance he turn to charge and we loudly call on mac to ` clear out ' not a bit of it he be too excite to realize he danger but pat fortunately interpose he horse and spear in time and no doubt save poor mac from a gruesome maul it be very plucky but it be very foolish for heavily weighted with boot breeches spur and spear a man could have no chance against the savage onset of a infuriate boar in the long thick grass with which the plain be cover the ride be very dangerous i remember see six rider come signally to grief over a blind ditch in this jungle it add not a little to the excitement and really serious accident be not so common as might be imagine it be no joke however when a riderless horse come range up alongside of you as you be sail along intent on war bite and kick at you own horse he spoil you sport throw you out of the chase and you be lucky if you do not receive some ugly cut or bruise from he too active heel there be the great beauty of a well trained arab or country-bred if you get a spill he wait beside you till you recover you faculty and get you bellows again in work order if you be ride a cabool or even a waler it be even bet that he turn to bite or kick you as you lie or he rattle off in pursuit of you more firmly seat friend spoil they sport and cause the most fearful explosion of vituperative wrath there be something to I intensely exciting in all the varied incident of a rattle burst across country after a fight old gray boar you see the long wave line of stave and spear head and quaint shaped axis glitter and fluctuate above the feathery top of the sway grass there be a irregular line of stately elephant each with its towering howdah and dusky mahout move slowly along through the rustling reed you hear the sharp report of firework the rattle thunder of the big _ dooblum _ or drum and the ear-splitting clatter of innumerable _ tom-tom _ shout oath and cry from a hundred noisy coolie come float down in burst of clamor on the soft morning air the din wax and wane as the excited beater descry a ` sounder ' of pig ahead with a mighty roar that make you blood tingle the frantic coolie rally for the final burst like rocket from a tube the boar and he progeny come crash through the brake and separate before you on the plain with a wild cheer you dash after they in hot pursuit no time now to think of pitfall bank or ditch you gallant steed strain he every muscle every sense be on the alert but you see not the bush and brake and tangled thicket that you leave behind you you eye be on the dusky glisten hide and the stiff erect bristle in front the shine tusk and foam-flecked chest be you goal and the wild excitement culminate as you feel you keen steel go straight through muscle bone and sinew and you know that another grisly monster have fall as you ease you girth and wipe you heated brow you feel that few pleasure of the chase come up to the noblest most thrilling sport of all that of pig-stick the plain be alive with shout beater hurry up to secure the gory carcase of the slaughter foe a riderless horse be far away make off alone for the distant grove where the snowy tent be glisten through the foliage on the distant horizon a small cluster of eager sportsman be fast overhaul another luckless tusker and enjoy in all they fierce excitement the same sensation you have just experience now be the time to enjoy the soothing weed and quaff the grateful ` peg ' and as the syce and other servant come up in group of two and three you listen with languid delight to all they remark on the incident of the chase and as with they acute oriental imagination nation they dilate in term of truly eastern exaggeration on you wonderful pluck and daring you almost fancy yourself really the hero they would make you out to be then the reunion round the festive board at night when every one again live through all the excitement of the day talk of fox-hunting after pig-stick it be like compare a penny candle to a lighthouse or a donkey race to the ` grand national ' peeprah factory with its many patch of jungle its various lake and fine undulating country be another favorite rendezvous for the votary of pig-stick the house itself be quite palatial build on the bank of a lovely horseshoe lake and embosome in a grove of tree of great rarity and beautiful foliage it have be build long before the day of overland route and suez canal when a planter make indium he home and spare no trouble nor expense to make he home comfortable in the great garden be fruit tree from almost every clime little channel of solid masonry lead water from the well to all part of the garden lead down to the lake be a broad flight of step guard on the one side by a immense peepul tree whose hollow trunk and wide stretch canopy of foliage have brave the storm of over half a century on the other side by a most symmetrical almond tree which when in blossom be the most beautiful object for mile around a well-kept shrubbery surround the house and tall casuarina and glossy dark green india-rubber and bhur tree form a thousand combination of shade and color here we often meet to experience the warm large-hearted hospitality of dear old pat and he gentle little wife at one time there be a pack of harrier which would lead we a fine sharp burst by the thicket near the river after a double hare but as a rule a meet at peeprah portended death to the gallant tusker for the jungle be full of pig and only honest hard work be mean when the peeprah beater turn out the whole country be cover with patch of grass and thorny jungle know they have another friendly cover close by the pig always break at the first beat and the ride have to be fast and furious if a spear be to be win there be some nasty drop jump and deep hidden ditch and accident be frequent in one of these hot sharp gallop poor ` bonnie morn ' a favorite horse belong to ` jamie ' be kill not see the ditch it come with tremendous force against the bank and of course its back be break even in its death thro it recognize its master 's voice and turn round and lick he hand we be all collect round and let who will sneer there be few dry eye as we see this last mute tribute of affection from the poor die animal the death of ` bonnie morn ' alas my ` brave bonnie ' the pride of my heart the moment have come when from thee i must part no more wilt thou hark to the huntsman 's glad horn my brave little arab my poor ` bonnie morn ' how proudly you bear I at bright break of day how gallantly ` lead ' when the boar break away but no more alas thou the hunt shall adorn for now thou art die my dear ` bonnie morn ' he would neigh with delight when i would enter he stall and canter up gladly on hear my call rub he head on my shoulder while munch he corn my dear gentle arab my poor ` bonnie morn ' or out in the grass when a pig be in view none so eager to start when he hear a ` halloo ' off off like a flash the ground spurn with scorn he aye lead the van do my brave ` bonnie morn ' o'er _ nullah _ and ditch o'er hedge fence or bank no matter _ he would _ clear it aye in the front rank a brave little hunter as ever be bear be my grand arab fav ` rite my good ` bonnie morn ' or when in the ` rank

' who so willing and true past the ` stand ' like a arrow the bonnie horse fly no spur he good rider need ever have worn for he aye do he best do my fleet ` bonnie morn ' and now here he lie the good little horse no more he 'll career in the hunt or on ` course ' : such a charger to lose make I sad and forlorn i _ can not _ help a tear ` tis for poor ` bonnie morn ' ah blame not my grief for ` tis deep and sincere as a friend and companion i hold ` bonnie ' dear no true sportsman ever such feeling will scorn as i heave a deep sigh for my brave ` bonnie morn ' and even in death when in anguish he lay when he life 's blood be drip -- drip -- slowly away he last thought be still of the master he have bear he neigh lick my hand -- and thus die ` bonnie morn ' one tremendous old boar be kill here during one of we meet which be long celebrate in we after-dinner talk on boar and hunting it be call ` the lungra ' which mean the cripple because it have be wound in the leg in some previous encounter perhaps in its hot youth before age have stiffen its joint and tinge its whisker with gray it be the most undaunted pig i have ever see it would not budge a inch for the beater and charge the elephant time after time send they fly from the jungle most ignominiously at length its patience become exhaust it slowly emerge from the jungle coolly survey the scene and its surroundings and then disdain flight charge straight at the nearest horseman its hide be as tough as a highland targe and though l deliver he spear it turn the weapon aside as if it be merely a thrust from a wooden pole the old _ lungra _ make good he charge and rip l 's horse on the shoulder it next charge pat and rip he horse and cut another horse a valuable black waler across the knee lame it for life rider after rider charge down upon the fierce old brute although repeatedly wound none of the thrust be very serious and already it have put five horse _ hors de combat _ it now take up a position under a big ` bhur ' tree close to some water and while the boldest of we hold back for a little it take a deliberate mud bath under we very nose doubtless feeling much refresh it again take up its position under the tree ready to face each fresh assailant full of fight and determine to die but not to yield a inch time after time we ride at the dauntless cripple each time he charge right down and we spear make little mark upon he toughened hide we horse too be get tired of such a customer and little inclined to face he charge at length ` jamie ' deliver a lucky spear and the gray old warrior fall it have keep we at bay for fully a hour and a half and among we number we reckon some of the best rider and boldest pig-sticker in the district such be we sport in those good old day we meet come but seldom so that sport never interfere with the interest of honest hard work but meeting each other as we do and engage in exciting sport like pig-sticking cement we friendship keep we in health and encourage all the hardy tendency of we nature it whet we appetite it rouse all those robust virtue that have make englishman the man they be it send we back to work with lighter heart and renew energy it build up many happy cherish memory of kindly word and look and deed that will only fade when we in turn have to bow before the hunter and render up we spirit to god who give they long live honest

flood through numerous channel to join the gange there be immense tract of uncultivated land cover with tall elephant grass and give cover to tiger hog deer pig wild buffalo and even a occasional rhinoceros to say nothing of smaller game and wildfowl which be very plentiful the sal forest in north bhaugulpore generally keep to the high ridge which be compose of a light sandy soil very friable and not very fertile except for oil and indigo seed which grow most luxuriantly wherever the forest land have be clear in the shallow valley which lie between the ridge rice be chiefly cultivate and give large return the sal forest have be sadly thin by unscientific and indiscriminate cutting and very few fine tree now remain the earth be teem with insect chief amongst which be the dreaded and destructive white ant the high pointed nest of these destructive insect form of hardened mud be the commonest object one meet with in these forest solitude at interval beneath some wide spreading peepul or bhur tree one come on a rude forest shrine daub all over with red paint and with gaudy festoon of imitation flower cut from the pith of the plantain tree hang on every surround bough these shrine be sacred to _ chumpa buttee _ the hindoo diana protectress of herd deer buffalo huntsman and herdsman she be the recognize jungle goddess and be hold in great veneration by all the wild tribe and half-civilized denizen of the gloomy sal jungle the general color of the forest be a dingy green save when a deeper shade here and there show where the mighty bhur uprear its towering height or where the crimson flower of the _ seemul _ or cotton tree and the bronze-coloured foliage of the _ sunpul _ -lrb- a tree very like the ornamental beech in shrubbery at home -rrb- impart a more varied color to the generally pervade dark green of the universal sal the variety of tree be of course almost innumerable but the sal be so out of all proportion more numerous than any other kind that the forest well deserve they recognize name the sal be a fine hard wood of very slow growth the leaf be broad and glistening and in spring be beautifully tip with a reddish bronze which gradually tone down into the dingy green which be the prevail tint the _ sheshum _ or _ sissod _ a tree with bright green leaf much resemble the birch the wood of which be invaluable for cart wheel and such-like work be occasionally meet with there be the _ kormbhe _ a very tough wood with a red stringy bark of which the jungle man make a kind of touchwood for they matchlock and the _ parass _ whose peculiarity be that at time it burst into a wondrous wealth of bright crimson blossom without a leaf be on the tree the _ parass _ tree in full bloom be gorgeous after the blossom fall the dark-green leaf come out and be not much different in color from the sal then there be the _ mhowa _ with its lovely white blossom from which a strong spirit be distil and on which the deer pig and wild bear love to feast the peculiar sickly smell of the _ mhowa _ when in flower pervade the atmosphere for a great distance round and remind one forcibly of the peculiar sweet sickly smell of a brewery the hill _ sirre _ be a tall feathery-looking tree of most elegant shape towering above the other forest tree and the native strip it of its bark which they use to poison stream it seem to have some narcotic or poisonous principle easily soluble in water for when put in any quantity in a stream or piece of water it cause all the fish to become apparently paralyzed and rise to the surface where they float about quite stupified and helpless and become a easy prey to the poach ` banturs ' and ` moosahur ' who adopt this wretched mode of fishing along the bank of the stream vegetation get very luxurious and among the thick undergrowth be find some lovely fern broad-leaved plant and flower of every hue all alike nearly scentless here be no odorous breath of violet or honeysuckle no delicate perfume of primrose or sweetbriar only a musty dank earthy smell which get more and more pronounced as the mist rise along with the deadly vapor of the night sleep in these forest be very unhealthy there be a most fatal miasma all through the year less during the hot month but very bad during and immediately after the annual rain and in September and October nearly every soul in the jungly tract be smite with fever the vapor only rise to a certain height above the ground and at the elevation of ten foot or so i believe one could sleep in the jungle with impunity but it be dangerous at all time to sleep in the forest unless at a considerable elevation the absence of all those delicious smell which make a walk through the woodland at home so delightful be conspicuous in the sal forest and another of the most noticeable feature be the extreme silence the oppressive stillness that reign you know how full of melody be a english wood when thrush blackbird mavi linnet and a thousand warbler flit from tree to tree how the choir ring out its full anthem of sweetest sound till every bush and tree seem a center of sweet strain soft low liquid trill and full ripe gush of melody and song but it be not thus in a indian forest there be actually few bird as you brush through the long grass and trample the tangled undergrowth put aside the sprawl branch or dodge under the pliant arm of the creeper you may flush a black or gray partridge raise a covey of quail or startle a quiet family party of peafowl but there be no sweet singer flit about to make the vault arcade of the forest echo to they music the hornbill dart with a succession of long bound flight from one tall tree to another the large woodpecker tap a hollow tree close by he gorgeous plumage glisten like a mimic rainbow in the sun a flight of green parrot sweep scream above you head the _ golden oriole _ or mango bird the _ koel _ with here and there a red-tufted _ bulbul _ make a faint attempt at a chirrup but as a rule the deep silence be unbroken save by the melancholy hoot of some blinking owl and the soft monotonous coo of the ringdove or the green pigeon the exquisite honey-sucker as delicately form as the petal of a fairy flower flit noiselessly about from blossom to blossom the native call it the ` muddpenah ' or drinker of honey there be innumerable butterfly of graceful shape and gorgeous color what few bird there be have beautiful plumage there be a faint rustle of leave a faint far hum of insect life but it feel so silent so unlike the wood at home you be oppress by the solemn stillness and feel almost nervous as you push warily along for at any moment a leopard wolf or hyena may get up before you or you may disturb the siesta of a sounder of pig or a herd of deer up in those forest on the border of nepaul which be call the _ morung _ there be a great many variety of parrot all of they very beautiful there be first the common green parrot with a red beak and a circle of salmon-coloured feather round its neck they be very noisy and destructive and flock together to the field where they do great damage to the crop the _ lutkun sooga _ be a exquisitely-coloured bird about the size of a sparrow the _ ghur -lrb- = a -rrb- l _ a large red and green parrot with a crimson beak the _ tota _ a yellowish-green color and the male with a breast as red as blood they call it the _ amereet bhelum _ another lovely little parrot the _ taeteea sooga _ have a green body red head and black throat but the most showy and brilliant of all the tribe be the _ putsoogee _ the body be a rich living green red wing yellow beak and black throat there be a tuft of vivid red as a topknot and the tail be a brilliant blue the under feather of the tail be a pure snowy white at time the silence be break by a loud metallic bell-like cry very like the yodel you hear in the alp you hear it rise sharp and distinct ` looralei ' and as suddenly cease this be the cry of the _ kookoor gh -lrb- = e -rrb- t _ a bird not unlike a small pheasant with a reddish-brown back and a fawn-coloured breast the _ sherra _ be another green parrot a little larger than the _ putsoogee _ but not so beautifully color there be generally a green slime-covered sluggish stream in all these forest its channel choke with rot leaf and decay vegetable matter the water should never be drunk until it have be boil and filter at interval the stream open out and form a clear rush-fringed pool and the tree recede on either bank leave a lovely grassy glade where the deer and nilghau come to drink on the glassy bosom of the pool in the center fine duck mallard and teal can frequently be find and the rush round the margin be to a certainty good for a couple of brace of snipe sometimes on a withered branch overhang the stream you can see perch the _ ahur _ or great black fish-hawk it have a grate discordant cry which it utter at interval as it sit plume its black feather above the pool the dark ibis and the ubiquitous paddy-bird be of course also find here and where the land be low and marshy and the stream crawl along through several channel you be sure to come across a couple of red-headed _ sarus _ serpent bird a crane and a solitary heron the _ moosahernee _ be a black and white bird i fancy a sort of ibis and be good eat the _ dokahur _ be another fine big bird black body and white wing and as its name -lrb- derive from _ dokha _ a shell -rrb- imply it be the shell-gatherer or snail-eater and give good shooting when you have determine to beat the forest you first get you coolie and villager assemble and send they some mile or two mile ahead under charge of some of the head man to beat the jungle towards you while you look out for a likely spot shady conceal and cool where you wait with you gun till the game be drive up to you the whole arrangement be generally make of course under you own supervision by you _ shekarry _ or gamekeeper as i suppose you might call he he be generally a thin wiry silent man well verse in all the lore of the wood acquaint with the name appearance and habit of every bird and beast in the forest he know they haunt and when they be to be find at home he will track a wounded deer like a bloodhound and can tell the sign and almost impalpable evidence of a animal 's whereabouts the knowledge of which go to make up the genuine hunter when all be still around and only the distant shout of the beater fall faintly at interval on the ear he keen hearing detect the light patter of hoof or paw on the crisp withered leave he hawk-like glance can pick out from the deepest shade the sleek coat or hide of the leopard or the deer and even before the animal have come in sight he sens tell he whether it be young or old whether it be alarmed or walk in blind confidence in fact i have know a good shekarry tell you exactly what animal be come whether bear leopard fox deer pig or monkey the best shekarry i ever have be a nepaulee call ` mehrman singh ' he have the regular tartar physiognomy of the nepaulese small oblique twinkling eye high cheekbone flattish nose and scanty moustache he be a tall wiry man with a remarkably light springy step a bold erect carriage and be altogether a fine manly independent fellow he have none of the fawn obsequiousness which be so common to the hindoo but be a merry laughing fellow with a keen love of sport and a great appreciation of humor he gun be fearfully and wonderfully make it be a long heavy flint gun with a tremendously heavy barrel and the stock all splice and splinter tie in place with bit of string i would rather not have be in the immediate vicinity of the weapon when he fire it and yet he contrived to do some good shooting with it he be wonderfully patient in stalk a animal or wait for its near approach as he never venture on a long shot and do not understand we objection to pot-shooting he shot be compose of jagged little bit of iron chip from a old _ kunthee _ or cooking-pot and he powder be truly unique be like lump of charcoal about the size of small raisin a shekarry fill about four or five finger ' depth of this into he gun then a handful of old iron and with a little touch of english powder prick in with a pin as priming he be ready for execution on any game that may come within reach of a safe pot-shot when the gun go off there be a mighty splutter a roar like that of a small cannon and the slug go hurtle through the bush carry away twig and leave and not unfrequently smash up the game so that it be almost useless for the table the _ bantur _ who principally inhabit these jungle be mostly of nepaulese origin they be a sturdy independent people and the woman have fair skin and be very pretty unchastity be very rare and the infidelity of a wife be almost unknown if it be find out mutilation and often death be the penalty exact from the unfortunate woman they wear one long loose flow garment much like the skirt of a gown this be tightly twist round the body above the bosom leave the neck and arm quite bare they be fond of ornament -- nose ear toe and arm and even ancle be load with silver ring and circlet some decorate they nose and the middle parting of the hair with a greasy-looking red pigment while nearly every grown-up woman have she arm neck and low down on the collar bone most artistically tattoo in a variety of close elaborate pattern the woman all work in the clearing sowing and weeding and reap the rice barley and other crop they do most of the digging where that be necessary the man confine themselves to plough and wood-cutting at the latter employment they be most expert they use the axe in the most masterly manner but they mode of cut be fearfully wasteful they always leave some three foot of the best part of the wood in the ground very rarely cut a tree close down to the root many of they be good charcoal-burner and indeed they principal occupation be supply the adjacent village with charcoal and firewood they use small narrow-edged axis for fell but for lop they invariably use the nepaulese national weapon -- the _ kookree _ this be a heavy curved knife with a broad blade the edge very sharp and the back thick and heavy in use it they slash right and leave with a quick downward stroke draw the blade quickly toward they as they strike they be wonderfully dexterous with the _ kookree _ and will clear away brush and underwood almost as quickly as a man can walk they pack they charcoal rice or other commodity in long narrow basket which they sling on a pole carry on they shoulder as we see the chinese do in the well know picture on tea-chest they be all hindoo in religion but be very fond of rice-whiskey although not so abstemious in this respect as the hindoo of the plain they be a much finer race both physically and morally as a rule they be truthful honest brave and independent they be always glad to see you laugh out merrily at you as you pass and be wonderfully hospitable it would be a nice point for sir wilfrid lawson to reconcile the use of rice-whiskey with this marked superiority in all moral virtue in the whiskey-drinking as against the totally-abstaining hindoo to return to mehrman singh he face be seam with smallpox mark and he have seven or eight black patch on it the first time i see he cause by the splintering of he flint when he let off he antediluvian gun when he see my breechloader the first he have ever behold he admiration be unbounded he tell I he have come on a leopard asleep in the forest one day and creep up quite close to he he faith in he old gun however be not so lively as to make he rashly attack so dangerous a customer so he tell I ` hum usko jan deydea oo wukt ' that be ' i _ give _ the brute its life that time but ' he continue ` have i have a english gun like this you honor i would have blow the _ soor _ -lrb- _ anglice _ pig -rrb- to hell ' old mehrman be rather strong in he expletive at time but i be not a little amuse at the cool way he speak of _ give _ the leopard its life the probability be that have he only wound the animal he would have lose he own these nepaulese be very fond of give feast to each other they dinner-party i assure you be very often ` great affair ' they be not mean in they arrangement and the want of the inner man be very amply provide for they crockery be simple and inexpensive when the feast be prepared each guest provide himself with a few broad leaf from the nearest sal tree and form these into a cup he pin they together with thorn from the acacia squat down in a circle with half-a-dozen of these sylvan cup around the attendant fill one with rice another with _ dhall _ a third with goat 's - flesh a fourth with _ turkaree _ or vegetable a fifth with chutnee pickle or some kind of preserve curd ghee a little oil perhaps sugar plantain and other fruit be not want and the whole be wash down with copious draught of fiery rice-whiskey or where it can be procure with palm-toddy not unfrequently dancing boy or girl be in attendance and the horrid din of tom-tom cymbal a squeak fiddle or a twanging sitar rattle castanets and ear-piercing song from the dusky _ prima donna _ make night hideous until the gray dawn peep over the dark forest line early in January 1875 my camp be at a place in the sal jungle call lohurneah i have be collect rent and look after my seed cultivation and pat and we sport district engineer have join I we determine to have a beat for deer mehrman singh have report numerous herd in the vicinity of we camp during the night we have be disturb by the reveller at such a feast in the village as i have be describe we have fill cartridge see to we gun and make every preparation for the beat and early in the morning the coolie and idler of the forest village all round be range in circle about we camp swallow a hasty breakfast we mount we pony and follow by we ragged escort make off for the forest on the way we meet a crowd of bantur with bundle of stake and great coil of strong heavy net send the coolie on ahead under charge of several headman and peon we plunge into the gloom of the forest leave we pony and groom outside when we come to a likely-looking spot the bantur begin operation by fix up the net on the stake and between tree till a line of strong net extend across the forest for several hundred yard we then go ahead leave the net behind we and each take up he station about 200 yard in front the man with the net then hide themselves behind tree and crouch in the underwood with we kookry we cut down several branch stick they in the ground in front and ensconce ourselves in this artificial shelter behind we and between we and the net be a narrow cart track lead through the forest and the reason of we take this position be give I by pat who be a old hand at jungle shooting when deer be be drive they be intensely suspicious and of course frighten they know every spot in the jungle and be acquaint with all the path track and open place in the forest when they be near a open glade or a road they slacken they pace and go slowly and warily forward a old buck generally lead when he have carefully reconnoitr and examine the suspect place in front and find it clear to all appearance they again put on the pace and clear the open ground at they greatest speed the best chance of a shot be when a path be in front of _ they _ and behind _ you _ as then they be go slowly at first when i use to go out after they i often get a open glade or road in _ front _ of I but experience soon tell I that pat 's plan be the best as this be a beat not so much for real sport as to show I how the villager manage these affair we be all under pat 's direction and he could not have choose better ground i be on the extreme left behind a clump of young tree with the sluggish muddy stream on my leave we engineer to my right be about one hundred yard off and pat himself on the extreme right at about the same distance from h behind we be the road and in the rear the long line of net with they conceal watcher the net be so set up on the stake that when a animal bound along and touch the net it fall over he and ere he can extricate himself from its mesh the vigilant banturs rush out and despatch he with spear and club we wait a long time hear nothing of the beater and watch the red and black ant hurry to and fro huge green-bellied spider oscillate backwards and forwards in they strong systematically weave web a small mungoose keep peep out at I from the root of a old india-rubber tree and aloft in the branch a amatory pair of hidden ringdove be billing and coo to each other at this moment a stealthy step steal softly behind and the next second mr mehrman singh creep quietly and noiselessly beside I he face flush with rapid walk he eye flash with excitement he finger on he lip and a look of portentous gravity and importance strive to spread itself over he speak countenance mehrman have be up all night at the feast and be as drunk as a piper it be no use be angry with he so i try to keep he quiet and resume my watch a few minute afterwards he grasp I by the wrist rather startling I but in a low hoarse whisper warn I that a troop of monkey be come i could not hear the faintest rustle but sure enough in a minute or two a troop of over twenty monkey come hop and shamble along stop every now and then to sit on they ham look back grin jabber and show they formidable tooth until mehrman rise up wave he cloth at they and turn they off from the direction of the net toward the bank of the stream next come a fox slouch warily and cautiously along then a couple of lean hungry-looking jackal next a sharp patter on the crisp dry leaf and several peafowl with resplendent plumage run rapidly past another touch on the arm from mehrman and follow the direction of he outstretched hand i descry a splendid buck within thirty yard of I he antler and chest but barely visible above the brushwood my gun be to my shoulder in a instant but the shekarry in a excited whisper implore I not to fire i hesitate and just then the stately head turn round to look behind and expose the beautifully curve neck full to my aim i fire and have the satisfaction of see the fine buck topple over seemingly hard hit a shot on my right and two shot in rapid succession further on shewed I that pat and h be also at work and then the whole forest seem alive with frightened madly-plunging pig deer and other animal i fire at and wound a enormous boar that come rush past and now the cry of the coolie in front as they come troop on mingle with the shout of the man at the net where the work of death evidently be go on it be most exciting while it last but after all i do not think it be honest sport the only apology i could make to myself be that the deer and pig be far too numerous and do immense damage to the crop and if not thin out they would soon have make the grow of any crop whatever a impossibility the monkey be a sacred animal be never molest by the native and the damage he do in a night to a crop of wheat or barley be astonishing peafowl too be very destructive and what with these and the ravages of pig deer hare and other plunderer the poor ryot have to watch many a weary night to secure any return from he field on rejoin each other at the net we find that five deer and two pig have be kill pat have shoot a boar and a porcupine the latter with no 4 shot h account for a deer and i get my buck and the boar which i have wound in the chest mehrman singh have follow he up and track he to the river where he take refuge among some long swamp reed reply to he call we go up and a shot through the head settle the old boar for ever we bag be therefore for the first beat seven deer four pig and a porcupine the coolie be now send away out of the jungle and on ahead for a mile or so the net be coil up we pony regain and off we set to take another station as we go along the river bank frequently have to force we way through thick jungle we start ` no end ' of peafowl and get down we soon add a couple to the bag pat get a fine jack snipe and i shoot a _ jheelum _ a very fine waterfowl with brown plumage have a strong metallic coppery lustre on the back and a steely dark blue breast the plumage be very thick and glossy and it prove afterwards to be excellent eating peafowl generally retire to the thickest part of the jungle during the heat of the day but if you go out very early when they be slowly wend they way back from the field where they have be revel all night you can shoot number of they i use to go about twenty or thirty yard into the jungle and walk slowly along keep that distance from the edge my syce and pony would then walk slowly by the edge of the field and when the syce see a peafowl ahead make for the jungle he would shout and try to make it rise he generally succeed and as i be a little in advance and conceal by the jungle i would get a fine shot as the bird fly overhead i have shoot as many as eight and ten in a morning in this way i always use no 4 shot with about 3-1\/2 dram of powder unless hard hit peafowl will often get away they run with amazing swiftness and in the heart of the jungle it be almost impossible to make they rise a couple of sharp terrier or a good retriever will sometimes flush they but the best way be to go along the edge of the jungle in the early morn as i have describe the peachick about seven or eight month old be deliciously tender and well flavored old bird be very dry and tough and require a great deal of that old-fashioned sauce hunger the common name for a peafowl be _ m -lrb- = o -rrb- r _ but the nepaulese and bantur call it _ majoor _ now _ majoor _ also mean coolie and a young fellow s be horrify one day hear he attendant in the jungle tell he in the most excited way ' _ majoor majoor _ sahib why do not you fire ' poor s think it be a coolie the man mean and that he must be go mad want he to shoot a coolie but he find out he mistake and learn the double meaning of the word when he get home and consult he _ manager _ the generic name for all deer be in hindustanus hurin but the nepaulese call it cheeter the male spotted deer they call kubra the female kubree these spotted deer keep almost exclusively to the forest and be very seldom find far away from the friendly cover of the sal wood they be the most handsome graceful look animal i know they skin beautifully mark with white spot and the horn wide and arch when properly prepare the skin make a beautiful mat for a draw room and the horn of a good buck be a handsome ornament to the hall or the verandah when bound along through the forest he beautifully spotted skin flash through the dark green foliage he antler lay back over he withers he look the very embodiment of grace and swiftness he be very timid and not easily stalk in march and April when a strong west wind be blow it rustle the myriad of leaf that dry as tinder encumber the earth this perpetual rustle prevent the deer from hear the footstep of a approach foe they generally betake themselves then to some patch of grass or long-crop outside the jungle altogether and if you want they in those month it be in such place and not inside the forest at all that you must search like all the deer tribe they be very curious and a bit of rag tie to a tree or a cloth put over a bush will not unfrequently entice they within range old shekarry will tell you that as long as the deer go on feeding and flap they ear you may continue you approach as soon as they throw up the head and keep the ear still they suspicion have be arouse and if you want venison you must be as still as a rock till you game be again lull into security as soon as the ear begin flap again you may continue you stalk but at the slightest noise the noble buck will be off like a flash of lightning you should never go out in the forest with white clothes as you be then a conspicuous mark for all the prying eye that be invisible to you the best color be dun brown dark gray or dark green when you see a deer have become suspicious and no cover be near stand perfectly erect and rigid and do not leave you leg apart the ` forked-parsnip ' formation of the ` human form divine ' be detect at a glance but there be just a chance that if you leg be draw together and you remain perfectly motionless you may be mistake for the stump of a tree or at the best some less dangerous enemy than man as we ride slowly along to allow the beater to get ahead and to let the heavily-laden man with the net keep up with we we be amuse to hear the remark of the syce and shekarry on the sport they have just witness pat 's old man juggroo a merry peep-eyed fellow full of anecdote and humor be rather hard on mehrman singh for have be up late the precede night mehrman whose head be by this time probably remind he that there be ` lees to every cup ' do not seem to relish the humor he begin grasp one wrist with the other hand work he hand slowly round he wrist and i notice that juggroo immediately change the subject this as i afterwards learn be the invariable nepaulese custom of show anger they grasp the wrist as i have say and it be take as a sign that if you do not discontinue you banter you will have a fight the nepaulese be rather vain of they personal appearance and hanker greatly after a good thick moustache this nature have deny they for the hair on they face be scanty and stubbly in the extreme one day juggroo see he master put some bandoline on he moustache which be a fine handsome silky one he ask pat 's bearer a old rogue what it be ` oh ' reply the bearer ` that be the gum of the sal tree master always use that and that be the reason he have such a fine moustache ' juggroo 's imagination fire up at the idea ` will it make mine grow too ' ` certainly ' ` how do you use it ' ` just rub it on as you see master do ' away go juggroo to try the new recipe now the gum of the sal tree be a very strong resin and harden in water it be almost impossible to get it off you skin as the more water you use the harder it get next day juggroo 's face present a sorry sight he have plentifully smear the gum over he upper lip so that when he wash he face the gum _ set _ make the lip as stiff as a board and threaten to crack the skin every time the slightest muscle move juggroo _ be _ ` sell ' and no mistake but he bear it all in grim silence although he never forget the old bearer one day long after he bring in some berry from the wood and be munch they seemingly with great relish the bearer want to know what they be juggroo with much apparent _ nonchalance _ tell he they be some very sweet juicy wild berry he have find in the forest the bearer ask to try one juggroo have _ another _ fruit ready very much resemble those he be eat it be fill with minute spikelet or little hairy spinnacle much resemble those find in ripe doghip at home if these even touch the skin they cause intense pain sting like nettle and blister every part they touch the unsuspicious bearer pop the treacherous berry into he mouth give it a crunch and then with a howl of agony splutter and spat while the tear run down he cheek as he implore juggroo by all the god to fetch he some water old juggroo with a grim smile walk coolly away discharge a parthian shaft by tell he that these berry be very good for make the hair grow and hope he would soon have a good moustache a man from the village now come run up to tell we that there be a leopard in the jungle we be about to beat and that it have seize but fail to carry away a dog from the village during the night native be so apt to tell story of this kind that at first we do not credit he but turn into the village he show we the poor dog with great wound on its neck and throat where the leopard have pounce upon it the noise it seem have bring some herdsman to the place and they cry have frighten the leopard and save the wretched dog as the man say he could show we the spot where the leopard generally remain we determine to beat he up so send a man off on horseback for the beater to slightly alter they intended line of beat we ride off attend by the villager to get behind the leopard 's lair and see if we could not secure he these fierce and courageous brute for they be both be very common in the sal jungle and as i have see several kill both in bhaugulpore and oudh i must devote a chapter to the subject chapter xii the leopard -- how to shoot he -- gallant encounter with a wound one -- encounter with a leopard in a dak bungalow -- pat shoot two leopard -- effect of the express bullet -- the ` sirwah purrul ' or annual festival of huntsman -- the hindoo ryot -- rice-planting and harvest -- poverty of the ryot -- he apathy -- village fire -- want of sanitation write principally for friend at home who be not familiar with indian life i must narrate fact that although well know in indian circle be yet new to the general reader in england my object be of course to represent the life we lead in the far east and to give a series of picture of what be go on there if i occasionally touch on what may to indian reader seem well-worn ground they will forgive I the leopard then as a rule keep to the wooded part of indium in the long grassy jungle border the koosee he be not generally meet with he be essentially a predatory animal always on the outlook for a meal round the village nestle amid they sal forest he be continually on the prowl look out for a goat a calf or unwary dog he appearance and habit be well know he generally select for he lair a retired spot surround by dense jungle the one we be after now have he home in a matted jungle grow out of a pool of water which have collect in a long hollow form the receptacle of the surface drainage from the adjacent slope this hollow stretch for mile towards the creek which we have be beat up and the locality have moisture and other concur element in its favor the vegetation have attain a luxuriance rarely see in the dry upland where the west wind lick up the moisture and the soil be arid and unpromise the mat intertwine branch of the creeper have form a almost impervious screen and on the basis thus form amid the branch and creeper the leopard have form they lair beneath be a still stagnant pool above be the leafy foliage the track lead down to a well-worn path climb like a cat as the leopard can do they find no difficulty in gain a footing on the mass of vegetation they generally select some retired spot like this and be very seldom see in the daytime with the approach of night however they begin they wander in quest of prey in a beat such as we be have ` all be fish that come to the net ' and leopard if they be in the jungle have to yield to the advance of the beater like the other denizen of the forest experience tell you that the leopard be daring and ferocious old experienced hand warn you that unless you can make sure of you shot it be unwise to fire at a leopard approach it be better to wait till he have get past you or at all event be ` broadside on ' if you only wind he as he be approach he will almost to a certainty make straight at you but if you shoot he as he be go past he will madden by pain and anger go straight forward and you escape he charge he be more courageous than a tiger and a very dangerous customer at close quarter up in one of the forest in oudh a friend of mine be out one day after leopard with a companion who belong to the forest department my friend 's companion fire at a leopard as it be approach he and wound it severely nothing daunted and recognize whence its hurt have come it charge directly down on the conceal sportsman and before he could half realize the position spring on he catch he left arm in its tooth and begin maul he with its claw he presence of mind do not desert he notice close by the stump of a sal tree that have be eat by white ant till the harder part of the wood alone remain stand up hard and sharp like so many spike of steel and know that the leopard be already badly wound and in all probability struggle for he life he manage to drag the struggle animal up to the stump jam he left arm yet further into the open mouth of the wound beast and be a strong man by pure physical force dash the leopard 's brain out on the jagged edge of the stump it be a splendid instance of presence of mind he be horribly maul of course in fact i believe he lose he arm but he save he life it show the danger of only wound a leopard especially if he be come towards you always wait till he have pass you station if it be practicable if you _ must _ shoot take what care you can that the shot be a sure one in some of the hill station and indeed in the village on the plain it be very common for a leopard to make he appearance in the house or verandah of a evening one be shoot in bhaugulpore station by the genial and respected chaplain on a Sunday morning two or three year ago as we go along h tell we a humorous story of a assistant in the public work department who get maul by a leopard at dengra ghat dak bungalow it have take up its quarter in a disused room and this young fellow burning with ardor to distinguish himself make straight for the room in which he be know to be he open the door follow by a motley crowd of retainer discharge he gun and the sequel prove that he be _ not _ a dead shot he have only wound the leopard with a bind the savage brute be on he but in the hurry and confusion he have change front the leopard have he by the back you can imagine the scene he roar for help the leopard be badly hit and a plucky _ bearer _ come to he rescue with a stout _ lathee _ between they they succeed in kill the wound animal but not before it have leave its mark on a very sensitive portion of he frame the moral be if you go after leopard be sure you kill he at once they seldom attack a strong well-grown animal calf however goat and dog be frequently carry off by they the young of deer and pig too fall victim and when nothing else can be have peafowl have be know to furnish they a meal in my factory in oudh i have a small graceful four-horned antelope it be carry off by a leopard from the garden in broad daylight and in face of a gang of coolie the most commonly practice mode of leopard shooting be to tie a goat up to a tree you have a _ mychan _ erect that be a platform elevate on tree above the ground here you take you seat attract by the bleating of the goat the prowl leopard approach he intended victim if you be on the watch you can generally detect he approach they steal on with extreme caution be intensely wary and suspicious at a village near where we now be i have sit up for three night for a leopard but although i know he be prowl in the vicinity i have never get a look at he we believe this leopard to be the same brute i have already describe we mode of beat the jungle be close and there be a great growth of young tree i be again on the right and near the edge of the forest beyond be a glade plant with rice the incident of the beat be much as you have just read there be however unknown or at any rate unnoticed by we more intense excitement we know that the leopard might at any moment pass before we pat be close to a mighty bhur tree whose branch send down shoot from the parent stem have plant round it a colony of vigorous support it be a magnificent tree with dense shade all be solemn and still pat with he keen eye he pulse bound and every sense on the alert be keep a careful look-out from behind a immense project buttress of the tree all be deadly quiet h and myself be occupy watch the gambol of some monkey in we front the beater be yet far off suddenly pat hear a faint crackle on a dry leaf he glance in the direction of the sound and he quick eye detect the glossy coat the beautifully spotted hide of not _ one _ leopard but _ two _ in a moment the stillness be break by the report of he rifle another report follow sharp and quick we be on the alert but to pat the chief honor and glory belong he have shoot one leopard dead through the heart the female be badly hit and come bound along in my direction of course we be now on the _ qui vive _ wait for a instant till i could get my aim clear of some intervene tree i at length get a fair shot and bring she down with a ball through the throat h and pat come run up and we congratulate ourselves on we success by and bye mehrman singh and the rest of the beater come up and the joy of the villager be gratify these be doubtless the two leopard we have hear so much about for which i have sit up and watch it be amusing to see some villager whose pet goat or value calf have be carry off now come up strike the dead body of the leopard and abuse it in the most unmeasured term such a crowd round as there be such a noise and such excitement while wait for the horse to be bring and while the excited mob of beater and coolie carry off the dead animal to the camp to be skin we amuse ourselves by try we rifle at a huge tree that grow on the further side of the rice swamp we find the effect of the ` express ' bullet to be tremendous it splintered up and burst the bark and body of the tree into fragment its effect on a animal be even more wonderful on look afterwards at the leopard which have be shoot we find that my bullet have touch the base of the shoulder near the collar-bone it have go downward through the neck under the collar-bone and strike the shoulder there it have splintered up and make a frightful wound scatter its fragment all over the chest and cut and lacerate everything in its way for big game the ` express ' be simply invaluable for all-round shooting perhaps a no 12 smooth-bore be the best it should be snap action with rebound lock you should have facility and instrument for load cartridge a good cartridge belt be a good thing for carry they but go where you will now where there be game to be kill a no 12 b l will enable you to participate in whatever shooting be go such a one as i have describe would satisfy all the wish of any young man who perhaps can only afford one gun as we ride slowly along we learn many curious fact of jungle and native life from the follower and by notice little incident happen before we eye pat who be so well verse in jungle life and its tradition tell we of a curious moveable feast which the native of these part hold annually generally in march or April which be call the _ sirwah purrub _ it seem to be somewhat like the old carnival of the middle age i have read that in sardinium and italy and switzerland something similar take place the _ sirwah purrub _ be a sort of festival hold in honor of the native diana -- the _ chumpa buttee _ before refer to on the appoint day all the male in the forest village without exception go a-hunting old spear be furbish up miraculous gun of even yet more ancient lineage than mehrman singh 's dangerous flintpiece be bring out from dusty hiding-place battle-axis bow and arrow hatchet club and weapon of all sort be look up and the motley crowd hie to the forest the one party beat up the game to the other some go fishing other try to secure a quail or partridge but it be a point of honor that something must be slay if game be not plentiful they will even go to another village and slay a goat which rather than return empty-handed they will bear in triumph home the woman meet the return hunter and if there have be a fortunate beat there be a great feast in the village during the evening and far on into the night the net be use and in this way they generally have some game to divide in the village on they return from the hunt ordinarily they seethe the flesh and pour the whole contents of the cooking-pot into a mess of boil rice with the addition of a little salt this be to they very palatable fare they be very good cook with very simple appliance with a little mustard oil or clarify butter a few vegetable or a cut-up fish they can be very successful the food however be generally smoke from the cow-dung fire if you be much out in these village this smoke constantly hang about cling to you clothes and flavor you food but the native seem to like it amazingly in the cold morning of December or January it hang about like the peat smoke in a highland village round every house be great stack and pile of cow-dung cake before every house be a huge pile of ash and the villager cower round this as the evening fall or before the sun have dissipate the mist of the morning during the day the village dog burrow in the ash hover in a dense cloud about the roof and eaves and along the lower branch of the tree in filmy layer the smoke almost choke one to ride through it i have see a native sit till half-choked in a dense column of this smoke he be too lazy to shift he position the fume of pungent smoke half smother he tear run from he eye he splutter and cough and abuse the smoke and its grandfather and maternal uncle and all its other known relative but he prefer semi-suffocation to the trouble of budge a inch sometimes the energy of these people be surprising to go to a fair or feast or on a pilgrimage they will walk mile upon mile subsist on parched pea or rice and carry heavy burden in company they sing and carol blithely enough when alone they be very taciturn man and woman walking together the man first with he _ lathee _ or staff the woman behind carry child or bundle and often look fagged and tired enough take vegetable or rice or other commodity to the bazaar the carrier often sling he burden to the two end of a pole wear over the shoulder much as chinaman do but they generally make they load into one bundle which they carry on the head or which they sling if not large and bulky over they back roll up in one of they cloth during the rice-planting season they toil in mud and water from earliest morn till late into twilight bend and stoop all the day they lower extremity up to the knee sometimes in water and the scorching sun beating on they back they certainly show they patient plod industry for it be downright honest hard work the young rice be take from the nursery patch where it have be sow thick some time previously when the rice-field be ready -- a sloppy muddy embanked little quagmire -- the ryot get he bundle of young rice-plant and shove in two or three at a time with he finger and thumb these afterwards form the tuft of rice its growth be very rapid sometimes in case of flood the rice actually grow with the rise of the water always keep its tip above the stream if wholly submerge for any length of time it die there be over a hundred variety some be only suit for very deep marshy soil other such as the _ s -lrb- = a -rrb- tee _ or sixty-days rice can be grow on comparatively high land and ripen early if rain be scanty the _ s -lrb- = a -rrb- tee _ and other rice crop have to be weed it be cut with a jagged-edged sort of reaping-hook call a _ hussooa _ the cut bundle be carry from the field by woman girl and lad they could not take cart in many instance into the swamp at such time you see every little dyke or embankment with a crowd of bustling villager each with a heavy bundle of grain on he head hurry to and fro like a stream of busy ant the woman with clothes tuck up above the knee plod and plash through the water they go at a half run a kind of fast trot and hardly a word be speak -- garner the rice crop be too important a operation to dawdle and gossip over each hurry off with he burden to the little family threshing-floor dump down he load give a weary grunt straighten he back give a yawn then off again to the field for another load it be no use leave a bundle on the field where food be so eagerly look for by such a dense population where there be hungry mouth and empty stomach in every village a bundle of rice would be go by the morning as in greece where every man have to watch he vineyard at night so here the _ kureehan _ or threshing-floor each have its watchman at night for the protection of the grow crop the villager club together and appoint a watchman or _ chowkeydar _ whom they pay by give he a small percentage on the yield or a small fractional proportion of the area he have to guard with its standing crop may be make over to he as a recompense they thresh out the rice when it have mature a little on the threshing-floor four to six bullock be tie in a line to a post in the center and round this they slowly pace in a circle they be not muzzle and the poor brute seem rather to enjoy the unwonted luxury of feed while they work when there be a good wind the grain be winnow it be lift either in bamboo scoop or in the two hand the wind blow the chaff or _ bhoosa _ on to a heap and the fine fresh rice remain behind the grain merchant now do a good business rice must be sell to pay the rent the money-lender and other clamour creditor the _ bunniah _ will take repayment in kind they put on the interest and cheat in the weighment and measurement so much have to be give to the weigh-man as a perquisite if seed have be borrow it have now to be return at a ruinous rate of interest some seed must be save for next year and a average _ poor _ ryot the cultivator of but a little hold very soon see the result of he harvest melt away leave little for wife and little one to live on he never get free of the money-lender he will have to go out and work hard for other as well as get up he own little land no chance of a new bullock this year and the old one be get wear out and thin the wife must dispense with she promise ornament or dress for the poor ryot it be a miserable hand-to-mouth existence when crop be poor as a rule he be never out of debt he live on the scantiest fare hunger often pinch he he know none of the luxury of life notwithstanding all the majority be patient frugal industrious and to the full extent of they scanty means even charitable and benevolent with the average ryot a little business go a great way there be some irreconcileable discontented worthless fellow in every village all more or less count a lie as rather a good thing to be expert in they lie naturally simply and instinctively : but with all he fault and they be doubtless many i confess to a great liking for the average hindoo ryot at time however they apathy and laziness be amazing they be very childish pet and easily rouse in a quarrel however they generally confine themselves to vituperation and abuse and seldom come to blow as a instance of they fatalism or apathetic indolence i can remember a village on the estate i be manage take fire it be quite close to the factory i have my pony saddle at once and gallop off for the burning village it be a long straggle one with a good masonry well in the center shadow by a mighty _ peepul _ tree the wind be blow the fire right along and if no obstruction be offer would sweep off every hut in the place the only soul who be try to do a thing be a young brahmin watchman belong to the factory he have succeed in remove some brass jar of he own and be save some grain one woman be rock to and fro beat she breast and cry there sit the rest of the apathetic villager in group not lift a finger not stir a step but calmly look on while the devour element be lick up hut after hut and destroy they little all in a few minute some of my servant syce and factory man have arrive i tie up the pony order my man to pull down a couple of hut in the center and try to infuse some energy into the villager not a bit of it they would _ not _ stir they would not even draw a bucket of water however my man get earthen pot i dig up fresh earth and throw it on the two dismantle hut drag away as much of the thatch and _ debris _ as we could the fire lick we face and actually get a footing on the first house beyond the frail opening we have try to make but we persevere and ultimately stay the fire and save about two third of the village i never see such a instance of complete apathy some of the inhabitant even have not untied the cattle in the shed they seem quite prostrated however as we work on and they begin to see that all be not yet lose they begin to buckle to yet even then they principal object be to save they brass pot and cooking utensil thing that could not possibly burn and which they might have leave alone with perfect safety a hindoo village be as inflammable as touchwood the house be generally build of grass wall connect with thin batten of bamboo the roof be bamboo and thatch thatch fence surround all the little courtyard leave refuse cowdung fuel and wood be pile up round every hut at each door be a open air fire which smoulder all day a stray puff of wind make a inquisitive visit round the corner and before one can half realize the catastrophe the village be on fire then each only think of he own goods there be no combined effort to stay the flame in the hot west wind of march April and may these fire be of very frequent occurrence in bhaugulpore i have see from my verandah three village on fire at one and the same time in some part of oudh among the sal forest village after village be burn down annually and i have see the same catastrophe visit the same village several time in the course of one year these fire arise from pure carelessness sheer apathy and laziness sanitary precaution too be very insufficient practically there be none huge unsightly water-hole fill during the rain with the drainage of all the dung-heap and mound of offal and filth that abound in the village swelter under the hot summer sun they get cover with a rank green scum and if they inky depths be stir the foulest and most fearful odour issue forth in these filthy pool the villager often perform they ablutions they do not scruple to drink the putrid water which be no doubt a hotbed and regular nursery for fever and choleraic and other disorder many home reader be but little acquaint with the indian village system and i shall devote a chapter to the description of a hindoo village with its functionary its institution its inhabitant and the more marked of they custom and avocation chapter xiii description of a native village -- village functionary -- the barber -- bathing habit -- the village well -- the school -- the child -- the village bazaar -- the landowner and he dwelling -- the ` putwarrie ' or village accountant -- the blacksmith -- the ` punchayiet ' or village jury system -- we legal system in indium -- remark on the administration of justice a typical village in behar be a heterogeneous collection of thatched hut apparently set down at random -- as indeed it be for every one erect he hut wherever whim or caprice lead he or wherever he can get a piece of vacant land grove of feathery bamboo and broad-leaved plumy-looking plantain almost conceal the hut and building several small orchard of mango surround the village the road lead to and from it be merely well-worn cattle track -- in the rain a perfect quagmire and in the hot weather dusty and confine between straggle hedge of aloe or prickly pear these hedge be festoon with mass of clinging luxuriant creeper among which sometimes struggle up a custard apple a avocado pear or a wild plum-tree the latter be a prickly straggle tree call the _ bhyre _ the wood be very hard and be often use for make plough the fruit be a little hard yellow crisp fruit with a big stone inside and very sweet when it be ripe the village urchin throw stick up among the branch and feast on the golden shower on many of the bank border the road thatch grass or rather strong upright wave grass with a beautiful feathery plume be plant this be use to make the wall of the house and these be then plaster outside and in with clay and cowdung the tall hedge of dense grass keep what little breeze there may be away from the traveller the road be something like a irish ` boreen ' want only its beauty and freshness on a hot day the atmosphere in one of these village road be stifle and load with dust these house with they grass wall and thatched roof be call _ kutcha _ as oppose to more pretentious structure of burnt brick with maybe a tiled sloping or flat plaster roof which be call _ pucca pucca _ literally mean ` ripe ' as oppose to _ cutcha _ ` unripe ' but the rich oriental tongue have adapt it to almost every kind of secondary meaning thus a man who be true upright respect a man to be depend on be call a _ pucca _ man it be a word in constant use among anglo-indian a _ pucca _ road be one which be bridge and metal if you make a engagement with a friend and he want to impress you with its importance he will ask you now be that _ pucca _ ' and so on other house in the village be compose of unburnt brick cement with mud or maybe compose of mud wall and thatched roof these be a compound sort of erection be call _ cutcha pucca _ in the _ cutcha _ house live the poorer caste the _ chumar _ or worker in leather the _ moosahm doosadh _ or _ gwallah _ the _ dorne _ or scavenger feeder on offal have to live apart in a _ tolah _ which might be call a small suburb by themselves the _ dorne _ drag from the village any animal that happen to die they generally pursue the handicraft of basket making or mat making and the _ dorne tolah _ can always be know by the pig and fowl prowl about in search of food and the _ dorne _ and he family splitting up bamboo and weave mat and basket at the door of they miserable habitation to the higher caste both pig arid fowl be unclean and a abomination _ moosahm doosadh _ and other poor caste such as _ dangur _ keep however a army of gaunt lean hungry-looking pig these may be see root and wallow in the marsh when the rice have be cut or forage among the mango grove to pick up any stray unripe fruit that may have escape the keen eye of the hungry and swarming child there be yet another small _ tolah _ or suburb call the _ kusbee tolah _ here live the miserable outcast who minister to the worst passion of we nature these degrade being be banish from the more respectable portion of the community but here as in we own highly civilised and favored land vice hover by the side of virtue and the hindoo village contain the same element of happiness and misery profligacy and probity purity and degradation as the fine home city that be a name in the mouth of man every village form a perfect little commonwealth it contain all the element of self-existence it be quite a little commune so far as social life be concern there be a hereditary blacksmith washerman potter barber and writer the _ dhobee _ or washerman can always be know by the propinquity of he donkey diminutive animal which he use to transport he bundle of unsavoury dirty clothes to the pool or tank where the linen be wash on great country road you may often see string of donkey laden with bag of grain which they transport from far-away village to the big bazaar but if you see a laden donkey near a village be sure the _ dhobee _ be not far off here as elsewhere the _ hajam _ or barber be a great gossip and generally a favorite he use no soap and have a most uncouth-looking razor yet he shave the head beard moustache and armpit of he customer with great deftness the lower class of native shave the hair of the head and of the armpit for the sake of cleanliness and for other obvious reason the higher class be very regular in they ablutions every morning be the water cold or warm the rajpoot and brahmin the respectable middle class and all in the village who lay any claim to social position have they _ goosal _ or bath some hie to the nearest tank or stream at all hour of the day at any ferry or landing stage you will see swarthy fine-looking fellow up to mid waist in the water scrub vigorously they bronze arm and neck and chest they clean they tooth with the end of a stick which they chew at one extremity till they loosen the fiber and with this improvise toothbrush and some wood ash for paste they make they look as white and clean as ivory there be generally a large masonry well in the middle of the village with a broad smooth _ pucca _ platform all round it it have be build by some former father of the hamlet to perpetuate he memory to fulfil a vow to the god perhaps simply from goodwill to he fellow townsman at all event there be generally one such in every village it be generally shadow by a huge _ bhur peepul _ or tamarind tree here may always be see the busiest sight in the village pretty young woman chatter laugh and talk and assume all sort of picturesque attitude as they fill they waterpot the village matron gossip and sometimes quarrel as they pull away at the windlass over the deep cool well on the platform be a group of fat brahmin nearly nude they lighter skin contrast well with the duskier hue of the lower class there be several group with damp drapery cling to they glisten skin they pour brass pot of cold water over they drip body they rub themselves briskly and gasp again as the cool element pour over head and shoulder they sit down while some young attendant or relation vigorously rub they down the back while sit they clean they foot thus amid much laughing and talk and quaint gesture and not a little expectoration they perform they ablutions not unfrequently the more wealthy anoint they body with mustard oil which at all event keep out cold and chill as they claim that it do though it be not fragrant round the well you get all the village news and scandal it be always throng in the morning and evening and only desert when the fierce heat of midday plunge the village into a lethargic silence unbroken save where the hum of the hand-mill or the thump of the husking-post tell where some busy damsel or matron be grind flour or husk rice in the cool shadow of she hut for the want of she lord and master education be now make rapid stride it be foster by government and many of the wealthier landowner or zemindar subscribe liberally for a schoolmaster in they village near the principal street then in a sort of lane shadow by a old mango-tree we come on the village school the little fellow have all discard they upper clothes on account of the heat and with much noise sway the body backwards and forwards and monotonously intone they grind away at the mill of learning and try to get a knowledge of book other dusky urchin figure away with lump of chalk on the floor or on flat piece of wood to serve as copy-book the din increase as the stranger pass : go into a english school the stranger would probably cause a momentary pause in the hum that be always hear in school the little hindoo scholar probably wish to impress you with a sense of he assiduity he raise he voice sway the body more briskly keep he one eye firmly fix on he task while with the other he throw a keen swift glance over you which embrace every detail of you costume and not improbably include a shrewd estimate of you disposition and character hindoo child never seem to I to be boy or girl they be preternaturally acute and observant you seldom see they play together they seem to be bear with the gift of tell a lie with most portentous gravity they wear a air of the most winning candor and guileless innocence when they be all the while plot some petty scheme against you they be certainly far more precocious than english child they realize the hard struggle for life far more quickly the poorer class can hardly be say to have any childhood as soon as they can toddle they be send to weed cut grass gather fuel tend herd or do anything that will bring they in a small pittance and ease the burden of the struggle parent i think the child of the higher and middle class very pretty they have beautiful dark thoughtful eye and a most intelligent expression very young baby however be miserably nurse they hair be allow to get all tangled and mat into unsightly knot they face be seldom wash and they eye be paint with antimony about the lid and be often rheumy and run with water the use of the pocket handkerchief be sadly neglect there be generally one open space or long street in we village and in a hamlet of any importance there be weekly or bi-weekly a bazaar or market from early morning in all direction from solitary hut in the forest from struggle little croft in the rice land from fisherman 's dwelling perch on the bank of the river from lonely camp in the grass jungle where the herd and he family live with they cattle from all the petty thorpe about come the woman with they basket of vegetable they bundle of spin yarn they piece of weave cloth whatever they have to sell or barter there be a lad with a pair of wooden shoe which he have fashion as he be tend the village cow another with a grass mat or bamboo staff or some other strange outlandish-looking article which he hope to barter in the bazaar for something on which he heart be set the _ bunniah _ hurry up they totter overladen pony the rice merchant twist he patient bullock 's tail to make it move faster the cloth merchant with he bale under he arm and measure stick in hand walk briskly along here come a gang of charcoal-burner with they load of fuel sling on pole dangle from they shoulder a _ box wallah _ with he attendant coolie stagger under the weight of a huge box of manchester goods hurry by it be a busy sight in the bazaar what a cackle what a confused clatter of voice here also the woman be the chief contributor to the din of tongue there be no irate husband here or moody master to tell they to be still spread out on the ground be heap of different grain bag of flour basket of meal pulse or barley sweetmeat occupy the attention of nearly all the buyer all hindoo indulge in sweet which take the place of beer with we instead of a ` nobbler ' they offer you a ` lollipop ' trinket bead bracelet armlet and anklet of pewter there be in great bunch fruit vegetable stick of cane skin full of oil and sugar and treacle stand with fresh ` paun ' leave and pile of coarse look mass of tobacco be largely patronise it be like a hive of bee the dust hover over the move mass the smell be various none of they ` blest odour of sweet araby ' drug condiment spice shoe in fact everything that a rustic population can require be here the _ pice _ jingle as they change hand the haggle and chaffer be without parallel in any market at home here be a man apparently in the last madness of intense passion in fierce altercation with another who try he utmost to outbluster he furious declamation in a moment they be smile and to all appearance the best friend in the world the bargain have be conclude it be all about whether the one could give three _ brinjal _ or four for one pice it be a scene of indescribable bustle noise and confusion by evening however all will have be pack up again and only the faint outline of yet float cloud of dust and the hop cheeky crow pick up the scatter litter and remnant of the market will remain to tell that it have be bazaar day in we village generally about the center of it there be a more pretentious structure with verandah support on wooden pillar high wall surround a rather commodious courtyard there be mysterious little door through which you can get a peep of crooked little stair lead to the upper room or to the roof from dusky inside verandah half-naked listless indolent figure lie about or walk slowly to and from the yard with seemingly purposeless indecision in the outer verandah be a old _ palkee _ with evidence in the tarnished gilding and fray and tattered hanging that it once have some pretension to fashionable elegance the wall of the building however be sadly crack and numerous young _ peepul _ tree grow in the crevice they insidious root creep farther and farther into the fissure and expedite the work of decay which be everywhere apparent it be the residence of the zemindar the lord of the village the owner of the land adjoining probably he be descend from some noble house of ancient lineage he forefather possibly lead armed retainer against some rival in yonder far off village where the dim outline of a mud fort yet tell of the insecurity of the day of old now he be old and fat and lazy possibly he have be too often to the money-lender he land be mortgage to they full value though they respect and look up to they old zemindar the villager be get independent they be not so humble and pay less and less of feudal tribute than in the old day when the golden palanquin be new when the elephant have splendid housing when mace and javelin and matchlock-man follow in he train alas the elephant be sell long ago and be now the property of a wealthy _ bunniah _ who have amass money in the buying and selling of grain and oil the zemindar may be a man of progress and intelligence but many be of this break down and helpless type hold the land of the village by hereditary right by grant conquest or purchase he collect he rent from the village through a small staff of _ peon _ or un-official police the account be keep by another important village functionary -- the _ putwarrie _ or village accountant _ putwarry _ belong to the writer or _ kayasth _ caste they be probably as clever and at the same time as unscrupulous as any class in indium they manage the most complicated account between ryot and landlord with great skill they memory be wonderful but they can always forget conveniently where ryot be numerous the landlord 's want press and frequent call make on the tenantry for payment often make in various kind of grain and produce the rate and price of which be constantly change it be easy to imagine the complication and intricacy of a _ putwarrie 's _ account each ryot pretty accurately remember he own particular indebtedness but woe to he if he pay the _ putwarrie _ the value of a ` red cent ' without take a receipt certainly there may be a really honest _ putwarrie _ but i very much doubt it the name stand for chicanery and robbery on the one hand the landlord be constantly stir he up for money question he account and put he not unfrequently to actual bodily coercion the ryot on the other hand be constantly invent excuse get up delay and propound innumerable reason why he can not pay he will try to forge receipt he will get up false evidence that he have already pay and the wretched _ putwarrie _ need all he native and acquire sharpness to hold he own but all ryot be not alike and when the _ putwarrie _ get hold of some unwary and ignorant bumpkin whom he can plunder he _ do _ plunder he systematically all cowherd be popularly suppose to be cattle lifter and a _ putwarrie _ after he have get over the stage of infancy and have be indoctrinate into all the knavery that he elder can teach he be suppose to belong to the highest category of villain a popular proverb much use in behar say : -- ` unda poortee cowa maro iinnum I billar : bara burri I kayashh marige humesha mara gwar ' this be translate thus : ` when the shell be break kill the crow and the wild cat at its birth ' a _ kayasth _ writer or _ putwarrie _ may be allow to live till he be twelve year old at which time he be sure to have learn rascality then kill he but kill _ gwar _ or cowherd any time for they be invariably rascal there be a deal of grim bucolic humor in this and it very nearly hit the truth the _ putwarrie _ then be a important personage he have he _ cutcherry _ or office where he and he tribe -lrb- for there be always number of he fellow caste man who help he in he book and account -rrb- squat on they mat on the ground each possess the instrument of he call in the shape of a small brass ink-pot and a oblong box contain a knife pencil and several reed for pen each have a bundle of papers and document before he this be call he _ busta _ and contain all the papers he use there they sit and have fierce squabble with the tenantry there be always some noise about a putwarrie 's cutcherry he have generally some half dozen quarrel on hand but he trust to he pen and tongue and clever brain he be essentially a man of peace hate physical contest delight in a keen argument and a encounter with a plot calculate brain another proverb say that the putwarrie have as much chance of become a soldier as a sheep have of success in attack a wolf the _ lohar _ or blacksmith be very unlike he prototype at home here be no sound anvil no dusky shop with the spark from the heated iron light up its dim recess there be little to remind one of longfellow 's beautiful poem the _ lohar _ sit in the open air he hammer and other implement of trade be very primitive like all native handicraftsman he sit down at he work he bellows be make of two loose bag of sheepskin lift alternately by the attendant coolie as they lift they get inflate with air they be then sharply force down on they own fold and the contain air eject forcibly through a iron or clay nozzle into the very small heap of glowing charcoal which form the fire he principal work be make and sharpen the uncouth-looking ploughshare which look more like flat blunt chisel than anything else they also make and keep in repair the _ hussowah _ or serrated sickle with which the crop be cut they be slow at they task but many of they be ingenious worker in metal they be very imitative and i have see many english tool and even gun-lock make by a common native village blacksmith that could not be surpass in delicacy of finish by any english smith it be foreign to we idea of the brawny blacksmith to hear that he sit to he work but this be the invariable custom even carpenter and mason squat down to theirs cheap labor be but a arbitrary term and a country smith at home might do the work of ten or twelve man in indium but it be just as well to get a idea of exist difference on many of the factory there be very intelligent _ mistree _ which be the term for the master blacksmith these man get but twenty-four to thirty shilling a month and supply themselves with food and clothing be nevertheless competent to work all the machinery attend to the engine and do all the ironwork necessary for the factory they will superintend the staff of blacksmith and if the sewing-machine of the _ mem sahib _ the gun-lock of the _ luna sahib _ the lawn-mower english pump or other machine get out of order require any metal work the _ mistree _ be call in and be generally competent to put thing to rights -lrb- illustration : carpenter and blacksmith at work -rrb- as i have say every village be a self-contained little commune all trade necessary to supply the want of the villager be represent in it besides the profit from he actual call nearly every man except the daily labourer have a little bit of land which he farm so as to eke out he scanty income all possess a cow or two a few goat and probably a pair of plough-bullock when a dispute arise in the village should a person be suspect of theft should he cattle trespass on he neighbor 's grow crop should he libel some one against whom he have a grudge or proceed to stronger measure take the law into he own hand and assault he the aggrieved party complain to the head man of the village in every village the head man be the fountain of justice he hold he office sometimes by right of superior wealth or intelligence or hereditary succession not unfrequently by the unanimous wish of he fellow-villager on a complaint be make to he he summons both party and they witness the complainant be then allow to nominate two man to act as assessor or juryman on he behalf he nomination be liable to challenge by the opposite party the defendant next name two to act on he behalf and if these be agree to by both party these four with the head man form what be call a _ punchayiet _ or council of five in fact a jury they examine the witness and each party to the suit conduct he own case the whole village not unfrequently attend to hear what go on in a mere caste or private quarrel only the friend of the party will attend every case be try in public and all the inhabitant of the village can hear the proceedings if they wish respectable inhabitant can remark on the proceedings make suggestion and give a opinion public feeling be thus pretty accurately gauge and test and the _ punchayiet _ agree among themselves on the verdict to the honor of they character for fair play be it say that the decision of a _ punchayiet _ be generally correct and be very seldom appeal against we complicated system of law with its delay its technicality its uncertainty and above all its expense its stamp duty its court fee its bribe to native underling and the innumerable vexation attendant on the administration of justice in we revenue and criminal court be repugnant to the villager of hindostan they be very litigious and believe in we desire to give they justice and protection to life and property but we court be far too costly we machinery of justice be far too intricate and complicated for a people like the hindoo ` justice within the gate ' be what they want it be quite enough admission of the reality of we rule -- that we be the paramount power -- that they submit a case to we at all and all impediment in the way of they get cheap and speedy justice should be do away with a codification of exist law a sweeping away of one half the form and technicality that at present bewilder the applicant for justice and altogether a less legal and more equitable procedure have a due regard to efficiency and the conservation of imperial interest should be the aim of we indian ruler more especially should this be the case in rural district where large interest be concern where case involve delicate point of law we present court divest of they hungry crowd of middleman and retainer be right enough but i would like to see rural court for petty case establish preside over by lead native planter merchant and man of probity which would in a measure supplement the _ punchayiet _ system which would be easy of access cheap in they procedure and with all the impress of authority it be a question i merely glance at as it do not come within the scope of a book like this but it be well know to every planter and european who have come much in contact with the rural class of hindostan that there be a vast amount of smoulder disaffection of deep-rooted dislike to and contempt of we present cumbrous costly machinery of law and justice if a villager wish to level a withering sarcasm at the head of a plausible talkative fellow all promise and no performance ready with tongue but not with purse or service he call he a _ vakeel _ that be a lawyer if he have to cool he heel in you office or round the factory to get some little business do to neglect he work to get he rent or produce account investigate wherever there be worry trouble delay or difficulty about anything concern the relation between himself and the factory the deepest and keenest expression of discontent and disgust he versatile and acute imagination can suggest or he fluent tongue give utterance to be that this be ` adanlut lea mafich ' that be ` like a court of justice ' could there be a stronger commentary on we judicial institution the world be wake up now rapidly from the lethargic sleep of age man 's mind be keenly alive to what be pass communication be much improve the dissemination of news be rapid the old race of besotted ignorant tenant and grasp avaricious domineering tyrant of landlord be fast die out and there could be no difficulty in establish in such village or district court as i have indicate all educate respectable european with a stake in the country should be make justice of the peace with limited power to try petty case there be a vast material -- loyalty educate mind a honest desire to do justice independence and a genuine scorn of everything pettifogging and underhand -- that the indian government would do well to utilise the best friend of the baboo can not acquit he of a tendency to temporise a hankering after finesse a too fatal facility to fall under pecuniary temptation the educate gentleman planter of the present day be above suspicion and before shower title and honor on native gentleman elevate they to the bench and deluge the service with they it might be worth we ruler ' while to utilise or try to utilise the experience loyalty honor and integrity of those of we countryman who might be willing to place they service at the disposal of government ` indium for the indian ' be a very good cry it sound well but it will not do to push it to its logical issue unless indian can govern indium wisely and well in accordance with modern national idea they have no more right to indium than hottentot have to the cape or the black fellow to australia in my opinion hindoo would never govern hindustan half quarter nay one tithe as well as englishman make more of you englishman in indium then make not less of you baboo if you please but make more of you englishman keep they loyal and content treat they kindly and liberally one englishman contented loyal and industrious in a indian district be a greater pillar of strength to the indian government than ten dozen baboo or zemindar let they have as many title decoration university degree or certificate of loyalty from junior civilian as they may not india for the indian but indium for imperial britain say i chapter xiv a native village continue -- the watchman or ` chowkeydar ' -- the temple -- brahmin -- idol -- religion -- humility of the poorer class -- they low condition -- they apathy -- the police -- they extortion and knavery -- a instance of police rascality -- corruption of native official -- the hindoo unfit for self-government one more important functionary we have yet to notice the watchman or _ chowkeydar _ he be generally a _ doosadh _ or other low caste man and perambulate the village at night at interval utter a loud cry or a fierce howl which be catch up and echo by all the _ chowkeydar _ of the neighbouring village it be a weird strange sound cry after cry echo far away distance beyond distance till it fade into faintness at time it be not a unmusical cry but when he howl out close to you tent wake you from you first dreamless sleep you do not feel it to be so the _ chowkeydar _ have to see that no thief enter the village by night he protect the herd and property of the villager if a theft or crime occur he must at once report it to the nearest police station if you lose you way by night you shout out for the nearest _ chowkeydar _ and he be bind to pass you on to the next village these man get a small gratuity from government but the villager also pay they a small sum which they assess accord to individual mean the _ chowkeydar _ be generally a ragged swarthy fellow with long matted hair a huge iron-bound staff and always a blue _ puggra _ the blue be he official badge sometimes he have a brass badge and carry a sword a curved blunt weapon the handle of which be so small that scarcely a englishman 's hand would be find to fit it it be more for show than use and in thousand of case it have become so fix in the scabbard that it can not be draw -lrb- illustration : hindoo village temple -rrb- in the immediate vicinity of each village and often in the village itself be a small temple sacred to vishnu or shiva it be often perch high up on some bank overlook the lake or village tank generally there be some umbrageous old tree overshadow the sacred fane and seat near recline in the shade be several oleaginous old brahmin if the weather be hot they generally wear only the _ dhote _ or loin cloth make of fine linen or cotton and hang about the leg in not ungraceful fold the brahmin can be tell by he sacred thread worn round the neck over the shoulder he skin be much fairer than the majority of he fellow villager it be not unfrequently a pale golden olive and i have see they as fair as many european they be intelligent man with acute mind but lazy and self-indulgent frequently the village brahmin be simply a sensual voluptuary this be not the time or place to descant on they religion which with many gross practice contain not a little that be pure and beautiful the common idea at home that they be miserable pagan ` bow down to stock and stone ' be like many of the accept idea about indium very much exaggerate that the mass the crude uneducated hindoo place some faith in the idol and expect in some mysterious way that it will influence they fate for good or evil be not to be deny but the more intelligent native and most of the brahmin only look on the idol as a visible sign and symbol of the divinity they want a vehicle to carry they thought upward to god and the idol be a means to assist they thought heavenward as work of art they idol be not equal to the fine picture and other symbol of the greek or the roman catholic but they serve the same purpose where the village be very poor and no pious founder have perpetuate he memory or do honor to the god by erect a temple the native content themselves with a rough mud shrine which they visit at interval and daub with red paint they deposit flower pour libation of water or milk and in other way strive to shew that a religious impulse be stir within they so far as i have observe however the vast mass of the poor toiler in indium have little or no religion material want be too press they may have some dumb vague aspiration after a higher and a holier life but the fight for necessaries for food raiment and shelter be too incessant for they to indulge much in contemplation they have a dim idea of a future life but none of they can give you anything but a very unsatisfactory idea of they religion they observe certain form and ceremony because they father do and because the brahmin tell they of real vital practical religion as we know it they have little or no knowledge ask any common labourer or one of the low caste about immortality about salvation about the higher virtue about the yearning and wish that every immortal soul at period have and he will simply tell you ` khoda jane hum greel admus ' ie ` god know i be only a poor man ' there they take refuge always when you ask they anything puzzling if you be rate they for a fault ask they to perform a complicated task or inquire you way in a strange neighborhood the first answer you get will ten to one be ` hum greel admus ' it be say almost instinctively and no doubt in many case be the refuge of simple disinclination to think the matter out pure laziness suggest it it be too much trouble to frame a answer or give the desire information and the ` greel admus ' come naturally to the lip it be often deprecatory meaning ' i be ignorant and uninformed ' you must not expect too ` much from a poor rude uncultivated man like I ' it be often also a delicate mode of flattery which be truly oriental imply and often convey in a tone a look a gesture that though the speaker be ` greel ' poor humble despise it be only by contrast to you the questioner who be mighty exalted and powerful for downright fawn obsequiousness or delicate imply fine-strung subtle flattery i will back a hindoo sycophant against the courtier or place-hunter of every other nation it be very annoying at time if you be in a hurry and particularly want a direct answer to a plain question to hear the old old story ' i be a poor man ' but there be nothing for it but patience you must ask again plainly and kindly the poorer class be easily flurry they will always give what information they have if kindly speak to but you must not fluster they you must rouse they mind to think and let they fairly grasp the purport of you inquiry for they be very suspicious often ponder over you object carefully consider all the pro and con as to you motive inclination or you position many try to give a answer that they think would be please to you if they think you be weary and tired and you ask you distance from the place you may be wish to reach they will ridiculously underestimate the length of road a man may have all the cardinal virtue but if they think you do not like he and you ask he character they will paint he to you blacker than satan himself it be very hard to get the plain unvarnished truth from a hindoo many indeed be almost incapable of give a intelligent answer to any question that do not nearly concern they own private and purely personal interest they have a sordid grub vegetate life many of they indeed be but little above the brute creation they have no idea beyond the supply of the mere animal want of the moment the future never trouble they they live they hard unlovely life and experience no pleasure and no surprise they have few regret they mind be mere blank and life be one long continued struggle with nature for bare subsistence what wonder then that they be fatalist they do not speculate on the mystery of existence they be content to be to labor to suffer to die when they time come like a dog because it be _ kismet _ -- they fate many of they never strive to avert any impending calamity such for example as sickness a man sicken he wrap himself in stolid apathy he make no effort to shake of he malady he accept it with sullen despairing pathetic resignation as he fate he friend mourn in they dumb despairing way but they too accept the situation he have no one to rouse he if you ask he what be the matter he only wail out ` hum kya kurre ' what can i do i be unwell no attempt whatever to tell you of the origin of he illness no wish even for sympathy or assistance he accept the fact of he illness he struggle not with fate it be so ordain why fight against it amen so let it be i have often be sadden to see poor toiling tenant strike down in this way even if you give they medicine they often have not energy enough to take it you must see they take it before you eye it be _ you _ struggle not theirs _ you _ must rouse they by _ you _ will _ you _ energy must compel _ they _ to make a attempt to combat they weakness once you rouse a man and infuse some spirit into he he may resist he disease but it be a hard fight to get he to try what a meaning in that one word try to act to do the average poor suffering native hindoo know nothing of it of course they mood vary they have they ` high day and holiday ' feast procession and entertainment but on the whole the average ryot or small cultivator have a hard life in every village there be generally bit of uncultivated or jungle land on which the village herd have a right of pasture the cow be a sacred animal they only use she product milk and butter the urchin may be see in the morning drive long string of emaciated look animal to the village pasture which in the evening wend they weary way backwards through the choke dust have have but ` short common ' all the day on the parched and scanty herbage the police be too often a source of annoyance and become extortionate robber instead of the protector of the poor it seem to be inherent in the oriental mind to abuse authority i do not scruple to say that all the vast army of policeman court peon writer clerk messenger and underling of all sort about the court of justice in the service of government officer or in any way attach to the retinue of a government official one and all be undeniably shamelessly venal and corrupt they accept a bribe much more quickly than a attorney a fee or a hungry dog a shin of beef if a policeman only enter a village he expect a feast from the head man and will ask a present with unblushing effrontery as a perquisite of he office if a theft be report the inspector of the nearest police-station or _ thanna _ as it be call send one of he myrmidon or if the chance of bribe be good he may attend himself on arrival amble on he broken-kneed wall-eyed pony he seat himself in the verandah of the chief man of the village who forthwith with much inward trepidation make he appearance the policeman assume the air of a haughty conqueror receive homage from a conquer foe he assure the tremble wretch that ` act on information receive ' he must search he dwelling for the miss goods and that he woman 's apartment will have to be ransack and so annoy goad and insult the unfortunate man that he be too glad to purchase immunity from further insolence by make the policeman a small present perhaps a ` kid of the goat ' or something else the guardian of the peace be then regale with the best food in the house after which he be ` wreathe with smile ' if he see a chance of a farther bribe he take he departure say he will make he report to the _ thanna _ he repeat he procedure with some of the other respectable inhabitant and go back a good deal richer than he come to share the spoil with the _ thannadar _ or inspector another man may then be send and the same course be follow until all the force in the station have have they share the ryot be afraid to resist the police have tremendous power for annoying and do he harm a crowd of subservient scoundrel always hang round the station dependent relation or accomplice these harry the poor man who be unwise enough to resist the extortionate demand of the police they take he cattle to the pound foment strife between he and he neighbor get up frivolous and false charge against he harass he in a thousand way and if all else fail get he summon as a witness in some case you might think a witness a person to be treat with respect to be attend to to have every facility offer he for give he evidence at the least cost of time and trouble possible consistent with the demand of justice and the vindication of law and authority not so in indium with the witness in a police case when the force dislike he if he have not previously satisfy they leech-like rapacity he be torment tortured bully and kick ` from pillar to post ' till he life become a burden to he he have to leave all he avocation perhaps at the time when he affair require he constant supervision he have to trudge many a weary mile to attend the court the police get hold of he and keep he often in real durance he get no opportunity for cooking or eat he food he daily habit be upset and interfere with in every little vexatious way -lrb- and they be master of the art of petty torture -rrb- they so worry and goad he that the very threat of be summon as a witness in a police case be often enough to make the horrify well-to-do native give a handsome gratuity to be allow to sit quietly at home this be no exaggeration it be the every day practice of the police they exercise a real despotism they have set up a reign of terror the nature of the ryot be such that he will submit to a great deal to avoid have to leave he home and he work the police take full advantage of this feeling and be perfectly unscrupulous insatiably rapacious and league together in villany they make a golden harvest out of every case put into they hand they have make the name of justice stink in the nostril of the respectable and well-to-do middle class of indium the district superintendent be man of energy and probity but after all they be only mortal what with account inspection report form and innumerable writings they can not exercise a constant vigilance and personal supervision over every part of they district a district may comprise many hundred village thousand of inhabitant and league of intricate and densely peopled country the mere physical exertion of ride over he district would be too much for any man in about a week the subordinate police be all interested in keep up the present system of extortion and the inspector and sub-inspector who wink at malpractice come in for they share of the spoil there be little combination among the peasantry each selfishly try to save he own skin and they know that if any one individual be to complain or to dare to resist he would have to bear the brunt of the battle alone none of he neighbor would stir a finger to back he he be too timid and too much in awe of the official european and constitutionally too averse to resistance to do aught but suffer in silence no doubt he feel he wrong most keenly and a sullen feeling of hate and wrong be be garner up which may produce result disastrous for the peace and wellbeing of we empire in the east as a case in point i may mention one instance out of many which come under my own observation i have a _ moonshee _ or accountant in one of my outwork in purneah formerly when the police have come through the factory he have be in the habit of give they a present and some food under my strict order however that no policeman be to be allow near the place unless they come on business he have discontinue pay he black mail this be too glare a infringement of what they consider they vested rights to be pass over in silence example might spread my man must be make a example of i have a case in the court of the deputy magistrate some twenty mile or so from the factory the moonshee have be name as a witness to prove the writing of some papers file in the suit they get a citation for he to appear a mere summons for he attendance as a witness arm with this they appear at the factory two or three day before the date fix on for hear the cause i have just ridden in from purneah tired hot and dusty and be sit in the shade of the verandah with young d my assistant one policeman first come up present the summons which i take and he then state that it be a _ warrant _ for the production of my moonshee and that he must take he away at once i tell the man it be merely a summons require the attendance of the moonshee on a certain date to give evidence in the case he be very insolent in he manner it be customary when a hindoo of inferior rank appear before you that he remove he shoe and stand before you in a respectful attitude this man 's headdress be all disarrange which in itself be a sign of disrespect he speak loudly and insolently keep he shoe on and sit down squat on the grass before I my assistant be very indignant and want to speak to the man but rightly judge that the object be to enrage I and trap I into commit some overt act that would be afterwards construe against I i keep my temper speak very firmly but temperately tell he my moonshee be do some work of great importance that i could not spare he service then but that i would myself see that the summons be attend to the policeman become more boisterous and insolent i offer to give he a letter to the magistrate acknowledge the receipt of the summons and i ask he he own name which he refuse to give i ask he if he could read and he say he could not i then ask he if he could not read how could he know what be in the paper which he have bring and how he know my moonshee be the party mean he say a chowkeydar have tell he so i ask where be the chowkeydar and see from my coolness and determination that the game be up he shout out and from round the corner of the hut come another policeman and two village chowkeydar from a distance they have evidently be hide observe all that pass and mean to act as witness against I if i have be lead by the first scoundrel 's behavior to lose my temper the second man be not such a brute as the first and when i proceed to ask they name and all about they and tell they i mean to report they to they superintendent they become somewhat frightened and try to make excuse i tell they to be off the premise at once offer to take the summons and give a receipt for it but they now see that they have make a mistake in try to bully I and make off at once mark the sequel the day before the case be fix on for hearing i send off the moonshee who be a witness of my own and he evidence be necessary to my prove my case i supply he with travel expense and he start on he way to the court he have to pass the _ thanna _ or police-station the police be on the watch he be seize as he pass he be confine all that night and all the follow day for want of he evidence i lose my case and have thus achieve one part of they object to pay I off they let my moonshee go after insult and abuse and with threat of future vengeance should he ever dare to thwart or oppose they this be pretty ` hot ' you think but it be not all fear my complaint to the superintendent or to the authority might get they into trouble they lay a false charge against I that i have obstruct they in the discharge of they duty that i have shower abuse on they use threatening language and insult the majesty of the law by tear up and spit upon the respect summons of she majesty on this complaint i be accordingly summon into purneah the charge be a tissue of the most barefaced lie but i have to ride fifty-four mile in the burning sun ford several river and undergo much fatigue and discomfort my work be of course seriously interfere with i have to take in my assistant as witness and one or two of the servant who have be present i be put to immense trouble and no little expense to say nothing of the indignation which i naturally feel and all because i have set my face against a well know evil and be determine not to submit to impudent extortion of course the case break down they contradict themselves in almost every particular the second constable indeed admit that i have offer they a letter to the magistrate and have not move out of the verandah during the colloquy i be honourably acquit and have the satisfaction of see the lie rascal put into the dock by the indignant magistrate and prosecute summarily for get up a false charge and give false evidence it be a lesson to the police in those part and they do not dare to trouble I much afterwards but it be only one instance out of hundred i could give and which every planter have witness of the barefaced audacity the shameless extortion the unblushing lawlessness of the rural police of indium it be a gigantic evil but surely not irremediable by add more european officer to the force by educate the people and make they more intelligent independent and self-reliant much may be do to abate the evil but at present it be admittedly a foul ulcer on the administration of justice under we rule the menial who serve a summons get a decree of court to execute or be entrust with any order of a official nature expect to be bribe to do he duty if he do not get he fee he will throw such impediment in the way raise such obstacle and fashion such delay that he completely foil every effort to procure justice through a legal channel no wonder a native hate we english court we english official let it be plainly understand be above suspicion it need not my poor testimony to uphold they character for high honor loyal integrity and zealous eagerness to do ` justly and to walk uprightly ' they be unwearied in they effort to get at truth and govern wisely but we system of law be totally unsuited for oriental it be make a medium for chicanery and trickery of the most atrocious form most of the native underling be utterly venal and corrupt increase pay do not mean decrease of knavery cheating and lie and take bribe and abuse of authority be ingrain into they very soul and all the cut and dry formula of namby pamby philanthropist the inane maundering of stay-at-home sentimentalist the wise saw of self-opinionated theorist who know nothing of the hindoo as he really shew himself to we in daily and hourly contact with he will ever persuade I that native as oppose to english rule would be productive of aught but burn oppression and shameless venality or would end in anything but anarchy and chaos it sound very well in print and increase the circulation of a paper or two among the baboo to cry out that we task be to elevate the oppressed and ignorant million of the east to educate they into self-government to make they judge officer lawgiver governor over all the land to vacate we place and power and let the baboo and the bunneah to whom we have give the glory of western civilization rule in we place and guide the fortune of these toiling million who owe protection and peace to we foster rule it be a noble sentiment to resign wealth honor glory and power to give up a settled government to alter a policy that have weld the conflicting element of hindustan into one stable whole to throw up we title of conqueror and disintegrate a mighty empire for what a sprinkling of thinly-veneered half-educated native want a share of the loaf and fish in political scramble and a few inane people of the ` man and brother ' type cry out at home to let they have they way no give the hindoo education equal law protection to life and property develop the resource of the country foster all the virtue you can find in the native mind but till you can give he the energy the integrity the singleness of purpose the manly honorable straightforwardness of the anglo-saxon he scorn of meanness trickery and fraud he loyal single-heartedness to do right he contempt for oppression of the weak he self-dependence he probity but why go on when you make hindoo honest truthful god-fearing englishman you can let they govern themselves but as soon ` may the leopard change he spot ' as the hindoo he character he be wholly unfit for self-government utterly oppose to honest truthful stable government at all time bring strange change but the wisdom which have govern the country hitherto will surely be able to meet the new demand that may be make upon it in the immediate present or in the far distant future chapter xv jungle wild fruit -- curious method of catch quail

fruit-bearing bush who among my reader have not a lively recollection of bramble hunting nutting or merry expedition for blueberry wild strawberry raspberry and other wild fruit you might walk many a mile through the sal jungle without meeting fruit of any kind save the dry and tasteless wild fig or the sickly mhowa there be indeed very few jungle fruit that i have ever come across there be one acid sort of plum call the _ omra _ which make a good preserve but be not very nice to eat raw the _ gorkah _ be a small red berry very sweet and pleasant slightly acid not unlike a red currant in fact and with two small pip or stone the nepaulese call it _ bunchooree _ it grow on a small stunted-looking bush with few branch and a pointed leaf in form resemble the acacia leaf but not so large the _ glaphur _ be a brown round fruit the skin rather crisp and hard and of a dull earthy color not unlike that of a common boil potato the inside be a stringy spongy-looking mass with small seed embed in a gummy viscid substance the taste be exactly like a almond and it form a pleasant mouthful if one be thirsty travel one day along one of the glade i have mention as divide the strip of jungle i be surprise to see a man before I in a field of long stubble with a cloth spread over he head and two stick project in front at a obtuse angle to he body form horn-like projection on which the end of he cloth twist spirally be tie i think from he curious antic and movement that he must be mad but i soon discover that there be method in he madness he be catch quail the quail be often very numerous in the stubble field and the native adopt very ingenious device for they capture this be one i be now witness cover themselves with they cloth as i have describe the project end of the two stick represent the horn they simulate all the movement of a cow or bull they pretend to paw up the earth toss they make-believe horn turn round and pretend to scratch themselves and in fact identify themselves with the animal they be represent and it be irresistibly comic to watch a solitary performer go through this _ al fresco _ comedy i have laugh often at some cunning old herdsman or shekarry when they see you watch they they will redouble they effort and try to represent a old bull go through all he prank and practice and throw you into convulsion of laughter round two side of the field they have previously put fine net and at the apex they have a large cage with a decoy quail inside or perhaps a pair the quail be a run bird disincline for flight except at night in the day-time they prefer run to use they wing the idiotic look old cow as we will call the hunter have all he wit about he he proceed very slowly and warily he keen eye detect the covey of quail which way they be run he ruse generally succeed wonderfully he be no more like a cow than that respectable animal be like a cucumber but he paw and toss and move about pretend to eat to nibble here and switch he tail there and so maneuver as to keep the run quail away from the unprotected edge of the field when they get to the verge protect by the net they begin to take alarm they be probably not very certain about the peculiar look ` old cow ' behind they and run along the net they see the decoy quail evidently feed in great security and freedom the v shape mouth of the large basket cage look invitingly open the puzzling net be bar the way and the ` old cow ' be gradually close up behind as the hunter move along i should have tell you he rub two piece of dry hard stick gently up and down he thigh with one hand produce a peculiar crepitation a crackling sound not sufficient to startle the bird into flight but alarming they enough to make they get out of the way of the ` old cow ' one bolder than the other possibly the most timid of the covey irritated by the queer crackle sound now enter the basket the other follow like a flock of sheep and once in the puzzling shape of the entrance prevent they exit not unfrequently the hunter bag twenty or even thirty brace of quail in one field by this ridiculous look but ingenious method the small quail net be also sometimes use for the capture of hare the native stretch the net in the jungle much as they do the large net for deer describe in a former chapter form a line they then beat up the hare of which there be no stint my friend pat once make a novel haul he _ lobarkhanna _ or blacksmith 's shop be close to a patch of jungle and pat often notice number of quail run through the loose chink and crevice of the wall in the morning when anyone go into the place for the first time this be at a factory call rajpore pat come to the conclusion that as the blacksmith 's fire smoulder some time after work be discontinue at night and as the atmosphere of the hut be warmer and more genial than the cold foggy outside air for it be in the cold season the quail probably take up they quarter in the hut for the night on account of the warmth and shelter one night therefore he get some of he servant and with great caution and as much silence as possible they let down a quantity of net all round the lobarkhanna and in the morning they capture about twenty quail the quail be very pugnacious and as they be easily train to fight they be very common pet with the native who train and keep they to pit they against each other and bet what they can afford on the result a quail fight a battle between two trained ram a cock fight even a encounter between trained tame buffalo be very common spectacles in the village but the most popular sport be a good wrestling match the dweller in the presidency town and indeed in most of the large station seldom see a exhibition of this kind but away in the remote interior near the frontier it be very popular pastime and wrestling be a favorite with all class such manly sport be rather oppose to the commonly receive idea at home of the mild hindoo in nearly every village of behar however and all along the border of nepaul there be as a rule a bit of land attach to the residence of some head man or the common property of the commune set apart for the practice of athletic sport chief of which be the favorite _ khoosthee _ or wrestle there be generally some wary old veteran who have win he spur or laurel or belt or whatever you choose to call it in many a hard fight and well contest tussle for the championship of he little world he be ` up to every dodge ' and know every feint and guard every wile and tactic of the wrestling ground it be generally in some shady grove secluded and cool here of a evening when the labor of the day be over the most stalwart son of the hamlet meet to test each other skill and endurance in a friendly _ shake _ the old man put they through the preliminary practice show they every trick at he command and attend strictly to they training and various trial the ground be dig knee deep and form a soft good holding stand i have often look on at this evening practice and it would astonish a stranger who can not understand strength endurance and activity be attribute to a ` mere nigger ' to see the severe training these young lad impose upon themselves they leap into the air and suddenly assume a sit position then leap up again and squat down with a force that would seem to jerk every bone in they body out of its place this get up the muscle of the thigh some lie down at full length only touch the ground with the extreme tip of they toe they arm double up under they and sustain the full weight of the body on the extended palm of the hand they then sway themselves backwards and forwards to they full length never shift hand or toe till they be bath in perspiration they keep up a uniform steady backward and forward movement so as to develop the muscle of the arm chest and back they practice leap run and lift weight some standing at they full height brace up the muscle of the shoulder and upper arm and then leap up allow themselves to fall to earth on the tensely string muscle of the shoulder this severe exercise get the muscle into perfect form and few very few indeed of we untrained youth could cope in a dead lock or fierce struggle with a good village hindoo or mussulman in active training and have any knowledge of the trick of the wrestling school no hit be allow the hindoo system of wrestling be the perfection of science and skill mere dead weight of course will always tell in a close grip but the catch the hold the twist and dodge that be practiced allow for the fullest development of cultivate skill as against mere brute force the system be purely a scientific one the fundamental rule be ` catch where you can ' only you must not clutch the hair or strike with the fist the loin be tightly gird with a long waist-belt or _ kummerbund _ of cloth which pass repeatedly between the limb and round the loin sufficiently brace up and protect that part of the body in some match you be not allow to clutch this waist cloth or belt in some village it be allow the custom vary in various place but what be a fair grip and what be not be always make know before the competitor engage a twist or grip or dodge be know as a _ paench _ this literally mean a screw or twist but in wrestle phraseology mean any grip by which you can get such a advantage over you opponent as to defeat he for every paench there be a counter paench a throw be consider satisfactory when both shoulder of you opponent touch the ground simultaneously the old _ khalifa _ or trainer take a great interest in the progress of he _ chaila _ or pupil _ chailum _ really mean disciple or follower every khalifa have he favorite paench or grip which have stand he in good stead in he old battle day he teach these paench to he pupil so that when you get young fellow from different village to meet you see a really fine exhibition of wrestle skill there be little tripping as amongst we wrestler at home a dead-lock be uncommon the rival wrestler generally bind into the ring slapping they thigh and arm with a loud resounding slap they lift they leg high up from the ground with every step and scheme and maneuver sometimes for a long while to get the best corner they try to get the sun into they adversary eye they scan the appearance and every movement of they opponent the old wary fellow take it very coolly and if they can not get the desire side of the ground they keep hop about like a solemn old ostrich till the impetuosity or impatience of they foe lead he to attack they remind you for all the world of a pair of game cock they body be bent they head almost touch there be a deal of light play with the hand each try to get the other by the wrist or elbow or at the back of the head round the neck if one get the other by a finger even it be a great advantage as he would whip nimbly round and threaten to break the impound finger this would be consider quite fair one will often suddenly drop on he knee and try to reach the ankle of he adversary i have see a slippery customer stoop suddenly down grasp up a handful of dust and throw it into the eye of he opponent it be do with the quickness of thought but it be detect and on a appeal by the sufferer the knave be well thrash by the onlooker there be many professional who follow no other call wrestler be keep by raja and wealthy man who get up match frequently one village will challenge another like we village cricket club the villager often get up small subscription and purchase a silver armlet or bracelet the prize he who shall hold he own against all comer the ` champion 's belt ' scarcely call forth greater competition keener rivalry or better sport it be at once the most manly and most scientific sport in which the native indulge a disputed fall sometimes terminate in a general free fight when the backer of the respective man lay on the stick to each other with mutual hate and hearty lustiness it be not by any mean always the strongest who win the man who know the most paench who be agile active cool and careful will not unfrequently overthrow a antagonist twice he weight and strength all the wrestler in the country-side know each other 's qualification pretty accurately and at a general match get up by a zemindar or planter or by public subscription it be generally safe to let they handicap the man who be ready to compete for the prize we use generally to put down a few of the oldest professor and let they pit couple against each other the sport to the onlooker be most exciting between the man themselves as a rule the utmost good humor reign they strive hard to win but they accept a defeat with smile resignation it be only between rival village champion different caste man or worse still man of differ religion such as a hindoo and a mahommedan that there be any danger of a fight a disturbance be a rare exception but i have see a few wrestling match end in a regular general scrimmage with broken head and even fractured limb with good management however and a efficient body of man to guard against a breach of the peace this need never occur it rarely take much trouble to get up a match if you tell you head man that you would like to see one say on a Saturday afternoon they pass the word to the different village and at the appoint time all the finest young fellow and most of the male population lead by they head man with the old trainer in attendance be at the appoint place the competitor be admit within the enclosure and round it the row of spectator pack twenty deep squat on the ground and watch the proceedings with deep interest while the _ punchayiet _ a pick council be take down the name of intend competitor find out about they form and performance and assign to each he antagonist the young man throw themselves with shout and laughter into the ring and go through all the evolution and posture of the training ground they bind about try all sort of antic and contortion display wonderful agility and activity it be a pretty sight to see and one can not help admire they vigorous frame and graceful proportion they be handsome well make supple wiry fellow although they be nigger and hodge and gile at home would not have a chance with they in a fair wrestling bout conduct accord to they own law and custom the entry be now all make place and pair be arrange and to the ear-splitting thunder of two or three tom-tom two pair of strap youngster step into the ring they carefully scan each other advance shake hand or salaam leisurely tie up they back hair slap they muscle rub a little earth over they shoulder and arm so that they adversary may have a fair grip then step by step slowly and gradually they near each other a few quick passage be now interchange the lithe supple finger twist and intertwine grip be form on arm and neck the posture change each moment and be a study for a anatomist or sculptor as they warm to they work they get more reckless they be only the raw material the untrained lad there be a quick scuffle heave sway rock and struggle and the two victor leap into the air and slapping they chest bind back into the gratified circle of they comrade while the two discomfited athlete force a rueful smile retire and ` take a back seat ' two couple of more experienced hand now face each other there be pretty play this time as the vary change of the contest bring forth ever vary display of skill and science the crowd shout as a advantage be gain or cry out ` hi hi ' in a doubtful manner as they favorite seem to be get the worst of it the result however be much the same after a longer or shorter time two get fairly throw and retire if there be any dispute it be at once refer to the judge who sit grimly watch the struggle and compare the paench display with those they themselves have practice in many a well-won fight on a reference be make both combatant retain they exact hold and position only cease strain as soon as the matter be settle they go at it again till victory determine in favor of the lucky man in no similar contest in england i be convince would there be so much fairness quietness and order the only stimulant in the crowd be betel nut and tobacco all be orderly and calm and at any moment a word from the sahib will quell any rise turbulence it be now time for a still more scientific exhibition pat have a man a tall wiry handsome brahmin who have never yet be beat young k have long be jealous of he uniform success and on several occasion have bring a antagonist to battle with pat 's champion to-day he have get a sturdy young blacksmith whom rumor have much vaunted and although he be not so tall as pat 's wrestler he square deep chest and stalwart limb give promise of great strength and endurance as the two man strip and bind into the ring there be the usual hush of anticipation keen eye scan the appearance of the antagonist they be both model of manly beauty the blacksmith though more awkward in he motion have a cool determine look about he the brahmin conscious of he reputation walk quickly up with a smile of rather ostentatious condescension on he finely cut feature and offer he hand to the blacksmith the little man be evidently suspicious he think this may be a deeply lay trap to get a grip upon he nor do he like the bland patronising manner of ` roopuarain ' so he surlily draw back at which there be a roar of laughter from the crowd in which we can not help join k now come forward and pat he ` fancy man ' on the back the two wrestler thereupon shake hand and then in the usual manner both warily move backwards and forwards till amid cry from the onlooker the blacksmith make a sudden dash at the practice old player and in a moment have he round the waist he evidently depend on he superior strength for a moment he fairly lift roopnarain clean off he leg sway he to and fro and with a mighty strain try to throw he to the ground bend to the note roopnarain allow himself to yield till he foot touch the ground then crouch like a panther he bound forward and get he leg behind that of the blacksmith by a deft side twist he nearly throw he over the little fellow however steady himself on the ground with one hand recover he footing and again have the brahmin firmly lock in he tenacious hold roopuarain do not like the grip these be not the tactic he be accustom to while the other tug and strain he quietly yield he lithe lissome frame to every effort try hard with obstinate endeavor to untwist the hand that hold he firmly lock it be beautiful play to see the mute hand of both the wrestler feel tear twist at each other but the grasp be too firm and take advantage of a momentary movement roopnarain get he elbow under the other 's chin then lean forward he press he opponent 's head backward and the strain begin to tell he fight fiercely he struggle hard but the determine elbow be not to be baulk and to save himself from a overthrow the blacksmith be force to relax he hold and spring nimbly back beyond reach to mature another attack roopnarain quietly walk round rub he shoulder with earth and with the same mock smile stand lean forward he hand on he knee wait for a fresh onset this time the young fellow be more cautious he find he have no novice to deal with and the brahmin be not at all anxious to precipitate matter by a splendid feint after some pretty sparring for a grip the youngster again succeed in get a hold on the brahmin and wheeling round quick as lightning get behind roopnarain and with a dexterous trip throw the tall man heavily on he face he then try to get he by the ankle and bend he leg up backwards he would have get a purchase for turn he on he back the old man be however ` up to this move ' he lay extend flat on he chest he leg wide apart as often as the little one bent down to grasp he ankle he would put out a hand stealthily and silently as a snake and endeavor to get the little man 's leg in he grasp this necessitate a change of position and round and round they spin each try to get hold of the other by the leg or foot the blacksmith get he knee on the neck of the brahmin and by sheer strength try several time with a mighty heave to turn he opponent it be no use however it be next to impossible to throw a man when he be lie flat out as the brahmin now be it be difficult enough to turn the dead weight of a man in that position and when he be strain every nerve to resist the accomplishment of you object it become altogether impracticable the excitement in the crowd be intense the very drummer -- i ought to call he a tom-tomer -- have cease to beat he tom-tom pat 's lip be firmly press together and k be tremble with suppress excitement the heave chest and profuse perspiration bedew the body of both combatant tell how severe have be they exertion the blacksmith seem gather himself up for a mighty effort when quick as light the brahmin draw he limb together be see to arch he back and with a sudden backward movement seem to glide from under he dash assailant and quicker than it take I to write it the position be reverse the brahmin be now above and the blacksmith take in the altered aspect of affair at a glance throw himself flat on the ground and try the same tactic as he opponent the different play of the two man now come strongly into relief instead of exhausting himself with useless effort roopnarain while keep a wary eye on every movement of he prostrate foe contented himself while he take breath with coolly and and yet determinedly make he grip secure put out one leg then within reach of he opponent 's hand as a lure he see the blacksmith stretch forth to grasp the tempting hold quicker than the dart of the python the fierce onset of the kingly tiger the sudden flash of the fork and quiver lightning be the grasp make at the outstretched arm by the practice brahmin he tenacious finger close tightly round the other 's wrist one sudden wrench and he have the blacksmith 's arm bent back and powerless hold down on the little fellow 's own shoulder pat smile a derisive smile k utter what be not a benison while the brahmin in the crowd and all pat 's man raise a truly hindoo howl the position of the man be now this the stout little man be flat on he face one of he arm bent helplessly round on he own back roopnarain calm and cool as ever be astride the prostrate blacksmith placidly survey the crowd the little man writhe and twist and struggle he try with he leg to entwine himself with those of the brahmin he try to spin round the brahmin be watch with the eye of a hawk for a grip of the other arm but it be closely draw in and firmly press in safety under the heave chest of the blacksmith the muscle be of steel it could not be dislodge : that be see at a glance the calmness and placidity of the old athlete be surprising it be wonderful still bend the imprison arm further back he put he knee on the neck of the poor little hero game as a pebble through it all and by a strong steady strain try to bend he over till we think either the poor fellow 's neck must break or he arm be tear from its socket he endure all without a murmur not a chance do he throw away once or twice he make a splendid effort once he try to catch the brahmin again by the leg roopnarain pounce down but the arm be as quickly within its shield it be now but a question of time and endurance every dodge that he be master of do the brahmin bring into play they be both in perfect training muscle as hard as steel every nerve and sinew strain to the utmost tension roopnarain actually try tickle he man but he would not give he a chance at length he get he hand in the bent elbow of the free arm and slowly and laboriously force it out there be tremendous spurt and struggle but patient determination be not to be baulk slowly the arm come up over the back the struggle be tremendous but at length both the poor fellow 's arm be tightly pinion behind he back he be powerless now the brahmin draw the two arm backwards towards the head of the poor little fellow and he be bind to come over or have both he arm break with a hoarse cry of sobbing-pain and shame the brave little man come over both shoulder on the mould and the scientific old veteran be again the victor this be but a very faint description of a true wrestling bout among the robust dweller in these remote village it may seem cruel but it be to my mind the perfection of muscular strength and skill combine with keen subtle intellectual acuteness it bring every faculty of mind and body into play it beget a healthy honest love of fair play and a admiration of endurance and pluck two quality of which englishman certainly can boast strength without skill and training will not avail it be a fine manly sport and one which should be encourage by all who wish well to we dusky fellow subject in the far off plain and valley of

style of act besides indigo plant proper there be another large branch of industry in north bhaugulpore and along the nepaul frontier there and in purneah which be the grow of indigo seed for the bengal planter the system of advance and the mode of cultivation be much the same as that follow in indigo plant proper the seed be sow in June or July be weed and tend all through the rain and cut in December the planter advance about four rupee a beegah to the ryot who cut he seed-plant and bring it into the factory threshing ground where it be beat out clean weigh and pack in bag when the seed have be thresh out and clean it be weigh and the ryot or cultivator get four rupee for every maund -- a maund be eighty pound avoirdupoi the previous advance be deduct the rent or loan account be adjust and the balance make over in cash other grow the seed on they own account without take advance and bring it to the factory for sale if price be rule high they may get much more than four rupee per maund for it and they adopt all kind of ingenious device to adulterate the seed and increase its weight they mix dust with it seed of weed even grain of wheat and mustard pea and other seed in buy seed therefore one have to be very careful to reject all that look bad or that may have be adulterate they will even get old useless seed the refuse stock of former year and mix this with leaf of the neem tree and some turmeric powder give it a gloss that make it look like fresh seed when you suspect that the seed have be tamper with in this manner you wet some of it and rub it on a piece of fresh clean linen so as to bring off the dye where the attempt have be flagrant you be sometimes tempt to take the law into you own hand and administer a little of the castigation which the cheating rascal so richly deserve in other case it be necessary to submit the seed to a microscopic examination if any old worn seed be detect you reject the sample unhesitatingly even when the seed appear quite good you subject it to yet another test take one or two hundred seed and put they on a damp piece of the pith of a plantain tree mix with a little earth set they in a warm place and in two day you will be able to tell what percentage have germinate and what be incapable of germination if the percentage be good the seed may be consider as fairly up to the sample and it be purchase there be native seed buyer who try to get as much into they hand as they can and rig the market there be also european buyer and there be a keen rivalry in all the bazaar the threshing-floor and seed-cleaning ground present a busy sight when several thousand maund of seed be be get ready for despatch by boat the dirty seed full of dust and other impurity be heap up in one corner the floor be in the shape of a large square nicely pave with cement as hard and clean as marble crowd of nearly nude coolie hurry to and fro with scoop of seed rest on they shoulder when they get in line at right angle to the direction in which the wind be blow they move slowly along let the seed descend on the heap below while the wind winnow it and carry the dust in dense cloud to leeward this be repeat over and over again till the seed be as clean as it can be make it be put through bamboo sieve so form that any seed larger than indigo can not pass through what remains in the sieve be put aside and afterwards clean sort and sell as food or if useless throw away or give to the fowl the man and boy dart backwards and forwards there be a steady drip drip of seed from the scoop dense cloud of dust and incessant noise and bustle peon or watchman be station all around to see that none be waste or steal some be fill sack full of the clean seed and haul they off to the weighman and he clerk two maund be put in every sack and when weigh the bag be haul up close to the _ godown _ or store-room here be a army of man with sailmaker 's needle and twine they sew up the bag which be then haul away to be mark with the factory brand cart be come and go carry bag to the boat which be lie at the river bank take in they cargo and the return cart bring back load of wood from the bank of the river in one corner under a shed sit the sahib chaffer with a party of _ paikar _ -lrb- seed merchant -rrb- who have bring seed for sale of course he decry the seed say it be bad will not hear of the price want and laugh to scorn all the fervent protestation that the seed be grow on they own ground and have never pass through any hand but they own if you be satisfied that the seed be good you secretly name you price to you head man who forthwith take up the work of depreciation you move off to some other department of the work the head man and the merchant sit down perhaps smoke a _ hookah _ each try to outwit the other but after a keen encounter of wit perhaps a bargain be make a pretty fair price be arrive at and away go the purchase seed to swell the heap at the other end of the yard it have to be carefully weigh first and the weighman get a little from the vendor as he perquisite which the factory take from he at the market rate you have buyer of you own out in the _ dehaat _ -lrb- district -rrb- and the parcel they have buy come in hour by hour with invoice detail all particulars of quantity quality and price the load from the seed depot and outwork come roll up in the afternoon and have all to be weigh check note down and examine every man 's hand be against you you can not trust you own servant for a paltry bribe they will try to pass a bad parcel of seed and even when you have you european assistant to help you it be hard work to avoid be over-reach in some shape or other you have to keep up a large staff of writer who make out invoice and account and keep the book you correspondence alone be enough work for one man and you have to tally bag count coolie see they pay they daily wage attend to lawsuit that may be go on and yet find time to superintend the operation of the farm and keep a eye to you rent and revenue from the village it be a busy a anxious time you have a vast responsibility on you shoulder and when one take into consideration the climate you have to contend with the home comfort and domestic joy you have to do without the constant tension of mind and irritation of body from dust heat insect lie bribery robber and villany of every description that meet you on all hand it must be allow that a planter at such a time have no easy life the time at which you despatch the seed be also the very time when you be prepare you land for spring sowing this require almost as much surveillance as the seed-buying and despatch you have not a moment you can call you own if you have subordinate you could trust who would be faithful and honest you could safely leave part of the work to they but from very sad experience i have find that trust to a native be trust to a very rotten stick they be certainly not all bad but there be just enough exception to prove the rule one peculiar custom prevail in this border district of north bhaugulpore which i have not observe elsewhere at the beginning of the financial year when the account of the past season have all be make up and arrange and the collection of the rent for the new year be begin the planter and zemindar hold what be call the _ pooneah _ it be customary for all cultivator and tenant to pay a proportion of they rent in advance the pooneah might therefore be call ` rent-day ' a similar day be set apart for the same purpose in tirhoot call _ tousee _ or collection but it be not attend by the same ceremonious observance and quaint custom as attach to the pooneah on the border land when every man 's account have be make up and check by the book the pooneah day be fix on invitation be send to all you neighbouring friend who look forward to each other 's annual pooneah as a great gala day in north bhaugulpore and purneah nearly all the planter and english-speaking population belong to old family who have be bear in the district and have settle and live there long before the day of quick communication with home they rule among they dependant be patriarchal everyone be know among the native who have see he since he birth live amongst they by some pet name the old man of the village remember he father and he father 's father the younger villager have have he point out to they on they visit to the factory as ` willie baba ' ` freddy baba ' or whatever he boyish name may have be with the addition of ` baba ' which be simply a pet name for a child these planter know every village for mile and mile they know most of the lead man in each village by name the villager know all about they discuss they affair with the utmost freedom and not a single thing ever so trivial happen in the planter 's home but it be know and comment on in all the village that lie within the _ ilaka _ -lrb- jurisdiction -rrb- of the factory the hospitality of these planter be unbounded they be most of they much like by all the native round i come a ` stranger amongst they ' and in one sense and not a flattering sense they try ` to take I in ' but only in one or two instance which i shall not specify here by nearly all i be welcome and kindly treat and i form some very lasting friendship among they old tradition of princely hospitality still linger among they they be clannish in the best sense of the word the kindness and attention give to aged or indigent relation be one of they best trait i be afraid the race be fast die out lavish expenditure and a too confide faith in they native dependant have often bring the usual result but many of my reader will associate with the name of purneah or bhaugulpore planter recollection of hospitality and unostentatious kindness and memory of glorious sport and warm-hearted friendship on the pooneah day then or the night before many of these friend would meet the day have long be know to all the village round and nothing could better shew the patriarchal semi-feudal style in which they rule over they village than the custom in connection with this anniversary some day before it requisition have be make on all the village in any way connect with the factory for various article of diet the herdsman have to send a tribute of milk curd and _ ghee _ or clarify butter cultivator of root crop or fruit send in sample of they produce in the shape of huge bundle of plantain immense jack-fruit or basket of sweet potato yam and other vegetable the _ koomhar _ or potter have to send in earthen pot and jar the _ mochee _ or worker in leather bring with he a sample of he work in the shape of a pair of shoe these be pounce on by you servant and _ omlah _ the omlah be the head man in the office it be a fine time for they wooden shoe umbrella brass pot fowl goat fruit in fact all the production of you country side be send or bring in it be the old feudal tribute of the middle age back again during the day the _

greasy recess in the waistband a dirty bundle be slowly pull forth and the desire sum reluctantly count out from early morn till dewy eve this work go on and you judge you pooneah to have be a good or bad one by the amount you be able to collect peon with they brass badge flash in the sun and they red puggree shew off they bronzed face and black whisker be despatch in all direction for defaulter there be a constant go to and fro a hurry and bustling in the crowd a hum as of a distant fair pervade the place and by evening the total of the day 's collection be add up and while the sahib and he friend take they sherry and bitters the omlah and servant retire to wash and feast and prepare for the night 's festivity during the day at the house of the omlah culinary preparation on a vast scale have be go on the large supplies of grain rice flour fruit vegetable & c which be bring in as _ salamee _ or tribute supplement by addition from the sahib 's own store have be make into savoury mess curry and cake boil flesh and roast kid be all ready and the crowd have divest themselves of they head-dress and outer garment and clean they hand and foot by copious ablutions sit down in a wide circle the large leaf of the water-lily be now serve out to each man and perform the office of plate huge basket of _ chupatty _ a flat sort of ` griddle-cake ' be now bring round and each man get four or five dole out the cooking and attendance be all do by brahmin no inferior caste would answer as rajpoot and other high caste will only eat food that have be cook by a brahmin or one of they own class the brahmin attendant now come round with great _ dekchee _ or cooking-pots full of curried vegetable boil rice and similar dish a ladle-full be hand out to each man who receive it on he leaf the rice be serve out by the hand of the attendant the guest manipulate a huge ball of rice and curry mixed between the finger of the right hand pass this solemnly into they widely-gaping mouth with the head throw back to receive the mess like a adjutant-bird swallow a frog and then they masticate with much apparent enjoyment sugar treacle curd milk oil butter preserve and chutnee be serve out to the more wealthy and respectable the amount they can consume be wonderful see the enormous supplies you would think that even this great crowd could never get through they but by the time repletion have set in there be little or nothing leave and many of the inflated and distended old farmer could begin again and repeat ` another of the same ' with ease each person have he own _ lotah _ a brass drinking vessel and when all have eat they again wash they hand rinse out they mouth and don they gayest apparel the gentleman in the bungalow now get word that the evening 's festivity be about to commence light we cigar we sally out to the _ shamiana _ which have be erect on the ridge surround the deep tank which supply the factory during the manufacturing season with water the _ shamiana _ be a large canopy or wall-less tent it be festoon with flower and green plantain tree and evergreen have be plant all round it flare flambeau torch chinese lantern and oil lamp flicker and glare and make the interior almost as bright as day when we arrive we find we chair draw up in state one raise seat in the center be the place of honor and reserve for the manager of the factory when we be seat the _ malee _ or gardener advance with a wooden tray fill with sand in which be stick head of all the finest flower the garden can afford place in the most symmetrical pattern and really a pretty tasteful piece of workmanship two or three old brahmin principal among whom be ` hureehar jha ' a wicked old scoundrel now advance bearing gay garland of flower mutter a strange gibberish in sanskrit suppose to be a blessing but which might be a curse for all we understand of it and deck we wrist and neck with these string of flower for this service they get a small gratuity the factory omlah head by the dignified portly _ gornasta _ or confidential adviser dress in snowy turban and spotless white now come forward a large brass tray stand on the table in front of you they each present a _ salamee _ or _ nuzzur _ that be a tribute or present which you touch and it be then deposit with a rattle jingle on the brass plate the head man of village putwarry and wealthy tenant give two three and sometimes even four rupee every tenant of respectability think it incumbent on he to give something every man as he come up make a low salaam deposit he _ salamee _ he name be write down and he retire the putwarry present two rupee each shout out they name and the name of they village afterwards a small assessment be levy on the villager of a ` pice ' or two ` pice ' each about a halfpenny of we money and which recoup the putwarree for he outlay this have nothing to do with the legitimate revenue of the factory it never appear in the book it be quite a voluntary offering and i have never see it in any other district in the meantime the _ raj-bhat _ a wander class of hereditary minstrel or bard be sing you praise and those of you ancestor in ear-splitting strain some of they have really good voice all possess the gift of improvisation and be quick to seize on the salient point of the scene before they and weave they into they song sometimes in a very ingenious and humorous manner they be often employ by rich native to while away a long night with one of they treasured rhythmical tale or song one or two be keep in the retinue of every rajah or noble and they possess a mine of legendary information which would be invaluable to the collector of folk-lore and antiquarian literature at some of the pooneah the evening 's gaiety wind up with a _ nautch _ or dance by dance girl or boy i always think this a most sleep-inspiring exhibition it have be so often describe that i need not trouble my reader with it the woman be gaily dress in brocade and gauzy texture and glitter with spangle and tawdry ornament the musical accompaniment of clang zither asthmatic fiddle timber-toned drum clang cymbal and harsh metallic triangle be a sore affliction and when the dusky prima donna throw back she head extend she chest get up to she high note with she hand behind she ear and she poura-stained mouth and tooth wide expand like the jaw of a fangless wolf and the demoniac instrument and performer redouble they din the noise be something too dreadful to experience often the native woman sit mute and hushed seem to like it i have hear it say that the german eat ant finlander relish penny candle the nepaulese gourmandise on putrid fish i be fond of mouldy cheese and organ-grinder be a object of affection with some of we home community i _ know _ that the general run of native delight in a nautch taste differ but to I it be a inexplicable phenomenon amid all this noise we sit till we be wearied parin-leaf and betel nut be hand round by the servant there be a very sudorific odour from the crowd all be comfortably seat on the ground the torch flare and send up volume of smoke to the ornamented roof of the canopy the light be reflect in the deep glassy bosom of the silent tank the combined sound and odour get oppressive and we be glad to get back to the bungalow to consume we ` peg ' and we ` weed ' in the congenial company of we friend in some factory the night close with a grand dance by all the inhabitant of the _ dangur tolum _ the man and woman range themselves in two semicircle stand opposite each other the tallest of both line at the one end diminish away at the other extremity to the child and little one who can scarcely toddle they have a wild plaintive song with swell cadence and abrupt stop they go through a extraordinary variety of evolution stamp with one foot and keep perfect time they sway they body revolve march and countermarch the man sometimes open they rank and the woman go through and _ vice versa _ they turn round like the wind convolution of a shell increase they pace as the song wax quick and shrill get excite and finish off with a resounding stamp of the foot and a guttural cry which seem to exhaust all the breath leave in they body the man then get some liquor and the woman a small money present if the sahib be very liberal he give they a pig on which to feast and the _ dangur _ go away very happy and contented they dance be not unlike the _ corroborry _ of the australian aborigine the two race be not unlike each other too in feature although i can not think that they be in any way connect next morning there be a jackal hunt or cricket or pony race or shooting match or sport of some kind while the rent collection still go on in the afternoon we have grand wrestling match amongst the native for small prize and generally witness some fine exhibition of athletic skill and endurance some wander juggler may have be attract by the rumor of the gather a tight-rope dancer a snake charmer a itinerant showman with a perform goat monkey or dancing bear may make he appearance before the admire crowd at time a party of mime or actor come round and a rare treat be not seldom afford

and tame buffalo which trample down the dry stalk and force they way into the innermost recess of the wilderness of grass which grow ten to twelve foot high if you once lose you path you may wander for mile until you weary horse be almost unable to stumble on in such a case the best way be to take it coolly and halloo till a herdsman or thatch-cutter come to you rescue the knowledge of the jungle display by these poor ignorant man be wonderful they know every gully and watercourse every ford and quicksand and they betray not the slightest sign of fear although they know that at any moment they may come across a herd of wild buffalo a savage rhinoceros or even a royal tiger the track of rhinoceros be often see but although i have frequently have these point out to I when out tiger shooting i only see two while i live in that district the first occasion be after a night of discomfort such as i have fortunately seldom experienced i have be away at a neighbouring factory in purneah some eighteen or twenty mile from my bungalow my companion have be my predecessor in the management and be suppose to be well acquaint with the country we have go over to one of the outwork across the river and i have receive charge of the place from he it be a lonely solitary spot the house be compose of grass wall plaster with mud and have not be use for some time f propose that we should ride over to see h to whom he would introduce I as he would be one of my nearest neighbor and would give we a comfortable dinner and bed which there be no chance of we procure where we be we plunge at once into the mazy labyrinth of the jungle and soon emerge on the high sandy downs stretch mile beyond mile along the southern bank of the ever-changing river have lose we way we get to the factory after dark but a friendly villager volunteer he service as guide and lead we safely to we destination after a cheerful evening with h we persuade he to accompany we back next day he take out he dog and we have a good course after a hare kill two jackal and send back the dog by the sweeper at burgamma the outwork we stop to _ tiffin _ on some cold fowl we have bring with we the old factory head man get we some milk egg and _ chupatty _ and about three in the afternoon we start for the head factory in a evil moment f propose that as we be near another outwork call _ fusseah _ we should diverge thither i could take over charge and we could thus save a ride on another day not know anything of the country i acquiesce and we reach fusseah in time to see the place and do all that be needful it be a miserable tumbledown little spot with four pair of vat it have formerly be a good working factory but the river have cut away most of its best land and completely wash away some of the village while the whole of the cultivation be fast relapsing into jungle ` debnarain singh ' the _ gomorsta _ or head man ask we to stay for the night as he say we could never get home before dark f however scout the idea and we resume we way the track for it could not be call a road lead we through one or two jungle village completely hide by the dense bamboo clump and long jungle grass you can not see a trace of habitation till you be fairly on the village and as the rice-field be border with long strip of tall grass the whole country present the appearance of a uniform jungle we get through the rice swamp the village and the grass in safety and as it be get dark emerge on the great plain of undulating ridgy sandbank that form the bed of the river during the annual flood we have we _ syce _ -lrb- groom -rrb- and two peon with we we have to ride over nearly two mile of sand before we could reach the _ ghat _ where we expect the ferry-boat and the main stream once cross we have only two mile further to reach the factory we be get both tired and hungry a heavy dew be fall and the night be raw and chill it be dark there be no moon to light we way and the star be obscure by the silently creep fog rise from the marshy hollow among the sand all at once f who be lead call out that we be off the path and before i could pull up my poor old tired horse be flounder in a quicksand up to the girth i throw myself off and try to wheel he round h be behind we and we cry to he to halt where he be i be sink at every movement up to the knee when the syce come to my rescue and take charge of the horse f 's syce run to extricate he master and horse the two peon keep call ` oh my father my father ' the horse snort and struggle desperately in the tenacious and treacherous quicksand but after a prolonged effort we all get safely out and rejoin h on the firm ridge we now halloo and shout for the boatman but beyond the swish of the rapid stream to we right or the plash of a fall bank as the swift current undermine it no sound answer we repeat call we be wet and weary but to go either backward or forward be out of the question we be off the path and the first step in any direction might lead we into another quicksand worse perhaps than that from which we have just extricate ourselves the horse be tremble in every limb the syce cower together and shiver with the cold we order the two peon to try and reach the ghat and see what have become of the boat while we await they return where we be the fog and darkness soon swallow they up and put the best face on we dismal circumstance that we could we light we pipe and extend we jaded limb on the damp sand for a time we could hear the shout of the peon as they halloo for the boatman and we listen anxiously for the response but there be none we could hear the purling swish of the rapid stream the crumble bank fall into the current with a distant splash occasionally a swift rush of wing overhead tell we of the arrowy flight of diver or teal far in the distance twinkle the gleam of a herdsman 's fire the faint tinkle of a distant bell or the subdue bark of a village dog for a moment alone break the silence at time the hideous chorus of a pack of jackal wake the echo of the night then at no great distance rise a hoarse booming cry swell on the night air and subside into a lengthen growl the syce start to they foot the horse snort with fear and as the roar be repeat follow closely by another to we left and seemingly nearer h exclaim ` by jove there be a couple of tiger ' sure enough so it be it be the first time i have hear the roar of the tiger in he own domain and i must confess that my sensation be not altogether pleasant we set about collect stick and what root of grass we could find but on the sand-flats everything be wet and it be so dark that we have to grope about on we hand and knee and pick up whatever we come across with great difficulty we manage to light a small fire and for about half-an-hour be nearly smother by try with inflated cheek to coax it into a blaze the tiger continue to call at interval but do not seem to be approach we it be a long weary wait we be cold wet hungry and tired f the cause of we misfortune have take off he saddle and with it for a pillow be now fast asleep h and i cower over the miserable sputter flame and long and wish for the morning it be a miserable night the hour seem interminable the dense volume of smoke from the water-sodden wood nearly choke we at last after some hour spend in this miserable manner we hear a faint halloo in the distance it be now past eleven at night we return the hail and bye-and-bye the peon return bring a boatman with they the lazy rascal at the ghat where we have propose cross have go home at nightfall leave they boat on the further bank we trusty peon have go five mile up the river through the thick jungle and bring a boat down with they from the next ghat to that where we be we now warily pick we way down to the edge of the bank the boat seem very fragile and the current look so swift and dangerous that we determine to go across first ourselves get the larger boat from the other side light a fire and then bring over the horse we embark accordingly leave the syce and horse behind we the peon and boatman pull the boat a long way up stream by a rope then shoot out we be carry swiftly down stream the dark shadow of the further bank seem at a great distance the boatman push vigorously at he bamboo pole the water rippled and gurgle and froth and eddy around half-a-dozen time we think we boat would topple over but at length we get safely across far below what we have propose as we landing place we find the boat all right and the boatman 's hut a mere collection of dry grass and a few old bamboo as it could be replace in a hour and the material lay all around we fire the hut which soon blaze up throw a weird lurid glow on bank and stream and disclose far on the other bank we weary nag and shiver syce look very bedraggled and forlorn indeed the leap and crackle of the flame and the genial warmth invigorate we a little and while i stay behind to feed the fire the other recross to bring the horse over with the previous fright however they long wait the blaze fire and be unaccustomed to boat at night the poor scared horse refuse to enter the boat the boat be flat-bottomed or broadly bulge with a bamboo platform strew with grass in the center as a rule they have no protect rail and even in the daytime when the current be strong and eddy numerous they be very dangerous for horse at all event the poor brute would not be lead on to the platform so there be nothing for it but to swim they across the boat be therefore tow a long way up the bank which on the farther side be nearly level with the current but where the hut have stand be steep and slushy and perhaps twenty foot high this be where the deepest water run and where the current be swiftest if the horse therefore miss the landing ghat or stage which be cut slope into the bank there be a danger of they be sweep away altogether and lose however we determine on make the attempt enter the water and hold the horse tightly by the head with a lead rope attach to be pay out in case of necessity the boat shoot out the horse paw the water enter deeper and deeper foot by foot into the swiftly rush silent stream so long as they be in they depth and have foot they be alright but when they reach the middle of the river the current rush with frightful velocity sweep they off they foot and boat and horse begin to go down stream the horse with lip apart show they tooth firmly set the lurid glare of the flame light up they strain eyeball the plashing of the water the dark rapid current flow noiselessly past the rock heave boat the dusky form of syce peon and boatman standing out clear in the ruddy fire-light against the utter blackness of the night compose a weird picture i can never forget the boat shot swiftly past the ghat and come with a thump against the bank it swing round into the stream again but the boatman have luckily manage to scramble ashore and he effort and mine unite haul on the mooring-rope suffice to bring she in to the bank the three struggle horse be yet in the current try bravely to stem the furious rush of the river the syce and my friend be hold hard to the tether-rope which be now at they full stretch it be a most critical moment have they let go the horse would have be sweep away to form a meal for the alligator they manage however to get in close to the bank and here although the water be still over they back they get a slight and precarious footing and inch by inch struggle after the boat which we be now pull up to the landing place after a sore struggle during which we think more than once the gallant nag would never emerge from the water they stagger up the bank drip tremble and utterly overcome with they exertion it be my first introduction to the treacherous koosee and i never again attempt to swim a horse across at night we lead the poor tired creature up to the fire heaping on fresh bundle of thatching-grass of which there be plenty lie about the syce then rub they down and shampoo they leg till they begin to take a little heart whinnying as we speak to they and caress they after rest for nearly a hour we replace the saddle and f who by this time begin to mistrust he knowledge of the jungle by night allow one of the peon who be sure he know every inch of the road to lead the way leave the smoulder flame to flicker and burn out in solitude we again plunge into the darkness of the night thread we way through the thick jungle grass now load with dewy moisture and drip copious shower upon we from its high wall at either side of the narrow track we cross a rapid little stream a arm of the main river turn to the right progress a few hundred yard turn to the left and finally come to a dead stop have again lose we way we heap execration on the luckless peon 's head and i suggest that we should make for the main stream follow up the bank till we reach the next ghat where i know there be a cart-road lead to the factory otherwise we might wander all night in the jungle perhaps get into another quicksand or come to some other signal grief we accordingly turn round we could hear the swish of the river at no great distance and soon stumble over bush and burst through mat chump of grass drip with wet and utterly tired and dejected we reach the bank of the stream here we have no difficulty in follow the path the river be so swift that the only way boat be enable to get up stream to take down the inland produce be by have a few coolie or boatman to drag the boat up against the current by towing-line this be call _ goon _ the goon-rope be attach to the mast of the boat at the free end be a round bit of bamboo the towing-coolie place this against he shoulder and slowly and laboriously drag the boat up against the current we be now on this towing-path and after ride for nearly four mile we reach the ghat strike into the cart-road and without further misadventure reach the factory about four in the morning utterly fagged and worn out about eight in the morning my bearer wake I out of a deep sleep with the news that there be a _ gaerha _ that be a rhinoceros close to the factory we have some day previously hear it rumor that there be _ two _ rhinoceros in the _ battabarree _ jungle so i at once rouse my soundly-sleeping friend swallow a hasty morsel of toast and a cup of coffee we mount we pony send we gun on ahead and ride off for the village where the rhinoceros be report as we ride hurriedly along we could see native run in the same direction as ourselves and one of my man come up panting and breathless to confirm the news about the rhinoceros with the unwelcome addition that premnarain singh a young neighbouring zemindar have go in pursuit of it with he elephant and gun we hurry on and just then hear the distant report of a shot follow quickly by two more we try to take a short cut across country through some rice-field but we pony sink in the boggy ground and we have to retrace we way to the path by the time we get to the village we find a excited crowd of over a thousand native dancing and gesticulate round the prostrate carcase of the rhinoceros the baboo and he party have find the poor brute firmly imbed in a quicksand with organise effort they might have secure the prize alive and could have sell he in calcutta for at least a thousand rupee but they be too excited and blaze away three shot into the helpless beast ` many hand make light work ' so the crowd soon have the dead animal extricate roll he into the creek and float he down to the village where we find they already begin to hack and hew the flesh completely spoil the skin and properly complete the butchery we be terribly vex that we be too late but endeavor to stop the stupid destruction that be go on the body measure eleven foot three inch from the snout to the tail and stand six foot nine the horn be six and a half inch long and the girth a little over ten foot we put the best face on the matter congratulate the baboo with very bad grace and ask he to get the skin cut up properly cut in strip from the under part of the rib and along the belly the skin make magnificent riding-whip the boss on the shoulder and side be make into shield by the native elaborately ornament and much prize the horn however be the most coveted acquisition it be believe to have peculiar virtue and be popularly suppose by its mere presence in a house to mitigate the pain of maternity a rhinoceros horn be often hand down from generation to generation as a heirloom and when a birth be about to take place the anxious husband often get a loan of the precious treasure after which he have no fear for the safe issue of the labor the flesh of the rhinoceros be eat by all class it be one of the five animal that a brahmin be allow to eat by the _ shastras _ they be formerly much more common in these jungle but of late year very few have be kill when they take up they abode in a piece of jungle they be not easily dislodge they be fierce savage brute and do not scruple to attack a elephant when they be hard press by the hunter when they wish to leave a locality where they have be disturb they will make for some distant point and march on with dog and inflexible purpose some have be know to travel eighty mile in the twenty-four hour through thick jungle over river and through swamp and quicksand they sense of hearing be very acute and they be very easily rouse to fury one peculiarity often notice by sportsman be that they always go to the same spot when they want to obey the call of nature mound of they dung be sometimes see in the jungle and the track shew that the rhinoceros pay a daily visit to this one particular spot in nepaul and along the _ teraus _ or wooded slope of the frontier they be more numerous but ` jung bahadur ' the late ruler of nepaul would allow no one to shoot they but himself i remember the wail lament of a nepaul officer with whom i be out shooting when i happen to fire at and wind one of the protected beast it be in nepaul among a cluster of low woody hill with a brawling stream dash through the precipitous channel wear out of the rocky boulder-covered dell the rhinoceros be up the hill slightly above I and we be beat up for a tiger that we have see go ahead of the line in my eagerness to bag a ` rhino ' i quite forget the interdict and fire a express bullet into the shoulder of the animal as he stand broadside on stare stupidly at I he stagger and make as if he would charge down the hill the old ` major capt -lrb- = a -rrb- n ' as they call we sport host be shout out to I not to fire the _ mahout _ and beater be petrified with horror at my presumption i fancy they expect a immediate order for my decapitation or for my ear to be cut off at the very least but feel i might as well be ` in for a pound as for a penny ' i fire again and tumble the huge brute over with a bullet through the skull behind the ear the old officer be horror-stricken and would allow no one to go near the animal he would not even let I get down to measure it be terrify lest the affair should reach the ear of he formidable lord and ruler that he hurry we off from the scene of my transgression as quickly as he could the old major capt -lrb- = a -rrb- n be a curious character the government of nepaul be purely military all executive and judicial function be carry on by military officer after serve a certain time in the army they get reward for good service by be appoint to the executive charge of a district so far as i could make out they seem to farm the revenue much as be do in turkey they must send in so much to the treasury and anything over they keep for themselves they administration of justice be rough and ready fine corporal punishment and in the case of heinous crime mutilation and death be they penalty there be a tax of _ kind _ on all produce and licens to cut timber bring in a large revenue a protective tariff be levy on all goods or produce pass the frontier from british territory and no european be allow to travel in the country or to settle and trade there in the lower valley there be magnificent stretch of land suitable for indigo tea rice and other crop the stream be numerous moisture be plentiful the soil be fertile and the slope of the hill be cover with splendid timber a great quantity of which be cut and float down the gunduch bagmuttee koosee and other stream during the rainy season it be use principally for beam rafter and railway sleeper the people be jealous of intrusion and suspicious of stranger but as i be with a official they generally come out in great number to gaze as we pass through a village the country do not seem so thickly populate as in we territory and the cultivator have a more well-to-do look they possess vast number of cattle the house have conical roof and great quadrangular shed roof with a flat covering of thatch be erect all round the house for the protection of the cattle at night the tax must weigh heavily on the population the executive officer when he get charge of a district remove all the subordinate who have be act under he predecessor when i ask the old major if this would not interfere with the efficient administration of justice and the smooth working of he revenue and executive function he give a funny leer almost a wink and say it be much more satisfactory to have man of you own work under you the fact be that with he own man he could more securely wring from the ryot the uttermost farthing they could pay and be more certain of get he own share of the spoil with practically irresponsible power and only answerable directly to he immediate military superior a unscrupulous man may harry and harass a district pretty much as he choose we old major seem to be civil and lenient but in some district the exaction and extortion of the ruler have drive many of the hard-working nepaulese over the border into we territory we landholder or zemindar have vast area of untilled land be only too glad to encourage this immigration and give the exile whom they find hard-working industrious tenant long lease on easy term the new-comer be very independent and strenuously resist any encroachment on what they consider they rights if a attempt be make to raise they rent even equitably the land have increase in value they will resist the attempt ` tooth and nail ' and take every advantage the law afford to oppose it they be very fond of litigation and be mostly able to afford the expense of a lawsuit i generally find it answer better to call they together and reason quietly with they submit any point in dispute to a arbitration of party mutually select nearly all the river in nepaul be form principally from the melting of the snow on the higher range a vast body of water descend annually into the plain from the natural surface drainage of the country but the melting of the snow be the main source of the river system many of the hill stream and it be particularly observable at some season in the koosee have a regular daily rise and fall in the early morning you can often ford a branch of the river which by midday have become a swiftly-rolling torrent fill the channel from bank to bank the water be intensely cold and few or no fish be to be find in the mountain stream of nepaul when the nepaulese come down to the plain on business pleasure or pilgrimage they great treat be a mighty banquet of fish for two or three _ anna _ a fish of several pound weight can easily be purchase they revel on this unwonted fare eat to repletion and very frequently make themselves ill in consequence when jung bahadur come down through chumparun to attend the _ durbar _ of the lament earl mayo cholera break out in he camp bring on simply by the enormous quantity of fish often not very fresh or wholesome which he guard and camp follower consume large quantity of dry fish be send up to nepaul and exchange for rice and other grain or horn hide and blanket the fish-drying be do very simply in the sun it be generally leave till it be half putrid and taint the air for mile the sweltering half-rotting mass pack in filthy bag and sling on pony or bullock be send over the frontier to some village bazaar in nepaul the track of a consignment of this horrible filth can be recognize from very far away the perfume hover on the road and as you be ride up and get the first sniff of the putrid odour you know at once that the nepaulese market be be recruit by a _ fresh _ accession of very _ stale _ fish if the taste be at all equal to the smell the rankest witch broth ever brew in reek cauldron would probably be preferable over the frontier there seem to be few road merely bullock track most of the transporting of goods be do by bullock and intercommunication must be slow and costly i believe that near katmandoo the capital the road and bridge be good and keep in tolerable repair there be a arsenal where they manufacture modern munitions of war they soldier be well discipline fairly well equip and form excellent fighting material we policy of annexation so far as indium be concern may perhaps be now consider as finally abandon we have no desire to annex nepaul but surely this system of utter isolation of jealous exclusion at all hazard of english enterprise and capital might be break down to a mutual community of interest a full and free exchange of product and a reception by nepaul without fear and distrust of the benefit we capitalist and pioneer could give the country by open out its resource and establish the industry of the west on its fertile slope and plain i be no politician and know nothing of the secret spring of policy that regulate we dealings with nepaul but it do seem somewhat weak and puerile to allow the nepaulese free access to we territory and a unprotected market in we town for all they produce while the british subject be rigorously exclude from the country he production saddle with a heavy protective duty and the representative of we government himself treat more as a prisoner in honorable confinement than as the accredit ambassador of a mighty empire i may be utterly wrong there may be weighty reason of state for this condition of thing but it be a general feeling among englishman in indium that _ we _ have to do all the give and we oriental neighbor do all the take the un-official english mind in indium do not see the necessity for the painfully deferential attitude we invariably take in we dealings with native state the time have surely come when oriental mistrust of we intention should be stoutly battle with there be room in nepaul for hundred of factory for tea-gardens fruit-grove spice-plantation woollen-mill saw-mill and countless other industry mineral product be report of unusual richness in the great central valley the climate approach that of england the establishment of productive industry would be a work of time but so long as this ridiculous policy of isolation be maintain and the exclusion of english tourist sportsman or observer carry out in all its present strictness we can never form a adequate idea of the resource of the country the nepaulese themselves can not progress i be convince that a frank and unconstrained intercourse between european and native would create no jealousy and antagonism but would lead to the development of a country singularly bless by nature and open a wide field for anglo-saxon energy and enterprise it do seem strange with all we vast territory of hindustan accurately map out and know road and railway canal and embankment intersect it in all direction that this interesting corner of the globe lie contiguous to we territory for hundred of mile should be less known than the interior of africa or the barren solitude of the ice-bound arctic region in these rich valley hundred of mile of the finest and most fertile land in asia lie cover by dense jungle wait for labor and capital for the present we have enough to do in we own possession to reclaim the uncultured waste but consider the rapid increase of population the avidity with which land be take up the daily increase use of all modern labour-saving appliance the time must very shortly come when capital and energy will need new outlet and one of the most promising of these be in nepaul the rapid change which have come over the face of rural indium especially in these border district within the last twenty year might well make the most thoughtless pause land have increase in value more than two-fold the price of labor and of produce have keep more than equal pace machinery be whir and clank where a few year ago a steam whistle would have startle the native out of they wit with cheap easy and rapid communication a journey to any of the great city be now think no more of than a trip to a distant village in the same district be think of twenty year ago everywhere be the sign of progress new industry be open up jungle be fast disappear agriculture have wonderfully improve and wherever a indigo factory have be build progress have take the place of stagnation industry and thrift that of listless indolence and shiftless apathy a spirit have move in the valley of dry bone and have clothe with live flesh the gaunt skeleton produce by ignorance disease and want the energy and intelligence of the planter have breathe on the stagnant water of the hindoo intellect the breath of life and the living tide be heave full of activity purge by its resistless ever-moving pulsation the formerly stagnant mass of its impurity and make it a life-giving sea of active industry and progress let any unprejudiced observer see for himself if it be not so let he go to those district where british capital and energy be not employ let he leave the plant district and go up to the waste of oudh or the purely native district of the north-west where there be no european but the official in the _ station _ he will find fewer and worse road fewer well worse construct house much ruder cultivation less activity and industry more dirt disease and desolation less intelligence more intolerance and a peasantry morally mentally physically and in every way inferior to those who be bring into daily contact with the anglo-saxon planter and gentleman and have imbibe somewhat of they activity and spirit of progress and yet these be the man whom successive lieutenant-governor and government generally have do they best to thwart and obstruct they have be misrepresent hold up to obloquy and foully slander they have be describe as utterly base fattening on the spoil of a cow and terror-ridden peasantry utterly unscrupulous fear neither god nor man hesitate at no crime deter by no consideration from oppress they tenantry and compass they interested end by the vilest fraud such be the picture draw of the indigo planter not so many year ago there may have be much in the past over which we would willingly draw the veil but at the present moment i firmly believe that the planter of behar -- and i speak as a observant student of what have be go on in indium -- have do more to elevate the peasantry to rouse they into vitality and to improve they in every way than all the other agency that have be at work with the same end in view the indian government to all appearance must always work in extreme it never seem to hit the happy medium the lieutenant-governor for the time be impress every department under he too strongly with he own individuality the planter who be a intelligent and independent body of man have seemingly always be obnoxious to the idea of a perfectly despotic and irresponsible ruler in spite however of all difficulty and drawback they have hold they own i know that the poor people and small cultivator look up to they with respect and affection they find in they ready and sympathizing friend able and willing to shield they from the exaction of they own more powerful and uncharitable fellow-countrymen half nay nine-tenth of the story against planter be get up by the money-lender the petty zemindar and wealthy villager who find the planter compete with they for land and labor and raise the price of both the poor people look to the factory as a never fail resource when all else fail and but for the assistance it give in money or seed or plough bullock and implement of husbandry many a struggle hardworking tenant would inevitably go to the wall or become inextricably entangled in the mesh of the bunneah and money-lender i assert as a fact that the great majority of villager in behar would rather go to the factory and have they sahib adjudicate on they dispute than take it into court the official in the indigo district know this and as a rule be very friendly with the planter but not long since a official be afraid to dine at a planter 's house fear he might be accuse of planter proclivity in no other country in the world would the same jealousy of man who open out and enrich a country and who be loyal intelligent and educate citizen be display but there be high quarter in which the old feeling of the east indium company that all who be not in the service must be adventurer and interloper seem not wholly to have die out that there have be abuse no one deny but for year past the majority of the planter in tirhoot chupra and chumparun and in the indigo district generally not merely the manager but the proprietor and agent have be laudably and loyally stir in spite of failure reduce price and frequent bad season to elevate the standard of they peasantry and establish the indigo system on a fair and equitable basis during the year when i be a assistant and manager on indigo estate the rate for payment of indigo to cultivator nearly double although price for the manufactured article remain stationary in well manage factory the forcible seizure of cart and plough and the enforcement of labor which be a old charge against planter be unknown and the payment of tribute common under the old feudal system and style _ furmaish _ have be allow to fall into desuetude the native zemindar or landholder however still jealously maintain they rights and harsh exaction be often make by they on the cultivator on the occasion of domestic event such as birth marriage death and such like in the family of the landowner for year these exaction or feudal payment by the ryot to the zemindar have be commute by the factory into a lump sum in cash when village have be take in farm and this sum have be pay to the zemindar as a enhance rent in the majority of case it have not be levy from the cultivator but the whole expense have be bear by the factory in individual instance resort may have be have to unworthy trick to harass the ryot the factory middle-men have often be oppressor and tyrant but as a body the indigo planter of the present day have sternly set they face to put down these oppression and have honestly strive to mete out even-handed justice to they tenant and dependant with the spread of education and intelligence the development of agricultural knowledge and practical science and the vastly improve communication by road bridge and ferry in bring about all of which the plant community themselves have be largely instrumental there can be little doubt that these old fashion charge against the planter as a body will cease and public opinion will be bring to bear on any one who may promote he own interest by cruelty or rapacity instead of do he business on a equitable commercial basis give every man he due rely on skill energy industry and integrity to promote the best interest of he factory gain the esteem and affection of he people by liberality kindness and strict justice it can never be expect that a ryot can grow indigo at a loss to himself or at a lower rate of profit than that which the cultivation of he other ordinary crop would give he without at least some compensate advantage with all he poverty and suppose stupidity he be keenly alive to he own interest quite able to hold he own in matter affect he pocket i have no hesitation in say that the steady effort which have be make by all the best planter to treat the ryot fairly to give he justice to encourage he with liberal aid and sympathy and to put they mutual relation on a fair business footing be now bear fruit and will result in the cultivation and manufacture of indigo in upper bengal become as it deserve to become one of the most firmly establish fairly conduct and justly administer industry in indium that it may be so be as i know the earnest wish as it have long be the dearest object of my best friend among the planter of

the population be very dense and waste land infrequent he be yet often to be encounter in the solitude of oudh or goruchpore have be shoot at and kill near bettiah and at we pig-sticking ground near kuderent in north bhaugulpore and purneah he may be say to be always at home as he can be meet there if you search for he at all season of the year in some part of indium notably in the deccan and in some district on the bombay side and even in the soonderbund near calcutta sportsman and shekarry go after the tiger on foot i must confess that this seem to I a mad thing to do with every advantage of weapon with the most daring courage and the most imperturbable coolness i think a man no fair match for a tiger in he native jungle there be man now live who have shoot number of tiger on foot but the numerous fatal accident record every year plainly shew the danger of such a mode of shooting in central indium in the north-west indeed in most district where elephant be not easily procurable it be customary to erect _ mychan _ or bamboo platform on tree a line of beater with tom-tom drum firework and other means for create a din be then send into the jungle to beat the tiger up to the platform on which you sit and wait this be often a successful mode if you secure a advantageous place but accident to the beater be very common and it be at best a weary and vexatious mode of shooting as after all you trouble the tiger may not come near you _ mychan _ or give you the slightest glimpse of he beautiful skin i have only be out after tiger on foot on one occasion it be in the sal jungle in oudh a neighbor of mine a most intimate and dear friend whom i have nickname the ` general ' and a young friend fullerton be with I a tigress and cub be report to be in a dense patch of _ nurkool _ jungle on the bank of the creek which divide the general 's cultivation from mine the nurkool be a tall feathery-looking cane very much relish by elephant it grow in dense brake and generally in damp boggy ground afford complete shade and shelter for wild animal and be a favorite haunt of pig wolf tiger and buffalo we have only one elephant the use of which fullerton have get from a neighbouring baboo it be not a staunch animal so we put one of we man in the howdah with a plentiful supply of bomb a kind of native firework enclose in a clay case which burn like a huge squib and set fire to the jungle along with the elephant we have a line of about one hundred coolie and several man with drum and tom-tom fullerton take the side nearest the river as it be possible the brute might sneak out that way and make she escape along the bank the general 's shekarry remain behind in rear of the line of beater in case the tigress might break the line and try to escape by the rear my _ gomasta _ the general and myself then take up position behind tree all along the side of the glade or dell in which be the bit of nurkool jungle it be a small basin sloping gently down to the creek from the sal jungle which grow up dark and thick all around a margin of close sward as green and level as a billiard-table encircle the glade and in the basin the thick nurkool grow up close dense and high like a rustling barrier of live green in the center be the decaying stump of a mighty forest monarch with its withered arm stretch out they bleached and shattered length far over the wave feathery top of the nurkool below the general and i cut down some branch which we stick in the ground before we i have a fall log in front of I on which i rest my gun i have a naked _ kookree _ ready to hand for we be sure that the tigress be in the swamp and i do not know what might happen i do not half like this style of shooting and wish i be safely seat on the back of ` jorrock ' my faithful old bhaugulpore elephant the general whistle as a sign for the beat to begin the coolie dash into the thicket the stately elephant slowly force he ponderous body through the crash sway brake the rattle of the tom-tom and rumble of the drum mingle with the hoarse shout and cry of the beater the fiery rush of sputter flame and the loud report as each bomb burst with the huge volume of blind smoke and the scent of gunpowder that come on the breeze tell we that the bomb be do they work the jungle be too green to burn but the firework raise a dense sulphurous smoke which penetrate among the tall stem of the nurkool and by the wave and crash of the tall sway cane the heaving of the howdah with the red puggree of the peon and the gleaming of the stave and weapon we could see that the beat be advance as they near the large withered tree in the center of the brake the elephant curl up he trunk and trumpet this be a sure sign there be game afoot we could see the peon in the howdah lean over the front bar and eagerly peer into the recess of the thicket before he he light one of the bomb and hurl it right up against the hole of the tree it hiss and sputter and the smoke come curl over the reed in dense volume a roar follow that make the valley ring again we hear a swift rush the elephant turn tail and flee madly away crash through the matted brake that crackle and tear under he tread the howdah sway wildly and the peon cling tenaciously on to the top bar with all he desperate might the _ mahout _ or elephant-driver try in vain to check the rush of the frightened brute but after repeat sound whack on the head he get she to stop and again turn round meantime the cry and shout have cease and the beater come pour from the jungle by two and three like the frightened inhabitant of some hive or ant-heap some in they hurry come tumble out headlong other with they face turn backwards to see if anything be in pursuit of they get entangled in the reed and fall prone on they hand and knee one fellow have just emerge from the thick cover when another terrify compatriot dash out in blind unreasoning fear close behind he the first one think the tiger be on he with one howl of anguish and dismay he flee as fast as he could run and the general and i who have witness the episode could not help unite in a resounding peal of laughter that do more to bring the scared coolie to they sens than anything else we could have do there be no doubt now of the tiger 's whereabouts one of the beater give we a most graphic description of its appearance and proportion accord to he it be bigger than a elephant have a mouth as wide as a coal scuttle and eye that glare like a thousand sun from all this we infer that there be a full grown tiger or tigress in the jungle we re-form the line of beater and once more get the elephant to enter the patch the same story be repeat no sooner do they get near the old tree than the tigress again charge with a roar and we valiant coolie and the chicken-hearted elephant vacate the jungle as fast as they leg could carry they this happen twice or thrice the tigress charge every time but would not leave she safe cover the elephant wheel round at every charge and would not shew fight fullerton get into the howdah and fire two shot into the spot where the tigress be lie he do not apparently wind she but the report bring she to the charge once more and the elephant by this time fairly tired of the game and thoroughly demoralise with fear bolt right away and nearly crack poor fullerton 's head against the branch of a tree we could plainly see that with only one elephant we could never dislodge the tigress so make the coolie beat up the patch in line we shoot several pig and a hog-deer and adjourn for something to eat by the bank of the creek we have be try to oust the tigress for over four hour but she be as wise as she be savage and refuse to become a mark for we bullet in the open after lunch we make another grand attempt we promise the coolie double pay if they rouse the tigress to flight the elephant be force again into the nurkool very much against he will and the mahout be promise a reward if we get the tigress the din this time be prodigious and strange to say they get quite close up to the big withered tree without the usual roar and charge this seem somewhat to stimulate the beater and the old elephant the coolie redouble they cry smote among the reed with they heavy stave and shout encouragement to each other right in the middle of the line as it seem to we from the outside there be then a fierce roar and a mighty commotion cry of fear and consternation arise and forth pour the coolie again helter skelter like so many rabbit from a warren when the weasel or ferret have enter the burrow right before I a huge old boar and a couple of sow come plunge forth i let they get on a little distance from the brake and then with my ` express ' i roll over the tusker and one of he companion and just then the general shout out to I ` there be the tiger ' i look in the direction of he level gun and there at the edge of the jungle be a handsome half-grown tiger cub beautifully mark he tail switching angrily from side to side and he twitch retract lip and bristle moustache draw back like those of a vicious cat show he gleaming polished fang and tooth the general have a fine chance take a steady aim and shoot the young savage right through the heart the handsome young tiger give one convulsive leap into the air and fall on he side stone dead we could not help a cheer and shout for fullerton who soon come run up we get some coolie together but they be frighten to go near the dead animal as we could plainly hear the old vixen inside snarl and snap for all the world like a angry terrier we hear she half-suppressed growl and snarl she be evidently in a fine temper how we wish for a couple of staunch elephant to hunt she out of the cane it be no use however the elephant would not go near the jungle again the coolie be thoroughly scared and have get plenty of pork and venison to eat so do not care for anything else we collect a lot of tame buffalo and try to drive they through the jungle but the coolie have lose heart and would not exert themselves so we have to content ourselves with the cub who measure six foot three inch -lrb- a very handsome skin it be -rrb- and very reluctantly have to leave the savage mother alone i never see a brute charge so persistently as she do she always rush forward with a succession of roar and be very wary and cunning she never charge home she do not even touch the elephant or any of the coolie but evidently trust to frighten she assailant away by a bold show and a fierce outcry we go back two day after with five elephant which with great difficulty we have get together -lrb- 1 -rrb- and thoroughly beat the patch of nurkool kill a lot of pig and a couple of deer shoot a alligator and destroy over thirty of its egg which we discover on the bank of the creek and return in the evening shoot a nilghau and a black buck but the tigress have disappear she be go and we grumble sorely at we bad luck that be the only occasion i be ever after tiger on foot it be doubtless intensely exciting work and both tigress and cub must have pass close to we several time hide by the jungle we be only about thirty pace from the edge of the brake and both animal must have see we although the dense cover hide they from we sight i certainly prefer shooting from the howdah although it be beyond the scope of this book to enter into a detailed account of the tiger discuss he structure habit and characteristic it may aid the reader if i give a sketchy general outline of some of the more prominent point of interest connect with the monarch of the jungle the cruel cunning ferocious king of the cat tribe the beautiful but dreaded tiger i should prefer to shew he character by incident with which i have myself be connect but as many statement have be make about tiger that be utterly absurd and untrue and as tiger story generally contain a good deal of exaggeration and a natural scepticism unconsciously haunt the reader when tiger and tiger shooting be the topic it may be as well to state once for all that i shall put down nothing that can not be abundantly substantiate by reference to my own sport journal on those of the brother s friend and fellow-sportsman of my own to g i be under great obligation for many interesting note he have give I about tiger shooting joe he brother be long we captain in we annual shooting party they father and _ he _ brother the latter still alive and a keen shot be note sportsman at a time when game be more plentiful shooting more generally practice and when to be a good shot mean more than average excellence the two brother between they have shoot i daresay more than four hundred and fifty male and female tiger and serried row of skull range round the billiard-room in they respective factory bear witness to they love of sport and the deadly accuracy of they aim under they auspices i begin my tiger shooting and as they know every inch of the jungle have for year be observant student of nature be acquaint with all the haunt and habit of every wild creature i acquire a fund of information about the tiger which i know could be depend on it be the result of actual observation and experience and in most instance it be corroborate by my own experience in my more limited sphere of action every incident i adduce every deduction i draw every assertion i make regard tiger and tiger shooting can be plentifully substantiate and abundantly testify to by my brother sportsman of purneah and bhaugulpore from they valuable information i have get most of the material for this part of my book of the order ferae the family _ felida _ there be perhaps no animal in the wide range of all zoology so eminently fit for destruction as the tiger he whole structure and appearance combine beauty and extreme agility with prodigious strength he ferocity and he cunning mark he out as the very type of a beast of prey he be the largest of the cat tribe the most formidable race of quadruped on earth he be the most bloodthirsty in habit and the most dreaded by man whole tract of fertile field reclaim from the wild luxuriance of matted jungle and wave with golden grain have be desert by the patient husbandman and allow to relapse into tangled thicket and uncultured waste on account of the ravages of this formidable robber whole village have be depopulate by tiger the moulder door-post and crumble rafter meet with at interval in the heart of the solitary jungle alone mark the spot where a thrive hamlet once send up the curl smoke from its humble hearth until the scourge of the wilderness the dreaded ` man-eater ' take up he station near it and drive the inhabitant in terror from the spot whole herd of valuable cattle have be literally destroy by the tiger he habitat be in those jungle and near those locality which be most highly prize by the herdsman of indium for they pasture and the number of cattle that yearly fall before he thirst for blood and he greed for live prey be almost incredible i have scarcely know a day pass during the hot month on the bank of the koosee that news of a _ kill _ have not be send in from some of the village in my _ ilaka _ and as a tiger eat once in every four or five day and oftener if he can get the chance the number of animal that fall a prey to he insatiable appetite over the extent of hindustan must be enormous the annual destruction of tame animal by tiger alone be almost incredible and when we add to this the wild buffalo the deer the pig and other untame animal to say nothing of smaller creature we can form some conception of the destruction cause by the tiger in the course of a year he whole frame be put together to effect destruction in cut up a tiger you be impressed with this he tendon be mass of nerve and muscle as hard as steel the muscular development be tremendous vast band and layer of muscle overlap each other strong ligament which you can scarcely cut through and which soon blunt the sharpest knife unite the solid freely-playing loosely-jointed bone the muzzle be broad and short and obtuse the claw be completely retractile the jaw be short there be two false molar two grinder above and the same number below the upper carnivorous tooth have three lobe and a obtuse heel the lower have two lobe point and sharp and no heel there be one very small tuberculous tooth above as a auxiliary and then the strong back tooth the muscle of the jaw be of tremendous power i have come across the remains of a buffalo kill by a tiger and find all the large bone even the big strong bone of the pelvis and large joint crack and crunch like so many walnut by the powerful jaw of the fierce brute the eye be peculiarly brilliant and when glare with fury it be truly demoniac with he bristle rigid the snarl lip draw back disclose the formidable fang the body crouch for he spring and the lithe tail puff up and swollen and lash restlessly from side to side each muscle tense and strung and a undulating movement perceptible like the motion of a huge snake a crouching tiger at bay be a sight that strike a certain chill to the heart of the onlooker when he bound forward with a roar that reverberate among the mazy labyrinth of the interminable jungle he test the steadiest nerve and almost daunt the bravest heart in they habit they be very unsociable and be only see together during the amatory season when that be over the male tiger betake he again to he solitary predatory life and the tigress become if possible fiercer than he be and bury herself in the gloomiest recess of the jungle when the young be bear the male tiger have often be know to devour he offspring and at this time they be very savage and quarrelsome old g a planter in purneah once come across a pair engage in deadly combat they writhe and struggle on the ground the male tiger striking tremendous blow on the chest and flank of he consort and tear she skin in strip while the tigress bury she fang in he neck tear and worry with all the ferocity of she nature she be battle for she young g shoot both the enraged combatant and find that one of the cub have be mangled evidently by he unnatural father another which he pick up in a neighbouring bush be unharmed but do not survive long pair have often be shoot in the same jungle but seldom in close proximity and it accord with all experience that they betray a aversion to each other 's society except at the one season this propensity of the father to devour he offspring seem to be due to jealousy or to blind unreasoning hate to save she offspring the female always conceal she young and will often move far from the jungle which she usually frequent when the cub be able to kill for themselves she seem to lose all pleasure in they society and by the time they be well grow she usually have another batch to provide for i have however shoot a tigress with a full-grown cub -- the hunt describe in the last chapter be a instance -- and on several occasion my friend george have shoot the mother with three or four full-grown cub in attendance this be however rare and only happen i believe when the mother have remain entirely separate from the company of the male the strength of the tiger be amazing the fore paw be the most formidable weapon of attack with one stroke deliver with full effect he can completely disable a large buffalo on one occasion on the koosee _ derah _ that be the plain border the river a enraged tiger pass through a herd of buffalo break the back of two of the herd give each a stroke right and leave as he go along one blow be generally sufficient to kill the largest bullock or buffalo we captain joe have once receive _ khubber _ that be news or information of a kill by a tiger he go straight to the _ baithan _ the herd 's head-quarter and on make enquiry be tell that the tiger be a veritable monster ` do you see it ' ask joe ' i do not ' respond the _ goalum _ or cowherd ` then how do you know it be so large ' ` because ' say the man ` it kill the biggest buffalo in my herd and the poor brute only give one groan ' george once track a tiger follow up the drag of a bullock that he have carry off at one place the brute come to a ditch which be measure and find to be five foot in width through this there be no drag but the trace continue on the further side the inference be that the powerful thief have clear the ditch take the bullock bodily with he at a bind other have be know to jump clear out of a cattle pen over a fence some six foot high take on one occasion a large-sized calf and another time a sheep another wound tiger with two bullet in he flank the wound be near the root of the tail clear a _ nullah _ or dry watercourse at one bind the nullah be step by george and find to be twenty-three pace wide it be fortunate with such tremendous power for attack that the tiger will try as a rule to slink out of the way if he can he almost always avoid a encounter with man he first instinct be flight only the exciting incident of the chase be as a rule put upon record a narrative of tiger shooting therefore be apt in this respect to be a little mislead the victim who meet they death tamely and quietly -lrb- and they form the majority in every hunt -rrb- -- those that be shoot as they be tamely try to escape -- be simply enumerate but the charge tiger the old vixen that break the line and scatter the beater to right and leave that rouse the blood of the sportsman to a fierce excitement these be make the most of every incident be detail and dwell upon and thus the idea have gain ground that all tiger be courageous and wait not for attack but in most instance take the initiative it be not the case most of the tiger i have see kill would have escape if they could it be only when bring to bay or very hard press or in defense of its young that a tiger or tigress display its native ferocity at such a moment indeed nothing give a better idea of savage determine fury and fiendish rage with ear throw back brow contract mouth open and glaring yellow eye scintillate with fury the cruel claw pluck at the earth the ridgy hair on the back stiff and erect as bristle and the lithe lissome body quiver in every muscle and fiber with wrath and hate the beast come down to the charge with a defiant roar which make the pulse bind and the breath come short and quick it require all a man 's nerve and coolness to enable he to make steady shooting rouse to fury by a wound i have see tiger wheel round with amazing swiftness and dash headlong roar dreadfully as they charge full upon the nearest elephant scatter the line and lacerate the poor creature on whose flank or head they may have fasten they whole aspect betoken pitiless ferocity and fiendish rage even in death they do not forget they savage instinct i know of one case in which a seemingly dead tiger inflict a fearful wound upon a elephant that have trodden on what appear to be he inanimate carcase another elephant that attack and all but trample a tiger to death be severely bite under one of the toe-nail the wound mortified and the unfortunate beast die in about a week after its infliction another monster severely wound fall into a pool of water and seize hold with its jaw of a hard knot of wood that be float about in its death agony it make its powerful tooth meet in the hard wood and not until it be be cut up and we have divide the muscle of the jaw could we extricate the wood from that formidable clench in rage and fury and mad with pain the wound tiger will often turn round and savagely bite the wound that cause its agony and they very often bite they paw and shoulder and tear the grass and earth around they a tiger wound in the spine however be the most exciting spectacle paralyse in the limb he wheel round roar and bite at everything within he reach in 1874 i shoot one in the spine and watch he furious movement for some time before i put he out of he misery i throw he a pad from one of the elephant and the way he tear and gnaw it give I some faint idea of he fury and ferocity he look the very personification of impotent viciousness the incarnation of devilish rage urge by hunger the tiger fearlessly attack he prey the most courageous be young tiger about seven or eight foot long they invariably give better sport than larger and older animal be more ready to charge and altogether bolder and more defiant up to the age of two year they have probably be with the mother have never encounter a reverse or defeat and have become bold by impunity hesitate not to fly at any assailant whatever like all the cat tribe they be very cruel in disposition often most wantonly so have disable he prey with the first onset the tiger play with it as a cat do with a mouse and unless very sharp set by hunger he always indulge this love of torture he attack be by no means due only to the craving of he appetite he often slay the victim of a herd in the wantonness of sport merely to indulge he murderous propensity even when he have have a good meal he will often go on add fresh victim seemingly to gratify he sense of power and he love of slaughter in teach she cub to kill for themselves the mother often display great cruelty frequently kill at a time five or six cow from one herd the young savage be apt pupil and ` try they prentice hand ' on calf and weakly member of the herd killing from the mere love of murder they cunning be as remarkable as they cruelty what they lack in speed they make up in consummate subtlety they take advantage of the direction of the wind and of every irregularity of the ground it be amazing what slight cover will suffice to conceal they lurk form from the observation of the herd during the day they generally retreat to some cool and shady spot deep in the recess of the jungle where the soft earth have be worn away with ragged hollow and deep shady water-course where the tallest and most impenetrable jungle conceal the wind and impervious path hide in the gloom and obscurity of the densely-matted grass the lordly tiger crouch and blink away the day with the approach of night however he mood undergo a change he hear the tinkle of the bell bear by some of the member of a retreat herd that may have be feed in close proximity to he haunt all day long and from which he have determine to select a victim for he evening meal he rouse himself and yawn stretch himself like the great cruel cat he be and then crawl and creep silently along by swampy watercourse and through devious labyrinth know to himself alone he hang on the outskirts of the herd prowl along and watch every motion of the return cattle he make he selection and with infinite cunning and patience contrive to separate it from the rest he wait for a favourable moment when with a roar that send the alarmed companion of the unfortunate victim scampering together to the front he spring on he unhappy prey deprive it of all power of resistance with one tremendous stroke and bear it away to feast at he leisure on the warm and quivering carcase he generally kill as the shades of evening be fall and seldom venture on a forage expedition by day after nightfall it be dangerous to be abroad in the jungle it be then that drama be act of thrilling interest and unimaginable sensation scene take place some of the old shekarry and field-watcher frequently dig shallow pit in which they take they stand they eye be on the level of the ground and any object stand out in relief against the sky line can be readily detect if they could relate they experience what absorb narrative they could write they see the tiger spring upon he terror-stricken prey the mother and she hungry cub prowl about for a victim or two fierce tiger battle for the favor of some sleek striped remorseless bloodthirsty forest-fiend in pursuit of they quarry they steal noiselessly along and love to make they spring unaware they generally select some weaker member of a herd and be chary of attack a strong big-boned horn animal they sometimes ` catch a tartar ' and instance be know of a buffalo not only withstand the attack of a tiger successfully but actually gain the victory over he more active assailant whose life have pay the penalty of he rashness old g tell I he have come across the body of a wild boar and a old tiger lie dead together near burgamma the boar be fearfully maul but the clean-cut gaping gash in the striped hide of the tiger tell how fearfully and gallantly he have battle for he life in emerge from the jungle at night they generally select the same path or spot and approach the edge of the cover with great caution they will follow the same track for day together hence in some place the track of the tiger be so numerous as to lead the tyro to imagine that dozen must have pass when in truth the track all belong to one and the same brute so acute be they perception so narrowly do they scrutinize every minute object in they path so suspicious be they nature that anything new in they path such as a pitfall a screen of cut grass a _ mychan _ that be a stage from which you might be intend to get a shot nay even the print of a footstep -- a man 's a horse 's a elephant 's -- be often quite enough to turn they from a project expedition or at any rate to lead they to seek some new outlet from the jungle in any case it increase they wariness and under such circumstance it become almost impossible to get a shot at they from a pit or shooting-stage they vision they sense of smell of hear all they perception be so acute that i think lie in wait for they be chiefly productive of weariness and vexation of spirit it be certainly dangerous and the chance of a successful shot be so problematical while the _ disagreeable _ and discomfort and danger be so real and tangible that i be incline to think this mode of attack ` hardly worth the candle ' with all he ferocity and cruelty however i be of opinion that the tiger be more cowardly than courageous he will always try to escape a danger and fly from attack rather than attack in return or wait to meet it and wherever he can in pursuit of he prey he will trust rather to he cunning than to he strength and he always prefer a ambuscade to a open onslaught -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be at the time the prince of wale be shoot in nepaul not very far from where i be then station most of the elephant in the district have be send up to he royal highness 's camp or be on they way to take part in the ceremony of the grand _ durbar _ in delhi chapter xix the tiger 's mode of attack -- the food he prefer -- variety of prey -- example -- what he eat first -- how to tell the kill of a tiger --

cunning of the tiger -- hunting incident shew they power of concealment -- tiger take to water -- example -- swim power -- catch by flood -- story of the soonderbund tiger the tiger 's mode of attack be very characteristic of he whole nature to see he stealthily crouch or crawl silently and sneakingly after a herd of cattle dodge behind every clump of bush or tuft of grass run swiftly along the high bank of a watercourse and sneak under the shadow border of a belt of jungle be to understand he cunning and craftiness he attitude when he be crouch for the final bind be the embodiment of suppleness and strength all he action be graceful and half display and half conceal beneath they symmetry and elegance the tremendous power and deadly ferocity that lurk beneath for a short distance he be possess of great speed and with a few short agile bound he generally manage to overtake he prey if baffle in he first attack he retire growl to lie in wait for a less fortunate victim he onset be so fierce and sudden the animal he select for he prey be generally take at a great disadvantage and be seldom in a position to make any strenuous or availing resistance deliver the numbing blow with he mighty fore paw he fasten on the throat of the animal he have fell and invariably try to tear open the jugular vein this be he practice in nearly every case and it shew a wonderful instinct for select the most deadly spot in the whole body of he luckless prey when he have get hold of he victim by the throat he lie down hold on to the bleeding carcase snarl and growl and fasten and withdraw he claw much as a cat do with a rat or mouse some writer say he then proceed to drink the blood but this be just one of those broad general assertion which require proof in some case he may quench he thirst and gratify he appetite for blood by drink it from the gush vein of he quiver victim but in many case i know from observation that the blood be not drunk if the tiger be very hungry he then begin he feast tear huge fragment of flesh from the dead body and not unusually swallow they whole if he be not particularly hungry he drag the carcase away and hide it in some well-known spot this be to preserve it from the hungry talon and tooth of vulture and jackal he commonly remain on guard near he _ cache _ until he have acquire a appetite if he can not conveniently carry away he quarry because of its bulk or the nature of the ground or from be disturb he return to the place at night and satisfy he appetite tiger can sneak crouchingly along as fast as they can trot and it be wonderful how silently they can steal on they prey they seem to have some stray provident fit and on occasion make provision for future want there be instance on record of a tiger drag a _ kill _ after he for mile over water and through slush and weed and feast on the carcase day after he have kill it it be a fact now establish beyond a doubt that he will eat carrion and putrid flesh but only from necessity and not from choice on one occasion my friend put up a tigress during the rain when there be few cattle in the _ derah _ or plain near the river she have kill a pig and be eagerly devour the carcase when she be disturbed snarl and growl she make off with a leg of pork in she mouth when a bullet end she career they seem to prefer pork and venison to almost any other kind of food and no doubt pig and deer be they natural and usual prey the influx however of vast herd of cattle and the consequent presence of man drive away the wild animal and at all event make they more wary and more difficult to kill finding domestic cattle unsuspicious and not very formidable foe the tiger contents himself at a pinch with beef and judge from he ravages he come to like it get bolder by impunity he venture in some strait to attack man he find he a very easy prey he find the flesh too perhaps not unlike he favorite pig henceforth he become a ` man-eater ' the most dreaded scourge and pestilent plague of the district he sometimes find a old boar a tough customer and never venture to attack a buffalo unless it be grazing alone and away from the rest of the herd when buffalo be attack they make common cause against they crafty and powerful foe and unite together in a crescent-shaped line they horn all direct in a living _ cheval-de-frise _ against the tiger they rush tumultuously at he and fairly hunt he from the jungle the pig have a short thick neck and be tremendously muscular be hard to kill but the poor inoffensive cow with she long-neck be generally kill at the first blow or so disabled that it require little further effort to complete the work of slaughter two friend of mine once shoot a enormous old tiger on a small island in the middle of the river during the height of the annual rain the brute have lose nearly all its hair from mange and be a emaciated sorry-looking object from the remains on the island -- the skin scale and bone -- they find that he must have slay and eat several alligator during he enforced imprisonment on the island they will eat alligator when press by hunger and they have be know to subsist on turtle tortoise iguana and even jackal only the other day in assam a son of dr b be severely maul by a tiger which spring into the verandah after a dog there be three gentleman in the verandah and as you may imagine they be take not a little by surprise they succeed in bag the tiger but not until poor b be very severely hurt after tear the throat open they walk round the prostrate carcase of they prey growl and spit like ` tabby ' cat they begin they operation in earnest invariably on the buttock a leopard generally eat the inner portion of the thigh first a wolf tear open the belly and eat the intestine first a vulture hawk or kite begin on the eye but a tiger invariably begin on the buttock whether of buffalo cow deer or pig he then eat the fatty cover round the intestine follow that up with the liver and udder and work he way round systematically to the fore-quarter leave the head to the last it be frequently the only part of a animal that they do not eat a ` man-eater ' eat the buttock shoulder and breast first so many carcase be find in the jungle of animal that have die from disease or old age or succumb to hurt and accident that the whitened skeleton meet the eye in hundred but one can always tell the kill of a tiger and distinguish between it and the other bleached heap the large bone of a tiger 's kill be always break the broad massive rib bone be crunch in two as easily as a dog would snap the drumstick of a fowl vulture and jackal the scavenger of the jungle be incapable of do this and when you see the fractured large bone you can always tell that the whiskered monarch have be on the war-path george s write I : -- ' i have know a tiger devour a whole bullock to he own cheek in one day early in the morning a man come to inform I he have see a tiger pull down a bullock i go after the fellow late in the afternoon and find he in a bush not more than twenty foot square the only jungle he have to hide in for some distance round and in this he have polish off the bullock nothing remain save the head the jungle be so very small and he have lie the whole day in it nothing in the way of vulture or jackal could have assist he in finish off the bullock ' when hungry they appear to bolt large mass of flesh without masticate it the same correspondent write : -- ` we cut out regular fid once from a tiger 's stomach also large piece of bone joe hear a tremendous roar one night which continue till near morning not far from nipunneah he go out at dawn to look for the tiger which he find be dead the brute have try to swallow the knee-joint of a bullock and it have stick in he gullet this make he roar from pain and eventually choke he ' as there be two distinct variety of wild pig in indium so there seem to be little doubt that there be two distinct kind of tiger as these have frequently cross we find many hybrid i can not do better than again quote from my obliging and observant friend george the two kind he designate as ` the royal bengal ' and ` the hill tiger ' and go on to say : -- ` as a rule the stripe of a royal bengal be single and dark the skull be widely different from that of he brother the hill tiger be low in the crown wider in the jaw rather flat in comparison and the brain-pan longer with a sloping curve at the end the crest of the brain-pan be a concave curve ` the hill tiger be much more massively build squat and thick set heavier in weight and larger in bulk with shorter tail and very large and powerful neck head and shoulder the stripe generally be double and of a more brownish tinge with fawn color between the double stripe the skull be high in the crown and not quite so wide the brain-pan be shorter and the crest slightly convex or nearly straight and the curve at the end of the skull rather abrupt ` they never grow so long as the bengal yet look twice as big ` the cross be very numerous and vary accord to pedigree in stripe skull form weight bulk and tail this i find most remarkable when i look at my collection of over 160 skull ` the difference be better mark in tiger than in tigress the bengal variety be not as a rule as ferocious as the hill tiger be more supple and cunning they can easier evade they pursuer by flight and maneuver than they less agile brother the former owe to deficiency of strength oftener meet with discomfiture and consequently be more wary and cunning while the latter prone to carry everything before they trust more to they strength and courage anticipate victory as certain ` in some the stripe be double throughout in other only partially so while in some they be single throughout and some have mane to a slight extent ' i have no doubt this classification be correct the tiger i have see in nepaul near the hill be sometimes almost a dull red and at a distance look like a huge dun cow while those i have see in the plain during we annual hunt be of a bright tawny yellow longer more lanky and not shew half such a bold front as they bulkier and bolder brethren of the hill the length of the tiger have often give rise to fierce discussion among sportsman the fertile imagination of the slayer of a solitary ` stripe ' have frequently invest the brute he have himself shot or see shot or perchance hear of as have be shoot by a friend or the friend of a friend with a fabulous length inch swell to foot and dimension grow at each repetition of the yarn till as in the case of boar the twenty-eight incher become a forty inch tusker and the eight foot tiger stretch to twelve or fourteen foot purist again stickler for stern truth hater of bounce or exaggeration have perhaps err as much on the other side and in they eagerness to give the exact measurement and avoid the very appearance of exaggeration they actually stretch they tape line and refuse to measure the curve of the body take it in straight line this i think be manifestly unfair we mode of measurement in purneah be to take the tiger as he lay before he be put on the elephant and measure from the tip of the nose over the crest of the skull along the undulation of the body to the tip of the tail that be we follow the curvature of the spine along the divide ridge of the back and always be careful and fair in we attempt i be of opinion that a tiger over ten foot long be a exceptionally long one but when i read of sportsman deny altogether that even that length can be attain i can but pity the dogmatic scepticism that refuse credence to well ascertain and authenticate fact i believe also that tiger be not get nearly so large as in former day i believe that much longer and heavier tiger -- animal larger in every way -- be shoot some twenty year ago than those we can get now but i account for this by the fact that there be less land leave waste and uncultivated there be more road ferry and bridge more improved communication and in consequence more travel population and cultivation have increase firearm be more numerous sport be more generally follow shooting be much more frequent and deadly and in a word tiger have not the same chance as they have some twenty year ago of attain a ripe old age and reach the extremest limit of they growth the largest tiger be also the most suspicious and wary be only find in the remotest recess of the impenetrable jungle of nepaul and the teraus or in those part of the indian wild where the crack of the european rifle be seldom or never hear it have be so loudly assert and so boldly maintain that no tiger be ever shoot reach when fairly measure -lrb- that be measure with the skin on as he lay -rrb- ten foot that i will let mr george again speak for himself refer to the royal bengal he say : -- ` these grow to great length they have be shoot as long as twelve foot seven inch -lrb- my father shoot one that length -rrb- or longer twelve foot seven inch twelve foot six inch twelve foot three inch twelve foot one inch and twelve foot have be shoot and record in the old sport magazine by gentleman of undoubted veracity in purneah ' i have see the skin of one twelve foot one inch compare with which the skin of one i have by I _ that measure as he lay _ -lrb- the italics be mine -rrb- eleven foot one inch look like the skin of a cub the old skin look more like that of a huge antediluvian species in comparison with the other ` the twelve footer be so heavy that my uncle -lrb- ca -rrb- tell I no number of mahout could lift it several man if they could have approach at one and the same time might have be able to do so but a sufficient number of man could not lay hold simultaneously to move the body from the ground ` eventually a number of bamboo have to be cut and place in a incline from the ground to the elephant 's saddle while the elephant kneel down and up this incline the tiger have to be regularly haul and shove and so fasten on the elephant ` he -lrb- the tiger -rrb- maul four elephant one of whom die the same day and one other have a narrow _ batch _ ie escape of its life in another communication to I my friend go over the same ground but as the matter be one of interest to sportsman and naturalist i will give the extract entire it proceed as follow : -- ` tiger grow to great length some assert to even fourteen foot i do not say they do not but such case be very rare and require authentication the longest i have see measure as he lay eleven foot one inch -lrb- see oriental sport magazine for July 1871 p 308 -rrb- he be seven foot nine inch from tip of nose to root of tail root of tail one foot three inch in circumference round chest four foot six inch length of head one foot two inch fore arm two foot two inch round the head two foot ten inch length of tail three foot four inch ` besides this i have shoot another eleven foot and one ten foot eleven inch ` the largest tigress i have shoot be at sahareah which measure ten foot two inch i shoot another ten foot exactly ' -lrb- see osm aug 1874 p 358 -rrb- ' i have get the head of a tiger shoot by joe which measure eleven foot five inch it be shoot at barailum ` the male be much bigger build in every way -- length weight size & c than the female the male be more savage the female more cunning and agile the arm body paw head skull claw tooth & c of the female be smaller the tail of tigress longer hind leg more lanky the print look smaller and more contract and the toe nearer together it be say that though a large tiger may venture to attack a buffalo the tigress refrain from do so but i have find this otherwise in my experience ' i have keep a regular log of all tiger shoot by I the average length of fifty-two tiger record in my journal be nine foot six and a half inch -lrb- cub exclude -rrb- and of sixty-eight tigress -lrb- cub exclude -rrb- eight foot four inch ` the average of tiger and tigress be eight foot ten and a quarter inch this be exclude cub i have take alive ' as to measurement he go on to make a few remark and as i can not improve on they i reproduce the original passage : -- ` several method have be recommend for measure tiger i measure they on the ground or when bring to camp before skin and run the tape tight along the line beginning at the tip of the nose along the middle of the skull between the ear and neck then along the spine to the end of the tail take any curve of the body ` no doubt measurement of skull body tail leg & c ought all to be take to give a adequate idea of the tiger and for compare they with one another but this be not always feasible ' most of the lead sportsman in indium now-a-day be very particular in take the dimension of every limb of the dead tiger they take he girth length and different proportion many even weigh the tiger when it get into camp and no doubt this test be one of the best that can be give for a comparison of the size of the different animal slay another much disputed point in the natural history of the animal a point on which there have be much acrimonious discussion be the number of young that be give at a birth some writer have assert and stoutly maintain that two cub or at the most three be the extreme number of young bring forth at one time this may be the ordinary number but the two gentleman i have already allude to have assure I that on frequent occasion they have pick up four actually bear and have cut out five several time and on one occasion six from the womb of a tigress i have myself pick up four male cub all in one spot with they eye just begin to open and none of they tooth through the gum one have be trample to death by buffalo the other three be alive and scatheless huddle into a bush like three immense kitten i keep the three for a considerable time and eventually take they to calcutta and sell they for a very satisfactory price it seem clear however that the tigress frequently have four and even five cub it be rare indeed to find she accompany by more than two well grow cub very seldom three and the inference be that one or two of the young tiger succumb in very early life the young one do not appear to grow very quickly they be about a foot long when they be bear they be bear blind with very minute hair almost none in fact but with the stripe already perfectly mark on the soft supple skin they open they eye when they be eight or ten day old at which time they measure about a foot and a half at the age of nine month they have attain to five foot in length and be wax mischievous tiger cub a year old average about five foot eight inch tigress some three inch or so less in two year they grow respectively to -- the male seven foot six inch and the female seven foot at about this time they leave the mother if they have not already do so and commence depredation on they own account in fact they education have be well attend to the mother teach they to kill when they be about a year old a young cub that measure only six foot and whose mother have be shoot in one of the annual beat be kill while attack a full grown cow in the government pound at dumdaha police station when they reach the length of six foot six inch they can kill pretty easily and number have be shoot by george and other purneah sportsman close to they ` kill ' they be most daring and courageous when they have just leave they mother 's care and be cast forth to fight the battle of life for themselves while with the old tigress they line have be cast in not unpleasant place they have seldom know hunger and have experience no reverse accustomed to see every animal succumb to she well plan and audacious attack they fancy that nothing will withstand they onslaught they have be know to attack a line of elephant and to charge most determinedly even in this adolescent stage bye-and-bye however as they receive a few rude shock from buffalo or be worst in a hand-to-hand encounter with some tough old bull or savage old gray boar more especially if they get a ugly rip or two from the sharp tusk of a infuriate fighting tusker they begin to be less aggressive they learn that discretion may be the better part of valor and they cunning instinct be rouse in fact they education be progress and in time they instinctively discover every wile and dodge and cunning stratagem and display all the wondrous subtlety of they race in procure they prey old tiger be invariably more wary cautious and suspicious than young one and till they be fairly put to it by hunger hurt or compulsion they endeavor to keep they stripe conceal when bring to bay however there be little to reproach they with on the score of cowardice and it will be matter of rejoice if you or you elephant do not come off second best in the encounter even in the last desperate case a cunning old tiger will often make a feint or sham rush or pretend charge when he whole object be flight if he succeed in demoralise the line of elephant roar and dash furiously about he will then try in the confusion to double through unless he be too badly wound to be able to travel fast in which case he will fight to the end old fellow be well acquaint with every maze and thicket in the jungle and they no sooner hear the elephant enter the ` bush ' or ` cover ' than they make off for some distant shelter if there be no apparent chance of this be successful they try to steal out laterally and outflank the line or if that also be impossible they hide in some secret recess like a fox or crouch low in some clumpy bush and trust to you or you elephant pass by without notice they presence it be marvellous in what sparse cover they will manage to lie up so admirably do they stripe mingle with the withered and char grass-stem and dry up stalk that it be very difficult to detect the dreaded robber when he be lie flat extend close to the ground so still and motionless that you can not distinguish a tremor or even a vibration of the grass in which he be crouch on one occasion george follow a old tiger through some stubble about three foot high it have be well trample down too by tame buffalo the tiger have be track into the field and be know to be in it george be within ten yard of the cunning brute and although mount on a tall elephant and eagerly scan the thin cover with he sharpest glance he could not discern the conceal monster he elephant be within four pace of it when it spring up at the charge give a mighty roar which however also serve as its death yell as a bullet from george 's trusty gun crash through its rib and heart tiger can lay themselves so flat on the ground and lie so perfectly motionless that it be often a very easy thing to overlook they on another occasion when the purneah hunt be out a tigress that have be shoot get under some cover that be trample down by a line of about twenty elephant the sportsman know that she have be severely wound as they could tell by the gout of blood but there be no sign of the body she have disappear after a long search beat the same ground over and over again a elephant tread on the dead body lie under the trampled cane and the mahout get down and discover she lie quite dead she be a large animal and full grow on another occasion george be after a fine male tiger he be follow up fast but come to a broad nullah full of water he suddenly lose sight of he game he look up and down the bank and on the opposite bank but could see no trace of the tiger look down he see in the water what at first he take to be a large bull-frog there be not a ripple on the placid stagnant surface of the pool he marvel much and just then he mahout point to the suppose bull-frog and in a excited whisper implore george to fire a keener look convinced george that it really be the tiger it be totally immerse all but the face and lie so still that not the faintest motion or ripple be perceptible he fire and inflict a terrible wound the tiger bound madly forward and george give it its quietus through the spine as it try to spring up the opposite bank a nearly similar case occur to old mr c one of the veteran sportsman of purneah a tiger have bolt towards a small tank or pond and though the line follow up in hot pursuit the brute disappear old c keener than the other be loth to give up the pursuit and presently discern a yellowish reflection in the clear water peer more intently he could discover the yellowish tawny outline of the cunning animal totally immerse in the water save its eye ear and nose he shoot the tiger dead and it sink to the bottom like a stone so perfectly have it conceal itself that the other sportsman could not for the life of they imagine what old c have fire at till he mahout get down and begin to haul the dead animal out of the water tiger be not at all afraid of water and be fast and powerful swimmer they swim much after the fashion of a horse only the head out of the water and they make scarcely any ripple ` in another case ' write george ` though not five yard from the elephant and right under I a tiger be swim with so slight a ripple that i mistook it for a rat until i see the stripe emerge when i perforated he jacket with a bullet ' only they head remain out of water when they be swim they be very hard to hit as shooting at a object on water be very deceptive work as to judge distance and a tiger 's head be but a small object to aim at when some little way off old c have another adventure with a cunning rogue which all but end disastrously he be in hot pursuit of the tiger and finding no safety on land it take to swim in a broad unfordable piece of water a sort of deep lagoon old c procure a boat that be handy and get a coolie to paddle he out after the tiger he fire several shot at the expose head of the brute but miss he think he would wait till he get nearer and make a sure shot as he have only one bullet leave in the boat suddenly the tiger turn round and make straight for the boat here be a quandary even if lie kill the tiger with he single bullet it might upset the boat the lagoon be full of alligator to say nothing of weed and there be no time to get he heavy boot off he feel he life might depend on the accuracy of he aim he fire and kill the tiger stone dead within four or five yard of the boat on one occasion when out with we worthy district magistrate mr s i come on the track of what to all appearance be a very large tiger they lead over the sand close to the water 's edge and be very distinct i could see no return mark so i judge that the tiger must have take to the water the stream be rapid and deep and midway to the further bank be a big oblong-shaped sandy islet some five or six hundred yard long and have a few scrubby bush grow sparsely on it we put we elephant into the rapid current and get across the river here be nearly a quarter of a mile wide on each side of the islet as we emerge from the stream on to the island we find fresh track of the tiger they lead we completely round the circumference of the islet the tiger have evidently be in quest of food the print be fresh and very well define finding that all be barren on the sandy shore he enter the current again and follow up we find he imprint once more on the further bank several hundred yard down the stream one tiger be kill stone dead by a single bullet during one of we annual hunt and fall back into the water it sink to the bottom like lead be unable to find the animal we beat all round the place till i suggest it might have be hit and fall into the river one of the man be order to dive down and ascertain if the tiger be at the bottom the river water be generally muddy so that the bottom can not be see divest himself of puggree and gird up he loin the diver sink gently to the bottom but presently reappear in a palpable funk puffing and blowing and declare that the tiger be certainly at the bottom the foolish fellow think it might be still alive we soon disabuse he mind of that idea and have the dead tiger haul up to dry land surprise by flood a tiger have be know to remain for day on a ant-hill and even to take refuge on the branch of some large tree but he take to water readily and can swim for over a mile and he have be know to remain for day in from two to three foot depth of water a time-honoured tiger story with old hand use to tell how the soonderbund tiger get carry out to sea if the listener be a new arrival or a _ gobe mouche _ they would explain that the tiger in the soonderbund often get carry out to sea by the retire tide it would sweep they off as they be swim from island to island in the vast delta of father gange only the young one however suffer this lamentable fate the older and more wary fellow teach perhaps by sad experience use always to dip they tail in before start on a swim so as to ascertain which way the tide be flow if it be the flow of the tide they would boldly venture in but if it be ebb tide and there be the slightest chance of they be carry out to sea they would patiently lie down meditate on the fleeting vanity of life and like the hero of the song -- ` wait for the turn of the tide ' without venture a opinion on this story i may confidently assert that the tiger unlike he humble prototype the domestic cat be not really afraid of water but will take to it readily to escape a

tiger and they be very often averse to give the slightest information as to they whereabouts to a stranger they will either give no information at all plead entire ignorance or they will wilfully mislead he put he on a totally wrong track if you be well know to the villager and if they have confidence in you nerve and aim they will eagerly tell you everything they know and will accompany you on you elephant to point out the exact spot where the tiger be last see in the event of a ` find ' they always look for _ backsheesh _ even though you exertion may have rid they neighborhood of a acknowledged scourge the _ gwallum _ or cowherd caste seem to know the habit of the yellow striped robber very accurately accompany by they herd they will venture into the thickest jungle even though they know that it be infested by one or more tiger if any member of the herd be attack it be quite common for the _ gwallum _ to rush up and by shout and even blow try to make the robber yield up he prey this be no exaggeration but a simple fact a cowherd attack by a tiger have be know to call up he herd by cry and they have succeed in drive off he fierce assailant no tiger will willingly face a herd of buffalo or cattle unite for mutual defense surround by he trusty herd the _ gwallum _ traverse the densest jungle and most tiger-infested thicket without fear they believe that to rub the fat of the tiger on the loin and to eat a piece of the tongue or flesh will cure impotency and tiger fat rub on a painful part of the body be a accept specific for rheumatic affection it be a firmly settle belief that the whisker and tooth wear on the body will act as a charm make the wearer proof against the attack of tiger the collar-bone too be eagerly covet for the same reason during the rain tiger be sometimes force like other of the cat tribe to take to tree a mr mci shoot two large full grown tiger in a tree at gunghara and a baboo of my acquaintance bag no less than eight in tree during one rainy season at rampoor tiger generally prefer remain near water and drink a great deal the quantity of raw meat they devour be no doubt provocative of thirst the mark of they claw be often see on tree in the vicinity of they haunt and from this fact many ridiculous story have get abroad regard they habit it have even be regard by some writer as a sort of rude test by which to arrive at a approximate estimate of the tiger 's size a tiger can stretch himself out some two or two and a half foot more than he measurable length you have doubtless often see a domestic cat whet its claw on the mat or scratch some rough substance such as the bark of a tree this be often do to clean the claw and to get rid of chip and ragged piece and it be sometimes mere playfulness it be the same with the tiger the scratch on the tree be frequently do in the mere wantonness of sport but it be often resort to to clear the claw from piece of flesh that may have adhere to they during a meal on some poor slaughter bullock these mark on the tree be a valuable sign for the hunter as by they appearance whether fresh or old he can often tell the whereabouts of he quarry and a good tracker will even be able to make a rough guess at its probable size and disposition like policeman tiger stick to certain beat even when disturb and force to abandon a favorite spot they frequently return to it and although the jungle may be wholly destroy old tiger retain a partiality for the scene of they youthful depredation they be often shoot in the most unlikely place where there be little or no cover and one would certainly never expect to find they they migrate with the herd and retire to the hill during the annual flood always come back to the same jungle when the rain be over experienced shekarry know this trait of the tiger 's character well and can tell you minutely the color and general appearance of the animal in any particular jungle they be aware of any peculiarity such as lameness scar & c and they observation must be very keen indeed and amazingly accurate as i have never know they wrong when they commit themselves to a positive statement a old planter reside at sultanpore close on the nepaul border a note sportsman and a crack shot be charge on one occasion by a large tiger the brute spring right off the ground on to the elephant 's head he hind leg be completely off the ground rest on the elephant 's chest and neck mr f retain sufficient presence of mind to sit close down in he howdah the tiger 's forearm be extend completely over the front bar and so close that it touch he hat in this position he call out to he son who be on another elephant close by to fire at the tiger he be cool enough to warn he to take a careful aim and not hit the elephant he son act gallantly up to he instruction and shoot the tiger through the heart when it drop down quite dead to mr f 's great relief some sportsman be of opinion that the tiger when charge never spring clear from the ground but only rear itself on its hind leg this however be a mistake i see a tiger leap right off the ground and spring on to the rump of a elephant carry young sam s the elephant prove staunch and remain quite quiet and sam turn round in he howdah shoot he assailant through the head i may give another incident to shew how closely tiger will sometimes stick to cover they be sometimes as bad to dislodge as a quail or a hare they will crouch down and conceal themselves till you almost trample on they one day a party of the purneah club be out they have shoot two fine tiger out of several that have be see the other be know to have go ahead into some jungle surround by water and easy to beat before proceed further it be propose accordingly to have some refreshment the _ tiffin _ elephant be direct to a tree close by beneath whose shade the hungry sportsman be to plant themselves the elephant have kneel down one or two box have actually be remove several of the servant be clear away the dry grass and leave hw come up on the opposite side of the tree and be in the act of leap off he elephant when a enormous tiger get up at he very foot and before the astounded sportsman could handle a gun the formidable intruder have clear the bush with a bind and disappear in the thick jungle the follow adventure bear I out in my remark that tiger get attach to and like to remain in one place mr f simpson a thorough-going sportsman of the good old type have be out one day in the koosee derah he have have a long and unsuccessful beat for tiger and have give up all hope of bag one that day he think therefore that he might as well turn he attention to more ignoble game extract he bullet he replace they with no 4 shot in a few minute a peacock get up in front of he and he fire the report rouse a very fine tiger right in front of he elephant to make the best of a bad bargain he give the retreat animal the full benefit of he remain charge of shot and pepper it well about a year after close to this very place ca bag a fine tiger on examination the mark of a charge of shot be find in the flank and on remove the pad of the foot number of pellet of no 4 shot be find embedded in they it be evidently the animal that have be pepper a year before and the pellet have work they way downward to the foot on another occasion a man come to the factory where george be then reside to give information of a tiger he bear on he back numerous bleeding scratch ample evidence of the truth of he story while cut grass in the jungle with a blanket on he back the day be rainy he have be attack by a tiger from the rear the blanket be generally fold several time and wear over the head and back it be a thick heavy covering and in the first onset the tiger tear the blanket from the man 's body which be probably the means of save he life the man turn round terribly scare as may be imagine in desperation he strike at the tiger with he sickle and accord to he own account he succeed in put out one of its eye he say it be a young tiger and he bleeding wound and the persistency with which he stick to he story impressed george with the belief that he be tell the truth a search for the tiger be make the man 's blanket be find tear to shred but no tiger although the footprint of one be plainly visible but some month after near the same spot george shoot a half grown tiger with one of its eye go which have evidently be roughly tear from the socket this be doubtless the identical brute that have attack the grass-cutter it be sometimes wonderful how easily a large and powerful tiger may be kill the most vulnerable part be the back of the head through the neck and broadside on the chest the neck be the most deadly spot of all and a shot behind the shoulder or on the spine be sure to bring the game to bag i have see several shot with a single bullet from a smooth-bore and on one occasion george tell I he see a tigress kill with a single smooth-bore bullet at over a hundred yard the bullet be a _ ricochet _ and strike the tigress below the chest and travel towards the heart but without touch it she fall twenty yard from where she have be hit another which on skinning we find have be shoot through the heart with a single smooth-bore bullet at a distance of one hundred and fifty yard travel for thirty yard before fall dead meiselback a neighbor of mine shot three tiger successively on one occasion with a no 18 joe manton smooth-bore each of the three be kill by a single bullet one in the head one in the neck and one through the heart the bullet enter behind the shoulder on the other hand i once fire no less than six jacob 's shell into a tiger all behind the shoulder before i could stop he the shell seem to explode on the surface the moment they come in contact with the body there be a tremendous surface wound big enough to put a pumpkin into but very little internal hurt on another occasion -lrb- April 4 1874 -rrb- during one of the most exciting and most glorious moment of my sport life -- buffalo charge the line in all direction burn jungle all around we and bullet whistle on every side -- i fire twelve shell into a large bull before i kill he as every shell hit he i hear the sharp detonation and see the tiny puff of smoke curl outward from the ghastly wound the poor maddened brute would drop on he knee stagger again to he foot and game to the last attempt to charge my elephant i be anxious really to test the effect of the jacob 's shell as against the solid conical bullet and carefully watch the result of each shot my weapon be a beautifully finish no 12 smooth-bore make expressly to order for a officer in the royal artillery from whom i buy it from that day i never fire another jacob 's shell my remark about the tiger spring clear off the ground when charge be amply bear out by the experience of some of my sport friend i could quote page but will content myself with one extract it be a point of some importance as many good old sportsman pooh-pooh the idea and maintain that the tiger merely stretch himself out to he fullest length and if he do leave the ground it be by a purely physical effort pull himself up by he claw my friend george write I : ` in several case i have know and see the tiger spring and leave the ground in one case the tiger spring from fully five yard off he crouch at the distance of a few pace as if about to spring and then spring clean on to the head of joe 's _ tusker _ a eight foot nine inch tigress once get on to the head of my elephant which be ten foot seven inch in height every one present see she leave the ground once when after a tiger in small stubble about six foot high i see one bind over a bush so clean that i could see every bit of he ' and so on for long range shoot the rifle be doubtless the best weapon the express be the most deadly the smooth-bore be the gun for downright honest sport shell and hollow pointed bullet be the thing as one sportsman write I ` for mutilation and cowardly murder and for spoil the skin ' poison be the resource of the poacher no sportsman could descend so low grant that the tiger be a scourge a pest a nuisance a cruel and implacable foe to man and beast pile all the vilest epithet of you vocabulary on he head and say that he deserve they all still he be what opportunity and circumstance have make he he be as nature fashion he and there be bold spirit and keen sight and steady nerve enough god wot among we indian sportsman to cope with he on more equal and sportsmanlike term than by poisoning he like a mangy dog on this point however opinion differ i do not envy the man who would prefer poisoning a tiger to the keen delight of patiently follow he up oust he from cover to cover watch he careful endeavor to elude you search perhaps at the end of a long and fascinating beat feel the electric excitement thrill every nerve and fiber of you body as the magnificent robber come bound down at the charge the very embodiment of ferocity and strength the perfection of symmetry the acme of agility and grace native be such notorious perverter of the truth and so often hide what little there may be in they communication under such flood of oriental hyperbole and exaggeration that you be often disappoint in go out on what you consider trustworthy and certain information they often remind I of the story of the laird of logan he be ride slowly along a country road one day when another equestrian join he logan 's eye fix itself on a hole in the turf bank bound the road and with great gravity and in trust-inspiring accent he say ' i see a _ tod _ -lrb- or fox -rrb- gang in there ' ` do you really ' cry the new comer ' i do ' respond the laird ` will you hold my horse till i get a spade ' cry the now excited traveller the laird assent away hurry the man and soon return with a spade he set manfully to work to dig out the fox and work till the perspiration stream down he face the laird sit stolidly look on say never a word and as he seem to be near the confines of the hole the poor digger redouble he exertion when at length it become plain that there be no fox there he wipe he streaming brow and rather crossly exclaim ` i be afraid there be no tod here ' ` it would be a wonder if there be ' rejoin the laird without the movement of a muscle ` it be ten year since i see he gang in there ' so it be sometimes with a native he will fire you ardor by tell you of some enormous tiger to be find in some jungle close by but when you come to enquire minutely into he story you find that the tiger be see perhaps the year before last or that it _ use _ to be there or that somebody else have tell he of its be there some tiger too be so cunning and wary that they will make off long before the elephant have come near i have see other rise on they hind leg just like a hare or a kangaroo and peer over the jungle try to make out one 's whereabouts this be of course only in short light jungle the plan we generally adopt in beat for tiger on or near the nepaul border be to use a line of elephant to beat the cover it be a fine sight to watch the long line of stately monster move slowly and steadily forward several howdah tower high above the line the polished barrel of gun and rifle glitter in the fierce ray of the burning and vertical sun some of the shooter wear huge hat make from the light pith of the solah plant other have long blue or white puggree wind round they head in truly oriental style these be very comfortable to wear but rather try to the sight as they afford no protection to the eye for ride they be to my mind the most comfortable head-dress that can be worn and they be certainly more graceful than the stiff unsightly solah hat between every two howdah be four or five pad elephant these beat up all the intervene bush and carry the game that may be shoot when a pig deer tiger or other animal have be shoot and have receive its _ coup de grace _ it be quickly bundle on to the pad and there secure the elephant kneel down to receive the load and while game be be pad the whole line wait till the operation be complete as it be bad policy to leave blank where this simple precaution be neglect many a tiger will sneak through the opening leave by the pad elephant and so silently and cautiously can they steal through the dense cover and so cunning be they and acute that they will take advantage of the slightest gap and the keenest and best train eye will fail to detect they in most of we hunting party on the koosee we have some twenty or thirty elephant and frequently six or eight howdah these expedition be very pleasant and we live luxuriously for real sport ten elephant and two or three try comrade -- not more -- be much better with a short easily-worked line that can turn and double and follow the tiger quickly and dog he every movement you can get far better sport and bring more to bag than with a long unwieldy line that take a considerable time to turn and wheel and in whose onward march there be of necessity little of the silence and swiftness which be necessary element in successful tiger shooting i have be out with a line of seventy-six elephant and fourteen howdah this be on 16th march 1875 it be a magnificent sight to see the seventy-six huge brute in the river together splash the water along they heated side to cool themselves and send huge wave dash against the crumble bank of the rapid stream it be no less magnificent to see they slow stately march through the sway crash jungle what a idea of irresistible power and ponderous strength the huge creature give we as they heave through the tangled brake crush everything in they resistless progress it be a sight to be remembered but as might have be expect we find the jungle almost untenant everything clear out before we long ere the line could reach its vicinity we only kill one tiger but next day we separate the main body cross the stream while my friend and myself with only fourteen elephant rebeat the same jungle and bag two in every hunt one member be tell off to look after the forage and grain for the elephant one attend to the cooking and requirement of the table one act as paymaster and keeper of account while the most experienced be unanimously elect captain and take general direction of every movement of the line he decide on the plan of operation for the day give each he place in the line and for the time become a irresponsible autocrat whose word be law and against whose decision there be no appeal scout be send out during the night and bring in report from all part of the jungle in the early morning while we be discuss _ chota baziree _ we early morning meal if tiger be report or a kill have be discover we form line in silence and without noise bear down direct on the spot in the captain 's howdah be three flag a blue flag fly means that only tiger or rhinoceros be to be shoot at a red flag signify that we be to have general firing in fact that we may blaze away at any game that may be afoot and the white flag shew we that we be on we homeward way and then also may shoot at anything we can get break the line or do whatever we choose on the flank be generally post the best shot of the party the captain as a rule keep to the center of the line frequently one man and elephant be send on ahead to some opening or dry water-bed to see that no cunning tiger sneak away unseen this vedette be call _ naka _ all experienced sportsman employ a naka and not unfrequently where the ground be difficult two be send ahead the naka be a most important post and the holder will often get a lucky shot at some wary veteran try to sneak off and may perhaps bag the only tiger of the day the mere knowledge that there be a elephant on ahead will often keep tiger from try to get away they prefer to face the known danger of the line behind to the unknown danger in front and in all case where there be a big party a naka should be send on ahead tiger can be and be shoot on the koosee plain all the year round but the big hunt take place in the month of march April and may when the hot west wind be blow and when the jungle have get considerably trample down by the herd of cattle grazing in the tangled wilderness of tall grass innumerable small path shew where the cattle wander backward and forward through the labyrinth of the jungle in the howdah we carry ample supplies of vesuvian we light and drop these as they blaze into the dry grass and withered leaf as we move along and soon a mighty wall of roar flame behind we attest the presence of the destroy element we go diagonally up wind and the flame and smoke thus surge and roar and curl and roll in dense blind volume to the rear and leeward of we line the roaring of the flame sound like the madden surf of a angry sea dashing in thunder against a iron-bound coast the leap flame mount up in fiery column illuminate the fleecy cloud of smoke with a unearthly glare the noise be deafen at times some of the elephant get quite nervous at the fierce roar of the flame behind and try to bolt across country the fire serve two good purpose it burn up the old withered grass make room for the fresh succulent sprout to spring and it keep all the game in front of the line drive the animal before we as they be afraid to break back and face the roaring-wall of flame a seething surge sea of flame several mile long encircle the whole country in its fiery belt sweep along at night with the roar of a storm-tossed sea the flame flicker swell and leap up in the dark night the fiery particle rush along amid cloud of lurid smoke and the glare of the serpent-like line redden the horizon be one of those magnificent spectacles that can only be witness at rare interval among the experience of a sojourn in indium word fail to depict its grandeur and the utmost skill of dor could not render on canvas the weird unearthly magnificence of a jungle fire at the culmination of its force and fury in beat the elephant be several yard apart and stand in the howdah you can see the slightest motion of the grass before you unless indeed it be virgin jungle quite untrodden and perhaps higher than you elephant in such high dense cover tiger will sometimes lie up and allow you to go clean past they in such a case you must fire the jungle and allow the blaze to beat for you it be common for young over eager sportsman to fire at move jungle trust to a lucky chance for hit the move animal this be useless waste of powder they fail to realize the great length of the sway grass and invariably shoot over the game the animal hear the crash of the bullet through the dense thicket overhead and immediately stop and you lose all idea of he whereabouts when you see a animal move before you in long jungle it should be you object to follow he slowly and patiently till you can get a sight of he and see what sort of beast he be firing at the move grass be worse than useless keep as close behind he as you can make sign for the other elephant to close in stick to you quarry never lose sight of he for a instant be ready to seize the first moment when more open jungle or some other favourable chance may give you a glimpse of he skin another caution should be observe never fire down the line it be astonishing how little will divert a bullet and a careless shot be worse than a dozen charge tiger if a tiger do break back let he get well away behind the line and then blaze at he as hard as you like it be particularly unpleasant to hear a bullet come singing and boom down the line from some excited dunderhead on the far leave or right a tiger slouch along in front move pretty fast in a silent swinging trot the top of the reed or grass sway very gently with a waver side to side motion a pig rush boldly through and a deer will cause the grass to rock violently to and fro a buffalo or rhinoceros be know at once by the crash of the dry stalk as he huge frame plunge along but the tiger can never be mistake when that gentle undulating noiseless motion be once see be ready with you trusty gun and remove not you eye from the

cane-work and a moveable seat with a leather strap adjustable to any length on which to lean back they should have a strong iron rail all round the top cover with leather with convenient groove to receive the barrel of the gun as they rest in front ready to either hand in front there should be compartment for different kind of cartridge and pocket and locker under the seat and at the back or wherever there be room outside should be a strong iron step to get out and in by easily and a strong iron ring through which to pass the rope that bind the howdah to the elephant you can not be too careful with you howdah rope a chain be generally use as a auxiliary to the rope which should be of cotton strong and well twisted and should be overhaul daily to see that there be no chafe it be pass round the foot-bar of the howdah and several time round the belly of the elephant another rope act as a crupper behind be pass through ring in the terminal frame-work of the howdah and under the elephant 's tail it frequently cause painful sore there and some driver give it a hitch round the tail in the same way as you would hitch it round a post another steadying rope go round the elephant 's breast like a chest-band ' a merciful man be merciful to he beast ' you should always therefore have a sheet of soft well oiled leather to go between the chest and belly rope and the elephant 's hide this prevent chafing and be a great relief to the poor old _ hathus _ as they call the elephant _ hatnee _ be the female elephant _ duntar _ be a fellow with large tusk and _ mukna _ be a elephant with small downward grow tusk many of the old fashion howdah be far too heavy a firm strong howdah should not weigh more than 28 lb in most of the old fashion one there be a seat for a attendant if you attendant be a mussulman he hurry down as soon as you shoot a deer to cut its throat the mohammedan religion enjoin a variety of rule on its professor in regard to the slaying of animal for food chief of these be a prohibition against eat the flesh of a animal that have die a natural death the throat of every animal intend to be eat should be cut and at the moment of apply the knife _ bismillah _ should be say that be ` in the name of god ' if therefore you mahout or attendant belong to the religion of the _ koran _ he will hurry down to cut the throat of a wounded deer if possible before life be extinct if it be already dead he will leave it alone for the hindoo who have no such scruple a number of _ moosahur banturs gwalla _ and other idler from the jungle village generally follow in the wake of the line if you shoot many pig they carry off the dead body and hold high carnival in they home in the evening to see they rush on a slay buffalo and hack it to piece be a curious sight they fight for piece of flesh like so many vulture sportsman generally content themselves with the head of a buffalo but not a scrap of the carcase be ever waste the native be attract to the spot like ant to a heap of grain or wasp to a old sugar barrel they seem to spring out of the earth so rapidly do they make they appearance if you be to kill a dozen buffalo i believe all the flesh would be take away to the neighbouring village within a hour this appearance of man in the jungle be wonderful you may think yourself in the center of a vast wilderness not a sign of human habitation for mile around on all side stretch a vast ocean of grass the resort of ferocious wild animal seemingly untrodden by a human foot you shoot a deer a pig or other animal whose flesh be fit for food the man behind you give a cry and in ten minute you will have a group of brawny young fellow around you elephant eager to carry away the game the way these native thread the dense jungle be to I a wonder they seem to know every devious path and hidden recess and they traverse the most gloomy and dangerous solitude without betray the slightest apprehension in fasten dead game to the pad of the carry elephant great care be necessary some elephant be very timid and indeed all elephant be mistrustful and suspicious of anything behind they they be pretty courageous in face anything before they but they do not like a rustling or indeed any motion in they rear i have see a dog put a elephant to flight and if you have a lazy _ hathus _ a good plan be to walk a horse behind he he will then shuffle along at a prodigious pace constantly look round from side to side and no doubt in he heart anathematise the horse that force the run so persistently the present method of roughly lash on dead game anyhow require alter some ingenious sportsman could surely devise a system of sling by which the dead weight of the game could be more equally distribute at present the dead body be haul up at random and fastened anyhow the pad get displace the elephant must stop till the burden be rearrange the rope especially on a hot day cut into the skin and rub off the hair and many a good skin be quite spoil by the present rough method of tie on the pad one day in take off a dead tiger from the pad near george 's bungalow the end of the rope -lrb- a new one -rrb- remain somehow fix to the neck of the elephant when he rise up be relieve of the weight he drag the dead tiger with he this put the elephant into a horrible funk and despite all the effort of the driver he start off at a trot haul the tiger after he every now and then he would turn round and tread and kick the lifeless carcase at length the rope give way and the elephant become more manageable but not before a fine skin have be totally ruin all owe to this primitive style of fasten by rope to the pad a proper pad with leather strap and buckle that could be haul as tight as necessary -- a sort of harness arrangement could easily be devise to secure dead game on the pad i be certain it would save time in the hunting-field and protect many a fine skin that get abraded and marked by the present rough and ready lash it be always dangerous to go too close up to a wounded tiger and one should never rashly jump to the conclusion that a tiger be dead because he appear so approach he cautiously and make very certain that he be really and truly dead before you venture to get down beside the body it be a bad plan to take you elephant close up to a dead tiger at all i have know case where good staunch elephant have be spoil for future sport by be rashly take up to a wounded tiger in roll about the tiger may get hold of the elephant and inflict injury that will demoralise they and make they quite unsteady on subsequent occasion i have know case where a tiger leave for dead have have to be shoot over again i have see a man get down to pull a seemingly dead tiger into the open and get charge fortunately it be a die effort and i put a bullet through the skull before the tiger could reach the frightened peon we have be several time group round a die tiger watch he breathe he last when the brute have summon up strength for a final effort and charge the elephant on one occasion wd have get down beside what he think a dead tiger have roll he over and tape in hand be about to measure the animal when he stagger to he foot with a terrific growl and make away through the jungle he have only be stunned and fortunately prefer run to fight or the consequence might have be more tragic as it be he be quickly follow up and kill but instance like these might be indefinitely multiply all teaching that seemingly dead tiger should be approach with the utmost respect never venture off you elephant without a loaded revolver in beat for tiger we have see that the appearance of the kill whether fresh or old whether much tear and mangled or comparatively untouched often afford valuable indication to the sportsman the footprint be not less narrowly look for and scrutinize if we be after tiger and follow they up the captain will generally get down at any bare place such as a dry nullah the edge of a tank or water hole or any other spot where footprint can be detect fresh print can be very easily distinguish the impression be like that make by a dog only much larger and the mark of the claw be not visible the largest footprint i have hear of be measure by george s and be find to be eight and a quarter inch wide from the outside of the first to the outside of the fourth toe if a tiger have pass very recently the print will be fresh-looking and if on damp ground there can be no mistake they if it have be rain recently we particularly notice whether the rain have obliterate the track at all in any place which would lead we to the conclusion that the tiger have pass before it rain if the water have lodge in the footprint the tiger have pass after the shower in fresh print the water will be slightly puddly or muddy in old print it will be quite clear and so on the call of the male tiger be quite different from that of the female the male call with a hoarse harsh cry something between the grunt of a pig and the bellow of a bull the call of the tigress be more like the prolonged mew of a cat much intensify during the pairing season the call be sharper and shorter and end in a sudden break at that time too they cry at more frequent interval the roar of the tiger be quite unlike the call once hear it be not easily forget the native who live in the jungle can tell one tiger from another by color size & c and they can even distinguish one animal from another by he call it be very absurd to hear a couple of native get together and describe the appearance of some tiger they have see in describe a pig they refer to he height or the length of he tusk they describe a fish by put they fist together and say he be so thick _ itna mota _ the head of a tiger be always the most conspicuous part of the body see in the jungle they therefore invariably describe he by he head one man will hold he two hand apart about two foot and say that the head be _ itna burra _ that be so big the other not to be outdo give rein to he imagination and add another foot the first immediately fancy discredit will attach to he veracity and vehemently assert that there must in that case have be two tiger and so they go on till they conclusively prove that two tiger there must have be and indeed if you let they go on they will soon assure you that besides the pair of tiger there must be at least a pair of half-grown cub they imagination be very fertile and you must take the information of a native as to tiger with a very large pinch of salt for successful tiger shooting much depend on the beating when after tiger general firing should on no account be allow and the line should move forward as silently as possible in light cover extend over a large area the elephant should be keep a considerable distance apart but in thick dense cover the line should be quite close and beat up slowly and thoroughly as a tiger may lay up and allow the line to pass he on no account should a elephant be let to lag behind and no one should be allow to rush forward or go in advance the elephant should move along steady and even like a move wall the fastest be on the flank and accommodate they pace to the general rate of progress no matter what tempting chance at pig or deer you may have you must on no account fire except at tiger the captain should be in the center and the man on the flank ought to be constantly on the _ qui vive _ to see that no cunning tiger outflank the line the attention should never wander from the jungle before you for at any moment a tiger may get up -- and i know of no sport where it be necessary to be so continuously on the alert every moment be fraught with intense excitement and when a tiger do really show he stripe before you the all-absorbing eager excitement of a lifetime be pack in a few brief moment not a chance should be throw away a long or even a uncertain shot be better than none and if you make one miss you may not have another chance again that day : for the tiger be chary of show he stripe and think discretion the better part of valor all the line of course be aware as a rule when a tiger be on the move and a good captain -lrb- and joe s who generally take the direction of we beat could not well be match -rrb- will wheel the line double turn march and countermarch and fairly run the tiger down at such a time although you may not actually see the tiger the excitement be tremendous you stand erect in the howdah you favorite gun ready you attendant behind be as excite as yourself and sway from side to side to peer into the gloomy depths of the jungle in front the mahout wriggle on he seat as if by he motion he could urge the elephant to a quicker advance he dig he toe savagely into he elephant behind the ear the line be close up every eye be fix on the move jungle ahead the roaring of the flame behind and the crash of the dry reed as the elephant force they ponderous frame through the intertwisted stem and foliage be the only sound that greet the ear suddenly you see the tawny yellow hide as the tiger slouch along you gun ring out a reverberate challenge as you fatal bullet speed on its errand to right and leave the echo ring as shoot after shot be fire at the bound robber then the line close up and you form a circle round the stricken beast and watch he mighty limb quiver in the death-agony and as he fall over dead and powerless for further harm you raise the heartfelt pulse-stirring cheer that find a echo in every brother sportman 's heart dispute sometimes arise as to whose bullet first draw blood these be settle by the captain and from he decision there be no appeal many sportsman put peculiar mark on they bullet by which they can be recognize which be a good plan in a exciting scrimmage every one blaze at the tiger not one bullet perhaps in five or six take effect and every one be ready to claim the skin as have be pierce with he particular bullet dispute be not very common but a inspection of the wound and the bullet find in the body generally settle the question after hear all the pro and con the captain generally succeed in award the tiger to the right man after a successful day the news rapidly spread through the adjacent country and we may take the line a little out of we way to make a sort of triumphal procession through the village on reach the camp there be sure to be a great crowd wait to see the slay tiger the despoiler of the people 's flock and herd it be then you hear of all the depredation the dead robber have commit and it be then you begin to form some faint conception of he enormous destructive power villager after villager unfold a tale of some favorite heifer or buffalo or cow have be strike down and the copious vocabulary of hindostanee billingsgate be almost exhaust and flood of abuse pour out on the prostrate head on cut open the tiger parasite be frequently find in the flesh these be long white thread-like worm and be suppose by some to be guinea worm huge mass of undigested bone and hair be sometimes take from the intestine shew that the tiger do not waste much time on mastication but tear and eat the flesh in large mass the liver be find to have number of separate lobe and the native say that this be a infallible test of the age of a tiger as a separate lobe form on the liver for each year of the tiger 's life i have certainly find young tiger have but two and three lobe and old tiger i have find with six seven and even eight but the statement be entirely unsupported by careful observation and require authentication before it can be accept a report kill be a pretty certain sign that there be tiger in the jungle but there be other sign with which one soon get familiar when for example you hear deer call repeatedly and see they constantly on the move it be a sign that tiger be in the neighborhood when cattle be reluctant to enter the jungle restless and unwilling to graze you may be sure tiger be somewhere about not far away a kill be often know by the number of vulture that hover about in long sailing steady circle what multitude of vulture there be overhead far up in the liquid ether you see they circle round and round like dim speck in the distance farther and farther away till they seem like bee then lessen and fade into the infinitude of space no part of the sky be ever free from they presence when a kill have be perceive you see one come fly along strong and swift in headlong flight with the directness of a thunderbolt he speed to where he loathsome meal lie swelter in the noonday sun as he come nearer and nearer he repulsive look body assume form and substance the cruel ugly bald head draw close in between the strong pointed shoulder the broad powerful wing with they wide sweep measure and slow bear he swiftly past with a curve and a sweep he circle round down come the long bony leg the bald and hideous neck be extend and with talon quiver for the rot flesh and cruel beak agape he hurry on to he repast the embodiment of everything ghoul-like and ghastly in he wake come another then two and three anon ten and twenty till hundred have collect and the ground be cover with the hissing tear fiercely claw crowd it be a horrible sight to see a heap of vulture battle over a dead bullock i have see they so pile up that the under one be nearly smother to death and the writhe contortion of the long bare neck as the fierce brute battle with talon and claw be like the twist of monster snake or the furious writhe of gorgon and fury over some fate victim it have be a much debate point with sportsman and naturalist whether the eye or the sense of smell guide the vulture to he feast of carrion i have often watch they they scan the vast surface spread below they with a pierce and never tiring gaze they observe each other when one be see to cease he steady circling flight far up in mid air and to stretch he broad wing earthwards the other know that he have espy a meal and follow he lead and these in turn be follow by other till from all quarter flock crowd of these scavenger of the sky they can detect a dog or jackal from a vast height and they know by intuition that where the carcase be there will the dog and jackal be gather i think there can be no doubt that the vision be the sense they be most indebted to for direct they to they food on one occasion i remember see a tumultuous heap of they battle fiercely as i have just try to describe over the carcase of two tiger we have kill near dumdaha the dead body be hide partially in a grove of tree and for a long time there be only some ten or a dozen vulture near these gorge themselves so fearfully that they could not rise from the ground but lay with wing expand look very aldermanic and apoplectic bye-and-bye however the rush begin and by the time we have strike the tent there could not have be fewer than 150 vulture hiss and spit at each other like angry cat trample each other to the dust to get at the carcase and tear wildly with talon and beak for a place in a very short time nothing but mangled bone remain a great number of the vulture get on to the rotten limb of a huge mango tree one other prove the last straw for down come the rotten branch and several of the vulture tear at each other fall heavily to the ground where they lay quite helpless as a experiment we shoot a miserable mangy pariah dog that be prowl about the ground seek garbage and offal he be shoot stone-dead and for a time no vulture venture near a crow be the first to begin the feast of death one of the hungriest of the vulture next approach and in a few minute the yet warm body of the poor dog be tear into a thousand fragment till nothing remain but scatter and

during a former hunt early in 1875 a military friend of mine be engage in inspect the boundary pillar near my factory between we territory and that of nepaul some of the pillar have be cut away by the river and the survey map require a little alteration in consequence we district magistrate be in attendance and send I a invitation to go up and spend a week with they in camp i have no need to send on tent as they have every requisite for comfort i send off my bed and bedding on geerdharee jha 's old elephant a timid useless brute fit neither far beat jungle nor for carry a howdah my horse i send on to the ghat or cross some ten mile up the river and after lunch i start it be a fine cool afternoon and it be not long ere i reach the neighbouring factory of im -lrb- = a -rrb- mnugger here i have a little refreshment with old tom and after exchange greeting i resume my way over a part of the country with which i be totally unacquainted i ride on past village nestle in the mango grove past huge tank excavate by the busy labor of generation long since depart past decaying temple overshadow by mighty tamarind tree with the _ peepul _ and _ pakur _ insinuate they twining root amid the shatter and crumble masonry in one large village i pass through the bustling bazaar where the din and dust and mingled odour be almost overpower the country be now assume quite a undulating character the bank of the creek be steep and rugged and in some case the water actually tumble from rock to rock with a purling pleasant ripple and plash a welcome sound to a scotch ear and a pleasant surprise after the dull dead leaden noiseless flow of the stream further down on the plain far in front lay the gloomy belt of teraus or border forest here call the _ morung _ where the british territory have they extreme limit in that direction behind this belt tier on tier rise the mighty range of the majestic himalaya tower up in solemn grandeur from the bushy mass of forest-clad hill till they snow-capped summit seem to pierce the sky the country be cover by green crop with here and there patch of dingy rice-stubble and a occasional stretch of dense grass jungle quail partridge and plover rise from the ground in covey as my horse canter through and a occasional peafowl or florican scud across the track as i ambled onward i ask at a wretched little accumulation of weaver ' hut where the ghat be and if my elephant have go on to both my query i receive satisfactory reply and as the day be now draw in i push my nag into a sharp canter and hurry forward i soon perceive the bulky outline of my elephant ahead and on come up find that my man have come too far up the river have miss the ghat to which i have send my spare horse and be now make for another ferry still higher up my horse be jade so i get on the elephant and make one of the peon lead the horse behind it be rapidly get dark and the mahout or elephant driver a miserable low caste stupid fellow evidently know nothing of the country and be go at random i halt at the next village get hold of the chowkeydar and by a promise of backsheesh prevail on he to accompany we and show we the way we turn off from the direct northerly direction in which we have be go and make straight for the river which we could see in the distance look chill and gray in the fast fading twilight we now get on the sandbank and have to go cautiously for fear of quicksand by the time we reach the ghat it be quite dark and grow very cold we be quite close to the hill a heavy dew be fall and i find that i should have to float down the liver for a mile and then pole up stream in another channel for two mile before i could reach camp i get my horse into the boat order the elephant driver to travel all night if he could as i should expect my thing to be at camp early in the morning and the boatman push off the unwieldy ferry-boat float we quietly down the rapid ` drumly ' stream all be solemnly still and silent on a indian river at night the stream be swift but noiseless vast plain and heap of sand stretch for mile on either bank there be no village near the stream faintly far away in the distance you hear a few subdue sound the only evidence of human habitation there be the tinkle of a cow-bell the bark of a pariah dog the monotonous dub-a-dub-dub of a timber-toned tom-tom muffle and slightly mellow by the distance the faint far cry and occasional halloo of the herd-boy call to each other gradually cease but the monotonous dub-a-dub-dub continue till far into the night it be now very cold and i be glad to borrow a blanket from my peon at such a time the pipe be a great solace it soothe the whole system and plunge one into a agreeable dreamy speculative mood through which all sort of fantastic notion resolve fancy chase each other quickly and old memory rise bitter or sweet but all tinge and tint by the seductive influence of the magic weed hail bless pipe the invigorator of the weary the uncomplaining faithful friend the consoler of sorrow and the dispeller of care the much-prized companion of the solitary wayfarer now a jackal utter a howl on the bank as we boat shoot past and the diabolical noise be echo from knoll to knoll and from ridge to ridge as these incarnate devil of the night join in and prolong the infernal chorus a occasional splash as a piece of the bank topple over into the stream rouse the cormorant and gull from they placid dozing on the sandbank they squeak and gurgle out a unintelligible protest then cosily settle they head again beneath the shelter wing and sleep the slumber of the dreamless a sharp sudden plump or a lazy surge sound accompany by a wheezy blow sort of hiss tell we that a _ seelun _ be disport himself or that a fat old ` porpus ' be bear he clumsy bulk through the rush current the bank now loom out dark and mysterious and as we turn the point another long stretch of the river open out reflect the merry twinkle of the myriad star that glitter sharp and clear million of mile overhead there be now a clattering of bamboo pole with a grunt of disgust and a quick catch of the breath as the cold water rush up against he thigh one of the boatman splash overboard and they commence slowly and wearily push the boat up stream we touch the bank a dozen time the current swoop down and turn we round and round the man have to put they shoulder under the gunwale and heave and strain with all they might the long bamboo pole be plunge into the dark depths of the river and the man puff and grunt and blow as they bend almost to the bottom of the boat while they push it be a weary progress we be drip wet with dew quite close on the bank we hear the hoarse wail call of a tigress the call of the tiger come echo down between the bank the man cease poling i peer forward into the obscurity my syce pat and speak soothingly to the tremble horse while my peon with excited finger fumble at the strap of my gun-case for a moment all be intensely still i whisper to the boatman to push out a little into the stream again the tigress call this time so close to we that we could almost fancy we could feel she breath my gun be ready the syce hold the horse firmly by the head and as we leave the bank we can distinctly see the outline of some large animal stand out a dark bulky mass against the skyline i take a steady aim and fire a roar of astonishment wrath and pain follow the report the horse struggle and snort the boatman call out ` oh my father ' and ejaculate ` hi-hi-hi ' in tone of pile up anguish and apprehension the peon cry exultantly ` wah wah khodawund lug gea ' that bullet have tell oh you highness and while the boat rock violently to and fro i abuse the boatman slang the syce and rush to grasp a pole while the peon seize another for we be drift rapidly down stream and may at any moment strike on a bank and topple over we can hear by the growling and commotion on the bank that my bullet have indeed tell and that something be hit we soon get the frightened boatman quiet down and after another hour 's weary work we spy the white outline of the tent above the bank a lamp shine out a bright welcome and although it be nearly twelve at night the captain and the magistrate be discuss hot toddy and wait my arrival my spare horse have come on from the ghat the syce have tell they i be come and they have be indulge in all sort of speculation over my non-arrival a good supper and a reek jorum soon banish all recollection of my weary journey and man be order to go out at first break of dawn and see about the wound tiger in the morning i be gratify beyond expression to find a fine tigress measure 8 foot 3 inch have be bring in the result of my lucky night shoot the mark of a large tiger be find about the spot and we determine to beat up for he and if possible secure he skin as we already have that of he consort captain s have some work to finish and my elephant and bearer have not arrive so we magistrate and myself walk down to the sandbank and amuse ourselves for a hour shooting sandpiper and plover we also shoot a pair of mallard and a couple of teal and then go back to the tent and be soon busily discuss a hunter 's breakfast while at we meal my elephant and thing arrive and just then also the ` major capt -lrb- = a -rrb- n ' or nepaulese functionary my old friend come up with eight elephant and we hurry out to greet the fat merry-featured old man what a quaint genial old customer he look as he bow and salaam to we from he elevated seat he face beam and he little bead-like eye twinkle with pleasure he be full of a adventure he have as he come along after cross a brawl mountain-torrent some mile from we camp they enter some dense kair jungle the kair be i believe a species of mimosa it be a hard wood grow in a thick scrubby form with small pointed leave a yellowish sort of flower and sharp thorn stud its branch it be a favorite resort for pig and although it be difficult to beat on account of the thorn tiger be not unfrequently find among the gloomy recess of a good kair scrub as they enter this jungle some of the man be loitering behind when the elephant have pass about halfway through the man come rush up pell mell with consternation on they face report that a huge tiger have spring out on they and carry off one of they number the major and the elephant hurry back and meet the man limp along bleed from several scratch and with a nasty bite in he shoulder but otherwise more frightened than hurt the tiger have simply knock he down stand over he for a minute seize he by the shoulder and then dash on through the scrub leave he behind half dead with pain and fear it be most amusing to hear the fat little major relate the story he go through all the by-play incident to the piece and as he get excited stand right up on he narrow pad he gesticulation be most vehement and as the elephant be rather unsteady and he footing to say the least precarious he seem every moment as if he must topple over the old warrior however be equal to the occasion without for a instant abate the vigor of he narrative he would clutch at the greasy matted lock of he mahout and steady himself while he volubly describe incident after incident as he warm with he subject and try to shew we how the tiger must have pounce on the man he would let go and use he hand in illustration the old elephant would give another heave and the fat little man would make another frantic grab at the patient mahout 's hair the whole scene be most comical and we be in convulsion of laughter the news however forebode ample sport we now have certain _ khubber _ of at least two tiger we be soon under weigh the wounded man have be send back to the major 's head-quarter on a elephant and in time recover completely from he mauling as we jog along we have a most interesting talk with the major capt -lrb- = a -rrb- n he be wonderfully well inform consider he have never be out of nepaul he know all about england we army we mode of government we parliament and we queen whenever he allude to she majesty he salaam profoundly whether as a tribute of respect to she or in compliment to we as loyal subject we could not quite make out he describe to we the route home by the suez canal and the fun of he talk be much heighten by he apply the native name to everything london be _ shuhur _ the word meaning ' a city ' and he tell we it be build on the _ tham -lrb- = a -rrb- ss nuddee _ by which he mean the thame river we magistrate have a jemadar of peon with he a sort of head man among the servant this man abundantly bedecked with ear-rings finger-ring and other ornament be a useless bullying sort of fellow dress to the full extent of oriental foppishness and because he be the magistrate 's servant he think himself entitle to order the other servant about in the most lordly way he be now make himself peculiarly officious shout to the driver to go here and there to do this and do that and indulge in copious torrent of abuse without which it seem impossible for a native subordinate to give direction on any subject we be all rather amuse and could not help burst into laughter as inflate with a sense of he own importance he begin abuse one of the native driver of the nepaulee chief this man do not submit tamely to he insolence to he the magistrate be nobody and the pompous jemadar a perfect nonentity he accordingly turn round and pour forth a perfect flood of invective never be collapse more utter the jemadar take a back seat at once and no more that day do we hear he melodious voice in tone of imperious command the old major chuckle and rub he fat little hand and lean over to I say ` at home a lion but abroad a lamb ' for surround by he woman at home the man would twirl he moustache look fierce and fancy himself a very tiger but no sooner do he go abroad and mix with man as good if not better than himself than he be ready to eat any amount of humble pie we determine first of all to beat for the tiger whose track have be see near where i have fire my lucky shot the precede night a strong west wind be blow and dense cloud of sand be be sweep athwart we line from the vast plain of fine white sand border the river for mile as we go along we fire the jungle in we rear and the strong wind carry the flame rage and roar through the dense jungle with amazing fury one elephant get so frightened at the noise behind he that he fairly bolt for the river and could not be persuade back into the line disturb by the fire we see numerous deer and pig but be after tiger we refrain from shooting at they the basinattea tuppoo which be the scene of we present hunt be famous jungle and many a tiger have be shoot there by the purneah club in bygone day the annual ravages of the impetuous river have however much change the face of the country vast tract of jungle have be obliterate by deposit of sand from its annual incursion great skeleton of tree stand everywhere stretch out bare and unsightly branch all bend to the south shew the mighty power of the current when it make its annual progress of devastation over the surrounding country now however it be like a thin streak of silver flash back the fierce ray of the meridian sun through the blind cloud of fine white sand we could at time during a temporary lull see its ruin surface and we be glad when we come on the track of the tiger which lead straight from the stream in the direction of some thick tree jungle at no great distance we gladly turn we back to the furious cloud of dust and gust of scorching wind and lead by a nepaulee tracker be soon crash heavily through the jungle when hunting with elephant the nepaulese beat in a dense line the head of the elephant touch each other in this manner we be now proceed when s call out ` there go the tiger ' we look up and see a very large tiger make off for a deep watercourse which run through the jungle some 200 yard ahead of the line we hurry up as fast as we could put out a fast elephant on either flank to see that the cunning brute do not sneak either up or down the nullah under cover of the high bank this however be not he object we see he descend into the nullah and almost immediately top the further bank and disappear into the jungle beyond press on at a rapid jolting trot we dash after he in hot pursuit the jungle seem somewhat lighter on ahead in the distance we could see some dangur at work break up land and to the right be a small collection of hut with a beautiful riband of green crop a perfect oasis in the wilderness of sand and parch up grass form into line we press on the tiger be evidently lie up probably deter from break across the open by the sight of the dangur at work my heart be bound with excitement we be all intensely eager and think no more of the hot wind and blinding dust just then captain s see the brute sneak along to the left of the line try to outflank we and break back he fire two shot rapidly with he express and the second one take effect in the neck of the tiger bowl he over as he stand he be a mangy-looking brute badly marked and measure eight foot eleven inch he do not have a chance of charge and probably have little heart for a fight we soon have he pad and then proceed straight north to the scene of the major 's encounter with the tiger in the morning the jungle be well trample down there be numerous stream and pool of water occasional clump of bamboo and abrupt ridgy undulation it be the very jungle for tiger and elate by we success in have bag one already we be all in high spirit the line of fire we could see far in the distance sweep on like the march of fate and we could have shoot numerous deer but reserve we fire for nobler game it be get well on in the afternoon when we come up to the kair jungle we beat right up to where the man have be seize and could see the mark of the struggle distinctly enough we beat right through the jungle with no result and as it be now get rather late the old major signify he desire to bid we good evening as this mean deprive we of eight elephant we prevail on he to try one spare straggle corner that we have not go through he laugh the idea to scorn of get a tiger there say there be no cover one elephant however be send while we be talk we elephant be all standing in a group and the mahout on he solitary elephant be listlessly jogging on in a purposeless and desultory manner when we suddenly hear the elephant pipe out a shrill note of alarm and the mahout yell ` bagh bagh ' tiger tiger the captain be again the lucky man the tiger a much finer and stronger build animal than the one we have already kill be stand not eighty pace off shew he tooth he bristle erect and evidently in a bad temper he have be crouch among some low bush and see the elephant bearing directly down on he he no doubt imagine he retreat have be discover at all event there he be and he present a splendid aim he be a noble-looking specimen as he stand there grim and defiant captain s take aim and lodge a express bullet in he chest it make a fearful wound and the ferocious brute writhe and roll about in agony we quickly surround he and a bullet behind the ear from my no 16 put a end to he misery the old major now bid we good evening and after pad the second tiger and much elated at we success we begin to beat homewards shoot at everything that rise before we a couple of tremendous pig get up before I and dash through a clear stream that be purl peacefully in its pebbly bed as the boar be rush up the farther bank i deposit a pellet in he hind quarter he give a angry grunt and totter on but presently pull up and seem determine to have some revenge for he hurt as my elephant come up the bank the gallant boar try to charge but already wound and weak from loss of blood he totter and stagger about my elephant would not face he so i give he another shot behind the shoulder and pad he for the _ moosahur _ and sweeper in camp just then one of the policeman start a young hog-deer and several of the man get down and try to catch the little thing alive they soon succeed and the cry of the poor little _ butcha _ that be ` young one ' be most plaintive the wind have now subside there be a red angry glare as the level ray of the setting sun shimmer through the dense cloud of dust that load the atmosphere it be like the dull red coppery hue which presage a storm the vast morung jungle lay behind we and beyond that the swell wooded hill begin to show dark and indistinct against the gathering gloom a long line of cattle be wend they way homeward to the batan and the tinkle of the big copper bell fall pleasingly on we ear in the distance we could see the white canvas of the tent gleam in the ray of the setting sun a vast circular line of smoulder fire flickering and flare fitfully and surmount by huge volume of curl smoke shew the remains of the fierce tornado of flame that have rage at noon when we light the jungle the jungle be very light and much trodden down we three howdah elephant be not far apart and we be chat cheerfully together and discuss the incident of the day my bearer be sit behind I in the back of the howdah and i have take out my ball cartridge from my no 12 breechloader and have replace they with shot just then my mahout raise he hand and in a hoarse excited whisper call out ` look sahib a large tiger ' ` where ' we all exclaim get excite at once he point in front to a large object look for all the world like a huge dun cow ` why you fool that be a bullock ' i exclaimed my bearer who have also be intently gaze now say ` no sahib that be a tiger and a large one ' at that moment it turn partly round and i at once see that the man be right and that it be a veritable tiger and seemingly a monster in size i at once call to captain s and the magistrate who have by this time fall a little behind ` look out you fellow here be a tiger in front ' at first they think i be joke but a glance confirm the truth of what i have say when i first see the brute he be evidently sneak after the cattle and be about sixty pace from I he be so intent on watch the herd that he have not notice we approach he be now however evidently alarmed and make off by the time i call out he must have be over eighty yard away i have my no 12 in my hand load with shot it be no use i put it down and take up my no 16 this occupy a few seconds i fire both barrel the first bullet be in excellent line but rather short the second go over the animal 's back and neither touch he it make he however quicken he retreat and when captain s fire he must have be fully one hundred and fifty yard away as it be now somewhat dusky he also miss he fire another long shot with he rifle but miss again oh that unlucky change of cartridge in my no 12 but for that -- but there -- we be always wise after the event we never expect to see a tiger in such open country especially as we have be over the same ground before firing pretty often as we come along we follow up of course but it be now fast get dark and though we beat about for some time we could not get another glimpse of the tiger he be seemingly a very large male dark-coloured and in splendid condition we must have get he have it be earlier as he could not have go far forward for the line of fire be beyond he and we have he between the fire and the elephant we get home about 630 rather disappoint at miss such a glorious prize so true be it that a sportsman 's soul be never satisfied but we have rare and most unlooked-for luck and we feel considerably better after a good dinner and indulge in hope of get the big fellow next morning in the same jungle some year ago a very sad accident occur a party be out tiger-shooting and during one of the beat a cowherd hear the noise of the advance elephant crouch behind a bush and cover himself with he blanket at a distance he look exactly like a pig and one of the shooter mistake he for one he fire and hit the poor herd in the hip as soon as the mistake be perceive everything be do for the poor fellow he wound be dress as well as they could do it and he be send off to the doctor in a dhoolie a a sort of covered litter sling on a pole and carry on man 's shoulder it be too late the poor coolie die on the road from shock and loss of blood such mistake occur very seldom and this be such a natural one that no one could blame the unfortunate sportsman and certainly no one feel keener regret than he do the coolie 's family be amply provide for which be all that remain to be do this be the only instance i know where fatal result have follow such a accident i have know several case of beater pepper with shot generally from they own carelessness and disregard of order but a salve in the shape of a few rupee have generally prove the most effective ointment i have know some rascal say they be sorry they have not be lucky enough to be wound as they consider a punctured cuticle nothing to set against the magnificent douceur of four or five rupee one impetuous scamp be tell not to go in front of the line during a beat near burgamma reply to the warning caution of he jemadar ` oh never mind if get shoot i will get backsheesh ' whether this be a compliment to the efficacy of we treatment -lrb- by the silver ointment -rrb- or to the inaccuracy and harmlessness of we shooting i leave the reader to judge we bag during this lucky day include the tigress kill by my shot on the river bank be as follow : three tiger one boar four deer include the young one take alive eight sandpiper nine plover two mallard and two teal chapter xxiii we resume the beat -- the hog-deer -- nepaulese village -- village granary -- tiger in front -- a hit a hit -- follow up the wound tiger -- find he dead -- tiffin in the village -- the patair jungle -- search for tiger -- go away -- a elephant steeplechase in pursuit -- exciting chase -- the morung jungle -- magnificent scenery -- skin the tiger -- incident of tiger hunting next morning both the magistrate and myself feel very ill headachy and sick with violent vomiting and retch captain s attribute it to the fierce hot wind and exposure of the precede day but we the sufferer blame the _ dekchee _ or cooking pot these _ dekchee _ be generally make of copper coated or tin over with white metal once a month or oftener if the tinning be omit or the copper become expose by accident or neglect the food cook in the pot sometimes get taint with copper and produce nausea and sickness in those who eat it i have know within my own experience case of copper poisoning that have terminate fatally it be well always thoroughly to inspect the kitchen utensil particularly when in camp unless carefully watch and closely supervised servant get very careless and let food remain in these copper vessel this be always dangerous and should never be allow in consequence of we indisposition we do not start till the forenoon be far advance and the hot west wind have again begin to sweep over the prairie-like stretch of sand and withered grass we commence beat up by the batan or cattle stance near which we have see the big tiger the precede evening s however become so sick and giddy that he have to return to camp and captain s and i continue the beat alone have go over the same ground only yesterday we do not expect a tiger so near to camp more especially as the fire have make fearful havoc with the tall grass hog-deer be very numerous they be not as a rule easily disturb they be of a reddish brown color not unlike that of the scotch red deer and rush through the jungle when alarm with a succession of bound leap they make very pretty shooting and when young afford tender and well-flavoured venison one hint i may give when you shoot a buck see that he be at once denude of certain appendage else the flesh will get rank and disagreeable to eat the buck have pretty antler but be not very noble look the do be somewhat lighter in color and do not seem to consort together in herd like antelope there be rarely more than five in a group though i have certainly see more on several occasion this morning we be unlucky with we deer i shoot three and captain s shoot at and wound three not one of which however do we bag this part of the country be exclusively inhabit by parbuttea the native name for nepaulese settle in british territory over the frontier line the village be call pahareea signify mountaineer or hillman from pahar a mountain we beat up to a parbuttea village with its conical roofed hut man and woman be engage in plait long coil of rice straw into cable look rope a few split bamboo be fasten into the ground in a circle and these rope be then coil round in and out between the stake this make a huge circular vat-shaped repository open at both end it be then lift up and put on a platform coat with mud and protect from rat and vermin by the pillar be place on smooth inverted earthen pot the coil of straw be now plaster outside and in with a mixture of mud chaff and cowdung and allow to dry when dry the hut be fill with grain and securely roof and thatch this form the invariable village granary and look at a distance not unlike a stack or rick of corn round a farm at home by the abundance of these granary in a village one can tell at a glance whether the season have be a good one and whether the frugal inhabitant of the clustering little hamlet be in pretty comfortable circumstance if they be under the sway of a grasp and unscrupulous landlord they not unfrequently bury they grain in clay-lined chamber in the earth and have always enough for current want store up in the sun-baked clay repository mention in a former chapter beyond the village we enter some thick patair jungle its greenness be refresh after the burn up and withered grass jungle we be now in a hollow border the stream and somewhat protect from the scorching wind and the stinging cloud of fine sand and red dust the brook look so cool and refreshing and the water so clear and pellucid that i be about to dismount to take a drink and lave my heated head and face when a low whistle to my right make I look in that direction and i see the captain wave he hand excitedly and point ahead he be higher up the bank than i be and in very dense patair a ridge run between he front of the line and mine so that i could only see he howdah and the bulk of the elephant 's body be conceal from I by the grass on this ridge i close up diagonally across the ridge s still wave to I to hurry up as i top it i spy a large tiger slouch along in the hollow immediately below I he see I at the same instant and bound on in front of s he express be at he shoulder on the instant he fire and a tremendous spurt of blood shew a hit a hit a palpable hit the tiger be nowhere visible and not a cry or a motion could we hear or see to give we any clue to the whereabouts of the wound animal we follow up however quickly but cautiously expect every instant a furious charge we must have go at least a hundred yard when right in front of I i descry the tiger crouch down its head rest on its fore paw and to all appearance settle for a spring it be about twenty yard from I and take a rather hasty aim i quickly fire both barrel straight at the head i could only see the head and paw but these i see quite distinctly my elephant be very unsteady and both my bullet go within a inch of the tiger 's head but fortunately miss completely i say fortunately for find the brute still remain quite motionless we cautiously approach and find it be stone dead the perfect naturalness of the position however might well have deceive a more experienced sportsman the beast be lie crouch on all fours as if in the very act of prepare to spring the one bullet have kill it the wound be in the lung and the internal bleeding have suffocate it but here be a wonderful instance of the tiger 's tenacity of life even when sorely wound for it have travel over a hundred and thirty yard after s have shoot it it be lucky i miss for my bullet would have spoil the skull she be a very handsome finely marked tigress a large specimen for on apply the tape we find she measure exactly nine foot before descend to measure she we be join by the old major capt -lrb- = a -rrb- n whose elephant we have for some time descry in the distance he congratulation be profuse and no doubt sincere and after pad the tigress we hie to the welcome shelter of one of the village house where we discuss a hearty and substantial tiffin during tiffin we be surround by a bevy of really fair and buxom lass they wear petticoat of striped blue cloth and have they arm and shoulder bare and they ear load with silver ornament they be merry laughing comely damsel with none of the exaggerated shyness and affect prudery of the woman of the plain we be offer plantain milk and chupatty and a old patriarch come out lean on he staff to revile and abuse the tigress from some of the young man we hear of a fresh kill to the north of the village and after tiffin we proceed in that direction follow up the course of the limpid stream whose gurgling ripple sound so pleasantly in we ear far ahead to the right and on the further bank of the stream we could see dense curl volume of smoke and leap pyramid of flame where a jungle fire be rage in some thick acacia scrub as we get nearer the heat become excessive and the flame fan into tremendous fury by the fierce west wind tear through the dry thorny bush we elephant be quite unsteady and do not like face the fire we make a slight detour and soon have the roar wall of flame behind we we be now enter on a moist circular basin-shaped hollow among the patair root be the recent mark of great number of wild pig where they have be forage among the stiff clay for these esculent the patair be like a huge bulrush and the elephant be very fond of its succulent juicy cool-looking leaf those in we line keep tear up huge tuft of it thrash out the mud and dirt from the root against they foreleg and with a grunt of satisfaction make it slowly disappear in they cavernous mouth there be considerable noise and the jungle be nearly as high as the howdah present the appearance of a impenetrable screen of vivid green we beat and rebeat across and across but there be no sign of the tiger the bank of the nullah be very steep rotten look and dangerous we have about eighteen elephant namely ten of we own and eight belong to the nepaulese we be beat very close the elephant ' head almost touch this be the way they always beat in nepaul we think we have leave not a spot in the basin untouched and captain s be quite satisfied that there could be no tiger there it be a splendid jungle for cover so thick dense and cool i be beat along the edge of the creek which run deep and silent between the gloomy sedge-covered bank in a placid little pool i see a couple of widgeon all unconscious of danger they glossy plumage reflect in the clear water i call to captain s ` we be sell this time captain there be no tiger here ' ' i be afraid not ' he answer ` shall i bag those two widgeon ' i ask ` all right ' be the response put in shot cartridge i shot both the widgeon but we be all astounded to see the tiger we have so carefully and perseveringly search for bind out of a crevice in the bank almost right under my elephant off he go with a smother roar that set we elephant hurry backwards and forwards there be a commotion along the whole line the jungle be too dense for we to see anything it be one more proof how these hill tiger will lie close even in the midst of a line s call out to I to remain quiet and see if we could trace the tiger 's progress by any rustling in the cover look down we see the kill close to the edge of the water a fast elephant be send on ahead to try and ascertain whether the tiger be likely to break beyond the circle of the little basin-shaped valley we gather round the kill it be quite fresh a young buffalo the major tell we that in he experience a male tiger always begin on the neck first a female always at the hind quarter a few mouthful only have be eat and accord to the major it must have be a tigress as the part devour be from the hind quarter while we be talk over these thing a frenzied shout from the driver of we naka elephant cause we to look in he direction he be gesticulate wildly and bawl at the top of he voice ` come come quickly sahib the tiger be run away ' now commence such a mad and hurry scramble as i have never witness before or since from the back of a elephant as we tear through the tangled dense green patair the broad leave crackle like crash branch the huge elephant surge ahead like ship rock in a gale of wind and the mahout and attendant on the pad elephant shout and urge on they shuffling animal by excited cry and resounding whack in the retinue of the major be several man with elephant spear or goad these consist of a long pliant polished bamboo with a sharp spike at the end which they call a _ jhetha _ these man now come hurry round the ridge among the opener grass and as we emerge from the heavy cover they begin goad the elephant behind and urge they to they most furious pace on ahead nearly a quarter of a mile away we could see a huge tiger make off for the distant morung at a rapid sling trot he lithe body shone before we and urge we to the most desperate effort it be almost a bare plateau there be scarcely any cover only here and there a few stunt acacia bush the dense forest be two or three mile ahead but there be several nasty steep bank and precipitous gully with deep water rush between attach to each nepaulee pad by a stout curiously-plaited cord ornament with fancy knot and tassel of silk be a small pestle-shaped instrument not unlike a auctioneer 's hammer it be quaintly carve and stud with short blunt shine brass nail or spike i have notice these hang down from the pad and have often wonder what they be for i be now to see they use while the mahout in front rain a shower of blow on the elephant head and the spear-men prick he up from behind with they jhetha the occupant of the pad turn round with he face to the tail belabour the poor hathee with the auctioneer 's hammer the blow rattle on the elephant 's rump the brute trumpet with pain but they _ do _ put on the pace and travel as i never imagine a elephant _ could _ travel past bush and brake down precipitous ravine over the stone through the thorny scrub dash down a steep bank here plunge madly through a deep stream there we shuffle along we must have be go fully seven mile a hour the pestle-shaped hammer be call a _ lohath _ and most unmercifully be they wield we be jostle and jolt till every bone ache again cloud of dust be drive before we reel wave line how the nepaulese shout and caper we be all mad with excitement i shout with the rest the fat little major kick he heel against the side of he elephant as if he be spur a derby winner to victory we usually sedate captain yell -- actually yell -- in a agony of excitement and try to execute a war dance of he own on the floor of he howdah we gun rattle the chain clank and jangle the howdah rock and pitch from side to side we make a desperate effort the poor elephant make a gallant race of it the foot man perspire and swear but it be not to be we striped friend have the best of the start and we gain not a inch upon he to we unspeakable mortification he reach the dense cover on ahead where we might as well have seek for a needle in a haystack never however shall i forget that mad headlong scramble fancy a elephant steeple-chase reader it be sublime but we ache for it next day the old major and he fleet race elephant now leave we and we jaded beast take we slowly back in the direction of we camp it be a fine wild view on which we be now gaze behind we the dark gloomy impenetrable morung the home of ever-abiding fever and ague behind that the countless multitude of hill swell here and recede there a jumbled heap of mighty peak and fret pinnacle with they glistening side and dark shadowless ravine they mighty scaur and they abrupt serrated edge show out clearly and boldly define against the evening sky far to the right the shine river -- a riband of burnish steel for its water be a deep steely blue -- roll its swift flood along amid shine sand-bank in front the vast undulating plain with grove and rill and smoking hamlet stretch at we foot in a lovely panorama of blended and harmonious color we be now high up above the plain and the scene be one of the finest i have ever witness in indium the wind have go down and the oblique ray of the sun light up the whole vast panorama with a lurid light which be heighten in effect by the dust-laden atmosphere and the volume of smoke from the now distant fire hedge in the far horizon with curtain of threaten grandeur and gloom that far away canopy of dust and smoke form a wonderful contrast to the shine snow-capped hill behind altogether it be a day to be remembered i have see no such strange and unearthly combination of shade and color in any landscape before or since on the way home we bag a florican and a very fine mallard and reach the camp utterly fag to find we worthy magistrate very much recover and glad to congratulate we on we have bag the tigress after a plunge in the river and a rare camp dinner -- such a meal as only a indian sportsman can procure -- we lay back in we cane chair and while the fragrant smoke from the mild manilla curl lovingly about the roof of the tent we discuss the day 's proceedings and fight we battle over again a rather animated discussion arise about the length of the tiger -- as to its frame merely and we wonder what difference the skin would make in the length of the animal as it be a point we have never hear moot before we determine to see for ourselves we accordingly go out into the beautiful moonlight and superintend the skinning of the tigress the skin be take off most artistically we have carefully measure the animal before skin she be exactly nine foot long we find the skin make a difference of only four inch the bare skeleton from tip of nose to extreme point of tail measure eight foot eight inch as a instance of tiger take to tree we worthy magistrate related that in rajmehal he and a friend have wound a tiger and subsequently lose he in the jungle in vain they search in every conceivable direction but could find no trace of he they be about give up in despair when s raise he hat happen to look up and there on a large bough directly overhead he see the wound tiger lie extend at full length some eighteen foot from the ground they be not long in leave the dangerous vicinity and it be not long either ere a well-directed shot bring the tiger down from he elevated perch these after-dinner story be not the least enjoyable part of a tiger-hunting party round the camp table in a snug well-lighted tent with all the ` material ' handy i have listen to many a tale of thrilling adventure s be full of reminiscence and have see a deal of tiger shooting in various part of indium he recollection be much appreciate to shew that the principal danger in tiger shooting be not from the tiger himself but from one 's elephant become panic-stricken and bolt he tell how a mr aubert a benare planter lose he life a tiger have be ` spine ' by a shot and the line gather round the prostrate monster to watch its death-struggle the elephant on which the unfortunate planter sit get demoralise and attempt to bolt the mahout endeavor to check its rush and in desperation the elephant charge straight down close past the tiger which lay writhe and roar under a huge overhang tree the elephant be rush directly under this tree and a large branch would have sweep howdah and everything it contain clean off the elephant 's back as easily as one would brush off a fly to save himself aubert make a leap for the branch the elephant forge madly ahead and the howdah be smash like match-wood fall on the tiger below who be tear and claw at everything within he reach poor aubert get hold of the branch with he hand and cling with all the desperation of one fight for he life he be right above the wound tiger but he grasp on the tree be not a firm one for a moment he hang suspend above the furious animal which mad with agony and fury be a picture of demoniac rage the poor fellow could hold no longer and fall right on the tiger it be nearly at its last gasp but it catch hold of aubert by the foot and in a final paroxysm of pain and rage chaw the foot clean off and the poor fellow die next day from the shock and loss of blood he be one of four brother who all meet untimely death from accident this one be kill by the tiger another be throw from a vehicle and kill on the spot the third be drown and the fourth shot by accident we bag to-day be one tiger one florican one mallard and two widgeon on cut the tiger open we find that the bullet have enter on the left side and as we suspect have enter the lung it have however make a terrible wound we find that it have penetrate the heart and liver go forward through the chest and smash the right shoulder notwithstanding this fearful wound shew the tremendous effect of the express bullet the tiger have go on for the distance i have mention after which it must have fall stone-dead it be a marvellous instance of vitality even after the heart liver and lung have be pierce the liver have six lobe and it be then i hear for the first time that with the native this be a infallible sign of the age of a tiger the old major firmly believe it and tell we it be quite a accept article of faith with all native sportsman fact subsequently come under my own observation which seem to give great probability to the theory but it be one on which i would not like to give a decide opinion till after hear the experience of other sportsman chapter xxiv camp of the nepaulee chief -- quicksand -- elephant cross river

beat due east setting fire to the jungle as we go along the roaring and crackling of the flame startle the elephant on which captain s be ride and go away across country at a furious pace it be with difficulty that it could be stop we cross the frontier line a short distance from camp and enter a dense jungle of thorny acacia with long dry grass almost choke the tree they be dry and stunt and when we drop a few light amongst such combustible material the fire be splendid beyond description how the flame surge through the withered grass we be force to pause and admire the magnificent sight the wall of flame tear along with inconceivable rapidity and the blind volume of smoke obscure the country for mile the jungle be full of deer and pig one fine buck come bound along past we line but i stop he with a single bullet through the neck he fall over with a tremendous crash and turn a complete somersault break off both he horn with the force of the fall we beat down a shallow sandy watercourse and could see the camp of the old major on the high bank beyond farther down the stream there be a small square fort the whitewashed wall of which flash back the ray of the sun and group round it be some ruinous look hut several snowy tent and a huge shamiana or canopy under which we could see a host of attendant spread carpet place chair and otherwise make ready for we the bank of the stream be very steep but the guide at length bring we to what seem a safe and fordable passage on the further side be a flat expanse of seemingly firm and dry sand but no sooner have we elephant begin to cross it than the whole sandbank for yard begin to rock and tremble the water well up over the footmark of the elephant and s call out to we fussun fussun quicksand quicksand we scatter the elephant and try to hurry they over the dangerous bit of ground with shout and cry of encouragement the poor animal seem thoroughly to appreciate the danger and shuffle forward as quickly as they could all get over in safety except the last three the treacherous sand render still more insecure by the heavy tread of so many ponderous animal now give way entirely and the three hapless elephant be leave flounder in the tenacious hold of the dreaded fussun two of the three be not far from the firm bank and manage to extricate themselves after a short struggle but the third have sink up to the shoulder and could scarcely move all hand immediately begin cut long grass and form it into bundle these be throw to the sink elephant he roll from side to side the sand quake and undulate round he in all direction at time he would roll over till nearly half he body be invisible some of the nepaulese venture near and manage to undo the harness-rope that be hold on the pad the sagacious brute fully understand he danger and the effort we be make for he assistance he manage to get several of the big bundle of grass under he foot and stand there look at we with a most pathetic plead expression and tremble as if with a ague from fear and exhaustion the old major come down to meet we and a crowd of he man add they effort to ours to help the unfortunate elephant we throw in bundle after bundle of grass till we have the yield sand cover with a thick passage of firmly bind fascine on which the hathee staggering and flounder painfully manage to reach firm land he be so completely exhaust that he could scarcely walk to the tent and we leave he there to the care of he attendant this be a very common episode in tiger hunting and do not always terminate so fortunately in run water the quicksand be not so dangerous as the force of the stream keep wash away the sand and do not allow it to settle round the leg of the elephant but on dry land a dry fussun as it be call be justly fear and many a valuable animal have be swallow up in its slow deadly tenacious grasp in cross sand the heaviest and slowest elephant should go first precede by a light nimble pioneer if the lead elephant show sign of sink the other should at once turn back and seek some safer place in all case the line should separate a little and not follow in each other 's footstep the indication of a quicksand be easily recognize if the surface of the sand begin to oscillate and undulate with a tremulous rock motion it be always wise to seek some other passage look back after elephant have pass you will often see what be a perfectly dry flat cover with several inch of water when water begin to ooze up in any quantity after a few elephant have pass it be much safer to make the remainder cross at some spot farther on in cross a deep swift river the elephant should enter the water in a line range up and down the river that be the line should be range along the bank and enter the water at right angle to the current and not in indian file the strongest elephant should be up stream as they help to break the force of the current for the weaker and smaller animal down below it be a fine sight to see some thirty or forty of these huge animal cross a deep and rapid river some be reluctant to strike out when they begin to enter the deepest channel and try to turn back the mahout and ` mate ' shout and belabor they with bamboo pole the trumpet of the elephant the wave of the trunk disport like huge water-snake in the perturb current the splashing of the bamboo the dark body of the native swim here and there round the animal the unwieldy boat pile high with how-dah and pad the whole heap surmount by a group of sportsman with they gleaming weapon and variegated puggree make up a picturesque and memorable sight some of the strong swimmer among the elephant seem to enjoy the whole affair immensely they dip they huge head entirely under the current the sun flash on the dark hide glisten with the drip water the enormous head emerge again slowly like some monstrous antediluvian creation and with a succession of these ponderous appearance and disappearance the mighty brute forge through the surging water when they reach a shallow part they pipe with pleasure and send volume of fluid splash against they heave flank scatter the spray all round in mimic rainbow at all time the koosee be a dangerous stream to cross but during the rain i have see the strongest and best swimming elephant take nearly a mile down stream and in many instance they have be drown they vast bulk and marvellous strength be quite unable to cope with the tremendous force of the rage water when we have get comfortably seat under the shamiana a crowd of attendant bring we basket of fruit and a very nice cold collation of various indian dish and curry we do ample justice to the old soldier 's hospitable offering and then betel-nut cardamum clove and other spice and paurus leaf be hand round on a silver salver beautifully emboss and carve with quaint device we light we cigar we beard and handkerchief be anoint with attar of rose and the old major then inform we that there be good khubber of tiger in the wood close by the tree be splendid specimen of forest growth enormously thick beautifully umbrageous and grow very close together there be a dense undergrowth of tangled creeper and the most lovely fern and tropical plant in the richest luxuriance and of every conceivable shade of amber and green it be a charming spot the patch of forest be separate from the unbroken line of morung jungle by a beautifully sheltered glade of several hundred acre and further break in three place by avenue-looking opening disclose peep of the black and gloomy-looking mass of impenetrable forest beyond in the first of these opening we be direct to take up a position while the pad elephant and a crowd of beater go to the edge of the patch of forest and begin beat up to we immense number of genuine jungle fowl be call in all direction and fly right across the opening in numerous covey they be beautifully mark with black and golden plume round the neck and i determine to shoot a few by and bye to send home to friend who i know would prize they as invaluable material in dress hook for fly-fishing the crash of the tree as the elephant force they way through the thick forest or tear off huge branch as they struggle amid the matted vegetation keep we all on the alert the first place be however a blank and we move on to the next we have not long to wait for a fierce din inside the jungle and the excited cry of the beater apprise we that game of some sort be afoot we be eagerly watch and speculate on the cause of the uproar when a very fine half-grown tiger cub spring out of some closely grow fern and dash across the narrow opening so quickly that ere we have time to raise a gun he have disappear in some heavy jhamun jungle on the further side of the path we hurry round as fast as we could to intercept he should he attempt to break on ahead and leave some man to rally the mahout and let they know that there be a tiger afoot we be soon in we place and ready to give the cub a warm reception should he again show he stripe it be not long ere he do so i spy he steal along the edge of the jungle evidently intend to make a rush back past the opening he have just cross and outflank the line of beater elephant i fire and hit he in the forearm he roll over roar with rage and then descry he assailant he bound into the open and as well as he wound would allow he come furiously down at the charge in less time however than it take to write it he have receive three bullet in he body and tumble down a lifeless heap we raise a cheer which bring the beater and elephant quickly to the spot in come through a thickly wood part of the forest with numerous long and pliant creeper intertwist into a confused tangle of rope-like ligament the old juddeah elephant tear down one of the long line and dislodge a angry army of venomous red ant on the occupant of the guddee or cushion seat on the elephant 's pad the ant prove formidable assailant there be two or three baboo or native gentleman hold on to the rope chew pan and enjoy the scene but the red ant be altogether more than they have bargain for recognize the baboo as the immediate cause of they disturbance they attack they with indomitable courage the mahout fairly yell with pain and one of the baboo smart from the fiery bite of the furious insect topple clean backwards into the undergrowth show a undignified pair of heel the other two dance on the guddee sweeping and thrash the air the cushion and they clothes with they cummerbund in the vain effort to free themselves of they angry assailant the guddee be literally cover with ant it look a animated red mass and the wretched baboo make frantic effort to shake themselves clear they be dreadfully bitten and reach the open they slide off the elephant and even on the ground continue they saltatory antic before finally get rid of they ferocious assailant in forest shooting the red ant be one of the most dreaded pest of the jungle if a colony get dislodge from some overhang branch and be land in you howdah the best plan be to evacuate you stronghold as quickly as you can and let the attendant clear away the invader they bite be very painful and they take such tenacious hold that rather than quit they grip they allow themselves to be decapitate and leave they head and formidable forceps stick in you flesh other dreaded foe in the forest jungle be the bhowra or ground bee which be more properly a kind of hornet if by evil chance you elephant should tread on they mound-like nest instantly a angry swarm of venomous and enraged hornet come buzz about you ear you only chance be to squat down and envelope yourself completely in a blanket old sportsman shoot in forest jungle invariably take a blanket avith they in the howdah to ensure themselves protection in the event of a attack by these blood-thirsty creature the thick matted creeper too be a great nuisance for which a bill-hook or sharp kookree be a invaluable adjunct to the other paraphernalia of the march i have see a mahout sweep clean off the elephant 's back by these tenacious creeper and the elephant themselves be sometimes unable to break through the tangle of sinewy lithe cord which drape the huge forest tree hang in slender festoon from every branch some of they be prickly and as the elephant slowly force he way through the mass of pendent sway cord they lacerate and tear the mahout 's clothes and skin and appropriate he puggree as you crouch down within the shelter of you howdah you can not help pity the poor wretch and incline to think that after all shooting in grass jungle have fewer drawback and be preferable to forest shooting one of the driver report that he have see a bear in the jungle and we see the earth of one not far from where the young tiger have fall it be the lair of the sloth bear or _ ursus labiali _ so call from he long pendent upper lip he spoor be very easily distinguish from that of any other animal the ball of the foot show a distinct round impression and about a inch to a inch and a half further on the impression of the long curved claw be see he use these long-curved claw to tear up ant hill and open hollow decay tree to get at the honey within of which he be very fond we go after the bear and be not long in discover he whereabouts and a well-directed shot from s add he to we bag the best bear shooting in indium perhaps be in chota nagpoor but this do not come within the limit of my present volume we now beat slowly through the wood keep a bright look out for ant and hornet and get fine shooting at the numerous jungle fowl which fly about in amazing number the forest tree in this patch of jungle be very fine the hill seeree with its feathery foliage and delicate cluster of white bugle-shaped blossom the semul or cotton tree with its wonderful wealth of magnificent crimson flower the birch-looking sheeshum or sissod the sombre look sal the shine leathery-leafed bhur with its immense over-arching limb and the crisp curly-leafed elegant-looking jhamun or indian olive form a paradise of sylvan beauty on which the eye dwelt till it be sate with the woodland loveliness in recross the dhar or water-course we take care to avoid the quicksand and as we do not expect to fall in with another tiger we indulge in a little general firing i shoot a fine buck through the spine and we bag several deer and no less than five florican this bird be ally to the bustard family and have beautiful droop feather hang in plumy pendant of deep black and pure white intermingled in the most graceful and showy manner the male be a magnificent bird and have perhaps as fine plumage as any bird on the border the flesh yield the most delicate eating of any game bird i know the slice of mingled brown and white from the breast be delicious the bird be rather shy generally get up a long way in front of the line and move with a slow rather clumsy flight not unlike the flight of the white earth owl they run with great swiftness and be rather hard to kill unless hit about the neck and head there be two sort the lesser and the greater the former also call the bastard florican altogether they be noble look bird and the sportsman be always glad to add as many florican as he can to he bag we be now near the locality of the fierce fire of the morning it be still blaze in a long extended line of flame and we witness a incident without parallel in the experience of any of we i fire at and wound a large stag it be wound somewhere in the side and seem very hard hit indeed madden probably by terror and pain it make straight for the line of fire and bound unhesitatingly right into the flame we see it distinctly go clean though the flame but we could not see whether it get away with its life as the elephant would not go up to the fire at all event the stag go right through he fiery ordeal and be lose to we we start numerous hare close to camp and s bowl over several they be very common in the short grass jungle where the soil be sandy and be frequently to be find among thin jowah jungle they afford good sport for course but be neither so fleet nor so large nor such good eating as the english hare in fact they be very dry eating and the best way to cook they be to jug they or make a hunter 's pie add portion of partridge quail or plover with a few mushroom and a modicum of ham or bacon if these be procurable we reach camp pretty late and send off venison bird and other spoil to mr s and to inamputte factory we bag shew a diversity of spoil consist of one tiger seven hog-deer one bear _ -lrb- ursus labiali -rrb- _ seventeen jungle fowl five florican and six hare it be no bad bag consider that during most of the day we have be beat solely for tiger we could have shoot many more deer and jungle fowl but we never try to shoot more than be need to satisfy the want of the camp be we to attempt to shoot at all the deer and pig that we see the figure would reach very large total as a rule therefore the record of indian sportsman give no idea of the vast quantity of game that be put up and never fire at it would be the very wantonness of destruction to shoot animal not want for some specific purpose unless indeed you be rage a indiscriminate war of extermination in a quarter where they number be a nuisance and prejudicial to crop in that case you proceedings would not be dignified by the name of sport after a few more day shoot the incident of which be pretty much like those i have be describe i start back for the factory i send my horse on ahead and take five elephant with I to beat up for game on the homeward route close to camp a fine buck get up in front of I i break both he foreleg with my first shot but the poor brute still manage to hobble along it be in some very dense patair jungle and i have considerable difficulty in bring he to bag when we reach the ghat or ferry i order geerdharee jha 's mahout to cross with he elephant the brute however refuse to cross the river alone and in spite of all the driver could do she insist on follow the rest i get down and some of the other driver get out the hobble and bind they round she leg in spite of these she still seem determine to follow we she shake the bedding and other article with which she be load off she back and make a frantic effort to follow we through the deep sand the iron chain cut into she leg and afraid that she might do herself a irreparable injury i have she tie up to a tree and leave she trumpet and make a indignant lamentation at be separate from the rest of the line the elephant seem to be quite a social animal i have frequently see case where after have be in company together for a lengthen hunt they have manifest great reluctance to separate in leave the line i have often notice the single elephant look back at he comrade and give vent to he disappointment and disapproval by grunt and trumpeting of indignant protest we leave the refractory hathee tie up to she tree and as we cross the long rolling billow of burn sand that lay athwart we course she be soon lose to view i shoot a couple more hog-deer and get several plover and teal in the patch of water that lay in some of the hollow among the sandbank i fire at a huge alligator bask in the sun on a sandbank close to the stream the bullet hit he somewhere in the forearm and he make a tremendous sensation header into the current from the agitation in the water he seem not to appreciate the leaden message which i have send he we find the journey through the soft yielding sand very fatiguing and especially try to the eye when not shoot it be a very wise precaution to wear eye-preserver or ` goggles ' they be a great relief to the eye and the best i think be the neutral tint during the west wind when the atmosphere be load with fine particle of irritating sand and dust these goggles be very necessary and be a great protection to the sight another prudent precaution be to have the back of one 's shirt or coat slightly pad with cotton and quilt the heat prevent one wear thick clothes and there be no doubt that the action of the direct ray of the burning sun all down the back on the spinal cord be very injurious and may be a fruitful cause of sunstroke it be certainly productive of great lassitude and weariness i use to wear a thin quilted sort of shield make of cotton-drill which fasten round the shoulder and waist it do not incommode one 's action in any particular and be i think a great protection against the fierce ray of the sun many prefer the puggree as a head-piece it be undeniably a fine thing when one be ride on horseback as it fit close to the head do not catch the wind during a smart trot or canter and be therefore not easily shake off for ride i think it preferable to all other headdress a good thick puggree be a great protection to the back of the head and neck the part of the body which of all other require protection from the sun it feel rather heavy at first but one get use to it and it do not shade the eye and face these be the two gravest objection to it but for comfort softness and protection to the head and neck i do not think it can be surpass after cross the sand we again enter some thin scrubby acacia jungle with here and there a moist swampy nullah with rank green patair jungle grow in the cool dank shade here we disturb a colony of pig but the four mahout be mahommedan i do not fire as we go along one of my man call my attention to some footprint near a small lagoon on inspection we find they be rhinoceros track evidently of old date these animal be often see in this part of the country but be more numerous farther north in the great morung forest jungle a very noticeable feature in these jungle be the immense quantity of bleached ghastly skeleton of cattle this year have be a most disastrous one for cattle enormous number have be sweep off by disease and in many village border on the morung the herd have be well-nigh exterminate little attention be pay to breed in some district such as the mooteeharree and mudhobunnee division fine cart-bullock be breed carefully handle and tend and fetch high price in kurruchpore beyond the gange in bhaugulpore district cattle of a small breed hardy active staunch and strong be breed in great number and be hold in great estimation for agricultural requirement but in these koosee jungle the bull be often ill-bred weedy brute and the cow be much in excess of a fair proportion of bull a deal of in-breeding take place unmatured young bull roam about with the herd and the result be a crowd of cattle that succumb to the first ailment so that the land be litter with they bone the bullock be indispensable to the indian cultivator bull calf be prize take care of well nurture and well feed the cow calf be pretty much leave to take care of themselves they be thin miserable half-starved brute and the short-sighted ryot seem altogether to forget that it be on these miserable withered specimen that he must depend for he supply of plough and cart-bullock the matter be most shamefully neglect government occasionally through its officer experimental farm etc try to get good sire stock for both horse and cattle but as long as the dam be bad -- mere weed without blood bone muscle or stamen the produce must be bad as a pretty well establish and general rule the ryot look after they bullock -- they recognize they value and appreciate they utility but the cow fare badly and from all i have myself see and from the concurrent testimony of many observant friend in the rural district i should say that the breed have become much deteriorated old planter constantly tell you that such cattle as they use to get be not now procurable for love or money within the last twenty year price have more than double because the demand for good plough-bullock have be more urgent as a consequence of increase cultivation and the supply be not equal to the demand attention to the matter be imperative and planter would be wise in they own interest to devote a little time and trouble to disseminate sound idea about the selection of breed stock and the principle of rearing and raise stock among they ryot and dependant every factory should be able to breed its own cattle and supply its own requirement for plough and cart-bullock it would be cheaper in the end and it would undoubtedly be a blessing to the country to raise the standard of cattle use in agricultural work to return from this digression we plod on and on weary hot and thirsty expect every moment to see the ghat and my wait horse but the country here be so wild the river take such erratic course during the annual flood and the district be so secluded and so seldom visit by european or factory servant that my syce have evidently lose he way after we have cross innumerable stream and laboriously traverse mile upon mile of burn sand we give up the attempt to find the ghat and make for nathpore nathpore be formerly a considerable town not far from the nepaul border a flourish grain mart and emporium for the fiber gum spice timber and other production of a wide frontier there be a busy and crowded bazaar long street of shop and house and hundred of boat lie in the stream beside the numerous ghat take in and discharge they cargo it may give a faint idea of the destructive force of a indian stream like the koosee when it be in full flood to say that this once flourishing town be now but a handful of miserable hut mile of rich land once clothe with luxuriant crop of rice indigo and wave grain be now barren reach of burn sand the bleached skeleton of mango jackfruit and other tree stretch out they leafless and lifeless branch to remind the spectator of the time when they foliage rustle in the breeze when they lusty limb bear rich cluster of luscious fruit and when the din of the bazaar resound beneath they welcome shade a fine old lady still live in a two-storied brick building with quaint little darkened room and a narrow verandah run all round the building she be long past the allotted threescore year and ten with a keen yet mildly beam eye and a wealth of beautiful hair as white as drive snow neatly gather back from she shapely forehead she be the last remain link connect the present with the past glory of nathpore she husband have be a planter and zemindar where he vat have stand laden with rich indigo the engulph sand now reflect the ray of the torrid sun from its burning whiteness she shew I a picture of the town as it appear to she when she have be bring there many a long and weary year ago ere yet she step have lose its lightness and when she be in the bloom of she bridal life there be a fine broad boulevard shadow by splendid tree on which she and she husband have drive in they carriage of a evening through crowd of prosperous and contented trader and cultivator the hungry river have sweep all this away subsist on a few precarious rent of some little plot of ground that it have spare all that remain of a once princely estate this good old lady live she lonely life cheerful and contented never murmur or repine the river have not spare even the grave of she depart dear one since i leave that part of the country i hear that she have be call away to join those who have go before she i arrive at she house late in the afternoon i have never be at nathpore before although the place be well know to I by reputation what a wreck it present as we elephant march through ruin dismantle crumble temple mass of masonry half submerge in the swift-running treacherous undermine stream huge tree lie prostrate twist and jam together where the angry flood have hurl they bare unsightly pole and pile stick from the water at every angle remind we of the granary and godown that be wont to be fill with the agricultural wealth of the district for mile around hard metalled road cut abruptly off and bridge with only half a arch standing lonely and ruin half way in the muddy current that sweep noiselessly past the desert city it be a scene of utter waste and desolation the lady i mention make I very welcome and i be strike by she unaffected cheerfulness and gentleness she be a gentlewoman indeed and though reduce in circumstance surround by misfortune and daily and hourly remind by the scatter wreck around she of she former wealth and position she bear all with exemplary fortitude and to the full extent of she scanty means she relieve the sorrow and ailment of the native they all love and respect and i could not help admiring and honor she she point out to I far away on the south-east horizon the place where the river run in its shallow channel when she first come to nathpore during she experience it have cut into and overspread more than twenty mile of country turning fertile field into arid waste of sand sweeping away factory farm and village and change the whole face of the country from a fruitful landscape into a wilderness of sand and swamp my horse come up in the evening and i ride over to inamputte leave my kindly hostess in she solitude

elephant -- discovery and capture of four cub -- joyful return to camp -- death of the tigress -- night encounter with a leopard -- the haunt of the tiger and we shooting grounds one of the most exciting and deeply interesting scene i ever witness in the jungle be on the occasion i have refer to in a former chapter when speaking of the number of young give by the tigress at a birth it be in the month of march at the village of ryseree in bhaugulpore i have be encamp in the midst of twenty-four beautiful tank the history and construction of which be lose in the mist of tradition the villager have a story that these tank be the work of a mighty giant bheema with whose aid and that of he brethren they have be excavate in a single night at all event they be now cover with a wild tangle of water lily and aquatic plant well stock with magnificent fish and a occasional scaly monster of a saurian they be the haunt of vast quantity of widgeon teal whistler mallard duck snipe curlew blue fowl and the usual varied _ habitus _ of a exceptionally good indian lake in the vicinity hare be numerous and in the thick jungle border the tank in place and consist mostly of nurkool and wild rise hog-deer and wild pig be abundant the dried-up bed of a old arm of the koosee be quite close to my camp and abound in sandpiper and golden gray goggle-eyed and stilted plover besides other game it be indeed a favorite camping spot and the village be inhabit by a hardy independent set of gwalla koormee and agriculturist with whom i be a prime favorite i be sit in my tent go over some village account with the village putwarrie and my gomasta a poss of villager be group under the grateful shade of a gnarled old mango tree whose contorted limb bear evidence to the violence of many a _ tufan _ or tempest which it have weather the usual confused clamor of tongue be rise from this group and the sub ect of debate be the eternal ` pice ' behind the bank and in rear of the tent the cook and he mate be disembowel a hapless _ moorghee _ a fowl whose decapitation have just be effect with a huge jagged old cavalry sword of which my cook be not a little proud and on the strength of which he adopt fierce military air and give a extra turn to he well-oiled moustache when he go abroad for a holiday farther to the rear a line of horse be picket include my man-eating demon the

fly the elephant be placidly munch they _ chana _ -lrb- bait or food -rrb- and occasionally give each other a dry bath in the shape of a shower of sand there be a monotonous clank of chain and a

surface a occasional outburst from the duck a angry clamor from the water-hen and blue-fowl my dog be lie round I blinking and wink and make a occasional futile snap at a imaginary fly or flea it be a drowsy and peaceful scene i be nearly drop off to sleep from the heat and the monotonous drone of the putwarrie who be intone nasally some formidable document about fishery rights and privilege suddenly there be a hush every sound seem to stop simultaneously as if by pre-arranged concert then three man be see rush madly along the elevated ridge surround one of the tank i recognize one of my

comical to witness they ungainly attitude they would stretch they clumsy neck and shake they head as if they do not rightly understand what be go on finding that if they stop too long to indulge they curiosity there be a danger of they get separate from the fight member of the herd they would make a stupid headlong lumber lurch forward and jostle each other in they blunder panic it be a grand

satisfactory price two of they be very powerful finely marked handsome animal the third have always be sickly have frequent convulsion and die a few day after i sell it i be afterwards tell that the milk diet be a mistake and that i should have feed they on raw meat however i be very well satisfy on the whole with the result of my adventure i have another in the same part of the country which at the time be a pretty good test of the state of my nerve i be camp out at the village of purindaha on the edge of a gloomy sal forest which be report to contain numerous leopard the villager be a mixed lot of low-caste hindoo and nepaulese settler they have be fight with the factory and would not pay up they rent and i be try with every probability of success to make a amicable arrangement with they at all event i have so far win they round that they be willing to talk to I they come to the tent and listen quietly and except on the subject of rent we get on in the most friendly manner it be the middle of April the heat be intense the whole atmosphere have that coppery look which denote extreme heat and the air be load with fine yellow dust which the daily west wind bear on its fever laden wing to disturb the lung and temper of all good christian the _ kanat _ or canvas wall of the tent have all be take down for coolness and my camp bed lay in one corner open all round to the outside air but only sheltered from the dew it have be a busy day i have be go over account and talk to the villager till i be really hoarse after a light dinner i lay down on my bed but it be too close and hot to sleep by and bye the various sound die out the tom-toming cease in the village my servant suspend they low muttered gossip round the cook 's fire wrap themselves in they white cloth and drop into slumber ` toby ' ` nettle ' ` whisky ' ` pincher ' and my other terrier resemble so many curled-up hairy ball and be in the land of dream occasionally a owl would give a melancholy hoot from the forest or a screech owl would raise a momentary and damnable din at interval the tinkle of a cow-bell sound faintly in the distance i toss restlessly think of various thing till i must have drop off into a uneasy fitful sleep i know not how long i have be doze but of a sudden i feel myself wide awake though with my eye yet firmly close i be conscious of some terrible unknown impending danger i have experience the same feeling before on wake from a nightmare but i know that the danger now be real i feel a shrink horror a terrible and nameless fear and for the life of I i could not move hand or foot i be lie on my side and could distinctly hear the thumping of my heart a cold sweat break out behind my ear and over my neck and chest i could analyze my every feeling and i know there be some presence in the tent and that i be in instant and imminent peril suddenly in the distance a pariah dog give a prolonged melancholy howl as if this have break the spell which have hitherto bind I i open my eye and within ten inch of my face there be a handsome leopardess gaze steadily at I we eye meet and how long we confront each other i know not it must have be some minute she eye contract and expand the pupil elongate and then open out into a round lustrous globe i could see the lithe tail oscillate at its extreme tip with a gentle wave motion like that of a cat when hunting bird in the garden i seem to possess no will i believe i be under a species of fascination but we continue we steady stare at each other just then there be a movement by some of the horse the leopard slowly turn she head and i grasp the revolver which lay under my pillow the beautiful spotted monster turn she head for a instant and shew she tooth and then with one bind go through the open side of the tent i fire two shot which be answer with a roar the din that follow would have frighten the devil it be a beautiful clear night with a moon at the full and everything shew as plainly as at noonday the servant utter exclamation of terror the terrier go into a agony of yelp and bark the horse snort and try to get loose and my chowkeydar who have be asleep on he watch think a band of dacoit be on we begin lay round he with he staff shout _ chor chor lagga lagga lagga _ that be ` thief thief lay on lay on lay on ' the leopard be hit and evidently in a terrible temper she halt not thirty pace from the tent beside a jhamun tree and seem undecided whether to go on or return and wreak she vengeance on I that moment decide she fate i snatch down my express rifle which be hang in two loop above my bed and shoot she right through the heart i never understand how she could have make she way past dog servant horse and watchman right into the tent without raise some alarm it must have be more from curiosity than any hostile design i know that my nerve be very rudely shake but i become the hero of the purindaha villager i believe that my night adventure with the leopardess do more to bring they round to a settlement than all my eloquence and figure the river koosee on the bank of which and in the long grass plain adjacent most of the incident i have record take place take its rise at the base of mount everest and after drain nearly the whole of eastern nepaul emerge by a deep gorge from the hill at the north-west corner of purneah the stream run with extreme velocity it be know as a snow stream the water be always cold and generally of a milky color contain much fine white sand no sooner do it leave its rocky bed than it tear through the flat country by numerous channel it be subject to very sudden rise a premonitory warning of these be generally give the water become of a turbid almost blood-like color sometimes i have see the river rise over thirty foot in twenty-four hour the melting of the snow often make a rage torrent level from bank to bank where only a few hour before a horse could have ford the stream without wet the girth of the saddle in 1876 the largest channel be a swift broad stream call the dhaus the river be very capricious seldom flow for any length of time in one channel this be owe in great measure to the amount of silt it carry with it from the hill in its impetuous progress to the plain in these dry watercourse among the sand ridge beside the humid marshy hollow and among the thick strip of grass jungle tiger be always to be find they be much less numerous now however than formerly as a rule there be no shelter in these water-worn flood-ravaged tract and sultry jungle occasionally a few straggle plantain tree a clump of sickly-looking bamboo a cluster of tall shadowless palm mark the site of a desert village all else be wave grass withered and dry the village inhabit mostly by a few cowherd boatman and rice-farmer be scatter at wide interval in the shooting season and when the hot wind be blow the only shadow on the plain be that cast by the dense volume of lurid smoke rise in blind cloud from the jungle fire accord to the season animal life fluctuate strangely during the rain when the river be in full flood and much of the country submerge most of the animal migrate to the north buffalo and wild pig alone keep possession of the higher ridge in the neighborhood of they usual haunt the contrast present on these plain at different season of the year be most remarkable in march and April they be parch up brown and dead great black patch show the track of a destroy fire the fine brown ash from the burnt grass penetrate the eye and nostril and sweeping along in eddy and blind cloud they then look the very picture of a untenable waste a sea of desolation whose limit blend in the extreme distance with the shimmering coppery horizon in the rainy season these arid-looking waste be cover with tall-plumed reed-like wave grass vary from two to ten foot in height stretch in a unbroken sweep as far as the eye can reach except where a abrupt line shew that the swift river have its treacherous course after the rain progress through the jungle be dangerous quicksand and bed of tenacious mud impede one at every step the rich vegetation spring up green and vigorous with a rapidity only to be see in the tropics but what a glorious hunting ground what a preserve for nimrod deer forest or heathered moor can never compete with the old koosee derah for abundance of game and thrilling excitement in sport my genial happy loyal comrade too -- while memory last the recollection of you joyous frank warm-hearted comradeship shall never fade chapter xxvi remark on gun -- how to cure skin -- different recipe -- conclusion my remark on gun shall be brief the true sportsman have many facility for acquire the best information on a choice of weapon for large game perhaps nothing can equal the express rifle my own trusty weapon be a ' 500 bear very plain with a pistol grip point blank up to 180 yard make by murcott of the haymarket from whom i have buy over twenty gun every one of which turn out a splendid weapon my next favorite be a no 12 breachloader very light but strong and carefully finish it have a side snap action with rebound lock and be the quickest gun to fire and reload i ever possess i buy it from the same maker although it be manufacture by ww greener avoid a cheap gun as you would avoid a cheap jew pedlar a good name be above riches so far as a gun be concerned and when you have a good gun take as much care of it as you would of a good wife they be both equally rare a expensive gun be not necessarily a good one but a cheap gun be very seldom trustworthy have a portable handy black leather case keep you gun always clean bright and free from rust after every day 's shooting see that the barrel and lock be carefully clean and oil nothing be better for this purpose than rangoon oil for preserve horn a little scrape and varnish be all that be require while in camp it be a good plan to rub they with deer or pig or tiger fat as it keep they from crack to clean a tiger 's or other skull if there be a nest of ant near the camp place the skull in they immediate vicinity some recommend put in water till the particle of flesh rot or till the skull be clear by the fish a strong solution of caustic water may be use if you wish to get the bone clean very quickly some put the skull in quicklime but it have a tendency to make the bone splinter and it be difficult to keep the tooth from get loose and drop out the best but slowest plan be to fix they in mechanically by wire or white lead a good preservative be to wash or paint they with a very strong solution of fine lime and water to cure skin i know no better recipe than the one adopt by my trainer in the art of _ shibar _ the brother s i can not do better than give a description of the process in the word of george himself ` skin the animal in the usual way cut from the corner of the mouth down the throat and along the belly a white stripe or border generally run along the belly this should be leave as nearly as possible equal on both side carefully cut the fleshy part off the lip and ball of the toe and foot clean away every particle of fatty or fleshy matter that may still adhere to the skin peg it out on the ground with the hair side undermost when thoroughly scrape clean of all extraneous matter on the inner surface get a bucket or tub of buttermilk which be call by the native _ dahye _ or _ mutha _ it be a favorite article of diet with they cheap and plentiful dip the skin in this and keep it well and entirely submerge by place some heavy weight on it it should be submerge fully three inch in the tub of buttermilk ` after two day in the milk bath take it out and peg it as before now take a smooth oval rubbing-board about twelve inch long five round and about a inch thick in the middle and scrub the skin heartily with this instrument on its lower surface it should be cut in groove semicircular in shape half a inch wide and one inch apart during scrub use plenty of pure water to remove filth in about half a hour the pinkish-white color will disappear and the skin will appear white with a blackish tinge underneath this be the true hide ` again submerge in the buttermilk bath for twenty-four hour and get a man to tread on it in every possible way folding it and unfold it till all have be thoroughly work ` take it out again peg out and scrub it as before after which wash the whole hide well in clear water never mind if the skin look rotten it be really not so ` when wash put it into a tub in which you have first place a mixture consist of half a ounce of alum to each gallon of water soak the skin in this mixture for about six hour take it up occasionally to drain a little this be sufficient to cure you skin and clean it ' the tanning remain to be do ` get four pound of babool tamarind or dry oak bark -lrb- the babool be a kind of acacia and be easily procurable as the tamarind also be -rrb- boil the bark in two gallon of water till it be reduce to one half the quantity add to this nine gallon of fresh water and in this solution souse the skin for two or three or four day ` the hair have be set by the soak in alum the skin will tan more quickly and if the tan be occasionally rub into the pore of the skin it will be a improvement you can tell when the tanning be complete by the color the skin assume when this satisfy the eye take it out and drain on a rod when nearly dry it should be curry with olive oil or clarify butter if require for wear but if only for floor cover or carriage rug the english currier ' common ` dubbin ' sell by shopkeeper be best this operation which must be do on the inner side only be simple ` another simple recipe and one which answer well be this mix together of the best english soap four ounce arsenic two and a half grain camphor two ounce alum half a ounce saltpetre half a ounce boil the whole and keep stir in a half-pint of distilled water over a very slow fire for from ten to fifteen minute apply when cool with a sponge a little sweet oil may be rub on the skin after they be dry ` another good method be to apply arsenical soap which may be make as follow : powdered arsenic two pound camphor five ounce white soap slice thin two pound salt of tartar twelve dram chalk or powdered fine lime four ounce add a small quantity of water first to the soap put over a gentle fire and keep stir when melt add the lime and tartar and thoroughly mix next add the arsenic keep up a constant motion and lastly the camphor the camphor should first be reduce to a powder by means of a little spirit of wine and should be add to the mess after it have be take off the fire ` this preparation must be keep in a well-stoppered jar or properly close pot when ready the soap should be of the consistency of devonshire cream to use add water till it become of the consistency of clear rich soup ' i have now finish my book it have be pleasant to I to write down these recollection ever since i
