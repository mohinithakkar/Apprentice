exceed in a whole generation the expenditure of other nation in a single year such be the unexaggerated picture of we condition under a constitution found upon the republican principle of equal rights to admit that this picture have its shades be but to say that it be still the condition of man upon earth from evil -- physical moral and political -- it be not we claim to be exempt we have suffer sometimes by the visitation of heaven through disease often by the wrong and injustice of other nation even to the extremity of war and lastly by dissension among ourselves -- dissension perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom but which have more than once appear to threaten the dissolution of the union and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyment of we present lot and all we earthly hope of the future the cause of these dissension have be various found upon difference of speculation in the theory of republican government upon conflict view of policy in we relation with foreign nation upon jealousy of partial and sectional interest aggravate by prejudice and prepossession which stranger to each other be ever apt to entertain it be a source of gratification and of encouragement to I to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights have at the close of that generation by which it be form be crown with success equal to the most

contribute splendid talent spotless integrity ardent patriotism and disinterested sacrifice to the formation and administration of this government and that both have require a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error the revolutionary war of europe commence precisely at the moment when the government of the united state first go into operation under this constitution excite a collision of sentiment and of sympathy which kindle all the passion and imbitter the conflict of party till the nation be involve in war and the union be shake to its center this time of trial embrace a period of five and twenty year during which the policy of the union in its relation with europe constitute the principal basis of we political division and the most arduous part of the action of we federal government with the catastrophe in which the war of the french revolution terminate and we own subsequent peace with great britain this baneful weed of party strife be uproot from that time no difference of principle connect either with the theory of government or with we intercourse with foreign nation have exist or be call forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued combination of party or to give more than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate we political creed be without a dissenting voice that can be hear that the will of the people be the source and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth that the best security for the beneficence and the best guaranty against the abuse of power consist in the freedom the purity and the frequency of popular election that the general government of the union and the separate government of the state be all sovereignty of limited power fellow-servant of the same master uncontrolled within they respective sphere uncontrollable by encroachment upon each other that the firmest security of peace be the preparation during peace of the defens of war that a rigorous economy and accountability of public expenditure should guard against the aggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation that the military should be keep in strict subordination to the civil power that the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate that the policy of we country be peace and the ark of we salvation union be article of faith upon which we be all now agree if there have be those who doubt whether a confederated representative democracy be a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concern of a mighty nation those doubt have be dispel if there have be project of partial confederacy to be erect upon the ruin of the union they have be scatter to the wind if there have be dangerous attachment to one foreign nation and antipathy against another they have be extinguish ten year of peace at home and abroad have assuage the animosity of political contention and blended into harmony the most discordant element of public opinion there still remain one effort of magnanimity one sacrifice of prejudice and passion to be make by the individual throughout the nation who have heretofore follow the standard of political party it be that of discard every remnant of rancor against each other of embrace as countryman and friend and of yield to talent and virtue alone that confidence which in time of contention for principle be bestow only upon those who bear the badge of party communion the collision of party spirit which originate in speculative opinion or in different view of administrative policy be in they nature transitory those which be found on geographical division adverse interest of soil climate and mode of domestic life be more permanent and therefore perhaps more dangerous it be this which give inestimable value to the character of we government at once federal and national it hold out to we a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual state in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the union whatsoever be of domestic concernment unconnected with the other member of the union or with foreign land belong exclusively to the administration of the state government whatsoever directly involve the rights and interest of the federative fraternity or of foreign power be of the resort of this general government the duty of both be obvious in the general principle though sometimes perplex with difficulty in the detail to respect the rights of the state government be the inviolable duty of that of the union the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole the prejudice everywhere too commonly entertain against distant stranger be wear away and the jealousy of jarring interest be allay by the composition and function of the great national council annually assemble from all quarter of the union at this place here the distinguish man from every section of we country while meet to deliberate upon the great interest of those by whom they be depute learn to estimate the talent and do justice to the virtue of each other the harmony of

my own fate and the future destiny of my country march 4 1825 first annual message washington _ December 6 1825 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and of the house of representative _ : in take a general survey of the concern of we beloved country with reference to subject interesting to the common welfare the first sentiment which impress itself upon the mind be of gratitude to the omnipotent disposer of all good for the continuance of the signal blessing of he providence and especially for that health which to a unusual extent have prevail within we border and for that abundance which in the vicissitude of the season have be scatter with profusion over we land nor ought we less to ascribe to he the glory that we be permit to enjoy the bounty of he hand in peace and tranquillity -- in peace with all the other nation of the earth in tranquillity among ourselves there have indeed rarely be a period in the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the christian nation have be mark so extensively by peace and prosperity europe with a few partial and unhappy exception have enjoy ten year of peace during which all she government whatever the theory of they constitution may have be be successively teach to feel that the end of they institution be the happiness of the people and that the exercise of power among man can be justify only by the blessing it confer upon those over whom it be extend during the same period we intercourse with all those nation have be pacific and friendly it so continue since the close of you last session no material variation have occur in we relation with any one of they in the commercial and navigation system of great britain important change of municipal regulation have recently be sanction by act of parliament the effect of which upon the interest of other nation and particularly upon ours have not yet be fully develop in the recent renewal of the diplomatic mission on both side between the two government assurance have be give and receive of the continuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by which the adjustment of many point of difference have already be effect and which afford the surest pledge for the ultimate satisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may hereafter arise the policy of the united state in they commercial intercourse with other nation have always be of the most liberal character in the mutual exchange of they respective production they have abstain altogether from prohibition they have interdict themselves the power of lay tax upon export and whenever they have favor they own shipping by special preference or exclusive privilege in they own port it have be only with a view to countervail similar favor and exclusion grant by the nation with whom we have be engage in traffic to they own people or shipping and to the disadvantage of ours immediately after the close of the last war a proposal be fairly make by the act of congress of the 3d of march 1815 to all the maritime nation to lay aside the system of retaliate restriction and exclusion and to place the shipping of both party to the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duty of tonnage and impost this offer be partially and successively accept by great britain sweden the netherlands the hanseatic city prussium sardinia the duke of oldenburg and russia it be also adopt under certain modification in we late commercial convention with france and by the act of congress of the 8th January 1824 it have receive a new confirmation with all the nation who have accede to it and have be offer again to all those who be or may hereafter be willing to abide in reciprocity by it but all these regulation whether establish by treaty or by municipal enactment be still subject to one important restriction the removal of discriminate duty of tonnage and of impost be limit to article of the growth produce or manufacture of the country to which the vessel belong or to such article as be most usually first ship from she port it will deserve the serious consideration of congress whether even this remnant of restriction may not be safely abandon and whether the general tender of equal competition make in the act of 8th January 1824 may not be extend to include all article of merchandise not prohibit of what country soever they may be the produce or manufacture proposition to this effect have already be make to we by more than one european government and it be probable that if once establish by legislation or compact with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend itself by the experience of its advantage to the general accession of all the convention of commerce and navigation between the united state and france conclude on the 24th of June 1822 be in the understanding and intent of both party as appear upon its face only a temporary arrangement of the point of difference between they of the most immediate and press urgency it be limit in the first instance to two year from the 1st of October 1822 but with a proviso that it should further continue in force till the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty of commerce unless terminate by a notice six month in advance of either of the party to the other its operation so far as it extend have be mutually advantageous and it still continue in force by common consent but it leave unadjusted several object of great interest to the citizen and subject of both country and particularly a mass of claim to considerable amount of citizen of the united state upon the government of france of indemnity for property take or destroy under circumstance of the most aggravate and outrageous character in the long period during which continual and earnest appeal have be make to the equity and magnanimity of france in behalf of these claim they justice have not be as it could not be deny it be hope that the accession of a new sovereign to the throne would have afford a favorable opportunity for present they to the consideration of he government they have be present and urge hitherto without effect the repeat and earnest representation of we minister at the court of france remain as yet even without a answer be the demand of nation upon the justice of each other susceptible of adjudication by the sentence of a impartial tribunal those to which i now refer would long since have be settle and adequate indemnity would have be obtain there be large amount of similar claim upon the netherland naple and denmark for those upon spain prior to 1819 indemnity be after many year of patient forbearance obtain and those upon sweden have be lately compromise by a private settlement in which the claimant themselves have acquiesce the government of denmark and of naple have be recently remind of those yet exist against they nor will any of they be forget while a hope may be indulge of obtain justice by the means within the constitutional power of the executive and without resort to those means of self-redress which as well as the time circumstance and occasion which may require they be within the exclusive competency of the legislature it be with great satisfaction that i be enable to bear witness to the liberal spirit with which the republic of colombium have make satisfaction for well-established claim of a similar character and among the document now communicate to congress will be distinguish a treaty of commerce and navigation with that republic the ratification of which have be exchange since the last recess of the legislature the negotiation of similar treaty with all the independent south american state have be contemplate and may yet be accomplish the basis of they all as propose by the united state have be lay in two principle -- the one of entire and unqualified reciprocity the other the mutual obligation of the party to place each other permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation these principle be indeed indispensable to the effectual emancipation of the american hemisphere from the thraldom of colonize monopoly and exclusion a event rapidly realize in the progress of human affair and which the resistance still oppose in certain part of europe to the acknowledgment of the southern american republic as independent state will it be believe contribute more effectually to accomplish the time have be and that not remote when some of those state might in they anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition have accept of a nominal independence clog with burdensome condition and exclusive commercial privilege grant to the nation from which they have separate to the disadvantage of all other they be all now aware that such concession to any european nation would be incompatible with that independence which they have declare and maintain among the measure which have be suggest to they by the new relation with one another result from the recent change in they condition be that of assemble at the isthmus of panama a congress at which each of they should be represent to deliberate upon object important to the welfare of all the republic of colombium of mexico and of central america have already depute plenipotentiary to such a meeting and they have invite the united state to be also represent there by they minister the invitation have be accept and minister on the part of the united state will be commission to attend at those deliberation and to take part in they so far as may be compatible with that neutrality from which it be neither we intention nor the desire of the other american state that we should depart the commissioner under the seventh article of the treaty of ghent have so nearly complete they arduous labor that by the report recently receive from the agent on the part of the united state there be reason to expect that the commission will be close at they next session appoint for the 22d of may of the ensue year the other commission appoint to ascertain the indemnity due for slave carry away from the united state after the close of the late war have meet with some difficulty which have delay they progress in the inquiry a reference have be make to the british government on the subject which it may be hope will tend to hasten the decision of the commissioner or serve as a substitute for it among the power specifically grant to congress by the constitution be those of establish uniform law on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the united state and of provide for organize arm and discipline the militia and for govern such part of they as may be employ in the service of the united state the magnitude and complexity of the interest affect by legislation upon these subject may account for the fact that long and often as both of they have occupy the attention and animated the debate of congress no system have yet be devise for fulfil to the satisfaction of the community the duty prescribe by these grant of power to conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of personal liberty with the effective obligation of private contract be the difficult problem to be solve by a law of bankruptcy these be object of the deepest interest to society affect all that be precious in the existence of multitude of person many of they in the class essentially dependent and helpless of the age require nurture and of the sex entitle to protection from the free agency of the parent and the husband the organization of the militia be yet more indispensable to the liberty of the country it be only by a effective militia that we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid defiance to foreign aggression it be by the militia that we be constitute a armed nation standing in perpetual panoply of defense in the presence of all the other nation of the earth to this end it would be necessary if possible so to shape its organization as to give it a more united and active energy there be law for establish a uniform militia throughout the united state and for arm and equip its whole body but it be a body of dislocated member without the vigor of unity and have little of uniformity but the name to infuse into this most important institution the power of which it be susceptible and to make it available for the defense of the union at the shortest notice and at the smallest expense possible of time of life and of treasure be among the benefit to be expect from the persevere deliberation of congress among the unequivocal indication of we national prosperity be the flourishing state of we finances the revenue of the present year from all they principal source will exceed the anticipation of the last the balance in the treasury on the 1st of January last be a little short of $ 2000000 exclusive of two million and a half be the moiety of the loan of five million authorize by the act of 26th of may 1824 the receipt into the treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of September exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan be estimate at $ 16500000 and it be expect that those of the current quarter will exceed $ 5000000 form a aggregate of receipt of nearly twenty-two million independent of the loan the expenditure of the year will not exceed that sum more than two million by those expenditure nearly eight million of the principal of the public debt have be discharge more than a million and a half have be devote to the debt of gratitude to the warrior of the revolution a nearly equal sum to the construction of fortification and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent preparation of national defense half a million to the gradual increase of the navy a equal sum for purchase of territory from the indian and payment of annuity to they and upward of a million for object of internal improvement authorize by special act of the last congress if we add to these $ 4000000 for payment of interest upon the public debt there remain a sum of about seven million which have defray the whole expense of the administration of government in its legislative executive and judiciary department include the support of the military and naval establishment and all the occasional contingency of a government coextensive with the union the amount of duty secure on merchandise import since the commencement of the year be about twenty-five million and a half and that which will accrue during the current quarter be estimate at five million and a half from these thirty-one million deduct the drawback estimate at less than seven million a sum exceed twenty-four million will constitute the revenue of the year and will exceed the whole expenditure of the year the entire amount of the public debt remain due on the 1st of January next will be short of $ 81000000 by a act of congress of the 3d of march last a loan of $ 12000000 be authorize at 4-1\/2 per cent or a exchange of stock to that amount of 4-1\/2 per cent for a stock of 6 per cent to create a fund for extinguish a equal amount of the public debt bear a interest of 6 per cent redeemable in 1826 a account of the measure take to give effect to this act will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury as the object which it have in view have be but partially accomplish it will be for the consideration of congress whether the power with which it clothe the executive should not be renew at a early day of the present session and under what modification the act of congress of the 3d of march last direct the secretary of the treasury to subscribe in the name and for the use of the united state for 1500 share of the capital stock of the chesapeake and delaware canal company have be execute by the actual subscription for the amount specify and such other measure have be adopt by that officer under the act as the fulfillment of its intention require the latest account receive of this important undertaking authorize the belief that it be in successful progress the payment into the treasury from the proceeds of the sale of the public land during the present year be estimate at $ 1000000 the actual receipt of the first two quarter have fall very little short of that sum it be not expect that the second half of the year will be equally productive but the income of the year from that source may now be safely estimate at a million and a half the act of congress of 18th may 1824 to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the united state by the purchaser of public land be limit in its operation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last its effect at the end of the quarter during which it expire be to reduce that debt from ten to seven million by the operation of similar prior law of relief from and since that of 2d march 1821 the debt have be reduce from upward of twenty-two million to ten it be exceedingly desirable that it should be extinguish altogether and to facilitate that consummation i recommend to congress the revival for one year more of the act of 18th may 1824 with such provisional modification as may be necessary to guard the public interest against fraudulent practice in the resale of the relinquish land the purchaser of public land be among the most useful of we fellow-citizen and since the system of sale for cash alone have be introduce great indulgence have be justly extend to those who have previously purchase upon credit the debt which have be contract under the credit sale have become unwieldy and its extinction be alike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public under the system of sale mature as it have be by experience and adapt to the exigency of the time the land will continue as they have become a abundant source of revenue and when the pledge of they to the public creditor shall have be redeem by the entire discharge of the national debt the swell tide of wealth with which they replenish the common treasury may be make to reflow in unfailing stream of improvement from the atlantic to the pacific ocean the condition of the various branch of the public service resort from the department of war and they administration during the current year will be exhibit in the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document herewith communicate the organization and discipline of the army be effective and satisfactory to counteract the prevalence of desertion among the troops it have be suggest to withhold from the man a small portion of they monthly pay until the period of they discharge and some expedient appear to be necessary to preserve and maintain among the officer so much of the art of horsemanship as could scarcely fail to be find want on the possible sudden eruption of a war which should take we unprovided with a single corps of cavalry the military academy at west point under the restriction of a severe but paternal superintendence recommend itself more and more to the patronage of the nation and the number of meritorious officer which it form and introduce to the public service furnish the means of multiply the undertaking of public improvement to which they acquirement at that institution be peculiarly adapt the school of artillery practice establish at fortress monroe be well suit to the same purpose and may heed the aid of further legislative provision to the same end the report of the various officer at the head of the administrative branch of the military service connect with the quartering clothing subsistence health and pay of the army exhibit the assiduous vigilance of those officer in the performance of they respective duty and the faithful accountability which have pervade every part of the system we relation with the numerous tribe of aboriginal native of this country scatter over its extensive surface and so dependent even for they existence upon we power have be during the present year highly interesting a act of congress of 25th of may 1824 make a appropriation to defray the expense of make treaty of trade and friendship with the indian tribe beyond the mississippus a act of 3d of march 1825 authorize treaty to be make with the indian for they consent to the making of a road from the frontier of missourus to that of new mexico and another act of the same date provide for defray the expense of hold treaty with the sioux chippeway menomenee sauk fox etc for the purpose of establish boundary and promote peace between say tribe the first and the last object of these act have be accomplish and the second be yet in a process of execution the treaty which since the last session of congress have be conclude with the several tribe will be lay before the senate for they consideration conformably to the constitution they comprise large and valuable acquisition of territory and they secure a adjustment of boundary and give pledge of permanent peace between several tribe which have be long wage bloody war against each other on the 12th of February last a treaty be sign at the indian spring between commissioner appoint on the part of the united state and certain chief and individual of the creek nation of indian which be receive at the seat of government only a very few day before the close of the last session of congress and of the late administration the advice and consent of the senate be give to it on the 3d of march too late for it to receive the ratification of the then president of the united state it be ratify on the 7th of march under the unsuspecting impression that it have be negotiate in good faith and in the confidence inspire by the recommendation of the senate the subsequent transaction in relation to this treaty will form the subject of a separate communication the appropriation make by congress for public work as well in the construction of fortification as for purpose of internal improvement so far as they have be expend have be faithfully apply they progress have be delay by the want of suitable officer for superintend they a increase of both the corps of engineer military and topographical be recommend by my predecessor at the last session of congress the reason upon which that recommendation be found subsist in all they force and have acquire additional urgency since that time it may also be expedient to organize the topographical engineer into a corps similar to the present establishment of the corps of engineer the military academy at west point will furnish from the cadet annually graduate there officer well qualify for carry this measure into effect the board of engineer for internal improvement appoint for carry into execution the act of congress of 30th of April 1824 to procure the necessary survey plan and estimate on the subject of road and canal have be actively engage in that service from the close of the last session of congress they have complete the survey necessary for ascertain the practicability of a canal from the chesapeake bay to the ohio river and be prepare a full report on that subject which when complete will be lay before you the same observation be to be make with regard to the two other object of national importance upon which the board have be occupy namely the accomplishment of a national road from this city to new orlean and the practicability of unite the water of lake memphramagog with connecticut river and the improvement of the navigation of that river the survey have be make and be nearly complete the report may be expect at a early period during the present session of congress the act of congress of the last session relative to the survey mark or lay out road in the territory of florida arkansa and michigan from missourus to mexico and for the continuation of the cumberland road be some of they fully execute and other in the process of execution those for complete or commence fortification have be delay only so far as the corps of engineer have be inadequate to furnish officer for the necessary superintendence of the work under the act confirm the statute of virginium and maryland incorporate the chesapeake and ohio canal company three commissioner on the part of the united state have be appoint for open book and receive subscription in concert with a like number of commissioner appoint on the part of each of those state a meeting of the commissioner have be postpone to await the definitive report of the board of engineer the light-house and monument for the safety of we commerce and mariner the work for the security of plymouth beach and for the preservation of the island in boston harbor have receive the attention require by the law relate to those object respectively the continuation of the cumberland road the most important of they all after surmount no inconsiderable difficulty in fix upon the direction of the road have commence under the most promising auspices with the improvement of recent invention in the mode of construction and with the advantage of a great reduction in the comparative cost of the work the operation of the law relate to the revolutionary pensioner may deserve the renew consideration of congress the act of the 18th of march 1818 while it make provision for many meritorious and indigent citizen who have serve in the war of independence open a door to numerous abuse and imposition to remedy this the act of 1st may 1820 exact proof of absolute indigence which many really in want be unable and all susceptible of that delicacy which be ally to many virtue must be deeply reluctant to give the result have be that some among the least deserving have be retain and some in whom the requisite both of worth and want be combine have be stricken from the list as the number of these venerable relic of a age go by diminish as the decay of body mind and estate of those that survive must in the common course of nature increase should not a more liberal portion of indulgence be deal out to they may not the want in most instance be infer from the demand when the service can be prove and may not the last day of human infirmity be spare the mortification of purchase a pittance of relief only by the exposure of its own necessity i submit to congress the expediency of provide for individual case of this description by special enactment or of revise the act of the 1st of may 1820 with a view to mitigate the rigor of its exclusion in favor of person to whom charity now bestow can scarcely discharge the debt of justice the portion of the naval force of the union in actual service have be chiefly employ on three station -- the mediterranean the coast of south america border on the pacific ocean and the west indy a occasional cruiser have be send to range along the african shore most polluted by the traffic of slave one armed vessel have be station on the coast of we eastern boundary to cruise along the fishing grounds in hudson bay and on the coast of labrador and the first service of a new frigate have be perform in restore to he native soil and domestic enjoyment the veteran hero whose youthful blood and treasure have freely flow in the cause of we country 's independence and whose whole life have be a series of service and sacrifice to the improvement of he fellow-men the visit of general lafayette alike honorable to himself and to we country close as it have commence with the most affect testimonial of devoted attachment on he part and of unbounded gratitude of this people to he in return it will form hereafter a please incident in the annals of we union give to real history the intense interest of romance and signally mark the unpurchasable tribute of a great nation 's social affection to the disinterested champion of the liberty of human-kind the constant maintenance of a small squadron in the mediterranean be a necessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of pay tribute for the security of we commerce in that sea and for a precarious peace at the mercy of every caprice of four barbary state by whom it be liable to be violate a additional motive for keep a respectable force station there at this time be find in the maritime war rage between the greek and the turk and in which the neutral navigation of this union be always in danger of outrage and depredation a few instance have occur of such depredation upon we merchant vessel by privateer or pirate wear the grecian flag but without real authority from the greek or any other government the heroic struggle of the greek themselves in which we warmest sympathy as freeman and christian have be engage have continue to be maintain with vicissitude of success adverse and favorable similar motive have render expedient the keep of a like force on the coast of peru and chile on the pacific the irregular and convulsive character of the war upon the shore have be extend to the conflict upon the ocean a active warfare have be keep up for year with alternate success though generally to the advantage of the american patriot but they naval force have not always be under the control of they own government blockade unjustifiable upon any acknowledged principle of international law have be proclaim by officer in command and though disavow by the supreme authority the protection of we own commerce against they have be make cause of complaint and erroneous imputation against some of the most gallant officer of we navy complaint equally groundless have be make by the commander of the spanish royal force in those sea but the most effective protection to we commerce have be the flag and the firmness of we own commanding officer the cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause have remove it be hope all cause of dissension with one party and all vestige of force of the other but a unsettled coast of many degree of latitude form a part of we own territory and a flourish commerce and fishery extend to the island of the pacific and to china still require that the protect power of the union should be display under its flag as well upon the ocean as upon the land the object of the west indium squadron have be to carry into execution the law for the suppression of the african slave trade for the protection of we commerce against vessel of piratical character though bear commission from either of the belligerent party for its protection against open and unequivocal pirate these object during the present year have be accomplish more effectually than at any former period the african slave trade have long be exclude from the use of we flag and if some few citizen of we country have continue to set the law of the union as well as those of nature and humanity at defiance by persevere in that abominable traffic it have be only by shelter themselves under the banner of other nation less earnest for the total extinction of the trade than ours the irregular privateer have within the last year be in a great measure banish from those sea and the pirate for month past appear to have be almost entirely sweep away from the border and the shore of the two spanish island in those region the active persevere and unremitted energy of captain warrington and of the officer and man under he command on that try and perilous service have be crown with signal success and be entitle to the approbation of they country but experience have show that not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assiduity can be indulge on that station without reproduce piracy and murder in all they horror nor be it probable that for year to come we immensely valuable commerce in those sea can navigate in security without the steady continuance of a armed force devote to its protection it be indeed a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the present or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive and so rich as ours could exist and be pursue in safety without the continual support of a military marine -- the only arm by which the power of this confederacy can be estimate or feel by foreign nation and the only standing military force which can never be dangerous to we own liberty at home a permanent naval peace establishment therefore adapt to we present condition and adaptable to that gigantic growth with which the nation be advance in its career be among the subject which have already occupy the foresight of the last congress and which will deserve you serious deliberation we navy commence at a early period of we present political organization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energy the scanty resource and the comparative indigence of we infancy be even then find adequate to cope with all the power of barbary save the first and with one of the principal maritime power of europe at a period of further advancement but with little accession of strength it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of conflict but cover itself and we country with unfading glory but it be only since the close of the late war that by the number and force of the ship of which it be compose it could deserve the name of a navy yet it retain nearly the same organization as when it consist only of five frigate the rule and regulation by which it be govern earnestly call for revision and the want of a naval school of instruction correspond with the military academy at west point for the formation of scientific and accomplished officer be feel with daily increase aggravation the act of congress of 26th of may 1824 authorize a examination and survey of the harbor of charleston in south carolina of st mary in georgium and of the coast of florida and for other purpose have be execute so far as the appropriation would admit those of the 3d of march last authorize the establishment of a navy-yard and depot on the coast of florida in the gulf of mexico and authorize the building of ten sloop of war and for other purpose be in the course of execution for the particulars of which and other object connect with this department i refer to the report of the secretary of the navy herewith communicate a report from the postmaster-general be also submit exhibit the present flourishing condition of that department for the first time for many year the receipt for the year end on the 1st of July last exceed the expenditure during the same period to the amount of more than $ 45000 other fact equally creditable to the administration of this department be that in two year from the 1st of July 1823 a improvement of more than $ 185000 in its pecuniary affair have be realize that in the same interval the increase of the transportation of the mail have exceed 1500000 mile annually and that 1040 new post-office have be establish it hence appear that under judicious management the income from this establishment may be rely on as fully adequate to defray its expense and that by the discontinuance of post-roads altogether unproductive other of more useful character may be open till the circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the spread of we population and the comfort of friendly correspondence the exchange of internal traffic and the light of the periodical press shall be distribute to the remotest corner of the union at a charge scarcely perceptible to any individual and without the cost of a dollar to the public treasury upon this first occasion of address the legislature of the union with which i have be honor in present to they view the execution so far as it have be effect of the measure sanction by they for promote the internal improvement of we country i can not close the communication without recommend to they calm and persevere consideration the general principle in a more enlarged extent the great object of the institution of civil government be the improvement of the condition of those who be party to the social compact and no government in whatever form constitute can accomplish the lawful end of its institution but in proportion as it improve the condition of those over whom it be establish road and canal by multiply and facilitate the communication and intercourse between distant region and multitude of man be among the most important means of improvement but moral political intellectual improvement be duty assign by the author of we existence to social no less than to individual man for the fulfillment of those duty government be invest with power and to the attainment of the end -- the progressive improvement of the condition of the govern -- the exercise of delegated power be a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of power not grant be criminal and odious among the first perhaps the very first instrument for the improvement of the condition of man be knowledge and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapt to the want the comfort and enjoyment of human life public institution and seminary of learn be essential so convinced of this be the first of my predecessor in this office now first in the memory as live he be first in the heart of we countryman that once and again in he address to the congress with whom he cooperate in the public service he earnestly recommend the establishment of seminary of learn to prepare for all the emergency of peace and war -- a national university and a military academy with respect to the latter have he live to the present day in turn he eye to the institution at west point he would have enjoy the gratification of he most earnest wish but in survey the city which have be honor with he name he would have see the spot of earth which he have destine and bequeath to the use and benefit of he country as the site for a university still bare and barren in assume she station among the civilized nation of the earth it would seem that we country have contract the engagement to contribute she share of mind of labor and of expense to the improvement of those part of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual acquisition and particularly to geographical and astronomical science look back to the history only of the half century since the declaration of we independence and observe the generous emulation with which the government of france great britain and russium have devote the genius the intelligence the treasure of they respective nation to the common improvement of the species in these branch of science be it not incumbent upon we to inquire whether we be not bind by obligation of a high and honorable character to contribute we portion of energy and exertion to the common stock the voyage of discovery prosecute in the course of that time at the expense of those nation have not only redound to they glory but to the improvement of human knowledge we have be partaker of that improvement and owe for it a sacred debt not only of gratitude but of equal or proportional exertion in the same common cause of the cost of these undertaking if the mere expenditure of outfit equipment and completion of the expedition be to be consider the only charge it would be unworthy of a great and generous nation to take a second thought one hundred expedition of circumnavigation like those of cook and la prouse would not burden the exchequer of the nation fitting they out so much as the way and means of defray a single campaign in war but if we take into the account the life of those benefactor of mankind of which they service in the cause of they species be the purchase how shall the cost of those heroic enterprise be estimate and what compensation can be make to they or to they country for they be it not by bear they in affectionate remembrance be it not still more by imitate they example -- by enable countryman of we own to pursue the same career and to hazard they life in the same cause in invite the attention of congress to the subject of internal improvement upon a view thus enlarged it be not my design to recommend the equipment of a expedition for circumnavigate the globe for purpose of scientific research and inquiry we have object of useful investigation nearer home and to which we care may be more beneficially apply the interior of we own territory have yet be very imperfectly explore we coast along many degree of latitude upon the shore of the pacific ocean though much frequent by we spirited commercial navigator have be barely visit by we public ship the river of the west first fully discover and navigate by a countryman of we own still bear the name of the ship in which he ascend its water and claim the protection of we armed national flag at its mouth with the establishment of a military post there or at some other point of that coast recommend by my predecessor and already mature in the deliberation of the last congress i would suggest the expediency of connect the equipment of a public ship for the exploration of the whole northwest coast of this continent the establishment of a uniform standard of weight and measure be one of the specific object contemplate in the formation of we constitution and to fix that standard be one of the power delegate by express term in that instrument to congress the government of great britain and france have scarcely cease to be occupy with inquiry and speculation on the same subject since the existence of we constitution and with they it have expand into profound laborious and expensive research into the figure of the earth and the comparative length of the pendulum vibrate seconds in various latitudes from the equator to the pole these research have result in the composition and publication of several work highly interesting to the cause of science the experiment be yet in the process of performance some of they have recently be make on we own shore within the wall of one of we own college and partly by one of we own fellow-citizen it would be honorable to we country if the sequel of the same experiment should be countenance by the patronage of we government as they have hitherto be by those of france and britain connect with the establishment of a university or separate from it might be undertake the erection of a astronomical observatory with provision for the support of a astronomer to be in constant attendance of observation upon the phenomenon of the heaven and for the periodical publication of he observation it be with no feeling of pride as a american that the remark may be make that on the comparatively small territorial surface of europe there be exist upward of 130 of these light-house of the sky while throughout the whole american hemisphere there be not one if we reflect a moment upon the discovery which in the last four century have be make in the physical constitution of the universe by the means of these building and of observer station in they shall we doubt of they usefulness to every nation and while scarcely a year pass over we head without bring some new astronomical discovery to light which we must fain receive at second hand from europe be we not cut ourselves off from the means of return light for light while we have neither observatory nor observer upon we half of the globe and the earth revolve in perpetual darkness to we unsearching eye when on the 25th of October 1791 the first president of the united state announce to congress the result of the first enumeration of the inhabitant of this union he inform they that the return give the please assurance that the population of the united state border on 4000000 person at the distance of thirty year from that time the last enumeration five year since complete present a population border upon 10000000 perhaps of all the evidence of a prosperous and happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of population be the most unequivocal but the demonstration of we prosperity rest not alone upon this indication we commerce we wealth and the extent of we territory have increase in corresponding proportion and the number of independent community associate in we federal union have since that time nearly double the legislative representation of the state and people in the two house of congress have grow with the growth of they constituent body the house which then consist of 65 member now number upward of 200 the senate which consist of 26 member have now 48 but the executive and still more the judiciary department be yet in a great measure confine to they primitive organization and be now not adequate to the urgent want of a still grow community the naval armament which at a early period force themselves upon the necessity of the union soon lead to the establishment of a department of the navy but the department of foreign affair and of the interior which early after the formation of the government have be unite in one continue so unite to this time to the unquestionable detriment of the public service the multiplication of we relation with the nation and government of the old world have keep pace with that of we population and commerce while within the last ten year a new family of nation in we own hemisphere have arise among the inhabitant of the earth with whom we intercourse commercial and political would of itself furnish occupation to a active and industrious department the constitution of the judiciary experimental and imperfect as it be even in the infancy of we exist government be yet more inadequate to the administration of national justice at we present maturity nine year have elapse since a predecessor in this office now not the last the citizen who perhaps of all other throughout the union contribute most to the formation and establishment of we constitution in he valedictory address to congress immediately precede he retirement from public life urgently recommend the revision of the judiciary and the establishment of a additional executive department the exigency of the public service and its unavoidable deficiency as now in exercise have add yearly cumulative weight to the consideration present by he as persuasive to the measure and in recommend it to you deliberation i be happy to have the influence of he high authority in aid of the undoubting conviction of my own experience the law relate to the administration of the patent office be deserving of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some improvement the grant of power to regulate the action of congress upon this subject have specify both the end to be obtain and the means by which it be to be effect to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to they respective writings and discovery if a honest pride might be indulge in the reflection that on the record of that office be already find invention the usefulness of which have scarcely be transcend in the annals of human ingenuity would not its exultation be allay by the inquiry whether the law have effectively insure to the inventor the reward destine to they by the constitution -- even a limited term of exclusive right to they discovery on the 24th of December 1799 it be resolve by congress that a marble monument should be erect by the united state in the capitol at the city of washington that the family of general washington should be request to permit he body to be deposit under it and that the monument be so design as to commemorate the great event of he military and political life in remind congress of this resolution and that the monument contemplate by it remain yet without execution i shall indulge only the remark that the work at the capitol be approach to completion that the consent of the family desire by the resolution be request and obtain that a monument have be recently erect in this city over the remains of another distinguish patriot of the revolution and that a spot have be reserve within the wall where you be deliberate for the benefit of this and future age in which the mortal remains may be deposit of he whose spirit hover over you and listen with delight to every act of the representative of he nation which can tend to exalt and adorn he and they country the constitution under which you be assemble be a charter of limited power after full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the object which urge by a irresistible sense of my own duty i have recommend to you attention should you come to the conclusion that however desirable in themselves the enactment of law for effect they would transcend the power commit to you by that venerable instrument which we be all bind to support let no consideration induce you to assume the exercise of power not grant to you by the people but if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over the district of columbium if the power to lay and collect tax duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united state if the power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and with the indian tribe to fix the standard of weight and measure to establish post-office and post-road to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy to dispose of and make all heedful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united state and to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry these power into execution -- if these power and other enumerate in the constitution may be effectually bring into action by law promote the improvement of agriculture commerce and manufacture the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant art the advancement of literature and the progress of the science ornamental and profound to refrain from exercise they for the benefit of the people themselves would be to hide in the earth the talent commit to we charge -- would be treachery to the most sacred of trust the spirit of improvement be abroad upon the earth it stimulate the heart and sharpen the faculty not of we fellow-citizen alone but of the nation of europe and of they ruler while dwelling with please satisfaction upon the superior excellence of we political institution let we not be unmindful that liberty be power that the nation bless with the largest portion of liberty must in proportion to its number be the most powerful nation upon earth and that the tenure of power by man be in the moral purpose of he creator upon condition that it shall be exercise to end of beneficence to improve the condition of himself and he fellow-men while foreign nation less bless with that freedom which be power than ourselves be advance with gigantic stride in the career of public improvement be we to slumber in indolence or fold up we arm and proclaim to the world that we be palsy by the will of we constituent would it not be to cast away the bounty of providence and doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority in the course of the year now draw to its close we have behold under the auspices and at the expense of one state of this union a new university unfold its portal to the son of science and hold up the torch of human improvement to eye that seek the light we have see under the persevere and enlighten enterprise of another state the water of we western lake mingle with those of the ocean if undertaking like these have be accomplish in the compass of a few year by the authority of single member of we confederation can we the representative authority of the whole union fall behind we fellow-servant in the exercise of the trust commit to we for the benefit of we common sovereign by the accomplishment of work important to the whole and to which neither the authority nor the resource of any one state can be adequate finally fellow-citizen i shall await with cheer hope and faithful cooperation the result of you deliberation assure that without encroach upon the power reserve to the authority of the respective state or to the people you will with a due sense of you obligation to you country and of the high responsibility weigh upon yourselve give efficacy to the means commit to you for the common good and may he who search the heart of the child of man prosper you exertion to secure the blessing of peace and promote the highest welfare of we country john quincy adam special message washington _ December 14 1825 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit to the senate for they consideration and advice with regard to they ratification the follow treaty : 1 a treaty between the united state and the great and little osage tribe of indian conclude at st loui in the state of missourus on the 2d day of June last by william clark superintendent of indian affair commissioner on the part of the united state and the chief headman and warrior of the same tribe duly authorize and empower by they respective tribe or nation 2 a treaty between the united state and the kanzas nation of indian conclude at st loui in the state of missourus on the 3d day of June last by william clark superintendent of indian affair commissioner on the part of the united state and the chief headman and warrior of the say nation duly authorize and empower by the same 3 a convention between the united state and the shawnee nation of indian reside within the state of missourus sign at st loui in the state of missourus on the 7th day of November last by william clark superintendent of indian affair and the chief and headman of the say nation duly authorize and empower by the same john quincy adam washington _ December 15 1825 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit herewith to the senate for they consideration in reference to its ratification a general convention of peace amity commerce and navigation between the united state of america and the federation of the center of america sign at this place on the 5th instant by the secretary of state and the minister plenipotentiary from the republic of central america to the united state john quincy adam washington _ December 26 1825 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : in the message to both house of congress at the commencement of the session it be mention that the government of the republic of colombium of mexico and of central america have severally invite the government of the united state to be represent at the congress of american nation to be assemble at panama to deliberate upon object of peculiar concernment to this hemisphere and that this invitation have be accept although this measure be deem to be within the constitutional competency of the executive i have not think proper to take any step in it before ascertain that my opinion of its expediency will concur with that of both branch of the legislature first by the decision of the senate upon the nomination to be lay before they and secondly by the sanction of both house to the appropriation without which it can not be carry into effect a report from the secretary of state and copy of the correspondence with the south american government on this subject since the invitation give by they be herewith transmit to the senate they will disclose the object of importance which be expect to form a subject of discussion at this meeting in which interest of high importance to this union be involve it will be see that the united state neither intend nor be expect to take part in any deliberation of a belligerent character that the motive of they attendance be neither to contract alliance nor to engage in any undertaking or project import hostility to any other nation but the southern american nation in the infancy of they independence often find themselves in position with reference to other country with the principle applicable to which derivable from the state of independence itself they have not be familiarize by experience the result of this have be that sometimes in they intercourse with the united state they have manifest disposition to reserve a right of grant special favor and privilege to the spanish nation as the price of they recognition at other they have actually establish duty and imposition operate unfavorably to the united state to the advantage of other european power and sometimes they have appear to consider that they might interchange among themselves mutual concession of exclusive favor to which neither european power nor the united state should be admit in most of these case they regulation unfavorable to we have yield to friendly expostulation and remonstrance but it be believe to be of infinite moment that the principle of a liberal commercial intercourse should be exhibit to they and urge with disinterested and friendly persuasion upon they when all assemble for the avowed purpose of consult together upon the establishment of such principle as may have a important bearing upon they future welfare the consentaneous adoption of principle of maritime neutrality and favorable to the navigation of peace and commerce in time of war will also form a subject of consideration to this congress the doctrine that free ship make free goods and the restriction of reason upon the extent of blockade may be establish by general agreement with far more ease and perhaps with less danger by the general engagement to adhere to they concerted at such a meeting than by partial treaty or convention with each of the nation separately a agreement between all the party represent at the meeting that each will guard by its own means against the establishment of any future european colony within its border may be find advisable this be more than two year since announce by my predecessor to the world as a principle result from the emancipation of both the american continent it may be so develop to the new southern nation that they will all feel it as a essential appendage to they independence there be yet another subject upon which without

large majority of the chief of the creek nation and with a reasonable prospect of immediate acquiescence by the remainder this expectation have not merely be disappoint the first measure for carry the treaty into execution have scarcely be take when the two principal chief who have sign it fall victim to the exasperation of the great mass of the nation and they family and dependent far from be able to execute the engagement on they part flee for life safety and subsistence from the territory which they have assume to cede to we own yet in this fugitive condition and while subsist on the bounty of the united state they have be find advance pretension to receive exclusively to themselves the whole of the sum stipulate by the commissioner of the united state in payment _ for all _ the land of the creek nation which be cede by the term of the treaty and they have claim the stipulation of the eighth article that the united state would _ protect _ the emigrate party against the encroachment

depend upon the will not of one but of both the party to it the party on the face of the treaty be the united state and the creek nation and however desirous one of they may be to give it effect this

absolved from all its engagement on they part and the alternative leave they be either to resort to measure of war to secure by force the advantage stipulate to they in the treaty or to attempt the

impracticable and although the excepted portion be of comparatively small amount and importance i have assent to its exception so far as to place it before the senate only from a conviction that between it and a resort to the forcible expulsion of the creek from they habitation and land within the state of georgium there be no middle term the deputation with which this treaty have be conclude consist of the principal chief of the nation -- able not only to negotiate but to carry into effect the stipulation to which they have agree there be a deputation also here from the small party which undertake to contract for the whole nation at the treaty of the 12th of February but the number of which accord to the information collect by general gaine do not exceed 400 they represent themselves indeed to be far more numerous but whatever they number may be they interest have be provide for in the treaty now submit they subscription to it would also have be receive but for unreasonable pretension raise by they after all the arrangement of the treaty have be agree upon and it be actually sign whatever they merit may have be in the facility with which they cede all the land of they nation within the state of georgium they utter inability to perform the engagement which they so readily contract and the exorbitancy of they demand when compare with the inefficiency of they own means of performance leave they with no claim upon the united state other than of impartial and rigorous justice in refer to the impression under which i ratify the treaty of the 12th of February last i do not deem it necessary to decide upon the propriety of the manner in which it be negotiate deeply regret the recrimination and recrimination to which these event have give rise i believe the public interest will best be consult by discard they altogether from the discussion of the subject the great body of the creek nation inflexibly refuse to acknowledge or to execute that treaty upon this ground it will be set aside should the senate advise and consent to the ratification of that now communicate without look back to the means by which the other be effect and in the adjustment of the term of the present treaty i have be peculiarly anxious to dispense a measure of great liberality to both party of the creek nation rather than to extort from they a bargain of which the advantage

sister republic of this hemisphere the great revolution in human affair which have bring into existence nearly at the same time eight sovereign and independent nation in we own quarter of the globe have place the united state in a situation not less novel and scarcely less interesting than that in which they have find themselves by they own transition from a cluster of colony to a nation of sovereign state the deliverance of the southern american republic from the oppression under which they have be so long afflict be hail with great unanimity by the people of this union as among the most auspicious event of the age on the 4th of may 1822 a act of congress make a appropriation of $ 100000 for such mission to the independent nation on the american continent as the president of the

frankness and good will toward those nation he give countenance to they design of invite the united state to this high assembly for consultation upon _ american interest _ it be not consider a conclusive reason for decline this invitation that the proposal for assemble such a congress have not first be make by ourselves it have spring from the urgent immediate and momentous common interest of the great community struggle for independence and as it be quicken into life from they the proposition to we appear respectful and friendly from we to they it could scarcely have be make without expose ourselves to suspicion of purpose of ambition if not of domination more suit to rouse resistance and excite distrust than to conciliate favor and friendship the first and paramount principle upon which it be deem wise and just to lay the corner stone of all we future relation with they be _ disinterestedness _ the next be cordial good will to they the third be a claim of fair and equal

have give we notice that in the novelty of they situation and in the spirit of deference to we experience they would be please to have the benefit of we friendly counsel to meet the temper with which this proposal be make with a cold repulse be not think congenial to that warm interest in they welfare with which the people and government of the union have hitherto go hand in hand through the whole progress of they revolution to insult they by a refusal of they overture and then invite they to a similar assembly to be call by ourselves be a expedient which never present itself to the mind i would have send minister to the meeting have it be merely to give they such advice as they might have desire even with reference to _ they own _ interest not involve ours i would have send they have it be merely to explain and set forth to they we reason for _ decline _ any proposal of specific measure to which they might desire we concurrence but which we might deem incompatible with we interest or we duty in the intercourse between nation temper be a missionary perhaps more powerful than talent nothing be ever lose by kind treatment nothing can be gain by sullen repuls and aspire pretension but object of the highest importance not only to the future welfare of the whole human race but bear directly upon the special interest of this union _ will _ engage the deliberation of the congress of panama whether we be represent there or not other if we be represent may be offer by we plenipotentiary for consideration have in view both these great result -- we own interest and the improvement

power by participate in the deliberation of this congress among the topic enumerate in official papers publish by the republic of colombium and advert to in the correspondence now communicate to the house as intend to be present for discussion at panama there be scarcely one in which the _ result _ of the meeting will not deeply affect the interest of the united state even those in which the belligerent state alone will take a active part will have a powerful effect upon the state of we relation with the american and probably with the principal european state be it merely that we might be correctly and speedily inform of the proceedings of the congress and of the progress and issue of they negotiation i should hold it advisable that we should have a accredit agency with they place in such confidential relation with the other member as would insure the authenticity and the safe and early transmission of its report of the same enumerated topic be the preparation of a manifesto setting forth to the world the justice of they cause and the relation they desire to hold with other christian power and to form a convention of navigation and commerce applicable both to the confederated state and to they ally it will be within the recollection of the house that immediately after the close of the war of we independence a measure closely analogous to this congress of panama be adopt by the congress of we confederation and for purpose of precisely the same character three commissioner with plenipotentiary power be appoint to negotiate treaty of amity navigation and commerce with all the principal power of europe they meet and reside for that purpose about one year at paris and the only result of they negotiation at that time be the first treaty between the united state and prussium -- memorable in the diplomatic annals of the world and precious as a monument of the principle in relation to commerce and maritime warfare with which we country enter upon she career as a member of the great family of independent nation this treaty prepare in conformity with the instruction of the american plenipotentiary consecrate three fundamental principle of the foreign intercourse which the congress of that period be desirous of establish : first equal reciprocity and the mutual stipulation of the privilege of the most favored nation in the commercial exchange of peace secondly the abolition of private war upon the ocean and thirdly restriction favorable to neutral commerce upon belligerent practice with regard to contraband of war and blockade a painful it may be say a calamitous experience of more than forty year have demonstrate the deep importance of these same principle to the peace and prosperity of this nation and to the welfare of all maritime state and have illustrate the profound wisdom with which they be assume as cardinal point of the policy of the union at that time in the infancy of they political existence under the influence of those principle of liberty and of right so congenial to the cause in which they have just fight and triumph they be able but to obtain the sanction of one great and philosophical though absolute sovereign in europe to they liberal and enlighten principle they could obtain no more since then a political hurricane have go over three-fourth of the civilized portion of the earth the desolation of which it may with confidence be expect be pass away leave at least the american atmosphere purify and refresh and now at this propitious moment the new-born nation of this hemisphere assemble by they representative at the isthmus between its two continent to settle the principle of they future international intercourse with other nation and with we ask in this great exigency for we advice upon those very fundamental maxim which we from we cradle at first proclaimed and partially succeed to introduce into the code of national law without recur to that total prostration of all neutral and commercial rights which mark the progress of the late european war and which finally involve the united state in they and advert only to we political relation with these american nation it be observable that while in all other respects those relation have be uniformly and without exception of the most friendly and mutually satisfactory character the only cause of difference and dissension between we and they which ever have arise originate in those never-failing fountain of discord and irritation -- discrimination of commercial favor to other nation licentious privateer and paper blockade i can not without do injustice to the republic of bueno ayre and colombium forbear to acknowledge the candid and conciliatory spirit with which they have repeatedly yield to we friendly representation and remonstrance on these subject -- in repeal discriminative law which operate to we disadvantage and in revoke the commission of they privateer to which colombium have add the magnanimity of make reparation for unlawful capture by some of she cruiser and of assent in the midst of war to treaty stipulation favorable to neutral navigation but the recurrence of these occasion of complaint have render the renewal of the discussion which result in the removal of they necessary while in the meantime injury be sustain by merchant and other individual of the united state which can not be repair and the remedy linger in overtake the pernicious operation of the mischief the settlement of general principle pervade with equal efficacy all the american state can alone put a end to these evil and can alone be accomplish at the propose assembly if it be true that the noblest treaty of peace ever mention in history be that by which the carthagenian be bind to abolish the practice of sacrifice they own child _ because it be stipulate in favor of human nature _ i can not exaggerate to myself the unfading glory with which these unite state will go forth in the memory of future age if by they friendly counsel by they moral influence by the power of argument and persuasion alone they can prevail upon the american nation at panama to stipulate by general agreement among themselves and so far as any of they may be concern the perpetual abolition of private war upon the ocean and if we can not yet flatter ourselves that this may be accomplish as advance toward it the establishment of the principle that the friendly flag shall cover the cargo the curtailment of contraband of war and the proscription of fictitious paper blockade -- engagement which we may reasonably hope will not prove impracticable -- will if successfully inculcate redound proportionally to we honor and drain the fountain of many a future sanguinary war the late president of the united state in he message to congress of the 2d December 1823 while announce the negotiation then pend with russium relate to the northwest coast of this continent observe that the occasion of the discussion to which that incident have give rise have be take for assert as a principle in which the rights and interest of the united state be involve that the american continent by the free and independent condition which they have assume and maintain be thenceforward not to be consider as subject for future colonization by any european power the principle have first be assume in that negotiation with russium it rest upon a course of reasoning equally simple and conclusive with the exception of the exist european colony which it be in nowise intend to disturb the two continent consist of several sovereign and independent nation whose territory cover they whole surface by this they independent condition the united state enjoy the right of commercial intercourse with every part of they possession to attempt the establishment of a colony in those possession would be to usurp to the exclusion of other a commercial intercourse which be the common possession of all it could not be do without encroach upon exist rights of the united state the government of russium have never dispute these position nor manifest the slightest dissatisfaction at they have be take most of the new american republic have declare they entire assent to they and they now propose among the subject of consultation at panama to take into consideration the means of make effectual the assertion of that principle as well as the means of resist interference from abroad with the domestic concern of the american government in allude to these mean it would obviously be premature at this time to anticipate that which be offer merely as matter for consultation or to pronounce upon those measure which have be or may be suggest the purpose of this government be to concur in none which would import hostility to europe or justly excite resentment in any of she state should it be deem advisable to contract any conventional engagement on this topic we view would extend no further than to a mutual pledge of the party to the compact to maintain the principle in application to its own territory and to permit no colonial lodgment or establishment of european jurisdiction upon its own soil and with respect to the obtrusive interference from abroad -- if its future character may be infer from that which have be and perhaps still be exercise in more than one of the new state -- a joint declaration of its character and exposure of it to the world may be probably all that the occasion would require whether the united state should or should not be party to such a declaration may justly form a part of the deliberation that there be a evil to be remedy heed little insight into the secret history of late year to know and that this remedy may best be concerted at the panama meeting deserve at least the experiment of consideration a concert of measure have reference to the more effectual abolition of the african slave trade and the consideration of the light in which the political condition of the island of haytus be to be regard be also among the subject mention by the minister from the republic of colombium as believe to be suitable for deliberation at the congress the failure of the negotiation with that republic undertake during the late administration for the suppression of that trade in compliance with a resolution of the house of representative indicate the expediency of listen with respectful attention to proposition which may contribute to the accomplishment of the great end which be the purpose of that resolution while the result of those negotiation will serve as admonition to abstain from pledge this government to any arrangement which might be expect to fail of obtain the advice and consent of the senate by a constitutional majority to its ratification whether the political condition of the island of haytus shall be bring at all into discussion at the meeting may be a question for preliminary advisement there be in the political constitution of government of that people circumstance which have hitherto forbid the acknowledgment of they by the government of the united state as sovereign and independent additional reason for withhold that acknowledgment have recently be see in they acceptance of a nominal sovereignty by the _ grant _ of a foreign prince under condition equivalent to the concession by they of exclusive commercial advantage to one nation adapt altogether to the state of colonial vassalage and retain little of independence but the name we plenipotentiary will be instruct to present these view to the assembly at panama and should they not be concur in to decline accede to any arrangement which may be propose upon different principle the condition of the island of cuba and porto rico be of deeper import and more immediate bearing upon the present interest and future prospects of we union the correspondence herewith transmit will show how earnestly it have engage the attention of this government the invasion of both those island by the united force of mexico and colombium be avowedly among the object to be mature by the belligerent state at panama the convulsion to which from the peculiar composition of they population they would be liable in the event of such a invasion and the danger therefrom result of they fall ultimately into the hand of some european power other than spain will not admit of we look at the consequence to which the congress at panama may lead with indifference it be unnecessary to enlarge upon this topic or to say more than that all we effort in reference to this interest will be to preserve the exist state of thing the tranquillity of the island and the peace and security of they inhabitant and lastly the congress of panama be believe to present a fair occasion for urge upon all the new nation of the south the just and liberal principle of religious liberty not by any interference whatever in they internal concern but by claim for we citizen whose occupation or interest may call they to occasional residence in they territory the inestimable privilege of worship they creator accord to the dictate of they own conscience this privilege sanction by the customary law of nation and secure by treaty stipulation in numerous national compact secure even to we own citizen in the treaty with colombium and with the federation of central america be yet to be obtain in the other south american state and mexico exist prejudice be still struggle against it which may perhaps be more successfully combate at this general meeting than at the separate seat of government of each republic i can scarcely deem it otherwise than superfluous to observe that the assembly will be in its nature diplomatic and not legislative that nothing can be transact there obligatory upon any one of the state to be represent at the meeting unless with the express concurrence of its own representative nor even then but subject to the ratification of its constitutional authority at home the faith of the united state to foreign power can not otherwise be pledge i shall indeed in the first instance consider the assembly as merely _ consultative _ and although the plenipotentiary of the united state will be empower to receive and refer to the consideration of they government any proposition from the other party to the meeting they will be authorize to conclude nothing unless subject to the definitive sanction of this government in all its constitutional form it have therefore seem to I unnecessary to insist that every object to be discuss at the meeting should be specify with the precision of a judicial sentence or enumerate with the exactness of a mathematical demonstration the purpose of the meeting itself be to deliberate upon the great and common _ interest _ of several new and neighbouring nation if the measure be new and without precedent so be the situation of the party to it that the purpose of the meeting be somewhat indefinite far from be a objection to it be among the cogent reason for its adoption it be not the establishment of principle of intercourse with one but with seven or eight nation at once that before they have have the means of exchange idea and communicate with one another in common upon these topic they should have definitively settle and arrange they in concert be to require that the effect should precede the cause it be to exact as a preliminary to the meeting that for the accomplishment of which the meeting itself be design among the inquiry which be think entitle to consideration before the determination be take to accept the invitation be that whether the measure might not have a tendency to change the policy hitherto invariably pursue by the united state of avoid all entangle alliance and all unnecessary foreign connection mindful of the advice give by the father of we country in he farewell address that the great rule of conduct for we in regard to foreign nation be in extend we commercial relation to have with they as little political connection as possible and faithfully adhering to the spirit of that admonition i can not overlook the reflection that the counsel of washington in that instance like all the counsel of wisdom be found upon the circumstance in which we country and the world around we be situate at the time when it be give that the reason assign by he for he advice be that europe have a set of primary interest which to we have none or a very remote relation that hence she must be engage in frequent controversy the cause of which be essentially foreign to we concern that we _ detach _ and _ distant _ situation invite and enable we to pursue a different course that by we union and rapid growth with a efficient government the period be not far distant when we might defy material injury from external annoyance when we might take such a attitude as would cause we neutrality to be respect and with reference to belligerent nation might choose peace or war as we interest guide by justice should counsel compare we situation and the circumstance of that time with those of the present day and what from the very word of washington then would be he counsel to he countryman now europe have still she set of primary interest with which we have little or a remote relation we distant and detach situation with reference to europe remain the same but we be then the only independent nation of this hemisphere and we be surround by european colony with the greater part of which we have no more intercourse than with the inhabitant of another planet those colony have now be transform into eight independent nation extend to we very border seven of they republic like ourselves with whom we have a immensely grow commercial and _ must _ have and have already important political connection with reference to whom we situation be neither distant nor detach whose political principle and system of government congenial with we own must and will have a action and counteraction upon we and ours to which we can not be indifferent if we would the rapidity of we growth and the consequent increase of we strength have more than realize the anticipation of this admirable political legacy thirty year have nearly elapse since it be write and in the interval we population we wealth we territorial extension we power -- physical and moral -- have nearly treble reasoning upon this state of thing from the sound and judicious principle of washington must we not say that the period which he predict as then not far off have arrive that _ america _ have a set of primary interest which have none or a remote relation to europe that the interference of europe therefore in those concern should be spontaneously withhold by she upon the same principle that we have never interfere with hers and that if she should interfere as she may by measure which may have a great and dangerous recoil upon ourselves we might be call in defense of we own altar and fireside to take a attitude which would cause we neutrality to be respect and choose peace or war as we interest guide by justice should counsel the acceptance of this invitation therefore far from conflict with the counsel or the policy of washington be directly deducible from and conformable to it nor be it less conformable to the view of my immediate predecessor as declare in he annual message to congress of the 2d December 1823 to which i have already advert and to a important passage of which i invite the attention of the house : the citizen of the united state -lrb- say he -rrb- cherish sentiment the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of they fellow-man on that -lrb- the european -rrb- side of the atlantic in the war of the european power in matter relate to themselves we have never take any part nor do it comport with we policy so to do it be only when we rights be invade or seriously menace that we resent injury or make preparation for we defense with the movement in this hemisphere we be of necessity more immediately connect and by cause which must be obvious to all enlighten and impartial observer the political system of the ally power be essentially different in this respect from that of america this difference proceed from that which exist in they respective government and to the defense of we own which have be achieve by the loss of so much blood and treasure and mature by the wisdom of they most enlighten citizen and under which we have enjoy unexampled felicity this whole nation be devote we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relation subsist between the united state and those power to declare that we should consider any attempt on they part to extend they system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to we peace and safety with the exist colony or dependency of any european power we have not interfere and shall not interfere but with the government who have declare they independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principle acknowledge we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppress they or control in any other manner they destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of a unfriendly disposition toward the united state in the war between those new government and spain we declare we neutrality at the time of they recognition and to this we have adhere and shall continue to adhere provide no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authority of this government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the united state indispensable to they security to the question which may be ask whether this meeting and the principle which may be adjust and settle by it as rule of intercourse between the american nation may not give umbrage to the holy league of european power or offense to spain it be deem a sufficient answer that we attendance at panama can give _ no just cause _ of umbrage or offense to either and that the united state will stipulate nothing there which can give such cause here the right of inquiry into we purpose and measure must stop the holy league of europe itself be form without inquire of the united state whether it would or would not give umbrage to they the fear of give umbrage to the holy league of europe be urge as a motive for deny to the american nation the acknowledgment of they independence that it would be view by spain as hostility to she be not only urge but directly declare by herself the congress and administration of that day consult they rights and duty and not they fear fully determine to give no heedless displeasure to any foreign power the united state can estimate the probability of they give it only by the right which any foreign state could have to take it from they measure neither the representation of the united state at panama nor any measure to which they assent may be yield there will give to the holy league or any of its member nor to spain the right to take offense for the rest the united state must still as heretofore take counsel from they duty rather than they fear such be the object in which it be expect that the plenipotentiary of the united state when commission to attend the meeting at the isthmus will take part and such be the motive and purpose with which the invitation of the three republic be accept it be however as the house will perceive from the correspondence accept only upon condition that the nomination of commissioner for the mission should receive the advice and consent of the senate the concurrence of the house to the measure by the appropriation necessary for carry it into effect be alike subject to its free determination and indispensable to the fulfillment of the intention that the congress at panama will accomplish all or even any of the transcendent benefit to the human race which warm the conception of its first proposer it be perhaps indulge too sanguine a forecast of event to promise it be in its nature a measure speculative and experimental the blessing of heaven may turn it to the account of human improvement accident unforeseen and mischance not to be anticipate may baffle all its high purpose and disappoint its fairest expectation but the design be great be benevolent be humane it look to the melioration of the condition of man it be congenial with that spirit which prompt the declaration of we independence which inspire the preamble of we first treaty with france which dictate we first treaty with prussium and the instruction under which it be negotiate which fill the heart and fire the soul of the immortal founder of we revolution with this

relation we have peace without and tranquillity within we border we be as a people increase with unabated rapidity in population wealth and national resource and whatever difference of opinion exist among we with regard to the mode and the means by which we shall turn the beneficence of heaven to the improvement of we own condition there be yet a spirit animate we all which will not suffer the bounty of providence to be shower upon we in vain but will receive they with grateful heart and apply they with unwearied hand to the advancement of the general good of the subject recommend to congress at they last session some be then definitively act upon other leave unfinished but partly mature will recur to you attention without heed a renewal of notice from I the purpose of this communication will be to present to you view the general aspect of we public affair at this moment and the measure which have be take to carry into effect the intention of the legislature as signify by the law then and heretofore enact in we intercourse with the other nation of the earth we have still the happiness of enjoy peace and a general good understanding qualify however in several important instance by collision of interest and by unsatisfied claim of justice to the settlement of which the constitutional interposition of the legislative authority may become ultimately indispensable by the decease of the emperor alexander of russium which occur contemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of congress the united state have be deprive of a long-tried steady and faithful friend bear to the inheritance of absolute power and train in the school of adversity from which no power on earth however absolute be exempt that monarch from he youth have be teach to feel the force and value of public opinion and to be sensible that the interest of he own government would best be promote by a frank and friendly intercourse with this republic as those of he people would be advance by a liberal commercial intercourse with we country a candid and confidential interchange of sentiment between he and the government of the united state upon the affair of southern america take place at a period not long precede he demise and contribute to fix that course of policy which leave to the other government of europe no alternative but that of sooner or later recognize the independence of we southern neighbor of which the example have by the united state already be set the ordinary diplomatic communication between he successor the emperor nichola and the united state have suffer some interruption by the illness departure and subsequent decease of he minister reside here who enjoy as he merit the entire confidence of he new sovereign as he have eminently respond to that of he predecessor but we have have the most satisfactory assurance that the sentiment of the reign emperor toward the united state be altogether conformable to those which have so long and constantly animated he imperial brother and we have reason to hope that they will serve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the two nation which found in congenial interest can not but result in the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both we relation of commerce and navigation with france be by the operation of the convention of 24th of June 1822 with that nation in a state of gradual and progressive improvement convince by all we experience no less than by the principle of fair and liberal reciprocity which the united state have constantly tender to all the nation of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which they would universally prefer that fair and equal competition be most conducive to the interest of both party the united state in the negotiation of that convention earnestly contend for a mutual renunciation of discriminate duty and charge in the port of the two country unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this principle in its full extent after reduce the duty of discrimination so far as be find attainable it be agree that at the expiration of two year from the 1st of October 1822 when the convention be to go into effect unless a notice of six month on either side should be give to the other that the convention itself must terminate those duty should be reduce one-fourth and that this reduction should be yearly repeat until all discrimination should cease while the convention itself should continue in force by the effect of this stipulation three-fourth of the discriminate duty which have be levy by each party upon the vessel of the other in its port have already be remove and on the 1st of next October should the convention be still in force the remain fourth will be discontinue french vessel laden with french produce will be receive in we port on the same term as we own and ours in return will enjoy the same advantage in the port of france by these approximation to a equality of duty and of charge not only have the commerce between the two country prosper but friendly disposition have be on both side encourage and promote they will continue to be cherish and cultivate on the part of the united state it would have be gratify to have have it in my power to add that the claim upon the justice of the french government involve the property and the comfortable subsistence of many of we fellow-citizen and which have be so long and so earnestly urge be in a more promising train of adjustment than at you last meeting but they condition remain unaltered with the government of the netherland the mutual abandonment of discriminate duty have be regulate by legislative act on both side the act of congress of the 20th of April 1818 abolish all discriminate duty of impost and tonnage upon the vessel and produce of the netherland in the port of the united state upon the assurance give by the government of the netherland that all such duty operate against the shipping and commerce of the united state in that kingdom have be abolish these reciprocal regulation have continue in force several year when the discriminate principle be resume by the netherland in a new and indirect form by a bounty of 10 per cent in the shape of a return of duty to they national vessel and in which those of the united state be not permit to participate by the act of congress of 7th January 1824 all discriminate duty in the united state be again suspend so far as related to the vessel and produce of the netherland so long as the reciprocal exemption should be extend to the vessel and produce of the united state in the netherland but the same act provide that in the event of a restoration of discriminate duty to operate against the shipping and commerce of the united state in any of the foreign country refer to therein the suspension of discriminate duty in favor of the navigation of such foreign country should cease and all the provision of the act impose discriminate foreign tonnage and impost duty in the united state should revive and be in full force with regard to that nation in the correspondence with the government of the netherland upon this subject they have contend that the favor show to they own shipping by this bounty upon they tonnage be not to be consider as a discriminate duty but it can not be deny that it produce all the same effect have the mutual abolition be stipulate by treaty such a bounty upon the national vessel could scarcely have be grant consistently with good faith yet as the act of congress of 7th January 1824 have not expressly authorize the executive authority to determine what shall be consider as a revival of discriminate duty by a foreign government to the disadvantage of the united state and as the retaliatory measure on we part however just and necessary may tend rather to that conflict of legislation which we deprecate than to that concert to which we invite all commercial nation as most conducive to they interest and we own i have think it more consistent with the spirit of we institution to refer the subject again to the paramount authority of the legislature to decide what measure the emergency may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect the minatory provision of the act of 1824 during the last session of congress treaty of amity navigation and commerce be negotiate and sign at this place with the government of denmark in europe and with the federation of central america in this hemisphere these treaty then receive the constitutional sanction of the senate by the advice and consent to they ratification they be accordingly ratify on the part of the united state and during the recess of congress have be also ratify by the other respective contracting party the ratification have be exchange and they have be publish by proclamation copy of which be herewith communicate to congress these treaty have establish between the contracting party the principle of equality and reciprocity in they broadest and most liberal extent each party admit the vessel of the other into its port laden with cargo the produce or manufacture of any quarter of the globe upon the payment of the same duty of tonnage and impost that be chargeable upon they own they have further stipulate that the party shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to any other nation which shall not upon the same term be grant to each other and that neither party will impose upon article of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other any other or higher duty than upon the like article be the produce or manufacture of any other country to these principle there be in the convention with denmark a exception with regard to the colony of that kingdom in the arctic sea but none with regard to she colony in the west indy in the course of the last summer the term to which we last commercial treaty with sweden be limit have expire a continuation of it be in the contemplation of the swedish government and be believe to be desirable on the part of the united state it have be propose by the king of sweden that pend the negotiation of renewal the expire treaty should be mutually consider as still in force a measure which will require the sanction of congress to be carry into effect on we part and which i therefore recommend to you consideration with prussium spain portugal and in general all the european power between whom and the united state relation of friendly intercourse have exist they condition have not materially vary since the last session of congress i regret not to be able to say the same of we commercial intercourse with the colonial possession of great britain in america negotiation of the highest importance to we common interest have be for several year in discussion between the two government and on the part of the united state have be invariably pursue in the spirit of candor and conciliation interest of great magnitude and delicacy have be adjust by the convention of 1815 and 1818 while that of 1822 mediate by the late emperor alexander have promise a satisfactory compromise of claim which the government of the united state in justice to the rights of a numerous class of they citizen be bind to sustain but with regard to the commercial intercourse between the united state and the british colony in america it have be hitherto find impracticable to bring the party to a understanding satisfactory to both the relative geographical position and the respective product of nature cultivate by human industry have constitute the element of a commercial intercourse between the united state and british america insular and continental important to the inhabitant of both country but it have be interdict by great britain upon a principle heretofore practice upon by the colonize nation of europe of hold the trade of they colony each in exclusive monopoly to herself after the termination of the late war this interdiction have be revive and the british government decline include this portion of we intercourse with she possession in the negotiation of the convention of 1815 the trade be then carry on exclusively in british vessel till the act of congress concern navigation of 1818 and the supplemental act of 1820 meet the interdict by a corresponding measure on the part of the united state these measure not of retaliation but of necessary self-defense be soon succeed by a act of parliament open certain colonial port to the vessel of the united state come directly from they and to the importation from they of certain article of we produce burden with heavy duty and exclude some of the most valuable article of we export the united state open they port to british vessel from the colony upon term as exactly correspond with those of the act of parliament as in the relative position of the party could be make and a negotiation be commence by mutual consent with the hope on we part that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment of the importance of the trade to the interest of the inhabitant of the two country between whom it must be carry on would ultimately bring the party to a compromise with which both might be satisfy with this view the government of the united state have determine to sacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial arrangement with foreign power they be entitle to demand and to acquiesce in some inequality disadvantageous to ourselves rather than to forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this interest to the satisfaction of great britain herself the negotiation repeatedly suspend by accidental circumstance be however by mutual agreement and express assent consider as pend and to be speedily resume in the meantime another act of parliament so doubtful and ambiguous in its import as to have be misunderstand by the officer in the colony who be to carry it into execution open again certain colonial port upon new condition and term with a threat to close they against any nation which may not accept those term as prescribe by the british government this act pass in July 1825 not communicate to the government of the united state not understand by the british officer of the custom in the colony where it be to be enforce be nevertheless submit to the consideration of congress at they last session with the knowledge that a negotiation upon the subject have long be in progress and pledge give of its resumption at a early day it be deem expedient to await the result of that negotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to term the import of which be not clear and which the british authority themselves in this hemisphere be not prepare to explain immediately after the close of the last session of congress one of we most distinguished citizen be dispatch as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to great britain furnish with instruction which we could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this long-controverted interest upon term acceptable to great britain upon he arrival and before he have deliver he letter of credence he be meet by a order of the british council exclude from and after the 1st of December now current the vessel of the united state from all the colonial british port except those immediately border on we territory in answer to he expostulation upon a measure thus unexpected he be inform that accord to the ancient maxim of policy of european nation have colony they trade be a exclusive possession of the mother country that all participation in it by other nation be a boon or favor not form a subject of negotiation but to be regulate by the legislative act of the power own the colony that the british government therefore decline negotiating concern it and that as the united state do not forthwith accept purely and simply the term offer by the act of parliament of July 1825 great britain would not now admit the vessel of the united state even upon the term on which she have open they to the navigation of other nation we have be accustom to consider the trade which we have enjoy with the british colony rather as a interchange of mutual benefit than as a mere favor receive that under every circumstance we have give a ample equivalent we have see every other nation hold colony negotiate with other nation and grant they freely admission to the colony by treaty and so far be the other colonize nation of europe now from refuse to negotiate for trade with they colony that we ourselves have secure access to the colony of more than one of they by treaty the refusal however of great britain to negotiate leaf to the united state no other alternative than that of regulate or interdict altogether the trade on they part accord as either measure may affect the interest of we own country and with that exclusive object i would recommend the whole subject to you calm and candid deliberation it be hope that we unavailing exertion to accomplish a cordial good understanding on this interest will not have a unpropitious effect upon the other great topic of discussion between the two government we northeastern and northwestern boundary be still unadjusted the commissioner under the seventh article of the treaty of ghent have nearly come to the close of they labor nor can we renounce the expectation enfeebled as it be that they may agree upon they report to the satisfaction or acquiescence of both party the commission for liquidate the claim for indemnity for slave carry away after the close of the war have be sit with doubtful prospects of success proposition of compromise have however pass between the two government the result of which we flatter ourselves may yet prove satisfactory we own disposition and purpose toward great britain be all friendly and conciliatory nor can we abandon but with strong reluctance the belief that they will ultimately meet a return not of favor which we neither ask nor desire but of equal reciprocity and good will with the american government of this hemisphere we continue to maintain a intercourse altogether friendly and between they nation and ours that commercial interchange of which mutual benefit be the source and mutual comfort and harmony the result be in a continual state of improvement the war between spain and they since the total expulsion of the spanish military force from they continental territory have be little more than nominal and they internal tranquillity though occasionally menace by the agitation which civil war never fail to leave behind they have not be affect by any serious calamity the congress of minister from several of those nation which assemble at panama after a short session there adjourn to meet again at a more favorable season in the neighborhood of mexico the decease of one of we minister on he way to the isthmus and the impediment of the season which delay the departure of the other deprive we of the advantage of be represent at the first meeting of the congress there be however no reason to believe that any of the transaction of the congress be of a nature to affect injuriously the interest of the united state or to require the interposition of we minister have they be present they absence have indeed deprive we of the opportunity of possess precise and authentic information of the treaty which be conclude at panama and the whole result have confirm I in the conviction of the expediency to the united state of be represent at the congress the survive member of the mission appoint during you last session have accordingly proceed to he destination and a successor to he distinguished and lament associate will be nominate to the senate a treaty of amity navigation and commerce have in the course of the last summer be conclude by we minister plenipotentiary at mexico with the united state of that confederacy which will also be lay before the senate for they advice with regard to its ratification in adverting to the present condition of we fiscal concern and to the prospects of we revenue the first remark that call we attention be that they be less exuberantly prosperous than they be at the corresponding period of the last year the severe shock so extensively sustain by the commercial and manufacturing interest in great britain have not be without a perceptible recoil upon ourselves a reduce importation from abroad be necessarily succeed by a reduce return to the treasury at home the net revenue of the present year will not equal that of the last and the receipt of that which be to come will fall short of those in the current year the diminution however be in part attributable to the flourishing condition of some of we domestic manufacture and so far be compensate by a equivalent more profitable to the nation it be also highly gratifying to perceive that the deficiency in the revenue while it scarcely exceed the anticipation of the last year 's estimate from the treasury have not interrupt the application of more than eleven million during the present year to the discharge of the principal and interest of the debt nor the reduction of upward of seven million of the capital of the debt itself the balance in the treasury on the 1st of January last be $ 520165043 the receipt from that time to the 30th of September last be $ 1958593250 the receipt of the current quarter estimate at $ 6000000 yield with the sum already receive a revenue of about twenty-five million and a half for the year the expenditure for the three first quarter of the year have amount to $ 1871422666 the expenditure of the current quarter be expect include the two million of the principal of the debt to be pay to balance the receipt so that the expense of the year amount to upward of a million less than its income will leave a proportionally increase balance in the treasury on the 1st of January 1827 over that of the 1st of January last instead of $ 5200000 there will be $ 6400000 the amount of duty secure on merchandise import from the commencement of the year till September 30 be estimate at $ 21250000 and the amount that will probably accrue during the present quarter be estimate at $ 4250000 make for the whole year $ 25500000 from which the drawback be deduct will leave a clear revenue from the custom receivable in the year 1827 of about $ 20400000 which with the sum to be receive from the proceeds of public land the bank dividend and other incidental receipt will form a aggregate of about $ 23000000 a sum fall short of the whole expense of the present year little more than the portion of those expenditure apply to the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of $ 10000000 by the act of the 3d march 1817 at the passage of that act the public debt amount to $ 123500000 on the 1st of January next it will be short of $ 74000000 in the lapse of these ten year $ 50000000 of public debt with the annual charge of upward of $ 3000000 of interest upon they have be extinguish at the passage of that act of the annual appropriation of ten million seven be absorb in the payment of interest and not more than three million go to reduce the capital of the debt of the same ten million at this time scarcely four be applicable to the interest and upward of six be effective in melt down the capital yet we experience have prove that a revenue consist so largely of impost and tonnage ebb and flow to a extraordinary extent with all the fluctuation incident to the general commerce of the world it be within we recollection that even in the compass of the same last ten year the receipt of the treasury be not adequate to the expenditure of the year and that in two successive year it be find necessary to resort to loan to meet the engagement of the nation the return tide of the succeed year replenish the public coffer until they have again begin to feel the vicissitude of a decline to produce these alternation of fullness and exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or unfruitful season the regulation of foreign government political revolution the prosperous or decaying condition of manufacture commercial speculation and many other cause not always to be trace variously combine we have find the alternate swell and diminution embrace period of from two to three year the last period of depression to we be from 1819 to 1822 the corresponding revival be from 1823 to the commencement of the present year still we have no cause to apprehend a depression comparable to that of the former period or even to anticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply the annual ten million to the reduction of the debt it be well for we however to be admonish of the necessity of abide by the maxim of the most vigilant economy and of resort to all honorable and useful expedient for pursue with steady and inflexible perseverance the total discharge of the debt besides the seven million of the loan of 1813 which will have be discharge in the course of the present year there be nine million which by the term of the contract would have be and be now redeemable thirteen million more of the loan of 1814 will become redeemable from and after the expiration of the present month and nine other million from and after the close of the ensue year they constitute a mass of $ 31000000 all bear a interest of 6 per cent more than twenty million of which will be immediately redeemable and the rest within little more than a year leave of this amount fifteen million to continue at the interest of 6 per cent but to be pay off as far as shall be find practicable in the year 1827 and 1828 there be scarcely a doubt that the remain sixteen million might within a few month be discharge by a loan at not exceed 5 per cent redeemable in the year 1829 and 1830 by this operation a sum of nearly half a million of dollar may be save to the nation and the discharge of the whole thirty-one million within the four year may be greatly facilitate if not wholly accomplish by a act of congress of 3d march 1835 a loan for the purpose now refer to or a subscription to stock be authorize at a interest not exceed 4-1\/2 per cent but at that time so large a portion of the floating capital of the country be absorb in commercial speculation and so little be leave for investment in the stock that the measure be but partially successful at the last session of congress the condition of the fund be still unpropitious to the measure but the change so soon afterwards occur that have the authority exist to redeem the nine million now redeemable by a exchange of stock or a loan at 5 per cent it be morally certain that it might have be effect and with it a yearly saving of $ 90000 with regard to the collection of the revenue of impost certain occurrence have within the last year be disclose in one or two of we principal port which engage the attention of congress at they last session and may hereafter require further consideration until within a very few year the execution of the law for raise the revenue like that of all we other law have be insure more by the moral sense of the community than by the rigor of a jealous precaution or by penal sanction confide in the exemplary punctuality and unsullied integrity of we import merchant a gradual relaxation from the provision of the collection law a close adherence to which would have cause inconvenience and expense to they have long become habitual and indulgence have be extend universally because they have never be abuse it may be worthy of you serious consideration whether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come in aid of this state of unguarded security from the report herewith communicate of the secretary of war and of the navy with the subsidiary document annex to they will be discover the present condition and administration of we military establishment on the land and on the sea the organization of the army have undergo no change since its reduction to the present peace establishment in 1821 it remain only to observe that it be yet find adequate to all the purpose for which a permanent armed force in time of peace can be heed or useful it may be proper to add that from a difference of opinion between the late president of the united state and the senate with regard to the construction of the act of congress of 2d march 1821 to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the united state it remain hitherto so far without execution that no colonel have be appoint to command one of the regiment of artillery a supplementary or explanatory act of the legislature appear to be the only expedient practicable for remove the difficulty of this appointment in a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military establishment form but a very inconsiderable portion of the duty devolve upon the administration of the department of war it will be see by the return from the subordinate department of the army that every branch of the service be mark with order regularity and discipline that from the commanding general through all the gradation of superintendence the officer feel themselves to have be citizen before they be soldier and that the glory of a republican army must consist in the spirit of freedom by which it be animated and of patriotism by which it be impel it may be confidently state that the moral character of the army be in a state of continual improvement and that all the arrangement for the disposal of its part have a constant reference to that end but to the war department be attribute other duty have indeed relation to a future possible condition of war but be purely defensive and in they tendency contribute rather to the security and permanency of peace -- the erection of the fortification provide for by congress and adapt to secure we shore from hostile invasion the distribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice to the pensioner of the revolutionary war the maintenance of we relation of peace and of protection with the indian tribe and the internal improvement and survey for the location of road and canal which during the last three session of congress have engage so much of they attention and may engross so large a share of they future benefaction to we country by the act of the 30th of April 1824 suggest and approve by my predecessor the sum of $ 30000 be appropriate for the purpose of cause to be make the necessary survey plan and estimate of the route of such road and canal as the president of the united state might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or necessary for the transportation of the public mail the survey plan and estimate for each when complete will be lay before congress in execution of this act a board of engineer be immediately institute and have be since most assiduously and constantly occupy in carry it into effect the first object to which they labor be direct by order of the late president be the examination of the country between the tide water of the potomac the ohio and lake erie to ascertain the practicability of a communication between they to designate the most suitable route for the same and to form plan and estimate in detail of the expense of execution on the 3d of February 1825 they make they first report which be immediately communicate to congress and in which they declare that have maturely consider the circumstance observe by they personally and carefully study the result of such of the preliminary survey as be then complete they be decidedly of opinion that the communication be practicable at the last session of congress before the board of engineer be enable to make up they second report contain a general plan and preparatory estimate for the work the committee of the house of representative upon road and canal close the session with a report express the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of engineer might at this time be prepare and that the subject be refer to the early and favorable consideration of congress at they present session that expect report of the board of engineer be prepare and will forthwith be lay before you under the resolution of congress authorize the secretary of war to have prepare a complete system of cavalry tactic and a system of exercise and instruction of field artillery for the use of the militia of the united state to be report to congress at the present session a board of distinguished officer of the army and of the militia have be convene whose report will be submit to you with that of the secretary of war the occasion be think favorable for consult the same board aid by the result of a correspondence with the governor of the several state and territory and other citizen of intelligence and experience upon the acknowledged defective condition of we militia system and of the improvement of which it be susceptible the report of the board upon this subject be also submit for you consideration in the estimate of appropriation for the ensue year upward of $ 5000000 will be submit for the expenditure to be pay from the department of war less than two-fifth of this will be applicable to the maintenance and support of the army a million and a half in the form of pension go as a scarcely adequate tribute to the service and sacrifice of a former age and a more than equal sum invest in fortification or for the preparation of internal improvement provide for the quiet the comfort and happier existence of the age to come the appropriation to indemnify those unfortunate remnant of another race unable alike to share in the enjoyment and to exist in the presence of civilization though swell in recent year to a magnitude burdensome to the treasury be generally not without they equivalent in profitable value or serve to discharge the union from engagement more burdensome than debt in like manner the estimate of appropriation for the navy department will present a aggregate sum of upward of $ 3000000 about one-half of these however cover the current expenditure of the navy in actual service and one-half constitute a fund of national property the pledge of we future glory and defense it be scarcely one short year after the close of the late war and when the burden of its expense and charge be weigh heaviest upon the country that congress by the act of 29th April 1816 appropriate $ 1000000 annually for eight year to the _ gradual increase of the navy _ at a subsequent period this annual appropriation be reduce to half a million for six year of which the present year be the last a yet more recent appropriation the last two year for build ten sloop of war have nearly restore the original appropriation of 1816 of a million for every year the result be before we all we have twelve line-of-battle ship twenty frigate and sloop of war in proportion which with a few month of preparation may present a line of float fortification along the whole range of we coast ready to meet any invader who might attempt to set foot upon we shore combine with a system of fortification upon the shore themselves commence about the same time under the auspices of my immediate predecessor and hitherto systematically pursue it have place in we possession the most effective sinew of war and have leave we at once a example and a lesson from which we own duty may be infer the gradual increase of the navy be the principle of which the act of 29th April 1816 be the first development it be the introduction of a system to act upon the character and history of we country for a indefinite series of age it be a declaration of that congress to they constituent and to posterity that it be the destiny and the duty of these confederated state to become in regular process of time and by no petty advance a great naval power that which they propose to accomplish in eight year be rather to be consider as the measure of they means than the limitation of they design they look forward for a term of year sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite portion of they purpose and they leave to they successor to fill up the canvas of which they have trace the large and prophetic outline the ship of the line and frigate which they have in contemplation will be shortly complete the time which they have allot for the accomplishment of the work have more than elapse it remain for you consideration how they successor may contribute they portion of toil and of treasure for the benefit of the succeed age in the gradual increase of we navy there be perhaps no part of the exercise of the constitutional power of the federal government which have give more general satisfaction to the people of the union than this the system have not be thus vigorously introduce and hitherto sustain to be now depart from or abandon in continue to provide for the gradual increase of the navy it may not be necessary or expedient to add for the present any more to the number of we ship but should you deem it advisable to continue the yearly appropriation of half a million to the same object it may be profitably expend in provide a supply of timber to be seasoned and other material for future use in the construction of dock or in lay the foundation of a school for naval education as to the wisdom of congress either of those measure may appear to claim the preference of the small portion of this navy

the mutual interest of both party it be the vital spirit of trade itself nor can it be reconcile to the nature of man or to the primary law of human society that any traffic should long be willingly pursue of which all the advantage be on one side and all the burden on the other treaty of commerce have be find by experience to be among the most effective instrument for promote peace and harmony between nation whose interest exclusively consider on either side be bring into frequent collision by competition in frame such treaty it be the duty of each party not simply to urge with unyielding pertinacity that which suit its own interest but to concede liberally to that which be adapt to the interest of the other to accomplish this little more be generally require than a simple observance of the rule of reciprocity and be it possible for the statesman of one nation by stratagem and management to obtain from the weakness or ignorance of another a overreach treaty such a compact would prove a incentive to war rather than a bond of peace we convention with great britain be found upon the principle of reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the two country be greater in magnitude and amount than between any two other nation on the globe it be for all purpose of benefit or advantage to both as precious and in all probability far more extensive than if the party be still constituent part of one and the same nation treaty between such state regulate the intercourse of peace between they and adjust interest of such transcendent importance to both which have be find in a long experience of year mutually advantageous should not be lightly cancel or discontinue two convention for continue in force those above mention have be conclude between the plenipotentiary of the two government on the 6th of August last and will be forthwith lay before the senate for the exercise of they constitutional authority concern they in the execution of the treaty of peace of November 1782 and September 1783 between the united state and great britain and which terminate the war of we independence a line of boundary be draw as the demarcation of territory between the two country extend over near 20 degree of latitude and range over sea lake and mountain then very imperfectly explore and scarcely open to the geographical knowledge of the age in the progress of discovery and settlement by both party since that time several question of boundary between they respective territory have arise which have be find of exceedingly difficult adjustment at the close of the last war with great britain four of these question press themselves upon the consideration of the negotiator of the treaty of ghent but without the means of conclude a definitive arrangement concern they they be refer to three separate commission consist of two commissioner one appoint by each party to examine and decide upon they respective claim in the event of a disagreement between the commissioner it be provide that they should make report to they several government and that the report should finally be refer to the decision of a sovereign the common friend of both of these commission two have already terminate they session and investigation one by entire and the other by partial agreement the commissioner of the fifth article of the treaty of ghent have finally disagree and make they conflict report to they own government but from these report a great difficulty have occur in make up a question to be decide by the arbitrator this purpose have however be effect by a fourth convention conclude at london by the plenipotentiary of the two government on the 29th of September last it will be submit together with the other to the consideration of the senate while these question have be pend incident have occur of conflict pretension and of dangerous character upon the territory itself in dispute between the two nation by a common understanding between the government it be agree that no exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by either party while the negotiation be pend should change the state of the question of right to be definitively settle such collision have nevertheless recently take place by occurrence the precise character of which have not yet be ascertain a communication from the governor of the state of maine with accompany document and a correspondence between the secretary of state and the minister of great britain on this subject be now communicate measure have be take to ascertain the state of the fact more correctly by the employment of a special agent to visit the spot where the allege outrage have occur the result of whose inquiry when receive will be transmit to congress while so many of the subject of high interest to the friendly relation between the two country have be so far adjust it be matter of regret that they view respect the commercial intercourse between the united state and the british colonial possession have not equally approximate to a friendly agreement at the commencement of the last session of congress they be inform of the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the british government of access in vessel of the united state to all they colonial port except those immediately border upon we own territory in the amicable discussion which have succeed the adoption of this measure which as it affect harshly the interest of the united state become a subject of expostulation on we part the principle upon which its justification have be place have be of a diversified character it have be at once ascribe to a mere recurrence to the old long-established principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a feeling of resentment because the offer of a act of parliament open the colonial port upon certain condition have not be grasp at with sufficient eagerness by a instantaneous conformity to they at a subsequent period it have be intimate that the new exclusion be in resentment because a prior act of parliament of 1822 open certain colonial port under heavy and burdensome restriction to vessel of the united state have not be reciprocate by a admission of british vessel from the colony and they cargo without any restriction or discrimination whatever but be the motive for the interdiction what it may the british government have manifest no disposition either by negotiation or by correspond legislative enactment to recede from it and we have be give distinctly to understand that neither of the bill which be under the consideration of congress at they last session would have be deem sufficient in they concession to have be reward by any relaxation from the british interdict it be one of the inconvenience inseparably connect with the attempt to adjust by reciprocal legislation interest of this nature that neither party can know what would be satisfactory to the other and that after enact a statute for the avowed and sincere purpose of conciliation it will generally be find utterly inadequate to the expectation of the other party and will terminate in mutual disappointment the session of congress have terminate without any act upon the subject a proclamation be issue on the 17th of march last conformably to the provision of the sixth section of the act of 1st march 1823 declare the fact that the trade and intercourse authorize by the british act of parliament of 24th June 1822 between the united state and the british enumerated colonial port have be by the subsequent act of parliament of 5th July 1825 and the order of council of 27th July 1826 prohibit the effect of this proclamation by the term of the act under which it be issue have be that each and every provision of the act concern navigation of 18th April 1818 and of the act supplementary thereto of 15th may 1820 revive and be in full force such then be the present condition of the trade that useful as it be to both party it can with a single momentary exception be carry on directly by the vessel of neither that exception itself be find in a proclamation of the governor of the island of st christopher and of the virgin island invite for three month from the 28th of August last the importation of the article of the produce of the united state which constitute they export portion of this trade in the vessel of all nation that period have already expire the state of mutual interdiction have again take place the british government have not only decline negotiation upon this subject but by the principle they have assume with reference to it have preclude even the means of negotiation it become not the self-respect of the united state either to solicit gratuitous favor or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which a ample equivalent be exact it remain to be determine by the respective government whether the trade shall be open by act of reciprocal legislation it be in the meantime satisfactory to know that apart from the inconvenience result from a disturbance of the usual channel of trade no loss have be sustain by the commerce the navigation or the revenue of the united state and none of magnitude be to be apprehend from this exist state of mutual interdict with the other maritime and commercial nation of europe we intercourse continue with little variation since the cessation by the convention of 24th June 1822 of all discriminate duty upon the vessel of the united state and of france in either country we trade with that nation have increase and be increase a disposition on the part of france have be manifest to renew that negotiation and in accede to the proposal we have express the wish that it might be extend to other subject upon which a good understanding between the party would be beneficial to the interest of both the origin of the political relation between the united state and france be coeval with the first year of we independence the memory of it be interweave with that of we arduous struggle for national existence weaken as it have occasionally be since that time it can by we never be forget and we should hail with exultation the moment which should indicate a recollection equally friendly in spirit on the part of france a fresh effort have recently be make by the minister of the united state reside at paris to obtain a consideration of the just claim of citizen of the united state to the reparation of wrong long since commit many of they frankly acknowledge and all of they entitle upon every principle of justice to a candid examination the proposal last make to the french government have be to refer the subject which have form a obstacle to this consideration to the determination of a sovereign the common friend of both to this offer no definitive answer have yet be receive but the gallant and honorable spirit which have at all time be the pride and glory of france will not ultimately permit the demand of innocent sufferer to be extinguish in the mere consciousness of the power to reject they a new treaty of amity navigation and commerce have be conclude with the kingdom of sweden which will be submit to the senate for they advice with regard to its ratification at a more recent date a minister plenipotentiary from the hanseatic republic of hamburg lubeck and breman have be receive charge with a special mission for the negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that ancient and renowned league and the united state this negotiation have accordingly be commence and be now in progress the result of which will if successful be also submit to the senate for they consideration since the accession of the emperor nichola to the imperial throne of all the russia the friendly disposition toward the united state so constantly manifest by he predecessor have continue unabated and have be recently testify by the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to reside at this place from the interest take by this sovereign in behalf of the suffering greek and from the spirit with which other of the great european power be cooperate with he the friend of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they will obtain relief from that most unequal of conflict which they have so long and so gallantly sustain that they will enjoy the blessing of self-government which by they suffering in the cause of liberty they have richly earn and that they independence will be secure by those liberal institution of which they country furnish the earliest example in the history of mankind and which have consecrate to immortal remembrance the very soil for which they be now again profusely pour forth they blood the sympathy which the people and government of the united state have so warmly indulge with they cause have be acknowledge by they government in a letter of thanks which i have receive from they illustrious president a translation of which be now communicate to congress the representative of that nation to whom this tribute of gratitude be intend to be pay and to whom it be justly due in the american hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence have continue to prevail and if signalize by none of those splendid triumph which have crown with glory some of the precede year it have only be from the banishment of all external force against which the struggle have be maintain the shout of victory have be supersede by the expulsion of the enemy over whom it could have be achieve we friendly wish and cordial good will which have constantly follow the southern nation of america in all the vicissitude of they war of independence be succeed by a solicitude equally ardent and cordial that by the wisdom and purity of they institution they may secure to themselves the choicest blessing of social order and the best reward of virtuous liberty disclaim alike all right and all intention of interfere in those concern which it be the prerogative of they independence to regulate as to they shall seem fit we hail with joy every indication of they prosperity of they harmony of they persevere and inflexible homage to those principle of freedom and of equal rights which be alone suit to the genius and temper of the american nation it have be therefore with some concern that we have observe indication of intestine division in some of the republic of the south and appearance of less union with one another than we believe to be the interest of all among the result of this state of thing have be that the treaty conclude at panama do not appear to have be ratify by the contracting party and that the meeting of the congress at tacubaya have be indefinitely postpone in accept the invitation to be represent at this congress while a manifestation be intend on the part of the united state of the most friendly disposition toward the southern republic by whom it have be propose it be hope that it would furnish a opportunity for bring all the nation of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and adoption of the principle in the regulation of they internal relation which would have secure a lasting peace and harmony between they and have promote the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe but as obstacle appear to have arise to the reassembling of the congress one of the two minister commission on the part of the united state have return to the bosom of he country while the minister charge with the ordinary mission to mexico remain authorize to attend at the conference of the congress whenever they may be resume a hope be for a short time entertain that a treaty of peace actually sign between the government of bueno ayre and of brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collision between belligerent pretension and neutral rights which be so commonly the result of maritime war and which have unfortunately disturb the harmony of the relation between the united state and the brazilian government at they last session congress be inform that some of the naval officer of that empire have advance and practice upon principle in relation to blockade and to neutral navigation which we could not sanction and which we commander find it necessary to resist it appear that they have not be sustain by the government of brazil itself some of the vessel capture under the assume authority of these erroneous principle have be restore and we trust that we just expectation will be realize that adequate indemnity will be make to all the citizen of the united state who have suffer by the unwarranted capture which the brazilian tribunal themselves have pronounce unlawful in the diplomatic discussion at rio de janeiro of these wrong sustain by citizen of the united state and of other which seem as if emanate immediately from that government itself the charg d'affaire of the united state under a impression that he representation in behalf of the rights and interest of he countryman be totally disregard and useless deem it he duty without wait for instruction to terminate he official function to demand he passport and return to the united state this movement dictate by a honest zeal for the honor and interest of he country -- motive which operate exclusively on the mind of the officer who resort to it -- have not be disapprove by I the brazilian government however complain of it as a measure for which no adequate intentional cause have be give by they and upon a explicit assurance through they charg d'affaire reside here that a successor to the late representative of the united state near that government the appointment of whom they desire should be receive and treat with the respect due to he character and that indemnity should be promptly make for all injury inflict on citizen of the united state or they property contrary to the law of nation a temporary commission as charge d'affaire to that country have be issue which it be hope will entirety restore the ordinary diplomatic intercourse between the two government and the friendly relation between they respective nation turn from the momentous concern of we union in its intercourse with foreign nation to those of the deepest interest in the administration of we internal affair we find the revenue of the present year correspond as nearly as might be expect with the anticipation of the last and present a aspect still more favorable in the promise of the next the balance in the treasury on January 1 last be $ 635868618 the receipt from that day to the 30th of September last as near as the return of they yet receive can show amount to $ 1688658132 the receipt of the present quarter estimate at $ 4515000 add to the above form a aggregate of $ 21400000 of receipt the expenditure of the year may perhaps amount to $ 22300000 present a small excess over the receipt but of these twenty-two million upward of six have be apply to the discharge of the principal of the public debt the whole amount of which approach seventy-four million on the 1st of January last will on the first day of the next year fall short of sixty-seven million and a half the balance in the treasury on the 1st of January next it be expect will exceed $ 5450000 a sum exceed that of the 1st of January 1825 though fall short of that exhibit on the 1st of January last it be foresee that the revenue of the present year would not equal that of the last which have itself be less than that of the next preceding year but the hope have be realize which be entertain that these deficiency would in nowise interrupt the steady operation of the discharge of the public debt by the annual ten million devote to that object by the act of 3d march 1817 the amount of duty secure on merchandise import from the commencement of the year until the 30th of September last be $ 21226000 and the probable amount of that which will be secure during the remainder of the year be $ 5774000 form a sum total of $ 27000000 with the allowance for drawback and contingent deficiency which may occur though not specifically foresee we may safely estimate the receipt of the ensue year at $ 22300000 -- a revenue for the next equal to the expenditure of the present year the deep solicitude feel by we citizen of all class throughout the union for the total discharge of the public debt will apologize for the earnestness with which i deem it my duty to urge this topic upon the consideration of congress -- of recommend to they again the observance of the strictest economy in the application of the public fund the depression upon the receipt of the revenue which have commence with the year 1826 continue with increase severity during the two first quarter of the present year the return tide begin to flow with the third quarter and so far as we can judge from experience may be expect to continue through the course of the ensue year in the meantime a alleviation from the burden of the public debt will in the three year have be effect to the amount of nearly sixteen million and the charge of annual interest will have be reduce upward of one million but among the maxim of political economy which the steward of the public money should never suffer without urgent necessity to be transcend be that of keep the expenditure of the year within the limit of its receipt the appropriation of the two last year include the yearly ten million of the sink fund have each equal the promise revenue of the ensue year while we foresee with confidence that the public coffer will be replenish from the receipt as fast as they will be drain by the expenditure equal in amount to those of the current year it should not be forget that they could ill suffer the exhaustion of larger disbursement the condition of the army and of all the branch of the public service under the superintendence of the secretary of war will be see by the report from that officer and the document with which it be accompany during the last summer a detachment of the army have be usefully and successfully call to perform they appropriate duty at the moment when the commissioner appoint for carry into execution certain provision of the treaty of August 19 1825 with various tribe of the northwestern indian be about to arrive at the appoint place of meet the unprovoked murder of several citizen and other act of unequivocal hostility commit by a party of the winnebago tribe one of those associate in the treaty follow by indication of a menacing character among other tribe of the same region render necessary a immediate display of the defensive and protective force of the union in that quarter it be accordingly exhibit by the immediate and concerted movement of the governor of the state of illinoi and of the territory of michigan and competent levy of militia under they authority with a corps of 700 man of united state troops under the command of general atkinson who at the call of governor cass immediately repair to the scene of danger from they station at st loui they presence dispel the alarm of we fellow-citizen on those border and overawe the hostile purpose of the indian the perpetrator of the murder be surrender to the authority and operation of we law and every appearance of purpose hostility from those indian tribe have subside although the present organization of the army and the administration of its various branch of service be upon the whole satisfactory they be yet susceptible of much improvement in particulars some of which have be heretofore submit to the consideration of congress and other be now first present in the report of the secretary of war the expediency of provide for additional number of officer in the two corps of engineer will in some degree depend upon the number and extent of the object of national importance upon which congress may think it proper that survey should be make conformably to the act of the 30th of April 1824 ` of the survey which before the last session of congress have be make under the authority of that act report be make -- 1 of the board of internal improvement on the chesapeake and ohio canal 2 on the continuation of the national road from cumberland to the tide water within the district of columbium 3 on the continuation of the national road from canton to zanesville 4 on the location of the national road from zanesville to columbus 5

the survey of the muscle shoal in the tennessee river and for a route for a contemplated communication between the hiwassee and coosa river in the state of alabama other report of survey upon object point out by the several act of congress of the last and preceding session be in the progress of preparation and most of they may be complete before the close of this session all the officer of both corps of engineer with several other person duly qualify have be constantly employ upon these service from the passage of the act of 30th April 1824 to this time be no other advantage to accrue to the country from they labor than the fund of topographical knowledge which they have collect and communicate that alone would have be a profit to the union more than adequate to all the expenditure which have be devote to the object but the appropriation for the repair and continuation of the cumberland road for the construction of various other road for the removal of obstruction from the river and harbor for the erection of light-houses beacon pier and buoy and for the completion of canal undertake by individual association but heed the assistance of means and resource more comprehensive than individual enterprise can command may be consider rather as treasure lay up from the contribution of the present age for the benefit of posterity than as unrequited application of the accrue revenue of the nation to such object of permanent improvement to the condition of the country of real addition to the wealth as well as to the comfort of the people by whose authority and resource they have be effect from three to four million of the annual income of the nation have by law enact at the three most recent session of congress be apply without intrench upon the necessity of the treasury without add a dollar to the tax or debt of the community without suspend even the steady and regular discharge of the debt contract in former day which within the same three year have be diminish by the amount of nearly $ 16000000 the same observation be in a great degree applicable to the appropriation make for fortification upon the coast and harbor of the united state for the maintenance of the military academy at west point and for the various object under the superintendence of the department of the navy the report from the secretary of the navy and those from the subordinate branch of both the military department exhibit to congress in minute detail the present condition of the public establishment dependent upon they the execution of the act of congress relate to they and the view of the officer engage in the several branch of the service concern the improvement which may tend to they perfection the fortification of the coast and the gradual increase and improvement of the navy be part of a great system of national defense which have be upward of ten year in progress and which for a series of year to come will continue to claim the constant and persevere protection and superintendence of the legislative authority among the measure which have emanate from these principle the act of the last session of congress for the gradual improvement of the navy hold a conspicuous place the collection of timber for the future construction of vessel of war the preservation and reproduction of the species of timber peculiarly adapt to that purpose the construction of dry dock for the use of the navy the erection of a marine railway for the repair of the public ship and the improvement of the navy-yard for the preservation of the public property deposit in they have all receive from the executive the attention require by that act and will continue to receive it steadily proceed toward the execution of all its purpose the establishment of a naval academy furnish the means of theoretic instruction to the youth who devote they life to the service of they country upon the ocean still solicit the sanction of the legislature practical seamanship and the art of navigation may be acquire on the cruise of the squadron which from time to time be dispatch to distant sea but a competent knowledge even of the art of shipbuilding the higher mathematics and astronomy the literature which can place we officer on a level of polished education with the officer of other maritime nation the knowledge of the law municipal and national which in they intercourse with foreign state and they government be continually call into operation and above all that acquaintance with the principle of honor and justice with the higher obligation of moral and of general law human and divine which constitute the great distinction between the warrior-patriot and the licensed robber and pirate -- these can be systematically teach and eminently acquire only in a permanent school station upon the shore and provide with the teacher the instrument and the book conversant with and adapt to the communication of the principle of these respective science to the youthful and inquire mind the report from the postmaster-general exhibit the condition of that department as highly satisfactory for the present and still more promising for the future its receipt for the year end the 1st of July last amount to $ 1473551 and exceed its expenditure by upward of $ 100000 it can not be a oversanguine estimate to predict that in less than ten year of which one-half have elapse the receipt will have be more than double in the meantime a reduce expenditure upon established route have keep pace with increase facility of public accommodation and additional service have be obtain at reduce rate of compensation within the last year the transportation of the mail in stage have be greatly augment the number of post-office have be increase to 7000 and it may be anticipate that while the facility of intercourse between fellow-citizen in person or by correspondence will soon be carry to the door of every villager in the union a yearly surplus of revenue will accrue which may be apply as the wisdom of congress under the exercise of they constitutional power may devise for the further establishment and improvement of the public road or by add still further to the facility in the transportation of the mail of the indication of the prosperous condition of we country none can be more please than those present by the multiply relation of personal and intimate intercourse between the citizen of the union dwelling at the remotest distance from each other among the subject which have heretofore occupy the earnest solicitude and attention of congress be the management and disposal of that portion of the property of the nation which consist of the public land the acquisition of they make at the expense of the whole union not only in treasure but in blood mark a right of property in they equally extensive by the report and statement from the general land office now communicate it appear that under the present government of the united state a sum little short of $ 33000000 have be pay from the common treasury for that portion of this property which have be purchase from france and spain and for the extinction of the aboriginal title the amount of land acquire be near 260000000 acre of which on the 1st of January 1826 about 139000000 acre have be survey and little more than 19000000 acre have be sell the amount pay into the treasury by the purchaser of the public land sell be not yet equal to the sum pay for the whole but leave a small balance to be refund the proceeds of the sale of the land have long be pledge to the creditor of the nation a pledge from which we have reason to hope that they will in a very few year be redeem the system upon which this great national interest have be manage be the result of long anxious and persevere deliberation mature and modify by the progress of we population and the lesson of experience it have be hitherto eminently successful more than nine-tenth of the land still remain the common property of the union the appropriation and disposal of which be sacred trust in the hand of congress of the land sell a considerable part be convey under extend credit which in the vicissitude and fluctuation in the value of land and of they produce become oppressively burdensome to the purchaser it can never be the interest or the policy of the nation to wring from its own citizen the reasonable profit of they industry and enterprise by hold they to the rigorous import of disastrous engagement in march 1821 a debt of $ 22000000 due by purchaser of the public land have accumulate which they be unable to pay a act of congress of the 2d march 1821 come to they relief and have be succeed by other the latest be the act of the 4th of may 1826 the indulgent provision of which expire on the 4th July last the effect of these law have be to reduce the debt from the purchaser to a remain balance of about $ 4300000 due more than three-fifths of which be for land within the state of alabama i recommend to congress the revival and continuance for a further term of the beneficent accommodation to the public debtor of that statute and submit to they consideration in the same spirit of equity the remission under proper discrimination of the forfeiture of partial payment on account of purchase of the public land so far as to allow of they application to other payment there be various other subject of deep interest to the whole union which have heretofore be recommend to the consideration of congress as well by my predecessor as under the impression of the duty devolve upon I by myself among these be the debt rather of justice than gratitude to the survive warrior of the revolutionary war the extension of the judicial administration of the federal government to those extensive and important member of the union which have rise into existence since the organization of the present judiciary establishment now constitute at least one-third of its territory power and population the formation

bohemia have be prepare for signature by the secretary of state and by the baron de lederer intrust with full power of the austrian government independently of the new and friendly relation which may be thus commence with one of the most eminent and powerful nation of the earth the occasion have be take in it as in other recent treaty conclude by the united state to extend those principle of liberal intercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchange of commerce the principle of justice and the feeling of mutual benevolence this system first proclaimed to the world in the first commercial treaty ever conclude by the united state -- that of 6th February 1778 with france -- have be invariably the cherish policy of we union it be by treaty of commerce alone that it can be make ultimately to prevail as the established system of all civilized nation with this principle we father extend the hand of friendship to every nation of the globe and to this policy we country have ever since adhered whatever of regulation in we law have ever be adopt unfavorable to the interest of any foreign nation have be essentially defensive and counteract to similar regulation of theirs operating against we immediately after the close of the war of independence commissioner be appoint by the congress of the confederation authorize to conclude treaty with every nation of europe dispose to adopt they before the war of the french revolution such treaty have be consummate with the unite netherland sweden and prussium during those war treaty with great britain and spain have be effect and those with prussium and france renew in all these some concession to the liberal principle of intercourse propose by the united state have be obtain but as in all the negotiation they come occasionally in collision with previous internal regulation or exclusive and exclude compact of monopoly with which the other party have be trammele the advance make in they toward the freedom of trade be partial and imperfect colonial establishment charter company and shipbuilding influence pervade and encumber the legislation of all the great commercial state and the united state in offer free trade and equal privilege to all be compel to acquiesce in many exception with each of the party to they treaty accommodate to they exist law and anterior engagement the colonial system by which this whole hemisphere be bind have fall into ruin totally abolish by revolution convert colony into independent nation throughout the two american continent except a portion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of we own and confine to the remnant of dominion retain by great britain over the insular archipelago geographically the appendage of we part of the globe with all the rest we have free trade even with the insular colony of all the european nation except great britain she government also have manifest approach to the adoption of a free and liberal intercourse between she colony and other nation though by a sudden and scarcely explain revulsion the spirit of exclusion have be revive for operation upon the united state alone the conclusion of we last treaty of peace with great britain be shortly afterwards follow by a commercial convention place the direct intercourse between the two country upon a footing of more equal reciprocity than have ever before be admit the same principle have since be much further extend by treaty with france sweden denmark the hanseatic city prussium in europe and with the republic of colombium and of central america in this hemisphere the mutual abolition of discriminate duty and charge upon the navigation and commercial intercourse between the party be the general maxim which characterize they all there be reason to expect that it will at no distant period be adopt by other nation both of europe and america and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of the fruitful source of war of commercial competition will be extinguish among the nation upon whose government many of we fellow-citizen have have long-pending claim of indemnity for depredation upon they property during a period when the rights of neutral commerce be disregard be that of denmark they be soon after the event occur the subject of a special mission from the united state at the close of which the assurance be give by he danish majesty that at a period of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be consider examine and decide upon in a spirit of determine purpose for the dispensation of justice i have much pleasure in inform congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise be now in progress that a small portion of the claim have already be settle to the satisfaction of the claimant and that we have reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be place in a train of equitable adjustment this result have always be confidently expect from the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the sovereign of the danish dominion have through every vicissitude of fortune maintain the general aspect of the affair of we highborn american nation of the south have be rather of approach than of settle tranquillity internal disturbance have be more frequent among they than they common friend would have desire we intercourse with all have continue to be that of friendship and of mutual good will treaty of commerce and of boundary with the unite mexican state have be negotiate but from various successive obstacle not yet bring to a final conclusion the civil war which unfortunately still prevail in the republic of central america have be unpropitious to the cultivation of we commercial relation with they and the dissension and revolutionary change in the republic of colombium and of peru have be see with cordial regret by we who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both it be with great satisfaction however that we have witness the recent conclusion of a peace between the government of bueno ayre and of brazil and it be equally gratifying to observe that indemnity have be obtain for some of the injury which we fellow-citizen have sustain in the latter of those country the rest be in a train of negotiation which we hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction and that it may be succeed by a treaty of commerce and navigation upon liberal principle propitious to a great and grow commerce already important to the interest of we country the condition and prospects of the revenue be more favorable than we most sanguine expectation have anticipate the balance in the treasury on the 1st of January last exclusive of the money receive under the convention of 13th of November 1826 with great britain be $ 586197283 the receipt into the treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of September last so far as they have be ascertain to form the basis of a estimate amount to $ 1863358027 which with the receipt of the present quarter estimate at $ 546128340 form a aggregate of receipt during the year of $ 2409486367 the expenditure of the year may probably amount to $ 2563711163 and leave in the treasury on the 1st of January next the sum of $ 512563814 the receipt of the present year have amount to near two million more than be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the amount of duty secure on importation from the 1st of January to the 30th of September be about $ 22997000 and that of the estimate accrue revenue be five million form a aggregate for the year of near twenty-eight million this be one million more than the estimate make last December for the accrue revenue of the present year which with allowance for drawback and contingent deficiency be expect to produce a actual revenue of $ 22300000 have these only be realize the expenditure of the year would have be also proportionally reduce for of these twenty-four million receive upward of nine million have be apply to the extinction of public debt bear a interest of 6 per cent a year and of course reduce the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more than half a million the payment on account of interest during the current year exceed $ 3000000 present a aggregate of more than twelve million apply during the year to the discharge of the public debt the whole of which remain due on the 1st of January next will amount only to $ 5836213578 that the revenue of the ensue year will not fall short of that receive in the one now expire there be indication which can scarcely prove deceptive in we country a uniform experience of forty year have show that whatever the tariff of duty upon article import from abroad have be the amount of importation have always bear a average value nearly approach to that of the export though occasionally differ in the balance sometimes be more and sometimes less it be indeed a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of export should by a small and only a small balance exceed that of import that balance be a permanent addition to the wealth of the nation the extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulate by the amount of its export and a important addition to the value of these will draw after it a corresponding increase of importation it have happen in the vicissitude of the season that the harvest of all europe have in the late summer and autumn fall short of they usual average a relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad have ensue a propitious market have be open to the granary of we country and a new prospect of reward present to the labor of the husbandman which for several year have be deny this accession to the profit of agriculture in the middle and western portion of we union be accidental and temporary it may continue only for a single year it may be as have be often experience in the revolution of time but the first of several scanty harvest in succession we may consider it certain that for the approach year it have add a item of large amount to the value of we export and that it will produce a corresponding increase of importation it may therefore confidently be foresee that the revenue of 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of 1828 and will afford the means of extinguish ten million more of the principal of the public debt this new element of prosperity to that part of we agricultural industry which be occupy in produce the first article of human subsistence be of the most cheer character to the feeling of patriotism proceeding from a cause which humanity will view with concern the suffering of scarcity in distant land it yield a consolatory reflection that this scarcity be in no respect attributable to we that it come from the dispensation of he who ordain all in wisdom and goodness and who permit evil itself only as a instrument of good that far from contribute to this scarcity we agency will be apply only to the alleviation of its severity and that in pour forth from the abundance of we own garner the supplies which will partially restore plenty to those who be in heed we shall ourselves reduce we store and add to the price of we own bread so as in some degree to participate in the want which it will be the good fortune of we country to relieve the great interest of a agricultural commercial and manufacturing nation be so link in union together that no permanent cause of prosperity to one of they can operate without extend its influence to the other all these interest be alike under the protect power of the legislative authority and the duty of the representative body be to conciliate they in harmony together so far as the object of taxation be to raise a revenue for discharge the debt and defray the expense of the community its operation should be adapt as much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion with they ability of bear it without oppression but the legislation of one nation be sometimes intentionally make to bear heavily upon the interest of another that legislation adapt as it be mean to be to the special interest of its own people will often press most unequally upon the several component interest of its neighbor thus the legislation of great britain when as have recently be avow adapt to the depression of a rival nation will naturally abound with regulation of interdict upon the production of the soil or industry of the other which come in competition with its own and will present encouragement perhaps even bounty to the raw material of the other state which it can not produce itself and which be essential for the use of its manufacture competitor in the market of the world with those of its commercial rival such be the state of the commercial legislation of great britain as it bear upon we interest it exclude with interdict duty all importation -lrb- except in time of approach famine -rrb- of the great staple of production of we middle and western state it proscribe with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock of the same portion and also of the northern and eastern part of we union it refuse even the rice of the south unless aggravate with a charge of duty upon the northern carrier who bring it to they but the cotton indispensable for they loom they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a fabric for we own wear to the destruction of we own manufacture which they be enable thus to undersell be the self-protecting energy of this nation so helpless that there exist in the political institution of we country no power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation that the grower of grain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign market of they produce that the shipper must dismantle they ship the trade of the north stagnate at the wharf and the manufacturer starve at they loom while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clothe in a foreign garb that the congress of the union be impotent to restore the balance in favor of native industry destroy by the statute of another realm more just and more generous sentiment will i trust prevail if the tariff adopt at the last session of congress shall be find by experience to bear oppressively upon the interest of any one section of the union it ought to be and i can not doubt will be so modify as to alleviate its burden to the voice of just complaint from any portion of they constituent the representative of the state and of the people will never turn away they ear but so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the husbandman shall be find thrive in they occupation under the duty impose for the protection of domestic manufacture they will not repine at the prosperity share with themselves by they fellow-citizen of other profession nor denounce as violation of the constitution the deliberate act of congress to shield from the wrong of foreign law the native industry of the union while the tariff of the last session of congress be a subject of legislative deliberation it be foretell by some of its opposer that one of its necessary consequence would be to impair the revenue it be yet too soon to pronounce with confidence that this prediction be erroneous the obstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently open a issue to another the consequence of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish the importation of some specific article but by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of one article will be follow by a increase importation of other the duty upon which will supply the deficiency which the diminish importation would otherwise occasion the effect of taxation upon revenue can seldom be foresee with certainty it must abide the test of experience as yet no symptom of diminution be perceptible in the receipt of the treasury as yet little addition of cost have even be experience upon the article burden with heavier duty by the last tariff the domestic manufacturer supply the same or a kindred article at a diminish price and the consumer pay the same tribute to the labor of he own countryman which he must otherwise have pay to foreign industry and toil the tariff of the last session be in its detail not acceptable to the great interest of any portion of the union not even to the interest which it be specially intend to subserve its object be to balance the burden upon native industry impose by the operation of foreign law but not to aggravate the burden of one section of the union by the relief afford to another to the great principle sanction by that act -- one of those upon which the constitution itself be form -- i hope and trust the authority of the union will adhere but if any of the duty impose by the act only relieve the manufacturer by aggravate the burden of the planter let a careful revisal of its provision enlighten by the practical experience of its effect be direct to retain those which impart protection to native industry and remove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great national interest by the depression of another the unite state of america and the people of every state of which they be compose be each of they sovereign power the legislative authority of the whole be exercise by congress under authority grant they in the common constitution the legislative power of each state be exercise by assembly derive they authority from the constitution of the state each be sovereign within its own province the distribution of power between they presuppose that these authority will move in harmony with each other the member of the state and general government be all under oath to support both and allegiance be due to the one and to the other the case of a conflict between these two power have not be suppose nor have any provision be make for it in we institution as a virtuous nation of ancient time exist more than five century without a law for the punishment of parricide more than once however in the progress of we history have the people and the legislature of one or more state in moment of excitement be instigate to this conflict and the means of effect this impulse have be allegation that the act of congress to be resist be _ unconstitutional _ the people of no one state have ever delegate to they legislature the power of pronounce a act of congress unconstitutional but they have delegate to they power by the exercise of which the execution of the law of congress within the state may be resist if we suppose the case of such conflicting legislation sustain by the corresponding executive and judicial authority patriotism and philanthropy turn they eye from the condition in which the party would be place and from that of the people of both which must be its victim the report from the secretary of war and the various subordinate office of the resort of that department present a exposition of the public administration of affair connect with they through the course of the current year the present state of the army and the distribution of the force of which it be compose will be see from the report of the major-general several alteration in the disposal of the troops have be find expedient in the course of the year and the discipline of the army though not entirely free from exception have be generally good the attention of congress be particularly invite to that part of the report of the secretary of war which concern the exist system of we relation with the indian tribe at the establishment of the federal government under the present constitution of the united state the principle be adopt of consider they as foreign and independent power and also as proprietor of land they be moreover consider as savage whom it be we policy and we duty to use we influence in convert to christianity and in bring within the pale of civilization as independent power we negotiate with they by treaty as proprietor we purchase of they all the land which we could prevail upon they to sell as brethren of the human race rude and ignorant we endeavor to bring they to the knowledge of religion and of letter the ultimate design be to incorporate in we own institution that portion of they which could be convert to the state of civilization in the practice of european state before we revolution they have be consider _ as child _ to be govern as tenant at discretion to be dispossess as occasion might require as hunter to be indemnify by trifling concession for removal from the grounds from which they game be extirpate in change the system it would seem as if a full contemplation of the consequence of the change have not be take we have be far more successful in the acquisition of they land than in impart to they the principle or inspiring they with the spirit of civilization but in appropriate to ourselves they hunting grounds we have bring upon ourselves the obligation of provide they with subsistence and when we have have the rare good fortune of teach they the art of civilization and the doctrine of christianity we have unexpectedly find they form in the midst of ourselves community claim to be independent of ours and rival of sovereignty within the territory of the member of we union this state of thing require that a remedy should be provide -- a remedy which while it shall do justice to those unfortunate child of nature may secure to the member of we confederation they rights of sovereignty and of soil as the outline of a project to that effect the view present in the report of the secretary of war be recommend to the consideration of congress the report from the engineer department present a comprehensive view of the progress which have be make in the great system promotive of the public interest commence and organize under authority of congress and the effect of which have already contribute to the security as they will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and dignity of the nation the first of these great system be that of fortification commence immediately after the close of we last war under the salutary experience which the event of that war have impress upon we countryman of its necessity introduce under the auspices of my immediate predecessor it have be continue with the persevere and liberal encouragement of the legislature and combine with corresponding exertion for the gradual increase and improvement of the navy prepare for we extensive country a condition of defense adapt to any critical emergency which the vary course of event may bring forth we advance in these concerted system have for the last ten year be steady and progressive and in a few year more will be so complete as to leave no cause for apprehension that we seacoast will ever again offer a theater of hostile invasion the next of these cardinal measure of policy be the preliminary to great and lasting work of public improvement in the survey of road examination for the course of canal and labor for the removal of

its own condition of these great national undertaking the academy at west point be among the most important in itself and the most comprehensive in its consequence in that institution a part of the revenue of the nation be apply to defray the expense of educate a competent portion of she youth chiefly to the knowledge and the duty of military life it be the living armory of the nation while the other work of improvement enumerate in the report now present to the attention of congress be destine to ameliorate the face of nature to multiply the facility of communication between the different

separable from the conflict of war upon the ocean with a portion of they the correspondence of we commander on the eastern aspect of the south american coast and among the island of greece discover how far we have be involve in these the honor of we country and the rights of we citizen have be assert and vindicate the appearance of new squadron in the mediterranean and the blockade of the dardanelle indicate the danger of other obstacle to the freedom of commerce and the necessity of keep we naval force in those sea to the suggestion repeat in the report of the secretary of the navy and tend to the permanent improvement of this institution i invite the favorable consideration of congress a resolution of the house of representative request that one of we small public vessel should be send to the pacific ocean and south sea to examine the coast island harbor shoal and reef in those sea and to ascertain they true situation and description have be put in a train of execution the vessel be nearly ready to depart the successful accomplishment of the expedition may be greatly facilitate by suitable legislative provision and particularly by a appropriation to defray its necessary expense the addition of a second and perhaps a third vessel with a slight aggravation of the cost would contribute much to the safety of the citizen embark on this undertake the result of which may be of the deepest interest to we country with the report of the secretary of the navy will be submit in conformity to the act of congress of 3d march 1827 for the gradual improvement of the navy of the

be make satisfactory progress toward a durable establishment the examination and inquiry to ascertain the practicability and expediency of a marine railway at pensacolum though not yet accomplish have be postpone but to be more effectually make the navy-yard of the united state have be examine and plan for they improvement and the preservation of the public property therein at portsmouth charlestown philadelphium washington and gosport and to which two other be to be add have be prepare and receive my sanction and no other portion of my public duty have be perform with a more intimate conviction of its importance to the future welfare and security of the union with the report from the postmaster-general be exhibit a comparative view of the gradual increase of that establishment from five to five year since 1792 till this time in the number of post-office which have grow from less than 200 to nearly 8000 in the revenue yield by they which from $ 67000 have swollen to upward of a million and a half and in the number of mile of post-road which from 5642 have multiply to 114536 while in the same period of time the population of the union have about thrice double the rate of increase of these office be nearly 40 and of the revenue and of travel mile from 20 to 25 for 1 the increase of revenue within the last five year have be nearly equal to the whole revenue of the department in 1812 the expenditure of the department during the year which end on the 1st of July last have exceed the receipt by a sum of about $ 25000 the excess have be occasion by the increase of mail conveyance and facility to the extent of near 800000 mile it have be supply by collection from the postmaster of the arrearage of precede year while the correct principle seem to be that the income levy by the department should defray all its expense it have never be the policy of this government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be apply to any other purpose the suggestion of the postmaster-general that the insurance of the safe transmission of money by the mail might be assume by the department for a moderate and competent remuneration will deserve the consideration of congress a report from the commissioner of the public building in this city exhibit the expenditure upon they in the course of the current year it will be see that the humane and benevolent intention of congress in provide by the act of 20th may 1826 for the erection of a penitentiary in this district have be accomplish the authority of further legislation be now require for the removal to this tenement of the offender against the law sentence to atone by personal confinement for they crime and to provide a code for they employment and government while thus confine the commissioner appoint

leave a balance of $ 753782 which be distribute ratably amongst all the claimant to whom award have be make accord to the direction of the act the exhibit append to the report from the commissioner of the general land office present the actual condition of that common property of the union the amount pay into the treasury from the proceeds of land during the year 1827 and the first half of 1828 fall little short of $ 2000000 the propriety of further extend the time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the united state by the purchaser of the public land limit by the act of 21st march last to the 4th of July next will claim the consideration of congress to whose vigilance and careful attention the regulation disposal and preservation of this great national inheritance have by the people of the united state be intrust among the important subject to which the attention of the present congress have already be invite and which may occupy they further and deliberate discussion will be the provision to be make for take the fifth census or enumeration of the inhabitant of the united state the constitution of the united state require that this enumeration should be make within every term of ten year and the date from which the last enumeration commence be the first Monday of August of the year 1820 the law under which the former enumeration be take be enact at the session of congress immediately precede the operation but considerable inconvenience be experience from the delay of legislation to so late a period that law like those of the precede enumeration direct that the census should be take by the marshal of the several district and territory of the union under instruction from the secretary of state the preparation and transmission to the marshal of those instruction require more time than be then allow between the passage of the law and the day when the enumeration be to commence the term of six month limit for the return of the marshal be also find even then too short and must be more so now when a additional population of at least 3000000 must be present upon the return as they be to be make at the short session of congress it would as well as from other consideration be more convenient to commence the enumeration from a earlier period of the year than the 1st of August the most favorable season would be the spring on a review of the former enumeration it will be find that the plan for take every census have contain many improvement upon that of its predecessor the last be still susceptible of much improvement the third census be the first at which any account be take of the manufacture of the country it be repeat at the last enumeration but the return in both case be necessarily very imperfect they must always be so rest of course only upon the communication voluntarily make by individual interested in some of the manufacturing establishment yet they contain much valuable information and may by some supplementary provision of the law be render more effective the column of age commence from infancy have hitherto be confine to a few period all under the number of 45 year important knowledge would be obtain by extend these column in interval of ten year to the utmost boundary of human life the labor of take they would be a trifling addition to that already prescribe and the result would exhibit comparative table of longevity highly interesting to the country i deem it my duty further to observe that much of the imperfection in the return of the last and perhaps of precede enumeration proceed from the inadequateness of the compensation allow to the marshal and they assistant in take they in close this communication it only remain for I to assure the legislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of measure recommend by I heretofore and yet to be act on by they and of the cordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which may receive they sanction during the session tend to the general welfare john quincy adam \* \* \* \* \* special message washington _ December 8 1828 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : in compliance with a
