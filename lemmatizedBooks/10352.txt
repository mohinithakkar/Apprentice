hear he majesty 's speech to both house return to they own house where a copy of it be this day read to they by the speaker mr ha herbert move for a address in word to this effect : sir to address the throne on the present occasion be a custom which as it be found on reason and decency have always be observe by the common of britain nor do i suspect this house of any intention to omit those form of respect to he majesty which we ancestor always preserve even under prince whose conduct and design give they no claim to reverence or gratitude to continue therefore sir a practice which the nature of government itself make necessary and which can not but be acknowledge to be in a peculiar degree proper under a prince whose personal virtue be so generally know i hope for the indulgence of this house in the liberty which i shall take of propose a address to this effect : that we should beg leave to congratulate he majesty upon he safe and happy return to these he kingdom and to return we sincere thanks for he most gracious speech from the throne and assure he at the same time that with heart full of duty and gratitude we can not but acknowledge he majesty 's regard and attention to the honor and interest of this nation to observe that the great and impending danger that threaten europe under the present critical and perplexed situation of affair have be represent by he majesty to he parliament for they advice and assistance with such paternal concern and such affection to he people such confidence in he faithful common and such anxiety for the general good of europe as can not fail to excite in we a due sense of he majesty 's goodness and condescension and therefore to assure he majesty in the strongest manner that this house will as often as these momentous affair shall come under we consideration give he majesty such advice as become dutiful and faithful subject and such assistance and support as shall be most conducive to the honor and true interest of he crown and kingdom that we thank he majesty for he royal care in prosecute the war with spain and that in order to answer these necessary purpose we will grant such effectual supplies as shall enable he majesty not only to be in a readiness to support he friend and ally at such time and in such manner as the exigency and circumstance of affair shall require but to oppose and defeat any attempt that shall be make against he majesty he crown and kingdom or against those who be equally engage with he majesty by the faith of treaty or unite by common interest and common danger shall be willing to concert such measure as shall be find necessary and expedient for maintain the balance of europe this address which in my opinion will contain both a proper answer to he majesty 's speech and a decent declaration of we gratitude and duty will not i hope be oppose for surely it can not be charge with assert any thing that be either false or mean with bestow any unnecessary panegyrick or with maintain any fact that be not generally allow mr trevor second he in the manner following : -- sir as the necessity of a address to he majesty can not be dispute the only question on this occasion must be whether the address now propose be such as it may become this house to offer in the present conjuncture of affair in a address sir it be necessary to preserve at once the respect due to we sovereign and the dignity which may justly be assume by the representative of the people of britain a people whose birthright give they a claim to approach they sovereign not indeed without the utmost respect but with language which absolute monarch never hear from the slave by whom they be surround this respect and dignity appear to I to be very happily unite in the address now propose in which we join with we profession of duty we offer of advice and assert we claim to the direction of the national expense by we promise to grant the necessary supplies as there can not therefore in my opinion sir be any thing add to the address now offer and there appear to I no necessity of any alteration or omission i second the motion lord noel somerset speak next to this effect : -- sir though i be far from intend to repress by sophistical cavil or trifling objection the zeal which the honorable gentleman who propose the address have show for promote the publick business yet as it be very inconsistent with the duty of a senator to prefer civility to truth and to sacrifice to ceremony or complaisance the interest of he country i think it necessary to declare my opinion that though the address propose may admit of many amendment which i leave to other gentleman to make i think the addition of one clause absolutely necessary that he majesty may be desire not to engage this nation in a war for the preservation of he foreign dominion dominion which as they be in themselves independent on the crown of britain and govern by different law and a different right have be separate by a express clause from these kingdom in the act to which he majesty owe he title to the throne this request sir be at this time particularly expedient when the continent be in confusion and the territory of hanover be endanger by the approach of the french force besides as nothing be more fatal than groundless expectation of assistance it may contribute to the safety of that people to show they that they be to depend upon they own strength to call they force together to fortify they town and guard they avenue and that if they sit indolent and careless in confidence that the power of britain will be employ in they defense they will only give they enemy a easy conquest and enslave themselves and they posterity to a foreign power : i move therefore that he majesty be petition in we address not to engage these kingdom in a war for the preservation of he foreign dominion mr shippen rise and speak thus : -- sir i know not with what success i may assert in this senate position for which i have formerly be censure and which few other member have hitherto maintain but i rise with confidence that i shall be at least acknowledge to act consistently with myself in second the noble person who speak last and i be convince that many of those who differ from I in opinion would gladly be able to boast of resemble I in congruity of principle and steadiness of conduct but steadiness sir be the effect only of integrity and congruity the consequence of conviction : he that speak always what he think and endeavor by diligent inquiry to think aright before he venture to declare he sentiment he that follow in he search no leader but reason nor expect any reward from they but the advantage of discover truth and the pleasure of communicate it will not easily change he opinion because it will seldom be easy to show that he who have honestly inquire after truth have fail to attain it for my part i be not ashamed nor afraid to affirm that thirty year have make no change in any of my political opinion i be now grow old in this house but that experience which be the consequence of age have only confirm the principle with which i enter it many year ago time have verify the prediction which i formerly utter and i have see my conjecture ripen into knowledge i should be therefore without excuse if either terror could affright or the hope of advantage allure I from the declaration of my opinion opinion which i be not deter from assert when the prospect of a longer life than i can now expect might have add to the temptation of ambition or aggravate the terror of poverty and disgrace opinion for which i would willingly have suffer the severest censure even when i have espouse they only in compliance with reason without the infallible certainty of experience of truth it have be always observe sir that every day add to its establishment and that falsehood however specious however support by power or establish by confederacy be unable to stand before the stroke of time against the inconveniency and vexation of long life may be set the pleasure of discover truth perhaps the only pleasure that age afford nor be it a slight satisfaction to a man not utterly infatuated or depraved to find opportunity of rectify he notion and regulate he conduct by new light but much greater be the happiness of that man to whom every day bring a new proof of the reasonableness of he former determination and who find by the most unerring test that he life have be spend in promotion of doctrine beneficial to mankind this sir be the happiness which i now enjoy and for which those who never shall attain it must look for a equivalent in lucrative employment honorary title pompous equipage and splendid palace these sir be the advantage which be to be gain by a seasonable variation of principle and by a ready compliance with the prevail fashion of opinion advantage which i indeed can not envy when they be purchase at so high a price but of which age and observation have too frequently show I the unbounded influence and to which i can not deny that i have always ascribe the instability of conduct and inconsistency of assertion which i have discover in many man whose ability i have no reason to depreciate and of whom i can not but believe they would easily distinguish truth be not falsehood recommend to they by the ornament of wealth if there be in this new senate any man devote to they private interest any who prefer the gratification of they passion to the safety and happiness of they country who can riot without remorse in the plunder of they constituent who can forget the anguish of guilt in the noise of a feast the pomp of a drawing-room or the arm of a strumpet and think expensive wickedness and the gaiety of folly equivalent to the fair fame of fidelity and the peace of virtue to they i shall speak to no purpose for i be far from imagine any power in my language to gain those to truth who have resign they heart to avarice or ambition or to prevail upon man to change opinion which they have indeed never believe though they be hire to assert they there be a degree of wickedness which reproof or argument can not reclaim as there be a degree of stupidity which instruction can not enlighten if my country sir have be so unfortunate as once more to commit she interest to those who propose to themselves no advantage from they trust but that of sell it i may perhaps fall once more under censure for declare my opinion and be once more treat as a criminal for assert what they who punish I can not deny for maintain the inconsistency of hanover maxim with the happiness of this nation and for preserve the caution which be so strongly inculcate by the patriot that draw up the act of settlement and give the present imperial family they title to the throne these man sir whose wisdom can not be dispute and whose zeal for he majesty 's family be equal to they knowledge think it requisite to provide some security against the prejudice of birth and education they be far from imagine that they be call to the throne a race of being exalt above the frailty of humanity or exempt by any peculiar privilege from error or from ignorance they know that every man be habitually if not naturally fond of he own nation and that he be incline to enrich it and defend it at the expense of another even perhaps of that to which he be indebted for much higher degree of greatness wealth and power for every thing which make one state of life preferable to another and which therefore if reason could prevail over prejudice and every action be regulate by strict justice might claim more regard than that corner of the earth in which he only happen to be bear they know sir that confidence be not always return that we most willingly trust those whom we have longest know and caress those with most fondness whose inclination we find by experience to correspond with we own without regard to particular circumstance which may entitle other to greater regard or higher degree of credit or of kindness against these prejudice which they sagacity enable they to foresee they integrity incite they to secure we by provision which every man then think equitable and wise because no man be then hire to espouse a contrary opinion to obviate the disposition which a foreign race of prince might have to trust they original subject it be enact that none of they should be capable of any place of trust or profit in these kingdom and to hinder we monarch from transfer the revenue of britain to hanover and enrich it with the commerce of we trader and the labor of we husbandman from raise tax to augment the splendor of a petty court and increase the garrison of they mountain by misapply that money which this nation should raise for its own defense it be provide that the emperor of britain should never return to he native dominion but reside always in this kingdom without any other care than that of gain the affection of he british subject preserve they rights and increase they power it be imagine by that senate that the electorate of hanover a subordinate dignity hold by custom of homage to a greater power ought to be think below the regard of the emperor of britain and that the sovereign of a nation like this ought to remember a lower state only to heighten he gratitude to the people by whom he be exalt they be far from imagine that britain and hanover would in time be consider as of equal importance and that they sovereign would divide he year between one country and the other and please himself with exhibit in hanover the annual show of the pomp and dignity of a british emperor this clause sir however a later senate readily repeal upon what motive i be not able to declare have never hear the argument which prevail upon they predecessor to enact it confute or invalidate nor have i find that the event have produce any justification of they conduct or that the nation have receive any remarkable advantage from the travels of we emperor there be another clause in that important act which yet the senate have not adventure to repeal by which it be provide that this nation shall not be engage in war for the defense of the hanoverian dominion dominion of which we can have no interest in the protection or preservation dominion perhaps of no great value into whatever hand chance and negligence may throw they which they situation have make entirely useless to a naval power but which though they can not benefit may injure we by divert the attention of we sovereign or withhold he affection whether this clause sir have not sometimes be elude whether the six thousand hessian which we once support be of use to any of the british dominion and whether a double number of the same nation now pay with we money for the defense of the queen of hungary have not be station only where they might defend hanover without the least advantage to we confederate whether the nation have not be condemn to double expense in the support of this alliance by raise for the queen 's service troops which be only employ in the protection of hanover and then in succour she with pecuniary supplies it be perhaps at present unnecessary though i hope not yet too late to inquire it be at present unnecessary because the clause which be propose can not be deny to be equally proper whether the act of settlement have be hitherto observe or violate for the violation of it ought to engage we in some measure that may secure we for the future from the like injury and the observation of it be a manifest proof how much it be approve by all party since in so many deviation from this settlement and a inconstancy of conduct of which a example be scarcely to be find this law have be esteem sacred the bulwark of we rights and the boundary which the sovereign power have not dare to overleap as he majesty sir have in a very solemn manner call upon we for we advice and assistance what can be more proper than to lay before he we opinion on this important question war be next to slavery one of the greatest calamity and a unnecessary war therefore the greatest error of government a error which can not be too cautiously obviate or too speedily reform if we consider sir the present state of the continent there be nothing more probable than that the subject of the elector of hanover may solicit the assistance of the emperor of britain and therefore it be necessary to inform they that they solicitation will be vain if we inquire into the suspicion of we fellow-subject we shall find they generally disturb with fear that they shall be sacrifice to the security of foreign dominion and therefore it be necessary to recall they affection to he majesty where it be impaired and confirm they confidence where it have be hitherto preserve by show in the most publick manner how vainly they have be disquiet and how grossly they have be mistake it be certainly we duty sir to give such advice as may most truly inform he majesty of the sentiment of he people and most effectually establish in the people a adherence to he majesty as it be certain that no advice will be second by greater number than that which be propose nor can he majesty by any act of goodness so much endear he government as by a ready promise to this nation of a exemption from any war in defense of hanover i hope sir it will not be object that by such request a suspicion will be insinuate of design detrimental to the british nation and repugnant to the condition on which he majesty ascend the throne because a objection of equal force may rise against any advice whatever that shall be offer by the senate it may be always urge sir that to recommend any measure be to suppose that they would not have be suggest to he majesty by he own wisdom and by consequence that he be defective either in knowledge or in goodness that he either mistake or neglect the interest of he people thus sir may the most laudable conduct be charge with sedition and the most awful regard be accuse of disrespect by force consequence and exaggerated language thus may senate become useless lest they should appear to be wiser than they sovereign and the sovereign be condemn to act only by the information of servile minister because no publick advice can safely be give he that king must act upon the information of other that they can see little with they own eye through the mist which flattery be continually employ in raise before they and that they be therefore most happy who have by the constitution of the country which they govern a opportunity of know the opinion of they people without disguise have yet never be deny by any who do not separate the interest of the king from that of the people and leave mankind no political distinction but that of tyrant and slave this sir be the happiness of the emperor of britain beyond other monarch a advantage by which he may be always enable to contemplate the happy and flourishing state of he subject and to receive the blessing and acclamation of million that owe to he care they wealth and they security of this advantage he can not be deprive but by the cowardice or the treachery of those man who be delegate by the people as the guardian of they liberty and surely it require no uncommon penetration to discover that no act of treason can be equal in malignity to that perfidy which deprive the king of the affection of he subject by conceal from he they sentiment and petition he that make he monarch hate must undoubtedly make he unhappy and he that destroy he happiness might more innocently take away he life to exempt myself therefore from such guilt to discharge the trust confer on I by my country and to perform the duty which i owe to my king i stand up to second this motion mr gybbon speak next to the follow purpose : -- sir as it be not easy to remember all the part of a address by only once hear it and hear it in a form different from that in which it be to be present i think it necessary to a more accurate consideration of it that it should be read distinctly to the house we may otherwise waste we time in debate to which only we own forgetfulness give occasion we may raise objection without reason and propose amendment where there be no defect -lrb- the address be accordingly read and mr gybbon proceed -rrb- have now hear the address i find by experience the propriety of my proposal have remark a clause which in my opinion be necessary to be amend and which i have not observe when it be repeat before it be well know that the speech from the throne though pronounce by the king be always consider as the composition of the ministry upon whom any false assertion would be charge as the informer and counsellor of the crown it be well know likewise that whenever this house return thanks to the king for any measure that have be pursue those measure be suppose to be approve by they and that approbation may be plead by the minister in he defense whenever he shall be require to answer for the event of he counsel it be therefore in my opinion extremely unreasonable to propose that _ thanks should be return to he majesty for he royal care in prosecute the war against spain _ for what have be the consequence of that care for which we thanks be to be with so much solemnity return but defeat disgrace and loss the ruin of we merchant the imprisonment of we sailor idle show of armament and useless expense what be the event which be to be record in a impartial account of this war a war provoke by so long a train of insult and injury and carry on with so apparent a inequality of force have we destroy the fleet of we enemy fire they town and lay they fortress in ruin have we conquer they colony and plunder they city and reduce they to a necessity of recede from they unjust claim and repay the plunder of we merchant be they ambassador now solicit peace at the court of britain or apply to the neighbouring prince to moderate the resentment of they victorious enemy i be afraid that the effect of we preparation however formidable be very different they have only raise discontent among we countryman and contempt among we enemy we have show that we be strong indeed but that we force be make ineffectual by we cowardice that when we threaten most loudly we perform nothing that we draw we sword but to brandish they and only wait a opportunity to sheath they in such a manner as not plainly to confess that we dare not strike if we consider therefore what effect we thanks for conduct like this must naturally produce it will appear that they can only encourage we enemy and dispirit we fellow-subject it will be imagine that the spaniard be a powerful nation which it be the highest degree of temerity to attack a nation by whom it be honor sufficient not to be overcome and from whom we can not be defend without the most vigilant caution and the most extensive knowledge both of politick and war it will readily be perceive by the proud spaniard that it be only necessary to prosecute they view a little longer to intimidate we with new demand and amuse we with new preparation and that we who be always satisfy with we success shall soon be weary of a war from which it be plain that we never expect any advantage and therefore shall in a short time willingly receive such term as we conqueror will grant we it be always to be remembered how much all human affair depend upon opinion how often reputation supply the want of real power by make those afraid who can not be hurt and by produce confidence where there be no superiority the opinion of which the senate ought to endeavor the promotion be confidence in they steadiness honesty and wisdom confidence which will not be much advance by a address of thanks for the conduct of the war against spain how justly may it be ask when this address be spread over the world what be the view with which the senate of britain petition they sovereign to declare war against spain if they design be as they then assert to procure security for the commerce of america and reparation for the injury which they merchant have receive by what fluctuation of counsel by what prevalence of new opinion have they now abandon it for that they have no longer the same intention that they now no more either propose security or demand recompense be evident since though they have obtain neither yet be they thankful for the conduct of the war to what can this apparent instability be imputed but to the want either of wisdom to balance they own power with that of they enemy and discern the true interest of they country or to a mean compliance with the clamor of the people to whom they dare not refuse the appearance of a war though they have no expectation of honor or success but in far other term sir will the spaniard speak of the address which be now propose behold say we boast enemy the spirit and wisdom of that assembly whose counsel hold the continent in suspense and whose determination change the fate of kingdom whose vote transfer sovereignty cover the ocean with fleet prescribe the operation of distant war and fix the balance of the world behold they amuse with idle preparation levy money for mockery of war and return thanks for the pleasure of the show behold they look with wonderful tranquillity on the loss of a great number of they ship which have be seize upon they own coast by we privateer and congratulating themselves and they monarch that any have be preserve how great would have be the exultation and how loud the applause have they succeed in any of they design have they obstruct the departure of we fleet or hinder we descent upon the dominion of the queen of hungary have they confine we privateer in we harbor defeat any of we troops or overrun any of we colony in what term would they have express they gratitude for victory who be thus thankful for disappointment and disgrace such sir must be the remark of we enemy upon a address like that which be now propose remark which we and we ally must be condemn to hear without attempt a reply for what can be urge to extenuate the ridicule of return thanks where we ought either to express resentment offer consolation and propose the means of better success or cover we grief and shame with perpetual silence when it shall be tell in foreign nation that the senate of britain have return thanks for the escape of the spaniard from ferrol they uninterrupted expedition to italy the embarrassment of they own trade the captivity of they sailor and the destruction of they troops what can they conclude but that the senate of britain be a collection of madman whom madman have depute to transact the publick affair and what must be the influence of such a people and such a senate will be easily conceive if i have give way sir in these observation to any wanton hyperbole or exaggerated assertion they will i hope be pardon by those who shall reflect upon the real absurdity of the proposal which i be endeavor to show in its true state and by all who shall consider that to return thanks for the management of the war be to return thanks for the carnage of carthagena for the ruin of we merchant for the loss of we reputation and for the exaltation of the family of bourbon i hope no man will be so unjust or can be so ignorant as to insinuate or believe that i impute any part of we miscarriage to the personal conduct of he majesty or that i think he majesty 's concern for the prosperity of he people unworthy of the warmest and sincerest gratitude if the address be confine to the inspection of we sovereign alone i should be very far from censure or ridicule it for he majesty have not the event of war in he power nor can confer upon he minister or general that knowledge which they have neglect to acquire or that capacity which nature have deny they he may perform more than we have a right to expect and yet be unsuccessful he may deserve the utmost gratitude even when by the misconduct of he servant the nation be distressed but sir in draw up a address we should remember that we be declare we sentiment not only to he majesty but to all europe to we ally we enemy and we posterity that this address will be understand like all other that thanks offer in this manner by custom signify approbation and that therefore we must at present repress we gratitude because it can only bring into contempt we sovereign and ourselves sir robert walpole speak next to this effect : -- sir i be very far from think that the war against spain have be so unsuccessful as some gentleman have represent it that the loss which we have suffer have be more frequent than we have reason to expect from the situation of we enemy and the course of we trade or we defeat such as the common chance of war do not often produce even when the inequality of the contend power be incontestable and the ultimate event as near to certainty as the nature of human affair ever can admit nor be i convinced sir even though it should be allow that no exaggeration have be make of we miscarriage that the impropriety of a address of thanks to he majesty for he regal care in the management of the war be gross or flagrant for if it be allow that he majesty may be innocent of all the misconduct that have produce we defeat that he may have form scheme wisely which be unskilfully prosecute that even valor and knowledge concurring will not always obtain success and that therefore some loss may be suffer and some defeat receive though not only he majesty give the wisest direction but he officer execute they with the utmost diligence and fidelity how will it appear from we ill success that we sovereign do not deserve we gratitude and if it shall appear to we that we thanks be merit who shall restrain we from offer they in the most publick and solemn manner for my part i think no consideration worthy of regard in competition with truth and justice and therefore shall never forbear any expression of duty to my sovereign for fear of the ridicule of we secret or the reproach of we publick enemy with regard to the address under we consideration if it be allow either that we have not be unsuccessful in any opprobrious degree or that ill success do not necessarily imply any defect in the conduct of he majesty or debar we from the right of acknowledge he goodness and he wisdom i think sir no objection can be make to the form of expression now propose in which all sound and pompous language all declamatory exaggeration and study figure of speech all appearance of exultation and all the farce of rhetorick be carefully avoid and nothing insert that may disgust the most delicate or raise scruple in the most sincere yet sir that we may not waste we time upon trivial dispute when the nation expect relief from we counsel that we may not suspend the prosecution of the war by complaint of past defeat or retard that assistance and advice which we sovereign demand by inquire whether it may be more proper to thank or to counsel he i be willing for the sake of unanimity that this clause should be omit and hope that no other part of the address can give any opportunity for criticism or for objection sir it be no wonder that the right honorable gentleman willingly consent to the omission of this clause which could be insert for no other purpose than that he might sacrifice it to the resentment which it must naturally produce and by a appearance of modesty and compliance pass easily through the first day and obviate any severe inquiry that might be design he be too well acquaint with the opinion of many whom the nation have choose to represent they and with the universal clamor of the people too accurately inform of the state of we enemy and too conscious how much he secret machination have hinder we success to expect or hope that we should meet here to return thanks for the management of the war of a war in which nothing have be attempt by he direction that be likely to succeed and in which no advantage have be gain but by act without order and against he hope that i do not charge he sir without reason or invent accusation only to obstruct he measure or to gratify my own resentment that i do not eagerly catch fly calumny prolong the date of casual reproach encourage the malignity of the envious or adopt the suspicion of the melancholy that i do not impose upon myself by a warm imagination and endeavor to communicate to other impression which i have only receive myself from prejudice and malignity will be prove from the review of he conduct since the beginning of we dispute with spain in which it will be find that he have be guilty not of single error but of deliberate treachery that he have always cooperate with we enemy and sacrifice to he private interest the happiness and the honor of the british nation how long we merchant be plunder we sailor enslave and we colony intimidate without resentment how long the spaniard usurp the dominion of the sea search we ship at pleasure confiscate the cargo without control and tortured we fellow-subject with impunity can not but be remember not only every gentleman in this house but every man in the nation however indolent ignorant or obscure can tell what barbarity be exercise what ravages be commit what complaint be make and how they be receive it be universally know that this gentleman and those whom he have seduce by pension and employment treat the lamentation of ruin family and the outcry of tortured briton as the clamor of sedition and the murmur of malignity suborn to inflame the people and embarrass the government it be know sir that we loss be at one time ridicule as below the consideration of the legislature and the distress of the most useful and honest part of mankind be make the subject of merriment and laughter the awkward wit of all the hireling of the town be exert to divert the attention of the publick and all they art be employ to introduce other subject into conversation or to still the complaint which they hear with a timely jest but they wit be not more successful on this than on other occasion they imagination be soon exhaust and they find as at other time that they must have recourse to new expedient the first artifice of shallow courtier be to elude with promise those complaint which they can not confute a practice that require no understanding or knowledge and therefore have be generally follow by the administration this artifice they quickly make use of when they find that neither the merchant nor the nation be to be silence by a affectation of negligence or the sally of mirth that it be no longer safe to jest upon the misery of they countryman the destruction of we trade and the violation of we rights they condescend therefore to some appearance of compassion and promise to exert all they influence to procure redress and security that they might not appear sir to have make this promise only to free themselves from present importunity they set negotiation on foot despatch memorial remonstrance proposition and computation and with a air of gravity and importance assemble at proper time to peruse the intelligence which they receive and to concert new instruction for they minister while this farce be act sir innumerable artifice be make use of to reconcile the nation to suspense and delay sometimes the distance of the spanish dominion in america retard the decision of we claim sometimes the dilatory disposition of the spaniard and the established method of they court make it impossible to procure a more speedy determination sometimes order be despatch to america in favor of we trade and sometimes those order be neglect by the captain of the spanish ship and the governor of they province and when it be inquire why those captain and governor be not punish or recall we be treat with contempt for not know what have be so lately tell we of the dilatory proceedings of the spanish court in the mean time we merchant be plunder and we sailor throw into dungeon we flag be insult and we navigation restrain by man act under the commission of the king of spain we perceive no effect of we negotiation but the expense and we enemy not only insist on they former claim but prosecute they with the utmost rigor insolence and cruelty it must indeed sir be urge in favor of we minister that he do not refuse any act of submission or omit any method of supplication by which he might hope to soften the spaniard he solicit they favor at they own court he send commissary into they country he assist they in take possession of dominion to which neither we nor they have prove a right and he employ the navy of britain to transport into italy the prince on whom the new-erected kingdom be to be confer well might he expect that the spaniard would be soften by so much kindness and forbearance and that gratitude would at length induce they to spare those whom no injury or contempt have be able to alienate from they and to allow those a free course through the sea of america to whom they have be indebted for a uninterrupted passage to the possession of a kingdom he might likewise urge sir that when he be oblige to make war upon they he be so tender of they interest that the british admiral be send out with order rather to destroy he own fleet than the galleon which in appearance he be send to take and to perish by the inclemency of the climate rather than enter the spanish port terrify they colony or plunder they town but to little purpose sir do we minister implore the compassion of the spaniard and represent the benefit by which we might claim it for he compliance be by the subtle spaniard attribute not to kindness but to fear and it be therefore determine to reduce he to absolute slavery by the same practice which have already sink he to so abject a state they therefore treat we remonstrance with contempt continue they insolence and they oppression and while we agent be cringe at they court with fresh instruction in he hand while he be hurry with busy look from one grandee to another and perhaps dismiss without a audience one day and send back in the midst of he harangue on another the guardship of the spaniard continue they havock we merchant be ruin and we sailor tortured at length sir the nation be too much inflamed to be any longer amuse with idle negotiation or trifling expedient the street echo with the clamor of the populace and this house be crowd with petition from the merchant the honorable person with all he art find himself unable any longer to elude a determination of this affair those whom he have hitherto persuade that he have fail merely for want of ability begin now to suspect that he have no desire of better success and those who have hitherto cheerfully merit they pension by a unshaken adherence to all he measure who have extol he wisdom and he integrity with all the confidence of security begin now to be shake by the universality of the censure which the open support of perfidy bring upon they they be afraid any longer to assert what they neither believe themselves nor could persuade other to admit the most indolent be alarm the most obstinate convinced and the most profligate ashamed what could now be do sir to gain a few month to secure a short interval of quiet in which he agent might be employ to disseminate some new falsehood bribe to he party some new vindicator or lull the people with the opiate of another expedient with a account of concession from the court of spain or a congress to compute the loss and adjust the claim of we merchant something be necessarily to be attempt and order be therefore despatch by we minister to he slave at the court of spain to procure some stipulation that might have at least the appearance of a step towards the conclusion of the debate he agent obey he with he usual alacrity and address and in time send he for the satisfaction of the british people the celebrated convention the convention sir have be so lately discuss be so particularly remembered and so universally condemn that it would be a unjustifiable prodigality of time to expatiate upon it there be but few in the last senate and i hope there be none in this who do not see the meanness of suffer incontestable claim to be dispute by commissary the injustice of the demand which be make upon the south-sea company and the contemptuous insolence of amusing we with the shadow of a stipulation which be to vanish into nothing unless we purchase a ratification of it by pay what we do not owe the convention therefore sir be so far from pacify that it only exasperate the nation and take from we minister the power of act any longer openly in favor of the spaniard of whom it must be confess that they wisdom be overpower by they pride and that for the sake of show to all the power of europe the dependence in which they hold the court of britain they take from they friend the power of serve they any longer and make it unsafe for they to pay that submission to which they be incline the spaniard do not sufficiently distinguish between the nation and the ministry of britain nor suspect that they interest inclination and opinion be directly opposite and that those who be caress fear and reverence by the ministry be by the people hate despise and ridicule by enslave we ministry they weakly imagine that they have conquer we nation nor perhaps sir would they quickly have discover they mistake have they use they victory with greater moderation condescend to govern they new province with less rigor and send we law in any other form than that of the convention but the security which success excite produce in they the same effect as it have often do in other and destroy in some degree the advantage of the conquest by which it be inspire the last proof of they contempt of we sovereign and we nation be too flagrant to be palliate and too publick not to be resent the cry of the nation be redouble the solicitation of the merchant renew the absurdity of we past conduct expose the meanness of we forbearance reproach and the necessity of more vigorous measure evidently prove the friend of spain discover sir at length that war be necessarily to be proclaimed and that it would be no longer they interest to act in open opposition to justice and reason to the policy of all age and remonstrance of the whole nation the minister therefore after long delay after have run round the circle of all he artifice and endeavor to intimidate the nation by false representation of the power of we enemy and the danger of a invasion from they at length suffer war to be proclaimed though not till he have take all precaution that might disappoint we of success he know that the state of the spanish dominion expose they in a particular manner to sudden incursion by small party and that in former war against they we chief advantage have be gain by the boldness and subtilty of private adventurer who by hover over they coast in small vessel without raise the alarm which the sight of a royal navy necessarily produce have discover opportunity of landing unexpectedly and enter they town by surprise of plunder they wealthy ship or enrich themselves by ransom and composition he know what inconsiderable body of man incite by private advantage select with care for particular expedition instruct by secret intelligence and conceal by the smallness of they number have find means to march up into the country through way which would never have be attempt by regular force and have bring upon the spaniard more terror and distress than could have be produce by a powerful army however carefully discipline or however skilfuly command it be therefore sir he first care to secure he darling spaniard from the pernicious design of private adventurer he know not but some of elizabeth 's hero might unfortunately revive and terrify with a unexpected invasion the remotest corner of the spanish colony or appear before they port with he nimble sloop and bid defiance to they navy and they garrison when therefore a bill be introduce into this house by which encouragement be give to the subject of this kingdom to fit out privateer and by which those who should conquer any of the colony of the spaniard be confirm in the possession of they for ever it can not be forget with what zeal he oppose and with what steadiness he reject it though it be not possible to assign any disadvantage which could have be produce by pass it and the utmost that could be urge against it be that it be unnecessary and useless have thus discourage that method of war which be most to be dread by we enemy and leave they little to fear but from national force and publick preparation he next care be to secure they from any destructive blow by give they time to equip they fleet collect they force repair they fortification garrison they town and regulate they trade for this purpose he delay as long as it be possible the despatch of we navy embarrass we levy of sailor by the violence of impress violence which proper encouragement and regulation might have make unnecessary and suffer the privateer of the enemy to plunder we merchant without control under pretence that ship of war could not be station nor convoy provide for they protection at length several fleet be fit out vernon be send to america and haddock into the mediterranean with what coqsequence it be well know nor should i mention they at this time have i not be awaken to the remembrance of they by a proposal of thanks for the conduct of the war the behavior of the two admiral be very different though it have not yet appear but that they order be the same vernon with six ship destroy those fortification before which hosier formerly perish in obedience to the command of we ministry how this success be receive by the minister and he adherent how much they be offend at the exultation of the populace how evidently they appear to consider it as a breach of they scheme and a deviation from they direction the whole nation can relate nor be it to be forget sir how invidiously the minister himself endeavor to extenuate the honor of that action by attempt to procure in the address which be on that occasion present to he majesty a suppression of the number of the ship with which he perform it in the mean time sir the nation expect account of the same kind from the mediterranean where haddock be station with a very considerable force but instead of relation of port bombard and town plunder of navy destroy and village lay in ash we be daily inform of the loss of we merchant whose ship be take almost within sight of we squadron we have indeed once the satisfaction of hearing that the fleet of spain be confine in the port of cadiz unprovided with provision and it be rashly report that means would either be find of destroy they in the harbor or that they would be shut up in that unfruitful part of the country till they should be oblige to disband they crew we therefore sir bear with patience the daily havock of we trade in expectation of the entire destruction of the royal navy of spain which would reduce they to despair of resistance and compel they to implore peace but while we be flattering ourselves with those please dream we be waken on a sudden with a astonishing account that the spaniard have leave cadiz and without any interruption from the briton be take in provision at ferrol this disappointment of we expectation do indeed discourage we but not deprive we of hope we know that the most politick be sometimes deceive and that the most vigilant may sometimes relax they attention we do not expect in we commander any exemption from human error and require only that they should endeavor to repair they failure and correct they mistake and therefore wait without clamor in expectation that what be omit at cadiz would be perform at ferrol but no sooner sir have the spaniard store they fleet than we be surprise with a revolution of affair yet more wonderful haddock instead of remain before ferrol be draw off by some chimerical alarm to protect minorca and the spaniard in the mean time sail away to america in conjunction with the french squadron that have be for some time ready for the voyage if we consider the absurdity of this conduct it can not but be imagine that we minister must send haddock false intelligence and treacherous direction on purpose that the spanish fleet might escape without interruption for how can it be conceive that the spaniard could have form any real design of besiege port mahon be it probable that they would have send a army in defenceless transport into the jaw of the british fleet and it be well know that they have no ship of war to protect they it be not very agreeable to common policy to land a army upon a island a island wholly destitute of provision for they support while a hostile navy be in possession of the sea by which the fortress which they troops be destine to besiege might be daily supply with necessaries and the garrison augment with new force while they army would be itself besiege in a barren island without provision without recruit without hope of succor or possibility of success but such be the solicitude of we admiral for the preservation of minorca that he abandon he station and suffer the spaniard to join they confederate of france and prosecute they voyage to america without hinderance or pursuit in america they remain for some time master of the sea and confine vernon to the port but want of provision oblige the french to return no invasion of we colony be attempt nor any of those destructive measure pursue which we have reason to fear and of which we minister notwithstanding he wonderful sagacity could not have foretell that they would have be defeat by a unexpected scarcity of victuals the spaniard however gain by this expedient time to repair they fortification strengthen they garrison and dispose they force in the most advantageous manner and therefore though they be not enable to attack we dominion have at least a opportunity of secure they own at length sir lest it should be indisputably evident that we minister be in confederacy with the spaniard it be determine that they american territory should be invade but care be take to disappoint the success of the expedition by employ new-raised troops and officer without experience and to make it burdensome to the nation by a double number of officer of which no use could be discover but that of increase the influence and multiply the dependant of the ministry it be not think sufficient sir to favor the design of the spaniard by the delay which the levy of new troops necessarily produce and to encourage they by the probability of a easy resistance against raw force nor be the nation in the opinion of the minister punish for its rebellion against he with adequate severity by be condemn to support a double number of troops some other method be to be use for embarrassing we preparation and protract the war the troops therefore sir be by the accident of a hard winter more speedily raise than it be reasonable to expect be detain in this island for several month upon trivial pretence and be at length suffer to embark at a time when it be well know that they would have much more formidable enemy than the spaniard to encounter when the unhealthy season of the american climate must necessarily destroy they by thousand when the air itself be poison and to be wound certainly death these be the hardship to which part of we fellow-subject have be expose by the tyranny of the minister hardship which caution could not obviate nor bravery surmount they be send to combat with nature to encounter with the blast of disease and to make war against the element they be send to feed the vulture of america and to gratify the spaniard with a easy conquest in the passage the general die and the command devolve upon a man who have never see a enemy and be therefore only a speculative warrior a accident which as it be not unlikely to happen would have be provide against by any minister who wish for success the melancholy event of this expedition i need not mention it be such as might be reasonably expect when we troops be send out without discipline without commander into a country where even the dew be fatal against enemy inform of they approach secure by fortification inure to the climate well provide and skilfully command in the mean time sir it be not to be forget what depredation be make upon we trading vessel with what insolence ship of very little force approach we coast and seize we merchant in sight of we fortification it be not to be forget that the conduct of some of those who owe they revenue and power to the minister give yet stronger proof of a combination it be not to be forget with what effrontery the loss of we merchant be ridicule with what contemptuous triumph of revenge they be charge with the guilt of this fatal war and how publickly they be condemn to suffer for they folly for this reason sir they be either deny the security of convoy or forsake in the most dangerous part of the sea by those to whose protection they be in appearance commit for this reason they be either hinder from engage in they voyage by the loss of those man who be detain unactive in the ship of war or deprive of they crew upon the high sea or suffer to proceed only to become a prey to the spaniard but it be not sir a sufficient gratification of we implacable minister that the merchant be distressed for alarming the nation it be think likewise necessary to punish the people for believe too easily the report of the merchant and to warn they for ever against daring to imagine themselves able to discern they own interest or to prescribe other measure to the minister than they should be themselves incline to pursue we minister be resolve to show they by a master-stroke that it be in he power to disappoint they desire by seem to comply and to destroy they commerce and they happiness by the very mean by which they hope to secure they for this purpose sir do this great man summon all he politick together and call to council all he confidant and all he dependant and it be at length after mature deliberation determine by they unite wisdom to put more ship into commission to aggravate the terror of the impress by new violence and severity to draw the sailor by the promise of large reward from the service of the merchant to collect a mighty fleet and to despatch it on a _ secret expedition _ a secret expedition sir be a new term of ministerial art a term which may have be perhaps formerly make use of by soldier for a design to be execute without give the enemy a opportunity of provide for they defense but be now use for a design with which the enemy be better acquaint than those to whom the execution of it be commit a secret expedition be now a expedition of which every one know the design but those at whose expense it be undertake it be a kind of naval review which excel those of the park in magnificence and expense but be equally useless and equally ridiculous upon these secret expedition however be fix for a long time the expectation of the people they see all the appearance of preparation for real war they be inform that the workman in the dock be retain by uncommon wages to do double duty they see the most specious encouragement offer to the sailor they see naval store accumulate with the utmost industry hear of nothing but the proof of new cannon and new contract for provision and how much reason soever they have to question the sincerity of the great man who have so long engross the management of all affair they do not imagine that he be yet so abandon to levy force only to exhaust they money and equip fleet only to expose they to ridicule when therefore sir after the usual delay the papers have inform the people that the great fleet be sail they no longer doubt that the spaniard be to be reduce to we own term they expect to be tell in a few day of the destruction of fleet the demolition of castle and the plunder of city and everyone envy the fortune of those who by be admit into they formidable fleet be entitle to the treasure of such wealthy enemy when they have for some time indulge these expectation a account be bring that the fleet be return without the least action or the least attempt and that new provision be to be take in that they might set out upon another _ secret expedition _ but sir this wonder-working term have now lose its efficacy and it be discover that _ secret expedition _ like all other _ secret service _ be only expedient to drain the money of the people and to conceal the ignorance or villany of the minister such have be the conduct for which we be desire to return thanks in a humble and dutiful address such be the transaction which we be to recommend to the approbation of we constituent and such the triumph upon which we must congratulate we sovereign for my part sir i can not but think that silence be a censure too gentle of that wickedness which no language can exaggerate and for which as it have perhaps no example human kind have not yet provide a name murder parricide and treason be modest appellation when refer to that conduct by which a king be betray and a nation ruin under pretence of promote its interest by a man trust with the administration of publick affair let we therefore sir if it be think not proper to lay before he majesty the sentiment of he people in they full extent at least not endeavor to conceal they from he let we at least address he in such a manner as may give he some occasion to inquire into the late transaction which have for many year be such that to inquire into they be to condemn they sir robert walpole rise again and speak to this effect : -- sir though i be far from be either confound or intimidate by this atrocious charge though i be confident that all the measure which have be so clamorously censure will admit of a very easy vindication and that whenever they be explain they will be approve yet as a accusation so complicated can not be confute without a long recapitulation of past event and a deduction of many particular circumstance some of which may require evidence and some a very minute and prolix explication i can not think this a proper day for engage in the controversy because it be my interest that it may be accurately discuss at present sir i shall content myself with bare assertion like those of he by whom i be accuse and hope they will not be hear with less attention or receive with less belief for surely it be never deny to any man to defend himself with the same weapon with which he be attack i shall therefore sir make no scruple to assert that the treasure of the publick have be employ with the utmost frugality to promote the purpose for which it be grant that we foreign affair have be transact with the utmost fidelity in pursuance of long consultation and shall venture to add that we success have not be such as ought to produce any suspicion of negligence or treachery that we design against carthagena be defeat can not be deny but what war have be one continue series of success in the late war with france of which the conduct have be so lavishly celebrate do no design miscarry if we conquer at ramilly be we not in we turn beat at almanza if we destroy the french ship be it not always with some loss of we own and since the suffering of we merchant have be mention with so much acrimony do not the list of the ship take in that war prove that the depredation of privateer can not be entirely prevent the disappointment sir of the publick expectation by the return of the fleet have be charge upon the administration as a crime too enormous to be mention without horror and detestation that the ministry have not the element in they power that they do not prescribe the course of the wind be a sufficient proof of they negligence and weakness : with as much justice be it charge upon they that the expectation of the populace which they do not raise and to which perhaps the conquest of a kingdom have not be equal fail of be gratify i be very far from hope or desire that the house should be satisfy with a defense like this i know by observe the practice of the opponent of the ministry what fallacy may be conceal in general assertion and be so far from wish to evade a more exact inquiry that if the gentleman who have thus publickly and confidently accuse the ministry will name a day for examine the state of the nation i will second he motion -lrb- the address be at length agree to without a division -rrb- mr pulteney then move that the state of the nation should be consider six week hence sir robert walpole second the motion and it be unanimously agree that this house will on the 21st of next month resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to consider of the state of the nation but when that day come sir robert walpole have be able to defeat a motion which be to refer some papers to a secret committee the consideration of the state of the nation be put off for a fortnight but on the eve of that day both house adjourn for fourteen day during which sir robert walpole resign he employment of first lord of the treasury and chancellor and under treasurer of he majesty 's exchequer and be create a peer by the title of lord walpole and earl of orford house of common march 9 1741-2 on a motion for inquire into the conduct of affair at home and abroad during the last twenty year lord limerick rise and speak in the follow manner : -- sir as i be about to offer to the house a motion of the highest importance to the honor and happiness of we country to the preservation of we privilege and the continuance of we constitution i make no doubt of a candid attention from this assembly and hope for such a determination as shall be the result not of external influence but of real conviction i can not but congratulate myself and all lover of they country that we be arrive at a time in which such hope may be rationally indulge that we shall soon see the triumph of liberty and the renovation of senatorial freedom it be not without the highest satisfaction that i find my life protracted to that happy day in which the yoke of dependence have be shake off and the shackle of oppression have be break in which truth and justice have once more raise up they head and obtain that regard which have so long be pay to splendid wickedness and successful rapine the time be now past in which it be meritorious to harden the heart against pity and the forehead against shame to plunder the people by needless tax and insult they by display they spoil before they eye in luxurious riot and boundless magnificence when the certain method of obtain what the greatest part even of good man can not but sometimes wish to acquire interest affluence and honor be a implicit resignation to authority a desertion of all principle defiance of all censure and a open declaration against any other motive of action than the sole pleasure of a arbitrary minister it be now sir no longer consider as a instance of disaffection to the government to represent the misery and declare the opinion of the people to propose they interest as the great basis of government the general end of society and the parent of law it be now no longer criminal to affirm that they have a right to complain when they be in they own opinion injure and to be hear when they complain it may now be with safety assert that those who swell with the pride of office and glitter with the magnificence of a court however they may display they affluence or boast they title with whatever contempt they may have learn of late to look upon they fellow-subject who have no possession but what they have obtain by they industry nor any honor but what be voluntarily pay to they understanding and they virtue with whatever authority they may dictate to they dependant or whatever reverence they may exact from a long subordination of hireling be amidst all they pomp and influence only the servant of the people intrust by they with the administration of they affair and accountable to they for the abuse of trust that trust of the highest importance have be long abused that the servant of the people have long think themselves out of the reach of justice and above examination have very ill discharge the office in which they have be engage that the publick advantage have be wholly disregard that treaty have be conclude without any regard to the interest of britain and that we foreign and domestick affair have be manage with equal ignorance negligence or wickedness the present state of europe and the calamity of this country will sufficiently inform we if we survey the condition of foreign nation we shall find that the power and dominion of the family of bourbon a family which have never have any other design than the extirpation of true religion and the universal slavery of mankind have be daily increase we shall find that they have increase by the declension of the house of austrium which treaty and we interest engage we to support but have they acquisition be make only by the force of arm have they grow stronger only by victory and more wealthy only by plunder we minister might with some appearance of reason have imputed they success to accident and inform we that we gain in the mean time a sufficient counterbalance to those advantage by a uninterrupted commerce and by the felicity of peace peace which in every nation have be find to produce affluence and of which the wisest man have think that it could scarcely be too dearly purchase but peace have in this nation by the wonderful artifice of we minister be the parent of poverty and misery we have be so far from find we commerce extend by it that we have enjoy it only by a contemptible patience of the most open depredation by a long connivance at piracy and by a continued submission to insult which no other nation would have bear we have be so far from see any part of we tax remit that we have be load with more rigorous exaction to support the expense of peace than be find necessary to defray the charge of a war against those whose opulence and power have incite they to aspire to the dominion of the world how these tax have be employ and why we trade have be neglect why we ally have be betray and why the ancient enemy of we country have be suffer to grow powerful by we connivance it be now time to examine and therefore i move that a committee be appoint to inquire into the conduct of affair at home and abroad during the last twenty year sir john st aubin then speak as follow : -- sir i rise up to second this motion and as the noble lord have open it in so full and proper a manner and as i do not doubt but that other gentleman be ready to support it more practice in speaking of greater ability and authority than myself i be the less anxious about the injury it may receive from the part i bear in it i think the proposition be so evident that it want no enforcement it come to you from the voice of the nation which thank god have at last find admittance within these wall innocence be of so delicate a nature that it can not bear suspicion and therefore will desire inquiry because it will always be justify by it guilt from its own consciousness will use subterfuge and fly to concealment and the more righteous and authoritative the inquiry the more it will be avoid because the greater will be the dread of punishment in private life i be contented with man 's virtue only without seek for opportunity of blame in a publick character when national grievance cry aloud for inquiry and justice it be we duty to pursue all the footstep of guilt and the loud the pathetick appeal of my constituent be more forcibly persuasive than any motive of private tenderness this appeal be not the clamor of faction artfully raise to disturb the operation of government violent for a while and soon to be appease it be the complaint of long and patient suffering a complaint not to be silence and which all endeavor to suppress it would only make more importunate and clamorous it be the solemn appeal of the whole people of the unite body of we constituent in this time of national calamity earnestly beseech you in a legal parliamentary way to redress they grievance to revive you ancient right of inquiry to explore the most remote and hidden source of iniquity to detect the bold author of they distress that they may be make example of national justice it be to you they appeal the true the genuine representative of the people not like former parliament a instrument of state the property of a minister purchase by the missionary of corruption who have be disperse through the kingdom and furnish with the publick money to invade all natural interest by poisoning the moral of the people upon this rotten foundation have be erect a towering fabrick of corruption : a most dangerous conspiracy have be carry on against the very essence of we constitution a formidable system of ministerial power have be form fallaciously assume under constitutional appearance the name of legal government in this system we have see the several office of administration meanly resolve themselves under the direction and control of one man : while this scheme be pursue the nation have be ingloriously patient of foreign indignity we trade have be most shamefully neglect or basely betray a war with a impotent enemy most amply provide for unsuccessfully carry on the faith of treaty break we natural ally desert and weaken even by that power which we now dread for want of they assistance it be not the bare removal from office that will satisfy the nation especially if such removal be dignified with the highest mark of royal favor this only give mankind a reasonable fear that he majesty have rather condescend to the importunity than adopt the opinion of he people it be indeed a most gracious condescension a very high instance of he majesty 's just intention to remove any of he servant upon national suspicion but it will give he majesty a most unfavourable opinion of he people if he be not satisfy that this suspicion be just it be the unfortunate situation of arbitrary king that they know the sentiment of they people only from whisperer in they closet we monarchy have securer establishment we sovereign be always sure of know the true sense of he people because he may see it through the proper the constitutional medium : but then this medium must be pure it must transmit every object in its real form and its natural color this be all that be now contend for you be call to the exercise of you just right of inquiry that he majesty may see what reason there be for this general inquietude this motion be of a general nature whom it may more particularly affect i shall not determine but there be a great person lately at the head of the administration who stand foremost the principal object of national suspicion he surely will not decline this inquiry it be he own proposition he have frequently in the name of the whole administration throw down he gauntlet here have desire you inquiry and have rest he fate on you justice the nation accept the challenge they join issue with he they be now desirous to bring this great cause in judgment before you it must be imputed to the long intermission of this right of inquiry that the people have now this cause of complaint have the administration of this great person be submit to the constitutional control have he conduct undergo strict and frequent inquiry he have part and ability to have do great honor and service to this country but the will uncontroul for ever must and will produce security and wantonness nor can moderation and despotick power subsist long together in vain do we admire the outline of we constitution in vain do we boast of those wise and salutary restraint which we ancestor at the expense of they blood and treasure have wisely impose upon monarchy itself if it be to be a constitution in theory only if this evasive doctrine be to be admit that a fellow-subject of we own perhaps of the lowest rank among we may be delegate by the crown to exercise the administration of government with absolute uncontroulable dominion over we which must be the case if ministerial conduct be not liable to parliamentary inquiry if i do not think this motion agreeable to the rule and proceedings of the senate if i think it be mean to introduce any procedure which be not strictly consonant to the law and constitution of my country i do most solemnly protest i would be against it but as i apprehend it to arise from the nature and spirit of we constitution as it will defend the innocent and can be detrimental only to the guilty i do most heartily second the motion the hon henry pelham oppose the motion to the following effect : -- sir if it be not daily to be observe how much the mind of the wisest and most moderate man be elate with success and how often those who have be able to surmount the strongest obstacle with unwearied diligence and to preserve they fortitude unshaken amidst hourly disappointment have be betray by slight advantage into indecent exultation unreasonable confidence and chimerical hope have i not long remark the infatuation of prosperity and the pride of triumph i should not have hear the motion which have be now make without astonishment it have be long the business or the amusement of the gentleman who have for some time confer upon themselves the venerable title of patriot advocate for the people and defender of the constitution have at length persuade part of the nation to dignify they with the same appellation to display in the most pathetick language and aggravate with the most hyperbolical exaggeration the wantonness with which the late ministry exercise they power the exorbitance of they demand and the violence of they measure they have indulge they imagination which have always be sufficiently fruitful in satire and invective by represent they as man in whom all regard to decency or reputation be extinguish man who no longer submit to wear the mask of hypocrisy or think the esteem of mankind worth they care who have cease to profess any regard to the welfare of they country or any desire of advance the publick happiness and who no longer desire any other effect of they power than the security of themselves and the conquest of they opponent such sir have be the character of the ministry which by the incessant endeavor of these disinterested patriot have be carry to the remotest corner of the empire and disseminate through all the degree of the people every man whom they could enlist among they pupil whom they could persuade to see with they eye rather than he own and who be not so stubborn as to require proof of they assertion and reason of they conduct every man who have no sentiment of he own hope to become important by echo those of he instructor be teach to think and to say that the court be fill with open corruption that the greatest and the wisest man of the kingdom set themselves publickly to sale and hold a open traffick for vote and place that whoever engage in the party of the minister declare himself ready to support he cause against truth and reason and conviction and be no longer under the restraint of shame or virtue these assertion hardy as they be they endeavor to support by instance of measure which they describe as have no other tendency than to advance the court to absolute authority to enslave the nation or to betray it : and more happily would they have propagate they system and much sooner would they have obtain a general declaration of the people in they favor have they be able to have produce a motion like this should the influence of these man increase should they grow secure in the possession of they power by any new method of delude the people what wonderful expedient what unheard-of method of government may not be expect from they what degree of violence may they not be suppose to practice who have flush they new authority by a motion which be never project since the first existence of we government or offer by the most arbitrary minister in all the confidence of a established majority it may perhaps be imagine by many of those who be unacquainted with senatorial affair as many of the member of this house may without any reproach be suppose to be that i have make use of those art against the patriot which they have so long practice against the court that i have exaggerate the enormity of the motion by unjust comparison or rhetorical flight and that there will be neither danger nor inconvenience in comply with it to any but those who have betray they trust or neglect they duty i doubt not but many of those with whom this motion have be concerted have approve it without see all its consequence and have be betray into that approbation by a laudable zeal for they country and a honest indignation against corruption and treachery by a virtuous desire of detect wickedness and of secure we constitution from any future danger or attack for the sake therefore of these gentleman whom i can not but suppose willing to follow the dictate of they own conscience and to act upon just motive i shall endeavor to lay open the nature of this extraordinary motion and doubt not but that when they find it as it will unquestionably appear unreasonable in itself and dangerous to posterity they will change they opinion for the same reason as they embrace it and prefer the happiness of they country to the prosperity of they party against a inquiry into the conduct of all foreign and domestick affair for _ twenty _ year past it be no weak argument that it be without precedent that neither the zeal of patriotism nor the rage of faction ever produce such a motion in any former age it can not be doubt by those who have read we history that formerly we country have produce man equally desirous of detect wickedness and secure liberty with those who be now congratulating they constituent on the success of they labor and that faction have swell in former time to a height at which it may reasonably be hope it will never arrive again be too evident to be controvert what then can we suppose be the reason that neither indignation nor integrity nor resentment ever before direct a motion like this be it not because it neither will serve the purpose of honesty nor wickedness that it would have defeat the design of good and betray those of bad man that it would have give patriotism a appearance of faction rather than have vest faction with the disguise of patriotism it can not be suppose that the sagacity of these gentleman however great have enable they to discover a method of proceeding which escape the penetration of we ancestor so long celebrate for the strength of they understanding and the extent of they knowledge for it be evident that without any uncommon effort of the intellectual faculty he that propose a inquiry for a year past might have make the same proposal with regard to a longer time and it be therefore probable that the limitation of the term be the effect of he knowledge rather than of he ignorance and indeed the absurdity of a universal inquiry for twenty year past be such that no man whose station have give he opportunity of be acquaint with publick business could have propose it have he not be mislead by the vehemence of resentment or biass by the secret operation of some motive different from publick good for it be no less than a proposal for a attempt impossible to be execute and of which the execution if it could be effect would be detrimental to the publick be we nation sir like some of the inland kingdom of the continent or the barbarous empire of japan without commerce without alliance without tax and without competition with other nation do we depend only on the product of we own soil to support we and the strength of we own arm to defend we without any intercourse with distant empire or any solicitude about foreign affair be the same measure uniformly pursue the government support by the same revenue and administer with the same view it might not be impracticable to examine the conduct of affair both foreign and domestick for twenty year because every year would afford only a transcript of the account of the last but how different be the state of britain a nation whose traffick be extend over the earth whose revenue be every year different or differently apply which be daily engage in new treaty of alliance or form new regulation of trade with almost every nation however distant which have undertake the arduous and intricate employment of superintend the interest of all foreign empire and maintain the equipoise of the french power which receive ambassador from all the neighbouring prince and extend its regard to the limit of the world in such a nation every year produce negotiation of peace or preparation for war new scheme and different measure by which expense be sometimes increase and sometimes retrench in such a nation every thing be in a state of perpetual vicissitude because its measure be seldom the effect of choice but of necessity arise from the change of conduct in other power nor be the multiplicity and intricacy of we domestick affair less remarkable or particular it be too well know that we debt be great and we tax numerous that we fund appropriate to particular purpose be at some time deficient and at other redundant and that therefore the money arise from the same impost be differently apply in different year to assert that this fluctuation produce intricacy may be imagine a censure of those to whose care we account be commit but surely it must be own that we account be make necessarily less uniform and regular and such as must require a longer time for a complete examination whoever shall set he foot in we office and observe the number of papers with which the transaction of the last twenty year have fill they will not need any argument against this motion when he see the number of writings which such a inquiry will make necessary to be peruse compare and extract the account which must be examine and oppose to other the intelligence from foreign court which must be consider and the estimate of domestick expense which must be discuss he will own that whoever be doom to the task of this inquiry would be happy in exchange he condition with that of the miner of america and that the most resolute industry however excite by ambition or animated by patriotism must sink under the weight of endless labor if it be consider how many be employ in the publick office it must be confess either that the national treasure be squander in salary upon man who have no employment or that twenty year may be reasonably suppose to produce more papers than a committee can examine and indeed if the committee of inquiry be not more numerous than have ever be appoint it may be assert without exaggeration that the inquiry into we affair for twenty year past will not be accurately perform in less than twenty year to come in which time those whose conduct be now suppose to have give the chief occasion to this motion may be expect to be remove for ever from the malice of calumny and the rage of persecution but if it should be imagine by those who have never be engage in publick affair can not properly judge of they intricacy and extent that such a inquiry be in reality so far from be impossible that it be only the work of a few month and that the labor of it will be amply recompense by the discovery which it will produce let they but so long suspend the gratification of they curiosity as to consider the nature of that demand by which they be about to satisfy it a demand by which nothing less be require than that all the secret of we government should be make publick it be know in general to every man whose employment or amusement it have be to consider the state of the french kingdom that the last twenty year have be a time not of war but of negotiation a period crown with project and machination often more dangerous than violence and invasion and that these project have be counteract by opposite scheme that treaty have be defeat by treaty and one alliance overbalance by another such a train of transaction in which almost every court of france have be engage must have give occasion to many private conference and secret negotiation many design must have be discover by informer who give they intelligence at the hazard of they life and be defeat sometimes by secret stipulation and sometimes by a judicious distribution of money to those who preside in senate or council every man must immediately be convince that by the inquiry now propose all these secret will be bring to light that one prince will be inform of the treachery of he servant and another see he own cowardice or venality expose to the world it be plain that the channel of intelligence will be for ever stop and that no prince will enter into private treaty with a monarch who be deny by the constitution of he empire the privilege of conceal he own measure it be evident that we enemy may hereafter plot we ruin in full security and that we ally will no longer treat we with confidence since therefore the inquiry now demand be impossible the motion ought to be reject as it can have no other tendency than to expose the senate and the nation to ridicule and since if it could be perform it would produce consequence fatal to we government as it would expose we most secret measure to we enemy and weaken the confidence of we ally i hope every man who regard either he own reputation or that of the senate or profess any solicitude for the publick good will oppose the motion lord quarendon speak to this effect : -- sir i be always incline to suspect a man who endeavor rather to terrify than persuade exaggeration and hyperbole be seldom make use of by he who have any real argument to produce the reasonableness of this motion -lrb- of which i be convince when i first hear it and of which i believe no man can doubt who be not afraid of the inquiry propose by it -rrb- be now in my opinion evince by the weak opposition which have be make by the honorable gentleman to whose ability i can not deny this attestation that the cause which he can not defend have very little to hope from any other advocate and surely he can not even by those who whenever he speak stand prepare to applaud he be think to have produce any formidable argument against the inquiry who have advance little more than that it be impossible to be perform impossibility be a formidable sound to ignorance and cowardice but experience have often discover that it be only a sound utter by those who have nothing else to say and courage readily surmount those obstacle that sink the lazy and timorous into despair that there be indeed impossibility in nature can not be deny there may be scheme form which no wise man will attempt to execute because he will know that they can not succeed but surely the examination of arithmetical deduction or the consideration of treaty and conference can not be admit into the number of impossible design unless as it may sometimes happen the treaty and calculation be unintelligible the only difficulty that can arise must be produce by the confusion and perplexity of we publick transaction the inconsistency of we treaty and the fallaciousness of we estimate but i hope no man will urge these as argument against the motion a inquiry ought to be promote that confusion may be reduce to order and that the distribution of the publick money may be regulate if the examination be difficult it ought to be speedily perform because those difficulty be daily increase if it be impossible it ought to be attempt that those method of form calculation may be change which make they impossible to be examine mr fowke reply in the manner following : -- sir to treat with contempt those argument which can not readily be answer be the common practice of disputant but as it be contrary to that candor and ingenuity which be inseparable from zeal for justice and love of truth it always raise a suspicion of private view and of design which however they may be conceal by specious appearance and vehement profession of integrity and sincerity tend in reality to the promotion of some secret interest or the gratification of some darling passion it be reasonable to imagine that he who in the examination of publick question call in the assistance of artifice and sophistry be actuate rather by the rage of persecution than the ardor of patriotism that he be pursue a enemy rather than detect a criminal and that he declaim against the abuse of power in another only that he may more easily obtain it himself in senatorial debate i have often know this method of easy confutation practice sometimes with more success and sometimes with less i have often known ridicule of use when reason have be baffle and see those affect to despise they opponent who have be able to produce nothing against they but artful allusion to past debate satirical insinuation of dependence or hardy assertion unsupported by proof by these art i have know the young and unexperienced keep in suspense i have see the cautious and diffident teach to doubt of the plainest truth and the bold and sanguine persuade to join in the cry and hunt down reason after the example of they leader but a bolder attempt to disarm argument of its force and to perplex the understanding have not often be make than this which i be now endeavor to oppose a motion have be make and second for a inquiry to which it be object not that it be illegal not that it be inconvenient not that it be unnecessary but that it be _ impossible _ a objection more formidable can not in my opinion easily be make nor can it be imagine that those man would think any other worthy of a attentive examination who can pass over this as below they regard yet even this have produce no answer but contemptuous raillery and violent exclamation what argument these gentleman require it be not easy to conjecture or how those who disapprove they measure may with any hope of success dispute against they those impetuous spirit that break so easily through the bar of impossibility will scarcely suffer they career to be stop by any other restraint and it may be reasonably fear that argument from justice or law or policy will have little force upon these daring mind who in the transport of they newly acquire victory trample impossibility under they foot and imagine that to those who have vanquish the ministry every thing be practicable that this inquiry would be the work of year that it will employ greater number than be ever depute by this house on such a occasion before that it would deprive the nation of the counsel of the wisest and most experienced member of this house -lrb- for such only ought to be choose -rrb- at a time when all europe be in arm when we ally be threaten not only with subjection but annihilation when the french be revive they ancient scheme and project the conquest of the continent and that it will therefore interrupt we attention to more important affair and disable we from rescue we confederate be incontestably evident nor can the wisest or the most experienced determine how far its consequence may extend or inform we whether it may not expose we commerce to be destroy by the spaniard and the liberty of all the nation round we to be infringe by the french whether it may not terminate in the loss of we independence and the destruction of we religion such be the effect which may be expect from a attempt to make the inquiry propose effect to which no proportionate advantage can be expect from it since it have be already show that it can never be complete and to which though the indefatigable industry of curiosity or malice should at length break through all obstacle and lay all the transaction of twenty year open to the world no discovery would be equivalent that any real discovery of misconduct would be make that the interest of we country would be find ever to have be lazily neglect or treacherously betray that any of we rights have be either yield by cowardice or sell by avarice or that we enemy have gain any advantage over we by the connivance or ignorance of we minister i be indeed very far from believe but as i be now endeavor to convince those of the impropriety of this motion who have long declare themselves of a different opinion it may not be improper to ask what advantage they propose by detect error of twenty year which be now irretrievable of inquire into fraudulent practice of which the author and the agent be now probably in they grave and expose measure of which all the inconveniency have be already feel and which have now cease to affect we if it be wise to neglect we present interest for the sake of inquire into past miscarriage and the inquiry now propose be in itself possible i have no objection to the present motion but as i think the confused state of europe demand we utmost attention and the prosecution of the war against spain be in itself of far more importance than the examination of all past transaction i can not but think that the duty which i owe to my country require that i should declare myself unwilling to concur in any proposal that may unnecessarily divert we thought or distract we council lord percival then rise and speak to the follow purpose : -- sir to discourage good design by representation of the danger of attempt and the difficulty of execute they have be at all time the practice of those whose interest have be threaten by they a pirate never fail to intimidate he pursuer by exaggerate the number and resolution of he crew the strength of he vessel and the security of he retreat a cheat discourage a prosecution by dwelling upon he knowledge of all the art and subterfuge of the law the steadiness of he witness and the experience of he agent to raise false terror by artful appearance be part of the art of war nor can the general be deny praise who by a artful disposition of a small body discourage those enemy from attack he by whom he would certainly be overcome but then surely the appearance ought to be such as may reasonably be expect to deceive for a stratagem too gross only produce contempt and confidence and add the vexation of be ridiculous to the calamity of be defeat whether this will be the fate of the advocate for the ministry i be not able to determine but surely they have forget the resolution with which they enemy bear up for many year against they superiority and the conduct by which at last they defeat the united influence of power and money if they hope to discourage they from a attack by represent the bulk and strength of they paper fortification they have lose all memory of the excise and the convention who can believe they eloquence sufficiently powerful to evince that the inquiry now propose ought to be number among impossibility whoever sir be acquaint with they method of negotiation will indeed easily believe the papers sufficiently numerous and the task of examine they such as no man would willingly undertake for it do not appear for what end the immense sum which late senate have grant be expend except for the payment of secretary and minister and courier but whatever care have be employ to perplex every transaction with useless circumstance and to crowd every office with needless papers it will be long before they convince we that it be impossible to examine they they may doubtless be in time peruse though perhaps they can never be understand the utmost inconvenience sir that can be fear be the necessity of engage a greater number of hand than on former occasion and it will be no disagreeable method to the publick if we employ some of the clerk which have be retain only for the sake of gratify the leader of borough or advance the distant relation of the defender of the ministry in unravel those proceedings which they have be hitherto hire only to embarrass and in detect some of those abuse to which the will of they master have make they instrumental that they may at last deserve in some degree the salary which they have enjoy may requite the publick for they part of its spoil by contribute to the punishment of the principal plunderer and leave they office of which i hope the number will be quickly diminish with the satisfaction of have deserve at last the thanks of they country by this expedient sir the inquiry will be make at least possible and i hope though it should still remain difficult those who have so long struggle for the preservation of they country and who have at last see they labor reward with success will not be discourage from pursue it the necessity of such a inquiry will grow every day more urgent because wicked man will be harden in confidence of impunity and the difficulty such as it be will be increase by every delay for what now make a inquiry difficult or in the style of these mighty politician impossible but the length of time that have elapse since the last exertion of this right of the senate and the multitude of transaction which be necessarily to be examine what be this year a irksome and tedious task will in another year require still more patience and labor and though i can not believe that it will ever become impossible it will undoubtedly in time be sufficient to weary the most active industry and to discourage the most ardent zeal the chief argument therefore that have be hitherto employ to discourage we from a inquiry ought rather in my opinion to incite we to it we ought to remember that while the enemy of we country be fortify themselves behind a endless multiplicity of negotiation and account every day add new strength to they intrenchment and that we ought to force they while they be yet unable to resist or escape we sir william yonge then speak to the following effect : -- sir however i may be convince in my own opinion of the impracticability of the inquiry now propose whatever confidence i may repose in the extensive knowledge and long experience of those by whom it have be openly pronounce not only difficult but impossible i think there be argument against the motion which though perhaps not stronger in themselves -lrb- for what objection can be stronger than impossibility -rrb- ought at least more powerfully to incite we to oppose it of the impossibility of execute this inquiry those who have propose it well deserve to be convince not by argument but experience they deserve not to be divert by persuasion from engage in a task which they have voluntarily determine to undergo a task which neither honor nor virtue nor necessity have impose upon they and to which it may justly be suspect that they would not have submit upon any other motive than those by which they conduct have hitherto be generally direct ambition and resentment man who upon such principle condemn themselves to labor which they can not support surely deserve to perish in the execution of they own project to be overwhelm by the burden which they have lay upon themselves and to suffer the disgrace which always attend the undertaker of impossibility and from which the power of raillery and ridicule which they have so successfully display on this occasion will not be sufficient to defend they they have indeed sir with great copiousness of language and great fertility of imagination show the weakness of suppose this inquiry impossible they have propose a method of perform it which they hope will at once confute and irritate they opponent but all they raillery and all they argument have in reality be throw away upon a attempt to confute what never be advance they have first mistaken the assertion which they oppose and then expose its absurdity they have introduce a bugbear and then attempt to signalize they courage and they ability by show that it can not fright they the honorable gentleman sir who first mention to you the impossibility of this inquiry speak only accord to the common acceptation of word and be far from intend to imply natural and philosophical impossibility he be far from intend to insinuate that to examine any series of transaction or peruse any number of papers imply a absurdity or contrariety to the established order of nature he do not intend to rank this design with those of building in the air or pump out the ocean he intend only to assert a moral or popular impossibility to show that the scheme be not practicable but by greater number than could be conveniently employ upon it or in a longer space of time than it be rational to assign to it as we say it be impossible to raise grove upon rock or build city in desert by which we mean only to imply that there be no proportion between the importance of the effect and the force of the cause which must operate to produce it that the toil will be great and the advantage little in this sense sir and nothing but malice or perverseness could have discover any other the motion may be truly say to be impossible but its impossibility ought to be rather the care of those who make than of those that oppose it and therefore i shall lay before the house other reason which unless they can be answer will determine I to vote against it it can not be doubt but the papers which must on this occasion be examine contain a great number of private transaction which the interest of the nation and the honor of we sovereign require to be conceal the system of policy which the french have within the last century introduce into the world have make negotiation more necessary than in any precede time what be formerly perform by fleet and army by invasion siege and battle have be of late accomplish by more silent method empire have be enlarged without bloodshed and nation reduce to distress without the ravages of hostile army by the diminution of they commerce and the alienation of they ally for this reason sir it have be necessary frequently to engage in private treaty to obviate design sometimes justly and at other time perhaps unreasonably suspect it have be proper to act upon remote supposition and to conclude alliance which be only to be publickly own in consequence of measure take by some other power which measure be sometimes lay aside and the treaty therefore be without effect in some of these provisionary contract it be easy to conceive that design be form not to the advantage of some power whom yet we do not treat as enemy which be only to be make publick by the execution of they : in other perhaps some concession be make to we in consideration of the assistance that we promise by which the weakness of we ally may be discover and which we can not disclose without make they enemy more insolent and increase that danger from which they apply to we for security and protection if to this representation of the nature of the papers with which we office have be fill by the negotiation of the last twenty year any thing be necessary to be add it may be farther allege that it have long be the practice of every nation on this side of the globe to procure private intelligence of the design and expectation of the neighbouring power to penetrate into the council of prince and the closet of minister to discover the instruction of ambassador and the order of general to learn the intention of fleet before they be equip and of army before they be levy and to provide not only against immediate and visible hostility but to obviate remote and probable danger it need not be declare in this assembly that this can not always be do without employ man who abuse the confidence repose in they a practice on which i shall not at this time trouble the house with my opinion nor interrupt the present debate by any attempt to justify or condemn it this i think may be very reasonably allege that whether the employment of such person be defensible by the reciprocal practice of nation or not it become at least those that corrupt they and pay they for they treachery not to expose they to vengeance to torture or to ruin not to betray those crime which they have hire they to commit or give they up to punishment to which they have make themselves liable only by they instigation and for they advantage that private compact between nation and sovereign ought to be keep inviolably secret can not be doubt by any man who consider that secrecy be one of the condition of those treaty without which they have not be conclude and therefore that to discover they be to violate they to break down the security of human society to destroy mutual trust and introduce into the world universal confusion for nothing less can be produce by a disregard of those tie which link nation in confederacy and produce confidence and security and which enable the weak by union to resist the attack of powerful ambition how much it would injure the honor of we sovereign to be charge with the dissolution of concord and the subversion of the general bulwark of publick faith it be superfluous to explain to know the condition to which a compliance with this motion would reduce the british nation we need only turn we eye downward upon the hourly scene of common life we need only attend to the occurrence which crowd perpetually upon we view and consider the calamitous state of that man of whom it be generally know that he can not be trust and that secret communicate to he be in reality scatter among mankind every one know that such a man can expect none of the advantage or pleasure of friendship that he can not transact affair with other upon term of equality that he must purchase the favor of those that be more powerful than himself and frighten those into compliance with he design who have any thing to fear from he that he must give uncommon security for the performance of he covenant that he can have no influence but that of money which will probably become every day less that he success will multiply he enemy and that in misfortune he will be without refuge the condition of nation collectively consider be not different from that of private man they prosperity be produce by the same conduct and they calamity draw upon they by the same error negligence or crime and therefore since he that betray secret in private life indisputably forfeit he claim to trust and since he that can be no longer trust be on the brink of ruin i can not but conclude that as by this motion all the secret of we government must be inevitably betray my duty to he majesty my love of my country and my obligation to discharge with fidelity the trust which my constituent have confer upon I oblige I to oppose it mr littleton then rise and speak to this effect : -- sir it always portend well to those who dispute on the side of truth and reason when they opponent appear not wholly to be harden against the force of argument when they seem desirous to gain the victory not by superiority of number but of reason and attempt rather to convince than to terrify or bribe for though man be not in quest of truth themselves nor desirous to point it out to other yet while they be oblige to speak with a appearance of sincerity they must necessarily afford the unprejudiced and attentive a opportunity of discover the right while they think themselves under a necessity of reasoning they can not but show the force of a just argument by the unsuccessfulness of they endeavor to confute it and the propriety of a useful and salutary motion by the slight objection which they raise against it they can not but find themselves sometimes force to discover what they can never be expect to acknowledge the weakness of they own reason by desert they when they be press with contrary assertion and seek a subterfuge in new argument equally inconclusive and contemptible they show the superiority of they opponent like other troops by retreat before they and form one fortification behind another in hope of weary those whom they can not hope to repulse of this conduct we have have already a instance in the present debate a debate manage with such vigor order and resolution as sufficiently show the advantage of regular discipline long continue and prove that troops may retain they skill and spirit even when they be deprive of that leader to whose instruction and example they be indebted for they when first this motion be offer it seem to have be they chief hope to divert we from it by outcry of impossibility by represent it as the demand of man unacquainted with the state of we office or the multiplicity of transaction in which the indefatigable industry of we minister have be employ and they have therefore endeavor to persuade we that they be only discourage we from a insuperable labor and advise we to desist from measure which we can not live to accomplish but when they find sir that they exaggeration produce merriment instead of terror that they opponent be determine to try they strength against impossibility that they be resolve to launch out into this boundless ocean of inquiry a ocean of which they have be boldly tell that it have neither shore nor bottom and that whoever venture into it must be tost about for life when they discover that this be not able to shake we resolution or move we to any other disposition they think it proper to explain away they assertion of impossibility by make a kind of distinction between thing impossible and thing which can not be perform and find it necessary to enlarge they plea they have now assert that this inquiry be both impossible and inexpedient its impossibility sir have be already sufficiently discuss and show to mean only a difficulty which the unskilfulness of we minister have produce for transaction can only produce difficulty to the inquirer when they be confuse and confusion can only be the effect of ignorance or neglect artifice be indeed one more source of perplexity : it be the interest of that man whose cause be bad to speak unintelligibly in the defense of it and of he whose action can not bear to be examine to hide they in disorder to engage he pursuer in a labyrinth that they may not trace he step and discover he retreat and what intricacy may be produce by fraud cooperate with subtilty it be not possible to tell i do not however believe that all the art of wickedness can elude the inquiry of a british senate quicken by zeal for the publick happiness the sagacity of we predecessor have often detect crime conceal with more policy than can be ascribe to those whose conduct be now to be examine and drag the author of national calamity to punishment from they darkest retreat the expediency therefore of this motion be now to be consider and surely it will not require long reflection to prove that it be proper when the nation be oppress with calamity to inquire by what misconduct they be bring upon it when immense sum have be raise by the most oppressive method of exaction to ask why they be demand and how they be expend when penal law have be partially execute to examine by what authority they be suspend and by what they be enforce and when the senate have for twenty year implicitly obey the direction of one man when it have be know throughout the nation before any question be propose how it would be decide to search out the motive of that regular compliance and to examine whether the minister be reverence for he wisdom and virtue or fear for he power or court for the publick money whether he owe he prevalence to the confidence or corruption of he follower it can not surely be think inexpedient to inquire into the reason for which we merchant be for many year suffer to be plunder or for which a war solicit by the general voice of the whole nation be delay into the reason for which we fleet be fit out only to coast upon the ocean and connive at the departure of squadron and the transportation of army to suffer we ally to be invade and we trader ruin and enslave it be in my opinion convenient to examine with the utmost rigor why time be grant to we enemy to fortify themselves against we while a standing army prey upon we people why force unacquainted with the use of arm be send against they under the command of leader equally ignorant and why we have suffer they privateer in the mean time to reeve at large over the ocean and insult we upon we own coast why we do not rescue we sailor from captivity when opportunity of exchange be in we power and why we rob we merchant of they crew by rigorous impress without employ they either to guard we trade or subdue we enemy if the senate be not to be suffer to inquire into affair like these it be no longer any security to the people that they have the right of elect representative and unless they may carry they inquiry back as far as they shall think it necessary the most acute sagacity may be easily elude cause may be very remote from they consequence the original motive of a long train of wicked measure may lie hide in some private transaction of former year and those advantage which we enemy have be of late suffer to obtain be perhaps sell they at some forget congress by some secret article such be probably the private transaction which the honorable gentleman be so much afraid of expose to the light transaction in which the interest of this nation have be meanly yield up by cowardice or sell by treachery in which britain have be consider as a province subordinate to some other country or in which the minister have enrich himself by the sacrifice of the publick rights it have be indeed allege with some degree of candor that many of we treaty be provision against invasion which perhaps be never intend and calculate to defeat measure which only we own cowardice dispose we to fear that such treaty have indeed be make hanover be a sufficient witness but however frequently they may occur they may surely be discover with very little disadvantage to the nation they will prove only the weakness of those that make they who be at one time intimidate by chimerical terror and at another lull into confidence by airy security the concession from foreign power which have be likewise mention ought surely not to be produce as argument against the motion for what could more excite the curiosity of the nation if indeed this motion be in reality produce by malevolence or resentment if none be expect to concur in it but those who envy the ability or have feel the power of the late minister it might be perhaps defeat by such insinuation for nothing could more certainly regain he reputation or exalt he to more absolute authority than proof that he have obtain for we any concession from foreign power if any advantageous term have be grant we he must be confess to have so far discharge he trust to he ally that he have keep they with the utmost caution from the knowledge of the people who have hear during all he administration of nothing but subsidy submission and compliance pay to almost every prince on the continent who have have the confidence to demand they and if by this inquiry any discovery to the disadvantage of we ally should be strike out he may with great sincerity allege that it be make without he consent another objection to this inquiry be that the spy which be retain in foreign court may be detect by it that the canal of we intelligence will be for ever stop and that we shall henceforth have no knowledge of the design of foreign power but what may be honestly attain by penetration and experience spy be indeed a generation for whose security i have not much regard but for whom i be on this occasion less solicitous as i believe very few of they will be affect by this motion the conduct of we minister have never discover such a acquaintance with the design of neighbouring prince as could be suspect to be obtain by any uncommon method or they have very little improve the opportunity which early information put into they power for they have always be baffle and deceive either they have employ no spy or they spy have be direct to elude they by false intelligence or true intelligence have be of no use and if any of these assertion be true the publick will not suffer by the motion it be justly observe by the honorable gentleman that a parallel may be properly draw between a nation and a private man and by consequence between a trading nation and a trader let we therefore consider what must be the state of that trader who shall never inspect or state he account who shall suffer he servant to traffick in the dark with he stock and on he credit and who shall permit they to transact bargain in he name without inquire whether they be advantageous or whether they be perform every man immediately mark out a trader thus infatuate as on the brink of bankruptcy and ruin every one will easily foresee that he servant will take advantage of he credulity and proceed hourly to grosser fraud that they will grow rich by betray he interest that they will neglect he affair to promote they own that they will plunder he till he have nothing left and seek then for employment among those to whom they have recommend themselves by sell they trust he neighbor who easily foresee he approach misery retire from he by degree disunite they business from he and leave he to fall without involve other in he ruin such must be the fate of a trader whom idleness or a blind confidence in the integrity of other hinder from attend to he own affair unless he rouse from he slumber and recover from he infatuation and what be to be do by the man who have for more than twenty year neglect so necessary a employment find what must necessarily be find in much less time he account perplex he credit depress and he affair disorder what remain but that he suffer that disorder to proceed no farther that he resolutely examine all the transaction which he have hitherto overlook that he repair those error which be yet retrievable and reduce he trade into method that he doom those servant by whom he have be rob or deceive to the punishment which they deserve and recover from they that wealth which they have accumulate by rapacity and fraud by this method only can the credit of the trader or the nation be repair and this be the method which the motion recommend a motion with which therefore every man may be expect to comply who desire that he country should once more recover its influence and power who wish to see britain again court and fear and she monarch consider as the arbiter of the world the protector of the true religion and the defender of the liberty of mankind mr phillip speak in substance as follow : -- sir i be so far from believe that there be danger of expose the spy of the government to the resentment of foreign prince by comply with this motion that i suspect the opposition to be produce chiefly from a consciousness that no spy will be discover to have be employ and that the secret service for which such large sum have be require will appear to have be rather for the service of domestick than of foreign traitor and to have be perform rather in this house than in foreign court secret service have be long a term of great use to the minister of this nation a term of art to which such uncommon efficacy have be hitherto annex that the people have be influence by it to pay tax without expect to be inform how they be apply have be content with be tell when they inquire after they property that they be exhaust and dissipate in secret service secret service i conceive to have originally imply transaction of which the agent be secret though the effect be visible when marlborough defeat the french when he counteract all they stratagem obviate all they design and deceive all they expectation he charge the nation with large sum for secret service which be indeed cheerfully allow because the importance and reality of the service be apparent from its effect but what advantage can we minister boast of have obtain in twenty year by the means of they intelligence or by whom have they within that period not be deceive by false appearance when we purchase secret service at so dear a rate let it appear that we really obtain what we pay for though the means by which it be obtain be keep impenetrably secret wherever the usefulness of the intelligence be not discoverable it be surely just to inquire whether we money be not demand for other purpose whether we be not in reality hire with we own money army to enslave or senator to betray we or enrich a avaricious minister while we imagine ourselves contribute to the publick security colonel cholmondeley reply to the following effect : -- sir it have be in all foregoing age the custom for man to speak of the government with reverence even when they oppose its measure or project its dissolution nor have it be think in any time before we own decent or senatorial to give way to satire or invective or indulge a petulant imagination to endeavor to level all order by contemptuous reflection or to court the populace by echo they language or adopt they sentiment this method of gain the reputation of patriotism have be unknown till the present age and reserve for the present leader of the people who will have the honor to stand record as the original author of anarchy the great subverter of order and the first man who dare to pronounce that all the secret of government ought to be make publick it have be hitherto understand in all nation that those who be intrust with authority have likewise a claim to respect and confidence that they be choose for the superiority of they ability or the reputation of they virtue and that therefore it be reasonable to consign to they management the direction of such affair as by they own nature require secrecy but this ancient doctrine by which subordination have be so long preserve be now to be set aside for new principle which may flatter the pride and incite the passion of the people we be now to be tell that affair be only keep secret because they will not bear examination that man conceal not those transaction in which they have succeed but those in which they have fail that they be only inclined to hide they folly or they crime and that to examine they conduct in the most open manner be only to secure the interest of the publick thus have the nation be teach to expect that the counsel of the cabinet should be disperse in the publick papers that they governor should declare the motive of they measure and discover the demand of we ally and the scheme of we policy and that the people should be consult upon every emergence and enjoy the right of instruct not only they own representative but the minister of the crown in this debate the mention of secret treaty have be receive with contempt and ridicule the minister have be upbraid with chimerical fear and unnecessary provision against attack which never be design they have be allege to have no other interest in view than they own when they endeavor to mislead inquirer and to have in reality nothing to keep from publick view but they own ignorance or wickedness it can not surely be seriously assert by man of knowledge and experience that there be no design form by wise government of which the success depend upon secrecy nor can it be assert that the inquiry now propose will betray nothing from which we enemy may receive advantage if we should suppose that all we scheme be either fully accomplish or irretrievably defeat it will not even then be prudent to discover they since they will enable we enemy to form conjecture of the future from the past and to obviate hereafter the same design when it shall be think necessary to resume they but in reality nothing be more irrational than to suppose this a safer time than any other for such general discovery for why should it be imagine that we engagement be not still depend and we treaty yet in force and what can be more dishonourable or imprudent than to destroy at once the whole scheme of foreign policy to dissolve we alliance and destroy the effect of such long and such expensive negotiation without first examine whether they will be beneficial or detrimental to we nor be it only with respect to foreign affair that secrecy be necessary there be undoubtedly many domestick transaction which it be not proper to communicate to the whole nation there be still a faction among we which openly desire the subversion of we present establishment a faction indeed not powerful and which grow i hope every day weaker but which be favor or at least imagine itself favor by those who have so long distinguish themselves by oppose the measure of the government against these man whose hope be revive by every commotion who studiously heighten every subject of discontent and add they outcry to every clamor it be not doubt but measure be form by which they design be discover and they measure break nor can it be suppose that this be do without the assistance of some who be receive with confidence amongst they and who probably pass for the most zealous of they party many other domestick occasion of expense might be mention of expense which operate in private and produce benefit which be only not acknowledge because they be not know but which could no longer be apply to the same useful purpose if the channel through which it pass be lay open i can not therefore forbear to offer my opinion that this motion by which all the secret of we government will be discover will tend to the confusion of the present system of europe to the absolute ruin of we interest in foreign court and to the embarrassment of we domestick affair i can not therefore conceive how any advantage can be expect by the most eager persecutor of the late ministry which can even in they opinion deserve to be purchase at so dear a rate mr pitt then speak to the follow purpose : -- sir i know not by what fatality the adversary of the motion be impel to assist they adversary and contribute to they own overthrow by suggest whenever they attempt to oppose it new argument against themselves it have be long observe that when man be draw near to destruction they be apparently deprive of they understanding and contribute by they own folly to those calamity with which they be threaten but which might by a different conduct be sometimes delay this have surely now happen to the veteran advocate for a absolute and unaccountable ministry who have discover on this occasion by the weakness of they resistance that they ability be decline and i can not but hope that the omen will be fulfil and that they infatuation will be quickly follow by they ruin to touch in this debate on we domestick affair to mention the distribution of the publick money and to discover they fear lest the way in which it have be disburse should by this inquiry be discover to recall to the mind of they opponent the immense sum which have be annually demand and of which no account have be yet give be surely the lowest degree of weakness and imprudence i be so far from be convince that any danger can arise from this inquiry that i believe the nation can only be injure by a long neglect of such examination and that a minister be easily formidable when he have exempt himself by a kind of prescription from expose he account and have long have a opportunity of employ the publick money in multiply he dependant enrich he hireling enslave borough and corrupt senate that those have be in reality the purpose for which the tax of many year have be squander be sufficiently apparent without a inquiry we have waste sum with which the french in pursuance of they new scheme of increase they influence would have be able to purchase the submission of half the nation of the earth and with which the monarch of europe might have be hold dependant on a nod these they have waste only to sink we country into disgrace to heighten the spirit of impotent enemy to destroy we commerce and distress we colony we have patiently suffer during a peace of twenty year those tax to be extort from we by which a war might have be support against the most powerful nation and have see they ingulfed in the boundless expense of the government without be able to discover any other effect from they than the establishment of ministerial tyranny there have indeed be among the follower of the court a regular subordination and exact obedience nor have any man be find hardy enough to reject the dictate of the grand vizier every man who have receive he pay have with great cheerfulness comply with he command and every man who have hold any post or office under the crown have evidently consider himself as enlist by the minister but the visible influence of place however destructive to the constitution be not the chief motive of a inquiry a inquiry imply something secret and be intend to discover the private method of extend dependence and propagate corruption the method by which the people have be influence to choose those man for representative whose principle they detest and whose conduct they condemn and by which those whom they country have choose for the guardian of its liberty have be induce to support in this house measure which in every other place they have make no scruple to censure when we shall examine the distribution of the publick treasure when we shall inquire by what conduct we have be debar from the honor of war and at the same time deprive of the blessing of peace to what cause it be to be imputed that we debt have continue during the long-continued tranquillity of europe nearly in the state to which they be raise by fight at we own expense the general quarrel of mankind and why the sink fund a kind of inviolable deposit appropriate to the payment of we creditor and the mitigation of we tax have be from year to year divert to very different use we shall find that we treasure have be exhaust not to humble foreign enemy or obviate domestick insurrection not to support we ally or suppress we faction but for end which no man who feel the love of he country yet unextinguished can name without horror the purchase of alliance and the hire of vote the corruption of the people and the exaltation of france such be the discovery which i be not afraid to declare that i expect from the inquiry and therefore i can not but think it necessary if those to whom the administration of affair have be for twenty year commit have betray they trust if they have invade the publick rights with the publick treasure and make use of the dignity which they country have confer upon they only to enslave it who will not confess that they ought to be deliver up to speedy justice that they ought to be set as landmark to posterity to warn those who shall hereafter launch out on the ocean of affluence and power not to be too confident of a prosperous gale but to remember that there be rock on which whoever rush must inevitably perish if they be innocent and far be it from I to declare they guilty without examination whom will this inquiry injure or what effect will it produce but that which every man appear to desire the reestablishment of the publick tranquillity a firm confidence in the justice and wisdom of the government and a general reconciliation of the people to the minister colonel mordaunt speak then in substance as follow : -- sir notwithstanding the zeal with which the honorable gentleman have urge the necessity of this inquiry a zeal of which i think it may at least be say that it be too vehement and acrimonious to be the mere result of publick spirit unmixed with interest or resentment he have yet be so far unsuccessful in he reasoning that he have not produce in I any conviction or weaken any of the impression which the argument of those whom he oppose have make upon I he have contented himself with recapitulate some of the benefit which may be hope for from the inquiry he have represent in the strongest term the suppose misconduct of the ministry he have aggravate all the appearance of wickedness or negligence and then have infer the usefulness of a general inquiry for the punishment of past offence and the prevention of the like practice in future time that he have discover great qualification for invective and that he declamation be well calculate to inflame those who have already determine they opinion and who be therefore only restrain from such measure as be now recommend by natural caution and sedateness i do not deny but surely he do not expect to gain proselyte by assertion without proof or to produce any alteration of sentiment without attempt to answer the argument which have be offer against he opinion it have be urge with great appearance of reason that a inquiry such as be now propose with whatever prospects of vengeance of justice or of advantage it may flatter we at a distance will be in reality detrimental to the publick because it will discover all the secret of we government lay all we negotiation open to the world will show what power we most fear or most trust and furnish we enemy with means of defeat all we scheme and counteract all we measure this appear to I sir the chief argument against the motion a argument of which the force can not but be discover by those whose interest it be to confute it and of which therefore by appear to neglect it they seem to confess that it be unanswerable and therefore since i can not find the motion justified otherwise than by loud declaration of its propriety and violent invective against the ministry i hope that i shall escape at least the censure of the calm and impartial though i venture to declare that i can not approve it and with regard to the clamorous and the turbulent i have long learn to despise they menace because i have hitherto find they only the boast of impotence mr cornwall make answer to the follow purport : -- sir if to obtain the important approbation of the gentleman that speak last it be necessary only to answer the argument on which he have insist and nothing be necessary to produce a inquiry but he approbation i shall not despair that this debate may be conclude accord to the wish of the nation that secret wickedness may be detect and that we posterity may be secure from any invasion of they liberty by example of the vengeance of a injured people -lrb- the house divide -- the yea go forth -- for the question 242 against it 244 : so that it pass in the negative by a majority of two -rrb- house of lord may 20 1742 debate on a motion for indemnify evidence relate to the conduct of the earl of orford the follow debate have be produce by a occasion very uncommon and important it be necessary to give a account of such transaction as may contribute to illustrate it the prime minister be drive out of the house of common by the prevalence of those who from they opposition to the measure of the court be term the country party it be propose that a committee should be appoint to inquire into the conduct of publick affair at home and abroad during the last twenty year but the motion be reject it be afterwards move that a committee should be appoint to inquire into the conduct of robert earl of orford during the last ten year in which he be first commissioner of the treasury and chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer which be carry by 252 to 245 a committee of one-and-twenty be choose by ballot and enter upon the inquiry call before they mr gibbon who declare himself agent to j botteler and say that botteler be a candidate for wendover and finding that no success be to be expect without five hundred pound send a friend to n paxton with a letter and that he see he return with a great number of papers in which he say be bill for five hundred pound botteler and he friend be examine confirm the testimony of gibbon and botteler add that he send to paxton as a officer of the treasury acquaint with those who have the disposal of money that he claim to the favor which he ask arise from a disappointment in a former election that he never give for the money any security or acknowledgment nor consider himself indebted for it to paxton or any other person paxton be then examine refuse to return any answer to the question of the committee because the answer might tend to accuse himself which reason be allege by other for a like refusal the committee find they inquiry elude by this plea for secrecy which the law of britain allow to be valid report to the common the obstacle that they meet with for the removal of which a bill be bring in like that of indemnity which have pass the common produce in the house of lord a debate in which the greatest man of each party exert the utmost force of they reason and eloquence the bill be read a second time and a motion make for its be refer to a committee lord carteret speak to this effect : -- my lord as the question now before we be of the highest importance both to the present age and to posterity as it may direct the proceedings of the court of justice prescribe the course of publick inquiry and by consequence affect the property or life of every lord in this assembly i hope it will be debate amongst we without the acrimony which arise from the prejudice of party or the violence which be produce by the desire of victory and that the controversy will be animated by no other passion than zeal for justice and love of truth for my part my lord i have reason to believe that many profession of my sincerity will not be necessary on this occasion because i shall not be easily suspect of any partiality in favor of the noble lord to whom this bill immediately relate it be well know to you lordship how freely i have censure he conduct and how invariably i have oppose those measure by which the nation have be so far exasperate that the bill now under we consideration have be think necessary by the common to pacify the general discontent to restore the publick tranquillity and to recover that confidence in the government without which no happiness be to be expect without which the best measure will always be obstruct by the people and the justest remonstrance disregard by the court but however laudable may be the end propose by the common i can not my lord be so far dazzle by the prospect of obtain it as not to examine the means to which we be invite to concur and inquire with that attention which the honor of sit in this house have make my duty whether they be such as have be practice by we ancestor such as be prescribe by the law or warrant by prudence the caution my lord with which we ancestor have always proceed in inquiry by which life or death property or reputation be endanger the certainty or at least the high degree of probability which they require in evidence to make it a sufficient ground of conviction be universally know nor be it necessary to show they opinion by particular example because be no less solicitous for the welfare of they posterity than for they own they be careful to record they sentiment in law and statute and to prescribe with the strongest sanction to succeed government what they have discover by they own reflection or be teach by they predecessor they consider my lord not only how great be the hardship of be unjustly condemn but likewise how much a man might suffer by be falsely accuse how much he might be harass by a prosecution and how sensibly he might feel the disgrace of a trial they know that to be charge with guilt imply some degree of reproach and that it give room at least for a inference that the known conduct of the person accuse be such as make it probable that he be still more wicked than he appear they know that the credulity of some might admit the charge upon evidence that be reject by the court and that difference of party or private quarrel might provoke other to propagate report once publish even when in they own opinion they be sufficiently confute and that therefore a innocent man might languish in infamy by a groundless charge though he should escape any legal penalty it have therefore my lord be immemorially establish in this nation that no man can be apprehend or call into question for any crime till there shall be proof first that there be a _ corpus delictus _ a crime really and visibly commit thus before a process can be issue out for inquire after a murderer it must be apparent that a murder have be perpetrate the dead body must be expose to a jury and it must appear to they that he die by violence it be not sufficient that a man be lose and that it be probable that he be murder because no other reason of he absence can be assign he must be find with the mark of force upon he or some circumstance that may make it credible that he do not perish by accident or he own hand it be require secondly my lord that he who apprehend any person as guilty of the fact thus apparently commit must suspect he to be the criminal for he be not to take a opportunity afford he by the commission of a illegal act to gratify any secret malice or wanton curiosity or to drag to a solemn examination those against whom he can not support a accusation and my lord that suspicion may not ravage the reputation of briton without control that man may not give way to the mere suggestion of malevolence and load the character of those with atrocious wickedness whom perhaps they have no real reason to believe more depraved than the bulk of mankind and whose failing may have be exaggerate in they eye by contrariety of opinion or accidental competition it be require in the third place my lord that whoever apprehend or molest another on suspicion of a crime shall be able to give the reason of he suspicion and to prove they by competent evidence these my lord be three essential which the wisdom of we ancestor have make indispensable previous to the arrest or imprisonment of the meanest briton it must appear that there be a crime commit that the person to be seize be suspect of have commit it and that the suspicion be found upon probability requisite so reasonable in they own nature so necessary to the protection of every man 's quiet and reputation and by consequence so useful to the security and happiness of society that i suppose they will need no support or vindication every man be interested in the continuance of this method of proceeding because no man be secure from suffer by the interruption or abolition of it such my lord be the care and caution which the law direct in the first part of any criminal process the detainment of the person suppose guilty nor be the method of trial prescribe with less regard to the security of innocence it be a established maxim that no man can be oblige to accuse himself or to answer any question which may have any tendency to discover what the nature of he defense require to be conceal he guilt must appear either by a voluntary and unconstrained confession which the terror of conscience have sometimes extort and the notoriety of the crime have at other time produce or by the deposition of such witness as the jury shall think worthy of belief to the credibility of any witness it be always requisite that he be disinterested that he own cause be not involve in that of the person who stand at the bar that he have no prospect of advance he fortune clear he reputation or secure he life for it be make too plain by daily example that interest will prevail over the virtue of most man and that it be not safe to believe those who be strongly tempt to deceive there be case my lord where the interest of the person offer he evidence be so apparent that he be not even admit to be hear and any benefit which may possibly be propose be admit as a objection to evidence and weaken it in a measure proportionate to the distance of the prospect and the degree of profit such be the rule hitherto follow in criminal proceedings the violation of which have be always censure as cruelty and oppression and perhaps always be repent even by those who propose and defend it when the commotion of party have subside and the heat of opposition and resentment have give way to unprejudiced reflection of these rule my lord it be not necessary to produce any defense from the practice of distant nation because it be sufficient in the present case that they be establish by the constitution of this country to which every briton have a right to appeal for how can any man defend he conduct if have act under one law he be to be try by another let we therefore my lord apply these rule to the present bill and inquire what regard appear to have be pay to they by the common and how well we shall observe they by concur in they design with respect to the first by which it be require that there be a known and manifest crime it do not appear to have engage the least attention in the other house for no fact be specify in the bill upon which a prosecution can be found and therefore to inquire after evidence be somewhat preposterous it be nothing less than to invite man to give they opinion without a subject and to answer without a question it may be urge indeed that there be a universal discontent over the whole nation that the clamor against the person mention in the bill have be continue for many year that the influence of the nation be impaired in foreign country that we treasury be exhaust that we liberty have be attack we property invade and we moral corrupt but these be yet only rumor without proof and without legal certainty which may indeed with great propriety give occasion to a inquiry and perhaps by that inquiry some fact may be ascertain which may afford sufficient reason for farther procedure but such my lord be the form of the bill now before we that if it should pass into a statute it would in my opinion put a stop to all future inquiry by make those incapable of give evidence who have have most opportunity of know those transaction which have give the chief occasion of suspicion and from whom therefore the most important information must naturally be expect the first requisite qualification of a witness whether we consult natural equity and reason or the common law of we own country be disinterestedness a indifference with regard to all outward circumstance about the event of the trial at which he testimony be require for he that be call as a witness where he be interested be in reality give evidence in he own cause but this qualification my lord the bill now before we manifestly take away for every man who shall appear against the person into whose conduct the common be inquire evidently promote in the highest degree he own interest by he evidence as he may preclude all examination of he own behavior and secure the possession of that wealth which he have accumulate by fraud and oppression or perhaps preserve that life which the justice of the nation might take away nothing my lord be more obvious than that this offer of indemnity may produce perjury and false accusation nothing be more probable than that he who be conscious of any atrocious villany which he can not certainly secure from discovery will snatch this opportunity of commit one crime more to set himself free from the dread of punishment and blot out he own guilt for ever by charge lord orford as one of he accomplice it may be urge my lord that he who shall give false evidence forfeit the indemnity to which the honest witness be entitle but let we consider why this should be now rather than in any former time account a sufficient security against falsehood and perjury it be at all time criminal and at all time punishable to commit perjury and yet it have be hitherto think necessary not only to deter it by subsequent penalty but to take away all previous temptation no man 's oath will be admit in he own cause though offer at the hazard of the punishment inflict upon perjury to offer indemnity to invite evidence and to deter they from false accusation by the forfeiture of it even though we should allow to the penal clause all the efficacy which can be expect by those who propose it be only to set one part of the bill at variance with the other to erect and demolish at the same time but it may be prove my lord that the reward will have more influence than the penalty and that every man who can reason upon the condition in which he be place by this bill will be more incite to accuse lord orford however unjustly by the prospect of security than intimidate by the forfeiture incur by perjury for let we suppose my lord a man whose conduct expose he to punishment and who know that he shall not long be able to conceal it what can be more apparently he interest than to contrive such a accusation as may complicate he own wickedness with some transaction of the person to whom this bill relate he may indeed be possibly confute and lose the benefit offer by the state but the loss of it will not place he in a condition more dangerous than that which he be in before he have already deserve all the severity to which perjury will expose he and by forge a bold and well-connected calumny he have at least a chance of escape let we suppose my lord that the bill now under we consideration assign a pecuniary reward to any man who should appear against this person with a clause by which he that should accuse he falsely should be dismiss without he pay would not this appear a method of prosecution contrary to law and reason and justice would not every man immediately discover that the witness be bribe and therefore they would deserve no credit and what be the difference between the advantage now offer and any other consideration except that scarcely any other reward can be offer so great and consequently so likely to influence it be to be remember that the patron of this bill evidently call for testimony from the abandon and the profligate from man whom they suppose necessarily to confess they own crime in they deposition and surely wretch like these ought not to be solicit to perjury by the offer of a reward how cruel must all impartial spectator of the publick transaction account a prosecution like this what would be you lordship ' judgment should you read that in any distant age or remote country a man be condemn upon the evidence of person publickly hire to accuse he and who by they own confession be traitor to they country that wickedness my lord should be extirpate by severity and justice rigorously exercise upon publick offender be the uncontroverted interest of every country and therefore it be not to be doubt that in all age the reflection of the wisest man have be employ upon the most proper method of detect offence and since the scheme now propose have never be practice or never but by the most oppressive tyrant in the most flagitious time it be evident that it have be think inconsistent with equity and of a tendency contrary to publick happiness i be very far my lord from desire that any breach of national trust should escape detection or that a publick office should afford security to bribery extortion or corruption i be far from intend to patronise the conduct of the person mention in the present bill let the common proceed with the utmost severity but let they not deviate from justice if he have forfeit he fortune he honor or he life let they by a legal process be take from he but let it always be consider that he like every other man be to be allow the common method of self-defence that he be to stand or fall by the law of he country and to retain the privilege of a briton till it shall appear that he have forfeit they by he crime to censure guilt my lord be undoubtedly necessary and to inquire into the conduct of man in power incontestably just but by the law both of heaven and earth the means as well as the end be prescribe _ rectum recte legitimum legitime faciendum _ we must not only propose a good end in we conduct but must attain it by that method which equity direct and the law prescribe how well my lord the law have be observe hitherto on this occasion i can not but propose that you lordship should consider it be well know that the common can not claim a right to administer a oath and therefore can only examine witness by simple interrogatory that they can not confer upon a committee the power which they have not themselves be indubitably certain and therefore it be evident that they have exceed they privilege and proceed in they inquiry by method which the law of this nation will not support that they can not my lord in they own right administer a oath they apparently confess by the practice of call in on that occasion a justice of the peace who as soon as he have perform he office be expect to retire this my lord be a evident elusion for it be always intend that he who give a oath give it in consequence of he right to take the examination but in this case the witness take a oath _ coram non judice _ before a magistrate that have no power to interrogate he and be interrogate by those who have no right to require he oath such my lord be my opinion of the conduct of the committee of the house of common of whom i can not but conclude that they have assume a right which the constitution of we government confer only on you lordship as a house of senate a court of judicature and therefore can not think it prudent to confirm they proceedings by a approbation of this bill the common may indeed imagine that the present state of affair make it necessary to proceed by extraordinary method they may believe that the nation will not be satisfy without a discovery of those fraud which have be so long practice and the punishment of those man by whom they have so long think themselves betray and oppress but let we consider that clamor be not evidence and that we ought not either to recede from justice or from we own rights to satisfy the expectation of the people to remonstrate against this invasion of we privilege my lord might be at this juncture improper the dispute might in this time of commotion and vicissitude distract the attention of those to whom the publick affair be commit retard the business of the nation and give we enemy those advantage which they can never hope from they own courage or policy or strength it may therefore be prudent on this occasion only not to admit the right which they have assume to satisfy ourselves with retain we privilege without require any farther confirmation of they and only defeat the invasion of they by reject the bill which be indeed of such a kind as can not be confirm without hazard not only we own rights but those of every briton for here be a species of testimony invite which be hitherto unknown to we law and from which it may be difficult to tell who can be secure the witness be require to disclose all matter relate to the conduct of _ lord orford accord to the best of they knowledge remembrance or belief _ a form of deposition my lord of great latitude a man 's belief may be influence by the report of other who may deceive he by he observation of circumstance either remote in themselves or imperfectly discover or by he own reasoning which must be just or fallacious accord to he ability but which must yet have the same effect upon he belief which they will influence not in proportion to they real strength but to the confidence place in they by himself there be only one case my lord in which by the common course of proceedings any regard be have to mere belief and this evidence be only accept on that occasion because no other can possibly be obtain when any claim be to be determine by write evidence of which in order to prove they validity it be necessary to inquire by whom they be draw or sign those who be acquaint with the writing of a dead person be admit to deliver upon oath they _ belief _ that the write ascribe to he be or be not he but such secondary witness be never call when the person can be produce whose hand be to be prove there be yet another reason for which it be improper to admit such evidence as this bill have a tendency to promote it be well know that in all the court of common law the person accuse be in some degree secure from the danger of be overborne by false accusation by the penalty which may be inflict upon witness discover to be perjure but in the method of examination now propose a method unknown to the constitution no such security can be obtain for there be no provision make by the law for the punishment of a man who shall give false evidence before a committee of the house of common it may likewise be observe that this bill want one of the most essential property of a law perspicuity and determinate meaning here be a indemnity promise to those who shall discover _ all _ that they _ know remember or believe _ a very extensive demand and which may therefore be liable to more fallacy and evasion than can be immediately enumerate or detect for how can any one prove that he have a claim to the indemnity he may indeed make some discovery but whether he do not conceal something who can determine may not such reserve be suspect when he answer shall not satisfy the expectation of he interrogator and may not that suspicion deprive he of the benefit of the act may not a man from want of memory or presence of mind omit something at he examination which he may appear afterwards to have know and since no human being have the power of distinguish exactly between fault and frailty may not the defect of he memory be charge on he as a criminal suppression of a known fact and may not he be leave to suffer the consequence of he own confession will not the bill give a apparent opportunity for partiality and will not life and death liberty and imprisonment be place in the hand of a committee of the common may they not be easily satisfy with information of one man and incessantly press another to farther discovery may they not call some man notoriously criminal to examination only to secure they from punishment and set they out of the reach of justice and extort from other such answer as may best promote they view by declare themselves unsatisfied with the extent of they testimony and will not this be a extortion of evidence equivalent to the method practice in the most despotick government and the most barbarous nation it have always be the praise of this house to pay a equal regard to justice and to mercy and to follow without partiality the direction of reason and the light of truth and how consistently with this character which it ought to be we highest ambition to maintain we can ratify the present bill you lordship be this day to consider it be to be inquire whether to suppose a man guilty only because some guilt be suspect be agreeable to justice and whether it be rational before there be any proof of a crime to point out the criminal we be to consider my lord whether it be not unjust to hear against any man a evidence who be hire to accuse he and hire with a reward which he can not receive without confess himself a man unworthy of belief it be to be inquire whether the evidence of a man who declare only what he _ believe _ ought to be admit when the nature of the crime allow stronger proof and whether any man ought to be examine where he can not be punish if he be find perjure a natural and just regard to we own rights on the preservation of which the continuance of the constitution must depend ought to alarm we at the appearance of any attempt to invade they and the necessity of known form of justice ought to incite we to the prevention of any innovation in the method of prosecute offender for my own part my lord i can not approve either the principle or form of the bill i think it necessary to proceed by known precedent when there be no immediate danger that require extraordinary measure of which i be far from be convince that they be necessary on the present occasion i think that the certainty of a crime ought to precede the prosecution of a criminal and i see that there be in the present case no crime attempt to be prove the common have in my opinion already exceed they privilege and i would not willingly confirm they new claim for these reason my lord i openly declare that i can not agree to the bill 's be read a second time lord talbot speak next to this effect : -- my lord so high be my veneration for this great assembly that it be never without the utmost effort of resolution that i can prevail upon myself to give my sentiment upon any question that be the subject of debate however strong may be my conviction or however ardent my zeal but in a very particular degree do i distrust my own ability when i find my opinion contrary to that of the noble lord who have now speak and it be no common perplexity to be reduce to the difficult choice of either suppress my thought or expose they to so disadvantageous a contrast yet since such be my present state that i can not avoid a declaration of my thought on this question without be condemn in my own breast as a deserter of my country nor utter they without the danger of become contemptible in the eye of you lordship i will however follow my conscience rather than my interest and though i should lose any part of my little reputation i shall find a ample recompense from the consciousness that i lose it in the discharge of my duty on a occasion which require from every good man the hazard of he life the argument of the noble lord have have upon I a effect which they never perhaps produce on any part of he audience before they have confirm I in the contrary opinion to that which he have endeavor to maintain it have be remark that in some encounter not to be put to flight be to obtain the victory and in a controversy with the noble lord not to be convince by he be to receive a sufficient proof that the cause in which he be engage be not to be defend by wit eloquence or learn on the present question my lord as on all other he have produce all that can be urge either from the knowledge of past age or experience of the present all that the scholar or the statesman can supply have be accumulate one argument have be add to another and all the power of a great capacity have be employ only to show that right and wrong can not be confound and that fallacy can never strike with the force of truth when i survey the argument of the noble lord disrobe of those ornament which he imagination have so liberally bestow upon they i be surprise at the momentary effect which they have upon my mind and which they could not have produce have they be clothe in the language of any other person for when i recollect singly the particular position upon which he opinion seem to be found i do not find they by any means uncontrovertible some of they seem at best uncertain and some evidently mistaken that there be no apparent crime commit and that therefore no legal inquiry can be make after the criminal i can not hear without astonishment be we commerce ruin be we troops destroy be the moral of the people vitiate be the senate crowd with dependant be we fleet disarm we ally betray and we enemy support without a crime be there no certainty of any crime commit when it be move to petition he majesty to dismiss this person from he council for ever it have be observe my lord that nothing but a sight of the dead body can warrant a pursuit after the murderer but this be a concession sufficient for the present purpose for if upon the sight of a murder person the murderer may lawfully be inquire after and those who be reasonably suspect detain and examine with equal reason my lord may the survey of a ruin nation a nation oppress with burdensome tax devour by the caterpillar of a standing army sink into contempt in every foreign court and repining at the daily decay of its commerce and the daily multiplication of its oppressor incite we to a inquiry after the author of its misery it be assert that no man ought to be call into question for any crime who be not suspect of have commit it this my lord be a rule not only reasonable in itself but so naturally observe that i believe it be never yet break and be certain no man will be charge with the violation of it for accuse this person as a enemy to he country but he that declare he suspicion may be call upon to discover upon what fact it be found nor will this part of the law produce any difficulty in the present case for as every man in the nation suspect this person of the most enormous crime every man can produce sufficient argument to justify he opinion on all other occasion my lord publick fame be allow some weight : that any man be universally account wicked will add strength to the testimony bring against he for any particular offence and it be at least a sufficient reason for call any man to examination that a crime be commit and he be generally report to be the author of it that this be the state of the person into whose conduct the common be now inquire that he be censure by every man in the kingdom whose sentiment be not repress by visible influence that he have no friend but those who have sell they integrity for the plunder of the publick and that all who be not enemy to they country have for many year incessantly struggle to drag he down from the pinnacle of power and expose he to that punishment which he have so long deserve and so long defy be evident beyond contradiction let it not therefore be urge my lord that there be no certainty of a crime which be prove to the conviction of every honest mind let it not be say that it be unreasonable to suspect this man whom the voice of the people a voice always to be reverence have so long condemn the method of procure evidence against he by a act of indemnity have be represent by the noble lord as not agreeable to justice or to law : in the knowledge of the law i be far from imagine myself able to contend with he but i think it may not be improper to observe that a person of the highest eminence in that profession whose long study and great ability give he decision a uncommon claim to authority and veneration and who be always consider in this house with the highest regard appear to have entertain a very different opinion it be declare by he without the least restriction that all means be lawful which tend to the discovery of truth and therefore the publick may justly expect that extraordinary method should be use upon occasion of uncommon importance nor do this expedient appear to I very remote from the daily practice of promising pardon to thief on condition that they will make discovery by which they confederate may be bring to justice if we examine only the equity of this procedure without regard to the example of former time it appear to I easily defensible for what can be more rational than to break a confederacy of wretch combine for the destruction of the happiness of mankind by divide they interest and make use for the publick good of that regard for they own safety which have swallow up every other principle of action it be admit that wickedness ought to be punish and it be universally know that punishment must be precede by detection any method therefore that promote the discovery of crime may be consider as advantageous to the publick as there be no wickedness of which the pernicious consequence be more extensive there be none which ought more diligently to be prevent or more severely punish than that of those man who have dare to abuse the power which they country have put into they hand but how they can be convict by any other means than those which be now propose i confess myself unable to discover for by a very small degree of artifice a man invest with power may make every witness a partner of he guilt and no man will be able to accuse he without betray himself in the present case it be evident that the person of whose action the bill now before we be design to produce a more perfect discovery have be combine with other in illegal measure in measure which they own security oblige they to conceal and which therefore the interest of the publick demand to be divulge that paxton have distribute large sum for purpose which he dare not discover we be inform by the report of the secret committee and i suppose every body suspect that they be distribute as reward for service which the nation think not very meritorious and i believe no man will ask what reason can be allege for such suspicion but since it may be possibly suggest that paxton expend these sum contrary to he master 's direction or without he knowledge it may be demand whether such a assertion would not be a apparent proof of a very criminal degree of negligence in a man intrust with the care of the publick treasure thus my lord it appear in my opinion evident that either he have concur in measure which he servile agent the mercenary tool of wickedness be afraid to confess or that he have stand by negligent of he trust and suffer the treasure of the nation to be squander by the meanest wretch without account that the latter part of the accusation be undoubtedly just the report of the common can not but convince we it appear that for near eight year paxton be so high in confidence that no account be demand from he he bestow pension at pleasure he be surround like he master by he idolater and after the fatigue of cringe in one place have a opportunity of purchase the tax of the nation the gratification of tyranny in another i presume my lord that no man dare assert such a flagrant neglect of so important a office to be not criminal in a very high degree to steal in private house that which be receive in trust be felony by the statute of we country and surely the wealth of the publick ought not to be less secure than that of individual nor ought he that connive at robbery to be treat with more lenity than the robber therefore my lord as i can not but approve of the bill i move that it may be read a second time and i hope the reason which i have offer when join with other which i expect to hear from lord of a greater experience knowledge and capacity will induce you lordship to be of the same opinion lord hervey speak next to this effect : -- my lord as the bill now before we be of a new kind upon a occasion no less new i have endeavor to bestow upon it a proportionate degree of attention and have consider it in all the light in which i could place it i have in my imagination connect with it all the circumstance with which it be accompany and all the consequence that it may produce either to the present age or to futurity but the longer i reflect upon it the more firmly be i determine to oppose it nor have deliberation any other effect than to crowd my thought with new argument against it and to heighten dislike to detestation it must my lord immediately occur to every man at the first mention of the method of proceed now propose that it be such as nothing but extreme necessity can vindicate that the noble person against whom it be contrived must be a monster burdensome to the world that he crime must be at once publick and enormous and that he have be already condemn by all maxim of justice though he have have the subtilty to escape by some unforeseen defect in the form of law it might be imagine my lord that there be the most evident mark of guilt in the conduct of the man thus censure that he flee from the justice of he country that he have openly suborn witness in he favor or have by some artifice certainly know obstruct the evidence that be to have be bring against he it might at least be reasonably conceive that he crime be of such a kind as might in they own nature easily be conceal and that therefore some extraordinary measure be necessary for the discovery of wickedness which lay out of the reach of common inquiry but my lord none of these circumstance can be now allege for there be no certainty of any crime commit nor any appearance of consciousness or fear in the person accuse who set he enemy at defiance in full security and decline no legal trial of he past action of which it ought to be observe that they have by the nature of he employment be so publick that they may easily be examine without recourse to a new law to facilitate discovery the bill therefore be my lord at least unnecessary and a innovation not necessary ought always to be reject because no man can foresee all the consequence of new measure or can know what evil they may create or what subsequent change they may introduce the alteration of one part of a system naturally require the alteration of another but my lord that there be no necessity for this law now propose be not the strongest argument that may be bring against it for there be in reality a necessity that it should be reject justice and humanity be necessarily to be support without which no society can subsist nor the life or property of any man be enjoy with security : and neither justice nor humanity can truly be say to reside where a law like this have meet with approbation my lord to prosecute any man by such method be to overbear he by the violence of power to take from he all the security of innocence and divest he of all the means of self-defence it be to hire against he those whose testimony ought not to be admit if they be voluntarily produce and of which surely nothing will be farther necessary to annihilate the validity than to observe that they be the deposition of man who be villain by they own confession and of whom the nation see that they may save they life by a bold accusation whether true or false that the bill will indeed be effectual to the purpose design that it will crowd the court of justice with evidence and open scene of wickedness never discover before i can readily believe for i can not imagine that any man who have expose he life by any flagrant crime will miss so fair a opportunity of save it by another i shall expect my lord that villain of all denomination who be now skulk in private retreat who be elude the officer of justice or fly before the publick pursuit of the country will secure themselves by this easy expedient and that housebreaker highwayman and pickpocket will come up in crowd to the bar charge the earl of orford as they accomplice and plead this bill as a security against all inquiry that this supposition however wild and exaggerate it may seem may not be think altogether chimerical that it may appear with how little consideration this bill have be draw and how easily it may be pervert to the patronage of wickedness i will lay before you lordship such a plea as may probably be produce by it a man whom the consciousness of murder have for some time keep in continual terror may clear himself for ever by allege that he be commission by the earl of orford to engage with any certain sum the vote or interest of the murder person that he take the opportunity of a solitary place to offer he the bribe and prevail upon he to comply with he proposal but that find he obstinate and perverse fill with prejudice against a wise and just administration and incline to obstruct the measure of the government he for some time expostulate with he and be provoke by he contumelious representation of the state of affair he could no longer restrain the ardor of he loyalty but think it proper to remove from the world a man so much inclined to spread sedition among the people and that therefore find the place convenient he suddenly rush upon he and cut he throat thus my lord might the murderer represent he case perhaps without any possibility of a legal confutation thus might the most atrocious villany escape censure by the assistance of impudence and cunning a bill like this my lord be nothing less than a proscription the head of a citizen be apparently set to sale and evidence be hire by which the innocent and the guilty may be destroy with equal facility it be apparent my lord that they by whom this bill be propose act upon the supposition that the noble person mention in it be guilty of all those crime of which he be suspect a supposition my lord which it be unjust to make and to which neither reason nor the law of we country will give countenance or support i my lord will much more equitably suppose he innocent i will suppose that he have throughout all the year of he administration steadily prosecute the best end by the best means that if he have sometimes be mistaken or disappointed it have be neither by he negligence nor ignorance but by false intelligence or accident not to be foresee and that he have never either sacrifice he country to private interest or procure by any illegal method the assistance and support of the legislature and i will ask you lordship whether if this character be just the bill ought to be pass and doubt not but every man 's conscience will inform he that it ought to be reject with the utmost indignation the reason my lord for which it ought to be reject be evidently this that it may bring innocence into danger but my lord every man before he trial be to be suppose innocent and therefore no man ought to be expose to the hazard of a trial by which virtue and wickedness be reduce to a level a bill like this ought to be mark out as the utmost effort of malice as a species of cruelty never know before and as a method of prosecution which this house have censure i do not indeed expect from those who have so long clamour with incessant vehemence against the measure of the ministry such a open confession of they own weakness nothing my lord be so frequently urge or so warmly exaggerate as the impossibility of procure evidence against a man in power nothing be more confidently assert than that he guilt would be easily prove when he authority be at a end and that even he own agent would readily detect he when they be no longer dependant upon he favor the time my lord so long expect and so ardently desire be at length come this noble person whom they have so long pursue with declamation invective and general reproach have at length resign those office which set he above punishment or trial he be now without any other security than that by which every other man be sheltered from oppression the publick protection of the law of he country but he be yet find impregnable he be yet able to set he enemy at defiance and they have therefore now with great sagacity contrived a method by which he may be divest of the common privilege of a social being and may be hunt like a wild beast without defense and without pity where my lord can it be expect that malice like this will find a end be it not reasonable to imagine that if they should be gratify in this demand and should find even this expedient baffle by the ability which they have so often encounter without success they would proceed to measure yet more atrocious and punish he without evidence whom they call to a trial without a crime it have be observe by the noble lord who speak last that there be crime mention in the report of the secret committee of the house of common or that at least such fact be assert in it that a accusation may by easy deduction be form from they the report of that committee my lord with whatever veneration it may be mention by those whose purpose it happen to favor or of whatever importance it may be in the other house be here nothing but a pamphlet not to be regard as a evidence or quote as a writing of authority it be only a account of fact of which we know not how they be collect and which every one may admit or reject at he own choice till they be ascertain by proper evidence at we own bar and which therefore ought not to influence we opinion in the present debate nor be the bill my lord only found upon principle inconsistent with the constitution of this nation apparently tend to the introduction of a new species of oppression but be in itself such as can not be ratify without injury to the honor of this great assembly in examine the bill my lord i think it not necessary to dwell upon the more minute and trivial defect of the orthography and expression though they be such as might justly give occasion for suspect that they by whom it be write be no less stranger to we language than to we constitution there be error or falsehood which it more nearly concern we to detect and to which we can not give any sanction without a evident diminution of we own authority it declare my lord that there be now a inquiry depend before the senate a assertion evidently false for the inquiry be only before the common whether this be insert by mistake or design whether it be intend to insinuate that the whole senatorial power be comprise in the house of common or to persuade the nation that you lordship concur with they in this inquiry it be not possible to determine but since it be false in either sense it ought not to receive we confirmation if we should pass the bill in its present state we should not only declare we approbation of the measure hitherto pursue by the common by which it have be already prove by the noble and learn lord who speak first against the bill that they have not only violate the law but invade the privilege of this house we should not only establish for ever in a committee of the house of common the power of examine upon oath by a elusive and equivocatory expedient but we should in effect vote away we own existence give up at once all authority in the government and grant they a unlimited power by acknowledge they the senate a acknowledgment which might in a very short time be quote against we and from which it would not be easy for we to extricate ourselves it have indeed be remark that there be a large sum of money disburse without account and the publick be represent as apparently injure either by fraud or negligence but it be not remember that none but he majesty have a right to inquire into the distribution of the revenue appropriate to the support of he family and dignity and the payment of he servant and which therefore can not in any degree be call publick money or fall under the cognizance of those whom it concern to inspect the national account either the civil list must be exempt from inquiry or he majesty must be reduce to a state below that of the meanest of he subject he can enjoy neither freedom nor property and must be debar for ever from those blessing which he be incessantly labor to secure to other there be likewise another consideration which my regard for the honor of this assembly suggest to I and of which i doubt not but that all you lordship will allow the importance the noble person who be point out in this bill as a publick criminal and whom all the villain of the kingdom be invite to accuse be invest with the same honor as ourselves and have a son who have for many year possess a seat amongst we let we not therefore concur with the common to load we own house with infamy and to propagate reproach which will at last fix upon ourselves innumerable be the objection my lord which might yet be urge and urge without any possibility of reply but as i have already be hear with so much patience i think what have be already mention sufficient to determine the question : and as i doubt not but the other defect and absurdity will be observe if it be necessary by some other lord i shall presume only to add that as the bill appear to I contrary to the law of this nation to the common justice of society and to the general reason of mankind as it must naturally establish a precedent of oppression and confirm a species of authority in the other house which be either never claim before or always deny as i think the most notorious and publick criminal ought not to be deprive of that method of defense which the established custom of we country allow he and believe the person mention in this bill to deserve rather applause and reward than censure and punishment i think myself oblige to oppose it and hope to find you lordship unanimous in the same opinion then the duke of argyle answer in substance as follow : -- my lord whatever may be the fate of this question i have little hope that it will be unanimously decide because i have reason to fear that some lord have conceive prejudice against the bill which hinder they from discover either its reasonableness or its necessity and be convince that other who approve the bill can support they opinion by argument from which as they can not be confute they never will recede those argument which have influence my opinion i will lay before you lordship and doubt not of show that i be very far from give way to personal malice or the prejudice of opposition and that i regard only the voice of reason and the call of the nation calmness and impartiality my lord have be with great propriety recommend to we by the noble lord who speak first in this debate and i hope he will discover by the moderation with which i shall deliver my sentiment on this occasion how much i reverence he precept and how willingly i yield to he authority i be at least certain that i have hitherto listen to the argument that have be offer on either side with a attention void of prejudice i have repress no motion of conviction nor abstracted my mind from any difficulty to avoid the labor of solve it : i have be solicitous to survey every position in its whole extent and trace it to its remotest consequence i have assist the argument against the bill by favourable supposition and imaginary circumstance and have endeavor to divest my own opinion of some appendant and accidental advantage that i might view it in a state less likely to attract regard and yet i can not find any reason by which i could justify myself to my country or my conscience if i should concur in reject this bill or should not endeavor to promote it i be not unacquainted my lord with the difficulty that obstruct the knowledge of we own heart and can not deny that inclination may be sometimes mistake for conviction and man even wise and honest may imagine themselves to believe what in reality they only wish : but this my lord can only happen for want of attention or on sudden emergency when it be necessary to determine with little consideration while the passion have not yet time to subside and reason be yet struggle with the emotion of desire in other circumstance my lord i be convince that no man impose on himself without connive at the fraud without consciousness that he admit a opinion which he have not well examine and without consult indolence rather than reason and therefore my lord i can with confidence affirm that i now declare my real opinion and that if i err i err only for want of ability to discover the truth and hope it will appear to you lordship that i have be mislead at least by specious argument and deceive by fallacious appearance which it be no reproach not to have be able to detect it will my lord be grant i suppose without hesitation that the law be consistent with itself that it never at the same time command and prohibit the same action that it can not be at once violate and observe from thence it will inevitably follow that where the circumstance of any transaction be such that the principle of that law by which it be cognizable be opposite to each other some expedient may be find by which these circumstance may be alter otherwise a subtle or powerful delinquent will always find shelter in ambiguity and the law will remain inactive like a balance load equally on each side on the present occasion my lord i pronounce with the utmost confidence as a maxim of indubitable certainty _ that the publick have a claim to every man 's evidence _ and that no man can plead exemption from this duty to he country but those whom false gratitude or contract notion of they own interest or fear of be entangled in the snare of examination prompt to disappoint the justice of the publick urge with equal vehemence and indeed with equal truth that _ no man be oblige to accuse himself _ and that the constitution of britain allow no man 's evidence to be extort from he to he own destruction thus my lord two of the first principle of the british law though maxim equally important equally certain and equally to be preserve from the least appearance of violation be contradictory to each other and neither can be obey because neither can be infringe how then my lord be this contradiction to be reconcile and the necessity avoid of break the law on one side or the other but by the method now propose of set those whose evidence be require free from the danger which they may incur by give it the end of the law be the redress of wrong the protection of right and the preservation of happiness and the law be so far imperfect as it fail to produce the end for which it be institute and where any imperfection be discover it be the province of the legislature to supply it by the experience my lord of one generation after another by the continue application of successive age be we law bring to its present accuracy as new combination of circumstance or unforeseen artifice of evasion discover to we ancestor the insufficiency of former provision new expedient be invent and as wickedness improve its subtilty the law multiply its power and extend its vigilance if i should therefore allow what have be urge that there be no precedent of a bill like this what can be infer from it but that wickedness have find a shelter that be never discover before and which must be force by a new method of attack and what then be we require to do more than have be always do by we ancestor on a thousand occasion of far less importance i know not my lord whether it be possible to imagine a emergence that can more evidently require the interposition of the legislative power than this which be now propose to you consideration the nation have be betray in peace and disgrace in war the constitution have be openly invade the vote of the common set publickly to sale the treasure of the publick have be squander to purchase security to those by whom it be oppress the people be exasperate to madness the common have begin the inquiry that have be for more than twenty year demand and elude and justice be on a sudden insuperably retard by the deficiency of the law surely my lord this be a occasion that may justify the exertion of unusual power and yet nothing either new or unusual be require for the bill now propose may be support both by precedent of occasional law and parallel statute of lasting obligation when fraud have be commit by the agent of trading company bill of indemnity to those by whom any discovery should be make have be propose and pass without any of those dreadful consequence which some noble lord have foresee in this i have never hear that any man be so stupid as to mistake such a bill for a general act of grace or that the confession of any crime be procure by it except of those which it be intend to detect i have never be inform that any murderer be bless with the acuteness of the noble lord or thought of fly to such a act as to a common shelter for villany such supposition my lord can be intend only to prolong a controversy and weary a opponent nor can such trifling exaggeration contribute to any other end than of discover the fertility of imagination and the exuberance of eloquence for my part my lord i think passion and negligence equally culpable in a debate like this and can not forbear to recommend seriousness and attention with the same zeal with which moderation and impartiality have already be inculcate he that entirely disregard the question in debate who think it too trivial for a serious discussion and speak upon it with the same superficial gaiety with which he would relate the change of a fashion or the incident of a ball be not very likely either to discover or propagate the truth and be less to be pardon than he who be betray by passion into absurdity as it be less criminal to injure we country by zeal than by contempt that bill without any essential difference from that which be now before we have be pass in favor of private company be indisputably certain it be certain that they never produce any other effect than such as be expect from they by those who promote they it be evident that the welfare of the nation be more worthy of we regard than any separate company that the whole of more importance than a part and therefore the same measure may be now use with far greater justice and with equal probability of success the necessity of the law now propose my lord can not more plainly appear than by reflect on the absurdity of the plea make use of for refuse it which consider in the whole contain only this assertion that the security of one man be to be prefer to justice to truth to publick felicity that a precedent be rather to be establish which will for ever shelter every future minister from the law of we country and that all we misery be rather to be bear in silence or lament in impotence than the man whom the whole nation agree to accuse as the author of they should be expose to the hazard of a trial even before those whom every tie of interest and long-continued affection have unite to he it be indeed object that by pass this bill we shall transfer the authority of try he to the other house that we shall give up we privilege for ever erect a new court of judicature and overturn the constitution i have long observe my lord how vain it be to argue against those whose resolution be determine by extrinsick motive and have be long acquaint with the art of disguise obstinacy by a appearance of reason that have no weight even in the opinion of he by whom they be offer and of raise cloud of objection which by the first reply will certainly be dissipate but which at least fill the mouth for a time and preserve the disputant from the reproach of adhering to a opinion in vindication of which he have nothing to say of this kind be the objection which i be now to remove though i remove it only to make way for another for those can never be silence who can satisfy themselves with argument like this however those that offer it expect it should be answer and if it should be pass over in the debate will boast of its irrefragability and imagine that they have gain the victory by the superiority of they ability rather than of they number that we shall by pass this bill give the common a power which they want at present be unquestionably evident but we shall only retrieve that which they be never know to want before the power of produce evidence evidence which we my lord must hear and of whose testimony we shall reserve the judgment to ourselves the common will only act as prosecutor a character in which they be never conceive to encroach upon we right the man whose conduct be the subject of inquiry must stand he trial at we bar nor have the bill any other tendency than to enable the common to bring he to it what can be allege against this design i know not because i can discover no objection which do not imply guilt and guilt we be not yet at liberty to suppose i be so far from press this bill from any motive of personal malevolence that i be only do in the case of the minister what i should ardently desire to be do in my own and what no man would wish to obstruct who be support by a consciousness of integrity and stimulate by that honest sense of reputation which i have always find the concomitant of innocence i hope i shall be readily believe by you lordship when i assert once more that i should not only forbear all opposition to a bill intend to produce a scrutiny into my conduct but that i should promote it with all my interest and solicit all my friend to expedite and support it for there be once a time my lord in which my behavior be bring to the test a time when no expedient be forget by which i might be oppress nor any method untried to procure accusation against I whether the present case in every circumstance will stand exactly parallel to mine i be very far from presume to determine i have serve my country with industry fidelity and success and have receive the illustrious testimony of my conduct the publick thanks of this house i be conscious of no crime nor have gratify in my service any other passion than my zeal for the publick i see myself ignominiously discard and attack by every method of calumny and reproach nor be the malice of my enemy satisfy with destroy my reputation without impair my fortune : for this purpose a prosecution be project a wretch be find out who engage to accuse I and receive he pardon for no other purpose nor do i make any opposition to it in this house though i know the intent with which it be procure and be inform that part of my estate be allot he to harden he heart and strengthen he assertion this my lord be surely a precedent which i have a right to quote and which will vindicate I to you lordship from the imputation of partiality and malignity since it be apparent that i do only in the case of another what i willingly submit to when a inquiry be make into my conduct but my lord this be far from be the only precedent which may be plead in favor of this bill a bill which in reality concur with the general and regular practice of the established law as will appear to every one that compare it with the eighth section of the act for prevent bribery in which it be establish as a perpetual law that he who have take a bribe shall within twelve month inform against he that give it shall be receive as a evidence and be indemnify from all the consequence of he discovery to these argument of reason and precedent i will add one of a more prevalent kind draw from motive of interest which surely would direct we minister to favor the inquiry and promote every expedient that might produce a complete discussion of the publick affair since they would show that they be not afraid of the most rigorous scrutiny and be above any fear that the precedent which they be now establish may revolve upon themselves to elude the ratification of this bill it be at first urge that there be no proof of any crime and when it be show that there be a apparent misapplication of the publick money it become necessary to determine upon a more hardy assertion and to silence malicious reasoner by show they how little they argument would be regard it then be deny with a spirit worthy of the cause in which it be exert that the civil list be publick money disputant like these my lord be not bear to be confute it would be to little purpose that any man should ask whether the money allot for the civil list be not grant by the publick and whether publick grant do not produce publick money it would be without any effect that the use for which that grant be make should be enumerate and the misapplication of it openly prove a distinction or at least a negative would be always at hand and obstinacy and interest would turn argument aside upon what principle my lord we can now call out for a proof of crime and proceed in the debate as if no just reason of suspicion have appear i be not able to conjecture here be in my opinion if not demonstrative proof yet the strongest presumption of one of the greatest crime of which any man can be guilty the propagation of wickedness of the most atrocious breach of trust which can be charge upon a british minister a deliberate traffick for the liberty of he country of these enormous villany however difficult it may now seem to disengage he from they i hope we shall see reason to acquit he at the bar of this house at which if he be innocent he ought to be desirous of appear nor do he friend consult he honor by endeavor to withhold he from it if they indeed believe he guilty they may then easily justify they conduct to he but the world will perhaps require a more publick vindication these my lord be the argument which have influence I hitherto to approve the bill now before we and which will continue they prevalence till i shall hear they confute and surely if they be not altogether unanswerable they be surely of so much importance that the bill for which they have be produce must be allow to deserve at least a deliberate examination and may very justly be refer to a committee in which ambiguity may be remove and inadvertency correct lord cholmondeley speak next to the follow purpose : -- my lord this bill be in my opinion so far from deserving approbation that i be in doubt whether i should retard the determination of the house by lay before you the reason which influence I in this debate nor indeed could i prevail upon myself to enter into a formal discussion of a question on which i should have imagine that all mankind would have be of one opinion do not my reverence of the ability of those noble lord who have speak in defense of the bill incline I even against the conviction of my own reason to suspect that argument may be offer in its favor which i have not yet be able to discover and that those which have be produce however inconclusive they have seem will operate more powerfully when they be more fully display and better understand for this reason i shall lay before you lordship the objection which arise in my mind when the bill be first lay before we and which have rather be strengthen than invalidate by the subsequent debate it appear my lord evident to I that every man have a right to be try by the known law of he country that no man can be justly punish by a law make after the commission of a fact because he then suffer by a law against which he never transgress nor be any man to be prosecute by method invent only to facilitate he condemnation because he ought to be acquit however guilty he may be suppose whom the established rule of justice can not convict the law my lord be the measure of political as conscience of moral right and he that break no law may indeed be criminal but be not punishable the law likewise prescribe the method of prosecute guilt and as we by omit any crime in we law disable ourselves from punish it however publick or flagrant so by regulate the process in we court of justice we give security to that guilt which by that process can not be detect the truth of this assertion my lord however paradoxical it may perhaps appear will become evident if we suppose a man bring to the bar whose guilt be unquestionable though it could not be legally prove because all those be dead who might have appear against he it be certain that he good fortune would give he no claim to pardon and yet he could not be convict unless we suppose he weak enough to accuse himself in this case my lord it be not impossible that some might be prompt by they zeal to propose that the foreign method of justice might be introduce and the rack employ to extort from he own mouth a confession of those crime of which every one believe he guilty with what horror my lord such a proposal would be hear how loudly it would be censure and how universally reject i need not say but must observe that in my opinion the detestation would arise principally from a sense of the injustice of expose any man to peculiar hardship and distinguish he to he disadvantage from the rest of the community it will my lord not be easy to prove that it be less agreeable to justice to oblige a man to accuse himself than to make use of extraordinary method of procure evidence against he because the barrier of security which the law have fix be equally break in either case and the accuse be expose to danger from which he have reason to believe himself sheltered by the constitution of he country this argument my lord i have mention without endeavor to evince the innocence of the person whom this bill immediately regard because the intent of it be to show that no man be to be deprive of the common benefit of the constitution and that the guilty have a right to all the advantage which the law allow they for guilt be never to be suppose till it be prove and it be therefore never to be prove by new method merely because it be suppose that the method of procure evidence now propose be new my lord i think it no temerity to conclude because the noble lord who have endeavor to defend it have produce no instance of a parallel practice and they knowledge and acuteness be such that they can only have fail to discover they because they be indeed nowhere to be find in the case of bribery my lord the person accuse have the privilege if he be innocent of prosecute he accuser for perjury and be therefore in less danger of be harass by a false indictment but my lord this be not the only difference between the two case for he that discover a bribe receive by himself have no motive of interest to prompt he evidence he be only secure from suffer by he own discovery and might have be equally safe by silence and secrecy since the law suppose the crime out of the reach of detection otherwise than by the confession of the criminal but far different my lord be the circumstance of those who be now invite to throng the court of justice and stun we with deposition and discovery they be man suppose criminal by the indemnity which be offer they and by the nature of they crime it be make at least probable that they be in daily hazard of discovery and punishment from which they be summon to set themselves free for ever by accuse a man of whom it have not be yet prove that he can legally be call to a trial thus my lord in the law which the noble duke have mention as a precedent for this bill the accuser be only place in a kind of equilibrium equally secure from punishment by silence or by information in hope that the love of truth and justice will turn the balance in the bill now before we the witness be in continual danger by withhold he evidence and be restore to perfect safety by become a accuser and from make discovery whether true or false have every thing to hope and nothing to fear the necessity of punish wickedness have be urge with great strength it have be unanswerably show by the advocate for this bill that vindictive justice be of the highest importance to the happiness of the publick and that those who may be injure with impunity be in reality deny the benefit of society and can be say to live in the state of uncivilized nature in which the strong must prey upon the weak this my lord have be urge with all the appearance of conviction and sincerity and yet have be urge by those who be provide a shelter for the most enormous villany and enable man who have violate every precept of law and virtue to bid defiance to justice and to sit at ease in the enjoyment of they acquisition and what my lord be the condition upon which wickedness be to be set free from terror upon which national justice be to be disarm and the betrayer of publick counsel or the plunderer of publick treasure qualify for new trust and set on a level with untainted fidelity a condition my lord which wretch like these will very readily accept the easy term of information and of perjury they be require only to give evidence against a man mark out for destruction and the guilt of partaking in he crime be to be efface by the merit of concur in he ruin it have indeed be a method of detection frequently employ against housebreaker and highwayman to proclaim a pardon for he that shall convict he accomplice but surely my lord this practice will not in the present question be mention as a precedent surely it will not be think equitable to level with felon and with thief a person distinguish by he rank he employment he ability and he service a person whose loyalty to he sovereign have never be call in question and whose fidelity to he country have at least never be disprove these be measure my lord which i hope you lordship will never concur to promote measure not support either by law or justice or enforce by any exigence of affair but dictate by persecution malice and revenge measure by which the guilty and the innocent may be destroy with equal facility and which must therefore tend to encourage wickedness as they destroy the security of virtue lord carteret then rise and speak to the following effect : -- my lord i have so long honor the ability and so often concur with the opinion of the noble lord who begin the debate that i can not without unusual concern rise up now to speak in opposition to he nor could any other principle support I under the apparent disadvantage of a contest so unequal but the consciousness of upright intention and the concurrence of the whole nation i can not but consider myself on this occasion my lord as the advocate of the people of britain who after continue oppression loss and indignity after have be plunder and ridicule harass and insult for complain have at length flatter themselves that they should have a opportunity of appeal to we bar for justice and of secure themselves from future injury by the punishment of those that have so long triumph in they guilt proclaim they defiance of justice and declare that the law be make only for they security the expectation of the people have be frustrate by the unexpected obstinacy of the agent of wickedness by a plea that be never make use of for the same purpose before against which the known law of the nation have provide no remedy and which you lordship be therefore now call upon to overthrow that the nation call loudly for a inquiry that the misapplication of the publick treasure be universally suspect and that the person mention in the bill be believe to be the chief author of that misapplication that at least those who have squander it have act by he authority and be admit to trust by he recommendation and that he be therefore accountable to the publick for they conduct i shall suppose can not be deny the nation my lord have a right to be gratify in they demand of a inquiry whatever be the foundation of they suspicion since it be manifest that it can produce no other effect than those of give new lustre to innocence and quiet the clamor of the people if it should be find that the government have be administer with honesty and ability and it be not less evident that if the general opinion be well ground if we interest have be betray and that money employ only to corrupt the nation which be raise for the defense of it the severest punishment ought to be inflict that all future minister may be deter from the same crime by exemplary vengeance thus my lord a inquiry appear upon every supposition useful and necessary but i can not comprehend how it can be prosecute by any other method than that of propose a indemnity to those who shall make discovery every wicked measure my lord must involve in guilt all who be engage in it and how easily it may be conceal from every other person may be show by a example of a crime which no man will deny to have sometimes exist and which in the opinion of most be not very uncommon in this age it will be allow at least that on some occasion when a favorite begin to totter when strong objection be raise against the continuance of a standing army when a convention require the ratification of the legislature or some fatal address be propose to be present to the crown a pecuniary reward may sometimes be offer and though that indeed be a supposition more difficult to be admit sometimes however rarely accept in this case my lord none but he that give and he that receive the bribe can be conscious of it at most we can only suppose a intervene agent to have any knowledge of it and if even he be admit to the secret so as to be able to make a legal discovery there must be some defect of cunning in the principal let we consider from which of these any discovery can be probably expect or what reason can be allege for which either should expose himself to punishment for the sake of ruin he associate it be therefore my lord plain from this instance that without the confession of some guilty person no discovery can be make of those crime which be most detrimental to we happiness and most dangerous to we liberty it be apparent that no man will discover he own guilt while there remain any danger of suffering by he confession it be certain that such crime will be commit if they be not discourage by the fear of punishment and it can not therefore be deny that a proclamation of indemnity be necessary to they detection this my lord be not as it have be allege a method unknown to we constitution as every man that read the common papers will easily discover i doubt if there have be for many year a single month in which some reward as well as indemnity have not be promise to any man who have be engage in a robbery would discover he confederate and surely a method that be daily practice for the security of private property may be very rationally and justly adopt by the legislature for the preservation of the happiness and the property of the publick the punishment of wickedness my lord be undoubtedly one of the essential part of good government and in reality the chief purpose for which society be institute for how will that society in which any individual may be plunder enslaved and murder without redress and without punishment differ from the state of corrupt nature in which the strongest must be absolute and right and power always the same that constitution therefore which have not provide for the punishment and previously for the discovery of guilt be so far in a state of imperfection and require to be strengthen by new provision this my lord be far from be we state for we have in we hand a method of detect the most powerful criminal a method in itself agreeable to reason recommend by the practice of we predecessor and now approve once more by the sanction of one of the branch of the legislature the objection which have on this occasion be make against it be such as no law can escape and which therefore can have no weight and it be no small confirmation of the expediency of it that they by whom it have be oppose have not be able to attack it with stronger reason from which if we consider they ability we shall be convince that nothing have secure it but the power of truth it be inquire by the noble lord how we shall distinguish true from false evidence to which it may be very readily answer that we shall distinguish they by the same means as on any other occasion by compare the allegation and consider how every witness agree with other and with himself how far he assertion be in themselves probable how they be confirm or weaken by known circumstance and how far they be invalidate by the contrary evidence we shall my lord if we add we sanction to this bill discover when any man 's accusation be prompt by he interest as we might know whether it be dictate by he malice it have be ask also how any man can ascertain he claim to the indemnity to which it may be easily reply that by give he evidence he acquire a right till that evidence shall be prove to be false the noble lord who speak some time ago and whose ability and quality be such that i can not but esteem and admire he even when conviction oblige I to oppose he have propose a case in which he seem to imagine that a murderer might secure himself from punishment by connect he crime with some transaction in which the earl of orford should be interested this case my lord be sufficiently improbable nor be it easy to mention any method of trial in which some inconvenience may not be produce in the indefinite complication of circumstance and unforeseen relation of event it be know to have happen once and can not be know not to have happen often that a person accuse of murder be try by a jury of which the real murderer be one will not this then be a argument against the great privilege of the native of this empire _ a trial by they equal _ but my lord i be of opinion that the murderer would not be indemnify by this bill since he do not commit the crime by the direction of the person whom he be suppose to accuse nor would it have any necessary connexion with he conduct but might be suppress in the accusation without any diminution of the force of the evidence a man will not be suffer to introduce he accusation with a account of all the villany of he whole life but will be require to confine he testimony to the affair upon which he be examine the committee my lord will distinguish between the crime perpetrate by the direction of the earl of orford and those of another kind and should a enormous criminal give such evidence as the noble lord be please to suppose he may be indemnify for the bribery but will be hang for the murder notwithstanding any thing in this bill to the contrary it have be insist on by the noble lord who have speak against the bill that no crime be prove and therefore there be no foundation for it but my lord i have always think that the profusion of the publick money be a crime and there be evidently a very large sum expend of which no account have be give and what more nearly relate to the present question of which no account have ever be demand on this occasion my lord a assertion have be allege which no personal regard shall ever prevail upon I to hear without dispute it since i think it be of the most dangerous tendency and unsupported by reason or by law it be allege my lord that the civil list be not to be consider as publick money and that the nation have therefore no claim to inquire how it be distribute that it be give to support the dignity of the crown and that only he majesty can ask the reason of any failure in the account of it i have on the contrary my lord hitherto understand that all be publick money which be give by the publick the present condition of the crown be very different from that of we ancient monarch who support they dignity by they own estate i admit my lord that they might at pleasure contract or enlarge they expense mortgage or alienate they land or bestow present and pension without control it be indeed express in the act that the grant of the civil list be without account by which i have hitherto understand only that the sum total be exempt from account not that the minister have a right to employ the civil list to such purpose as they shall think most conducive to they private view for if it should be grant not only that the nation have no right to know how the _ whole _ be expend which be the utmost that can be allow or to direct the application of any part of it which be very disputable yet it certainly have a claim to direct in what manner it shall _ not _ be apply and to provide that borough be not corrupt under pretence of promote the dignity of the crown the corruption of borough my lord be one of the greatest crime of which any man under we constitution be capable it be to corrupt at once the fountain and the stream of government to poison the whole nation at once and to make the people wicked that they may infect the house of common with wicked representative such my lord be the crime the suspicion of which incite the common to a publick inquiry in which they have be able to proceed so far as to prove that the publick discontent be not without cause and that such art have be practice as it be absolutely necessary to the publick security to detect and punish they therefore pursue they examination with a degree of ardor proportion to the importance of the danger in which every man be involve by the violation of the fundamental law of the constitution but they find themselves obstruct by the subtilty of some who confess only that they be guilty and determine to be faithful to they accomplice and themselves a farther inquiry my lord be by this unforeseen evasion make impossible the ultimate and principal agent be sheltered from the law by he guard of mercenary wretch who be contented to be infamous if they can continue to be rich and value themselves on they adherence to they master while they be conspire to ruin they country the nation my lord in the mean time justly apply for redress to the power of the legislature and to its wisdom for method of procure it by law the common have comply with they importunity and propose to you lordship the bill before you a bill for make a publick inquiry possible and for bring a minister within reach of the law on this occasion my lord we be upbraid with we own declaration that the person mention in this bill would quickly find accuser when he should be divest of he authority behold he now say he advocate reduce from he envied eminence and place on a level with he fellow-subject behold he no longer the distributer of employment or the disburser of the publick treasure see he divest of all security but that of innocence and yet no accusation be produce this my lord be a topick so fruitful of panegyrick and so happily adapt to the imagination of a person long use to celebrate the wisdom and integrity of minister that be not the present question of too great importance to admit of false concession i should suffer it to remain without controversy but my lord this be no time for criminal indulgence and therefore i shall annihilate this short-lived triumph by observe that to be out of place be not necessarily to be out of power a minister may retain he influence who have resign he employment he may still retain the favor of he prince and possess he with a false opinion that he can only secure he authority by protect he or what there be equal reason to suspect he successor may be afraid of concur in a law which may hereafter be revive against themselves it may be urge farther my lord that he can not with great propriety be say to have no power who see the legislature crowd with man that be indebted to he favor for they rank and they fortune such a man may bid defiance to inquiry with confidence produce by security very different from that of innocence he may depend upon the secrecy of those whom he have perhaps choose for no other virtue he may know that common danger will unite they to he and that they can not abandon he without expose themselves to the same censure these security my lord the fortification of the last retreat of wickedness remain now to be break and the nation expect its fate from we determination which will either secure the liberty of we posterity from violation by show that no degree of power can shelter those who shall invade they or that we constitution be arrive at this period and that all struggle for its continuance will be vain let we not my lord combine with the publick enemy let we not give the nation reason to believe that this house be infect with the contagion of venality that we honor be become a empty name and that the example of we ancestor have no other effect upon we than to raise the price of perfidy and enable we to sell we country at a higher rate let we remember my lord that power be support by opinion and that the reverence of the publick can not be preserve but by rigid justice and active beneficence for this reason i be far from grant that we ought to be cautious of charge those with crime who have the honor of a seat amongst we in my opinion my lord we ought to be watchful against the least suspicion of wickedness in we own body we ought to eject pollution from we wall and preserve that power for which some appear so anxious by keep we reputation pure and untainted it be therefore to little purpose object that there be no _ corpus delictus _ for even though it be true yet while there be a _ corpus suspicioni _ then inquiry ought to be make for we own honor nor can either law or reason be plead against it i can not therefore doubt that you lordship will endeavor to do justice that you will facilitate the production of oral evidence lest all write proof should be destroy that you will not despise the unite petition of the whole people of which i dread the consequence nor reject the only expedient by which they fear may be dissipate and they happiness secure lord hardwicke speak next in the follow manner : -- my lord after have with a intention uninterrupted by any foreign consideration and a mind intent only on the discovery of truth examine every argument which have be urge on either side i think it my duty to declare that i have yet discover no reason which in my opinion ought to prevail upon we to ratify the bill that be now before we the noble lord who have defend it appear to reason more upon maxim of policy than rule of law or principle of justice and seem to imagine that if they can prove it to be expedient it be not necessary to show that it be equitable how far my lord they have succeed in that argument which they have most labor i think it not necessary to examine because i have hitherto account it a incontestable maxim that whenever interest and virtue be in competition virtue be always to be prefer the noble lord who speak first in this debate have prove the unreasonableness and illegality of the method propose in this bill beyond the possibility of confutation he have show that they be inconsistent with the law and-that the law be found upon reason : he have prove that the bill suppose a criminal previous to the crime summons the man to a trial and then inquire for what offence nor have he my lord confine himself to a detection of the original defect the uncertainty of any crime commit but have proceed to prove that upon whatever supposition we proceed the bill be unequitable and of no other tendency than to multiply grievance and establish a precedent of oppression for this purpose he have show that no evidence can be procure by this till because all those who shall upon the encouragement propose in it offer information must be consider as hire witness to whom no credit can be give and who therefore ought not to be hear he lordship also prove that we can not pass this bill without diminish we right bestow new power upon the common confirm some of they claim which be most dubious nor by consequence without violate the constitution to all these argument argument draw from the most important consideration enforce by the strongest reasoning and explain with the utmost perspicuity what have be reply how have any of he assertion be invalidate or any of he reason elude how have it be show that there be any foundation for a criminal charge that witness thus procure ought to be hear or that we rights would not be make disputable by confirm the proceedings of the common it have be answer by a noble lord that though there be not _ corpus delictus _ there be _ corpus suspicioni _ what may be the force of this argument i can not say because i be not ashamed to own that i do not understand the meaning of the word i very well understand what be mean by _ corpus delictus _ and so do every other lord it be universally know to mean the _ body of a offence _ but as to the word _ corpus suspicioni _ i do not comprehend what they mean : it be a expression indeed which i never before hear and can signify in my apprehension nothing more than the _ body of a shadow _ the substance of something which be itself nothing such my lord be the principle of this bill by the confession of its warmest and ablest advocate it be a bill for summon a person to a trial against whom no crime be allege and against whom no witness will appear without a bribe for that those who should appear in consequence of this bill to offer they evidence ought to be consider as bribe will surely need no proof to those who consider that bribe be not confine to money and that every man who promote he own interest by he deposition be swearing not for truth and justice but for himself it may be urge and it be in my opinion all that the most fruitful imagination can suggest in favor of this bill that they be not require to accuse the earl of orford but to give in they evidence concern he conduct whether in he favor or against he but this argument my lord however specious it may seem will vanish of itself if the bill be diligently consider which be only to confer indemnity on those who in the course of they evidence shall discover any of they own crime on those whose testimony shall tend to fix some charge of wickedness on the earl of orford for it can not easily be imagine how those who appear in he favor should be under a necessity of reveal any action that require a indemnity thus my lord it appear that the bill can produce no other effect than that of multiply accusation since it offer reward only to those who be suppose to have be engage in unjustifiable practice and to procure witness by this method be equally unjust as to propose a publick prize to be obtain by swearing against any of you lordship if witness be to be purchase we ought at least to offer a equal price on each side that though they may be induce by the reward to offer they deposition they may not be tempt to accuse rather than to justify should any private man my lord offer a reward to any that would give evidence against another without specify the crime of which he be accuse doubtless he would be consider by the law of this nation as a violator of the rights of society a open slanderer and a disturber of mankind and would immediately by a indictment or information be oblige to make satisfaction to the community which he have offend or to the person whom he have injure it have my lord i own be assert by the noble duke that the publick have a right to every man 's evidence a maxim which in its proper sense can not be deny for it be undoubtedly true that the publick have a right to all the assistance of every individual but it be my lord upon such term as have be establish for the general advantage of all on such term as the majority of each society have prescribe but my lord the majority of a society which be the true definition of the _ publick _ be equally oblige with the smaller number or with individual to the observation of justice and can not therefore prescribe to different individual different condition they can not decree that treatment to be just with regard to one which they allow to be cruel with respect to another the claim of the publick be found first upon right which be invariable and next upon the law which though mutable in its own nature be however to be so far fix as that every man may know he own condition he own property and he own privilege or it cease in effect to be law it cease to be the rule of government or the measure of conduct in the present case my lord the publick have not a right to hire evidence because the publick have hitherto subsist upon this condition among other that no man shall swear in he own cause the publick have not a right to require from any man that he should betray himself because every man may plead that he be exempt from that demand by the publick faith thus my lord the right of the publick be only that right which the publick have establish by law and confirm by continual claim nor be the claim of the publick from individual to be extend beyond its known bound except in time of general distress where a few must necessarily suffer for the preservation of the rest this necessity be indeed now urge but surely it ought to be show that the present circumstance of affair differ from those of any former age before it can with any propriety he assert that measure be now necessary which no other distress however urgent or provocation however flagrant have hitherto produce it ought to be prove that wickedness have discover some new shelter from justice before new engine be invent to force it from its retreat and new power apply to drag it out to punishment the nation have subsist my lord so many century have often recover from the linger disease of inward corruption and repel the shock of outward violence it have often be endanger by corrupt counsel and wicked machination and surmount they by the force of its established law without the assistance of temporary expedient at least without expedient like this which neither law nor justice can support and which would in itself be a more atrocious grievance than those if they be real which it be intend to punish and might produce far greater evil than those which be imputed to he against whom it be project it have indeed my lord be mention by a noble lord in much softer language as a method only of make a inquiry possible the possibility of a inquiry my lord be a very remote and inoffensive idea but name will not change the nature of the thing to which they be apply the bill be in my opinion calculate to make a defense impossible to deprive innocence of its guard and to let loose oppression and perjury upon the world it be a bill to dazzle the wicked with a prospect of security and to incite they to purchase a indemnity for one crime by the perpetration of another it be a bill to confound the notion of right and wrong to violate the essence of we constitution and to leave we without any certain security for we property or rule for we action nor be the particular part less defective than the general foundation for it be full of ambiguous promise vague idea and indeterminate expression of which some have be already particularize by the noble lord that have speak on this occasion whose observation i shall not repeat nor endeavor to improve but can not forbear propose to the advocate for the bill one sentence that it may be explain by they and that at least we may not pass what we do not understand in the inquiry into the conduct of the earl of orford every man as we have already see be invite to bring he evidence and to procure a indemnity by answer such question as shall be ask _ touch or concern the say inquiry or relative thereto _ what be to be understand by this last sentence i would willingly be inform i would hear how far the _ relation _ to the inquiry be design to be extend with what other _ inquiry _ it be to be complicate and where the chain of interrogatory be to have a end when a evidence appear before the committee how can he be certain that the question ask be _ relative to the inquiry _ how can he be certain that they be such as he may procure a indemnity by resolve or whether they be not unconnected with the principal question and therefore insidious and dangerous and to what power must he appeal if he should be prosecute afterwards upon he own confession on pretence that it be not _ relative to the inquiry _ expression like these my lord if they be not the effect of malicious hurry and negligent animosity must be intend to vest the committee with absolute authority with the award of life and death by leave to they the liberty to explain the statute at they own pleasure to contract or enlarge the relation to the controversy to inquire without bound and judge without control thus my lord i have lay before you my opinion of this bill without any partial regard without exaggerate the ill consequence that may be fear from it or endeavor to elude any reasoning by which it have be defend i have endeavor to pursue the argument of the noble lord who speak first and to show that it be found upon false notion of criminal justice that it propose irrational and illegal method of trial that it will produce consequence fatal to we constitution and establish a precedent of oppression i have endeavor in examine the argument by which the bill have be defend to show that the rights of the publick be ascertain and that the power of the majority be to be limit by moral consideration and to prove in discuss its particular part that it be inaccurate indeterminate and unintelligible what effect my inquiry may have have upon you lordship yourselve only can tell for my part the necessity of dwelling so long upon the question have add new strength to my conviction and so clearly do i now see the danger and injustice of a law like this that though i do not imagine myself indue with any peculiar degree of heroism i believe that if i be condemn to a choice so disagreeable i should more willingly suffer by such a bill pass in my own case than consent to pass it in that of another the duke of argyle reply to the following effect : -- my lord i be not yet able to discover that the bill now before we be either illegal or absurd that its interpretation be doubtful or its probable consequence dangerous the indisputable maxim that _ the publick have a right to every man 's evidence _ have be explain away with much labor and with more art than a good cause can often require we have be tell of publick contract of the rights of society with regard to individual and the privilege of individual with respect to society we have have one term oppose to another only to amuse we attention and law reason and sophistry have be mingle till common sense be lose in the confusion but my lord it be easy to disentangle all this perplexity of idea and to set truth free from the shackle of sophistry by observe that it be in all civilized nation of the world one of the first principle of the constitution that the publick have a right always reserve of have recourse to extraordinary method of proceed when the happiness of the community appear not sufficiently secure by the known law law may by those who have make the study and explanation of they the employment of they life be esteem as the great standard of right they may be habitually reverence and consider as sacred in they own nature without regard to the end which they be design to produce but other my lord whose mind operate without any impediment from education will easily discover that law be to be regard only for they use that the power which make they only for the publick advantage ought to alter or annul they when they be no longer serviceable or when they obstruct those effect which they be intend to promote i will therefore my lord still assert that _ the publick have a right to every man 's evidence _ and that to reject any bill which can have no other consequence than that of enable the nation to assert its claim to reconcile one principle of law with another and to deprive villany of a evasion which may always be use be to deny justice to a oppressed people and to concur in the ruin of we country and farther my lord i confidently affirm it have not be prove that this bill can endanger any but the guilty nor have it be show that it be draw up for any other purpose than that which the noble lord mention of hinder _ a inquiry from be impossible _ it may therefore justly be require from those who affect on this occasion so much tenderness for liberty so many suspicion of remote design and so much zeal for we constitution to demonstrate that either a inquiry may be carry on by other means or that a inquiry be itself superfluous or improper though none of those who have speak against the bill have be willing to expose themselves to universal indignation by declare that they would gladly obstruct the progress of the inquiry that they design to throw a mist over the publick affair and to conceal from the people the cause of they misery and though i have no right to charge those who differ from I in opinion with intention which as they do not avow they can not be prove this however i will not fear to affirm that those who be for reject this method of inquiry would consult they honor by propose some other equally efficacious lest it should be think by such as have not any opportunity of know they superiority to temptation that they be influence by some motive which they be not willing to own and that they be in secret enemy to the inquiry though in publick they only condemn the method of pursue it the duke of newcastle next rose and speak to this effect : -- my lord the argument which have be produce in defense of the bill before we however those who offer they may be influence by they have make hitherto very little impression upon I my opinion of the impropriety and illegality of this new method of prosecution still continue the same nor can it be expect that i should alter it till those reason have be answer which have be offer by the noble lord who speak first in the debate the advocate for the bill seem indeed conscious of the insufficiency of they argument and have therefore add motive of another kind they have inform we that we power subsist upon we reputation and that we reputation can only be preserve by concur in the measure recommend by the common they have insinuate to we that he who obstruct this bill will be think desirous to obstruct the inquiry to conspire the ruin of he country and to act in confederacy with publick robber but my lord whether the nation be really exasperate to such a degree as be represent whether it be the general opinion of mankind that the publick affair have be unfaithfully administer and whether this bill have be dictate by a desire of publick justice or of private revenge i have not think it necessary to inquire have long learn to act in consequence of my own conviction not of the opinion of other at least not of those who determine upon question which they can not understand and judge without have ever obtain a opportunity of examine such my lord must be the opinion of the people upon question of policy opinion not form by reflection but adopt from those whom they sometimes with very little reason imagine nearer spectator of the government than themselves and in whom they place a implicit confidence on account of some casual act of popularity i shall not therefore think the demand of the people a rule of conduct nor shall ever fear to incur they resentment in the prosecution of they interest i shall never flatter they passion to obtain they favor or gratify they revenge for fear of they contempt the inconstancy my lord of publick applause all of we have observe and many of we have experience and we know that it be very far from be always the reward of merit we know that the brightest character may be easily darken by calumny that those who be labor for the welfare of the publick may be easily represent as traitor and oppressor and that the people may quickly be persuade to join in the accusation that the people however deceive have a right to accuse whomsoever they suspect and that they accusation ought to be hear i do not deny but surely my lord the opinion of the people be not such a proof of guilt as will justify a method of prosecution never know before or give we a right to throw down the barrier of liberty and punish by power those whom we can not convict by law let any of you lordship suppose himself by some accident expose to the temporary malice of the populace let he imagine he enemy inflame they to a demand of a prosecution and then propose that he should be deprive of the common method of defense and that evidence should be hire against he lest the publick should be disappointed and he will quickly discover the unreasonableness of this bill i suppose no man will deny that method of prosecution introduce on one occasion may be practice on another and that in the natural rotation of power the same means may be use for very different end nothing be more probable my lord if a bill of this kind should be ever pass in compliance with the clamor of the people to punish minister and to awe the court than that it may in time if a wicked minister should arise be make a precedent for measure by which the court may intimidate the champion of the people by which those may be pursue to destruction who have be guilty of no other crime than that of serve they country in a manner which those who be ignorant of the circumstance of affair happen to disapprove the measure now propose my lord be therefore to be reject because it be evident that they will establish a precedent by which virtue may at any time be oppress but which can be very seldom necessary for the detection of wickedness since there be no probability that it will often happen that a man really guilty of enormous crime can secure himself from discovery or connect other with he in such a manner that they can not impeach he without betray themselves but my lord whenever virtue be to be persecute whenever false accusation be to be promote this method be incontestably useful for no reward can so efficaciously prevail upon man who languish in daily fear of publick justice as a grant of impunity it may be urge my lord i own that all inquiry into futurity be idle speculation that the expedient propose be proper on the present occasion and that no method of justice be to be allow if the possibility of apply they to bad purpose be a sufficient reason for reject they but to this my lord it may be answer with equal reason that every process of law be likewise in some degree defective that the complication of circumstance be variable without end and therefore can not be comprise in any certain rule and that we must have no established method of justice if we can not be content with such as may possibly be sometimes elude and my lord it may be observe farther that scarcely any practice can be conceive however generally unreasonable and unjust which may not be sometimes equitable and proper and that if we be to lay aside all regard to futurity and act merely with regard to the present exigence it may be often proper to violate every part of we constitution this house may sometimes have reject bill beneficial to the nation and if this reasoning be allow it might have be wise and just in the common and the emperor to have suspend we authority by force to have vote we useless on that occasion and have pass the law without we concurrence with regard to the establishment of criminal prosecution as well as to we civil rights we be my lord to consider what be upon the whole most for the advantage of the publick we be not to admit practice which may be sometimes useful but may be often pernicious and which suppose man better or wiser than they be we do not grant absolute power to a wise and moderate prince because he successor may inherit he power without he virtue we be not to trust or allow new method of prosecution upon a occasion on which they may seem useful because they may be employ to purpose very different from those for which they be introduce thus my lord i have show the impropriety of the bill now before we upon the most favourable supposition that can possibly be make a supposition of the guilt of the noble person against whom it be contrived and surely my lord what can not even in that case be approve must if we suppose he innocent be detest that he be really innocent my lord that he be only blacken by calumny and pursue by resentment can not be more strongly prove than by the necessity to which he enemy be reduce of use expedient never hear of in this nation before to procure accusation against he expedient which they can not show to have be at any time necessary for the punishment of a man really wicked and which by bring guilt and innocence into the same danger leave we at liberty to imagine that he be clear from the crime imputed to he even in the opinion of those who pursue he with the fiercest resentment and the loudest clamor it may well be imagine my lord that those whom he have so long defeat by he ability see themselves now baffle by he innocence and that they only now persecute he character to hide the true reason for which they formerly attack he power i hope my lord i shall be easily forgive for observe that this be a testimony of uncorrupted greatness more illustrious than any former minister have ever obtain for when be it known my lord that after a continuance of power for twenty year any man when he conduct become the subject of publick examination be without accuser i can not for my part but congratulate the noble person upon he triumph over malice malice assist by subtilty and experience by wealth and power which be at length oblige to confess its impotence to call upon we to assist it with new law to enable it to offer a reward for evidence against he and throw down the boundary of natural justice that he may be harass censure and oppress upon whom it can not be prove that he ever deviate from the law or employ he power for any other end than the promotion of the publick happiness have the officer of the crown my lord when he influence be represent so great and he dominion so absolute project any such measure for he defense have they propose to silence he opponent by call they to a trial and offer a state price for accusation against they how loudly would they have be charge with the most flagrant violation of the law and the most open disregard of the rights of nature with how much vehemence would it have be urge that they be intoxicate with they success and that in the full security of power they think themselves entitle to neglect the great distinction of right and wrong and determine to employ the law for the completion of those purpose in which justice would give they no assistance i doubt not that you lordship will easily perceive that this censure be equally just in either case that you will not allow any man to be prosecute by method which he ought not to have use in he own case that you will not expose any man to hardship from which every other member of the community be exempt that you will not suffer any man to be try by hire evidence and that you will not condemn he whom the law acquit lord bathurst speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord the question under we consideration have be so long and so accurately debate that little can be add to the argument on either side and therefore though i think it necessary on so important a occasion to make a solemn declaration of my opinion i shall endeavor to support it not so much by any argument of my own as by a recapitulation and comparison of those which have be already hear by you lordship it have not be deny that the punishment of crime be absolutely necessary to the publick security and as it be evident that crime can not be punish unless they be detect it must be allow that the discovery of wicked measure ought to be in a very great degree the care of those who be intrust with the government of the nation nor can they better discharge they trust than by defeat the artifice of intrigue and block up the retreat of guilt this likewise my lord be admit with such restriction as seem intend to preclude any advantage that might be draw from the appearance of a concession for it be urge that guilt be not to be detect by any method which be not just and that no method be just which be not usual the first position my lord i have no intention to controvert as it be not to violate justice but to preserve it from violation that this bill have be project or defend but my lord it be to be observe that they who so warmly recommend the strictest adherence to justice seem not fully to understand the duty which they urge to do justice my lord be to act with impartiality to banish from the mind all regard to personal motive and to consider every question in its whole extent without suffer the attention to be restrain to particular circumstance or the judgment to be obstruct by partial affection this rule my lord seem not to have be very carefully observe by the most vehement advocate for justice in the case before we for they appear not to be solicitous that any should receive justice but the person mention in the bill they do not remember that the publick have cry out for justice more than twenty year for justice which have not yet be obtain and which can be obtain only by the method now propose it be necessary my lord for those who be so watchful against the breach of justice to prove that any means can be unjust which have no other tendency than the detection of wickedness of wickedness too artful or too powerful to be punish by the common rule of law the introduction of new method of prosecution be the natural consequence of new scheme of villany or new art of evasion nor be it necessary that precedent should be produce when the wisdom of the legislature concur in acknowledge the necessity of extraordinary measure though we constitution be in the highest degree excellent i never yet hear that it be perfect and whatever be not perfect may be improve we law however wise be yet the contrivance of human policy and why should we despair of add somewhat to that which we inherit from we ancestor why should we imagine that they anticipate every contingency and leave nothing for succeed age i think my lord with the highest regard both of we law and those by whom they be enact but i look with no less veneration on this illustrious assembly i believe you lordship equal to you progenitor in ability and therefore since you can not but outgo they in experience be confident that you may make improvement in the fabrick which they have erect that you may adorn it with new beauty or strengthen it with new support it can not at least be deny that you lordship have all the power of you ancestor and since every law be once new it be certain they be far from imagine that there be always a necessity of inquire after precedent if the argument draw from the want of precedent be now of any force let it be prove that its force be less in any former reign and let it be consider how we government could have attain its present excellence have this house instead of apply to every grievance its proper remedy be amuse with turn over journal and look upon every new emergence for precedent of which it be certain that there must have be a time in which they be not to be find in all regulation establish by the legislature it be sufficient that they do not produce confusion by be inconsistent with former law that they unite easily with we constitution and do not tend to the embarrassment of the machine of government this consideration my lord have be in a very remarkable manner regard by those who draw up the bill before we a bill of which the noble duke have prove that it will be so far from perplexing we judicial proceedings that it will reconcile the law to itself and free we from the necessity of obey one precept by the neglect of another the argument of the noble duke be such as in my opinion can not be answer or hear impartially without conviction the maxim quote by he be each of they incontestably true they be on this occasion incompatible and this be the only method by which they can be reconcile nor have he only show the propriety of the bill by irrefragable reason but have prove likewise that it be consistent not only with the constitution of we government but with the practice of we ancestor he have show that it may be support not only by reason but by bill of the same kind enact on occasion of far less importance he have prove my lord all that the most scrupulous inquirer can wish he have make it evident that the bill would be proper though it be unprecedented he have produce many precedent in support of it and have thereby evince that the only present question be whether it be just to the precedent allege by he it have be object that they differ in some particulars but when my lord do any two action however common agree in every circumstance relation may be complicate without end and every new complication produce new appearance which however be always to be disregard while the constituent principle remain unvaried if we consider the difficulty in which the opponent of the bill have involve themselves it will not be easy to think well of a cause which give birth to such wild assertion and extravagant opinion they have first by require precedent determine that we constitution must be henceforward for ever at a stand and then by declare that no precedent be of any weight in which every circumstance be not parallel to the case in debate have debar we from the repetition of any occasional law they have declare almost in plain term themselves useless and destroy that authority at once which they seem so much afraid of communicate to the common but by none of they art of subtle distinction my lord have they be able to evade the argument which arise from the conformity of this bill to the common practice of we court a argument which have produce no other answer than loud declamation against the indecency of compare with pickpocket and highwayman a noble person a minister of acknowledged merit long grace with the favor of he sovereign and long invest with the highest trust i my lord be very far from please myself with licentious or indecent language i be far from envy any man that exaltation which he obtain either by good or by bad action and have no inclination of level the person whose conduct i desire to see examine with the profligate or infamous yet i can not forbear to observe that high rank be a aggravation of villany that to have enjoy the favor of he sovereign be no defense of he that have abuse it and that high trust be a honor only to that man who when he lay down he office dare stand a inquiry have there be no precedent in we judicial proceedings my lord which bear any resemblance to this bill there would not from thence have arise any just objection common proceedings be establish for common occasion and it seem to have be the principle of we ancestor that it be better to give ten guilty person a opportunity of escape justice than to punish one innocent person by a unjust sentence a principle which perhaps might not be erroneous in common case in which only one individual be injure by another or when the trial be by the law commit to a common jury who might easily be mislead they might likewise imagine my lord that a criminal encourage by a fortunate escape to a repetition of he guilt would undoubtedly some time fall into the hand of the law though not extend on purpose to seize he and therefore they constitute they proceedings in such a manner that innocence might at least not be entrap though guilt should sometimes gain a reprieve but in the present case my lord every circumstance require a different conduct by the crime which this bill be intend to detect not single person or private family but whole nation and all order of man have long be injure and oppress and oppress with such success that the criminal have no temptation to renew he practice nor be there any danger of a erroneous sentence because the trial will be hear by this house by person whose integrity set they above corruption and whose wisdom will not be deceive by false appearance this consideration my lord afford a unanswerable reply to those who represent the bill as ill-concerted because the evidence to be procure by it be the testimony of man partner by they own confession in the crime which they reveal every court my lord examine the credibility of a witness and the known corruption of these man may be properly plead at the trial where you lordship will balance every circumstance with you known impartiality and examine how far every assertion be invalidate by the character of the witness and how far it be confirm by a corroboratory concurrence of known event or support by other testimony not liable to the same exception thus my lord it may be observe how quickly the cloud be disperse with which interest or perverseness have endeavor to obscure the truth and how easily the strongest objection which the greatest ability could raise against this bill be confute or how apparently when they be closely examine they confute themselves one of the objection that require no answer be that which have be raise with regard to the extent of the indemnity offer in the bill which in the opinion of those that oppose it ought to be restrain to particular person but that it be chiefly if not solely intend to be apply to those who have refuse to answer the question of the committee i believe every lord in this house be fully convince it be however necessary to draw it up in general term lest other artifice might have be employ and lest by point out particular person opportunity might have be give to deprive the publick of they evidence by prevail upon they to withdraw the bill be justly style by a noble lord a bill to prevent _ a inquiry from be impossible _ the difficulty of inquiry for the publick be well know and the difficulty arise chiefly from the inability of the people to reward they advocate or they evidence the state of the court my lord be very different the crown can not only pardon but advance those that have on any occasion promote its interest and i hope it will not be too much power to be for once grant to the people if they be empower to throw a simple indemnification into the balance and try whether with the slight addition of truth and reason and justice it will be able to weigh down title and wealth and power it have be urge that there be danger lest this bill should become a precedent i hope my lord the same occasion will not often happen and whenever it shall hereafter occur the precedent of pass the bill will be much less dangerous than that of reject it i hope it be not necessary to say more on this occasion yet i can not forbear to remind some lord of the fatal consequence which at critical conjuncture they have often dreaded or appear to dread from a disagreement of this house with the common at this time in which the nation be engage in war when the whole continent be one general scene of discord and confusion when the wisest counsel the firmest unanimity and the most vigorous measure be apparently necessary it might not be improper to reflect how unseasonably we shall irritate the common by reject this bill and how justly we shall exasperate the people by show they that they complaint and remonstrance be of no weight that they must expect the redress of they grievance from some other power and that we prefer the impunity of one man to the happiness and safety of the publick lord islay speak next to the follow purpose : -- my lord as there have in this debate be very frequent mention of extraordinary case of new mode of wickedness which require new form of procedure and new art of elude justice which make new method of prosecution necessary i can not forbear to lay before you lordship my sentiment on this question sentiment not so much form by reflection as impress by experience and which i owe not to any superior degree of penetration into future event but to subsequent discovery of my own error i have observe my lord that in every collision of party that occasion on which they passion be inflamed be always term a extraordinary conjuncture a important crisis of affair either because man affect to talk in strong term of the business in which they be engage for the sake of aggrandize themselves in they own opinion and that of the world or because the present object appear greatest to they sight by intercept other and that be imagine by they to be really most important in itself by which they own pleasure be most affect on these extraordinary occasion my lord the victorious have always endeavor to secure they conquest and to gratify they passion by new law by law even in the opinion of those by whom they be promote only justifiable by the present exigence and no sooner have a new rotation of affair give the superiority to another party than another law equally unreasonable and equally new be find equally necessary for a contrary purpose thus be we constitution violate by both under the pretence of secure it from the attack of each other and lasting evil have be admit for the sake of avert a temporary danger i have be too long acquaint with mankind to charge any party with insincerity in they conduct or to accuse they of affect to represent they dispute as more momentous than they appear to they own eye i know my lord how highly every man learn to value that which he have long contend for and how easily every man prevail upon himself to believe the security of the publick complicate with he own i have no other intention in these remark than to show how man be betray into a concurrence in measure of which when the ardor of opposition have subside and the imaginary danger be past they have very seldom fail to repent i do not remember my lord any deviation from the established order of we constitution which have not afterwards produce remorse in those that advise it i have know many endeavor to obviate the evil that might be produce by the precedent which they have contribute to establish by publick declaration of they repentance and acknowledgment of they error and for my part i take this opportunity of declare that though i have more than once promote extraordinary bill i do not recollect one which i would not now oppose nor one of which experience have not show I that the danger be greater than the benefit i have learn at length my lord that we constitution have be so form by the wisdom of we ancestor that it be able to protect itself by its own power without any assistance from temporary expedient which like some kind of medicine in the human body may give it the appearance of uncommon vigor but which in secret prey upon its noblest part and hurry it to a sudden decay but none of all the measure into which i have see party precipitate by acrimony and impetuosity have i know parallel to the bill which be now defend in this house a bill which i hope we shall have reason to term the wildest effort of misguided zeal and the most absurd project that the enthusiasm of faction ever produce the particular clause of this bill have be already examine with great acuteness and penetration and have all be show to be absurd or useless i shall therefore only add this observation that the indemnification however liberally offer will be wholly at the disposal of those who shall receive the examination by whom when such discovery be not make as they may happen to expect the witness may be charge with reserve and insincerity and be prosecute for those crime which could never have be know but by they own confession it be not impossible but that if the bait of indemnification shall be find insufficient to produce testimony against the noble person a bill of pain and penalty may be attempt to terrify those who be too wise to be ensnare by specious promise for what may not be expect from those who have already send they fellow-subject to prison only for refuse to accuse themselves nor can i discover my lord how the most abandon villain will be hinder from procure indemnity by perjury or what shall exclude a conspirator against the life and government of he majesty from pardon if he swear that in a plot for set the pretender on the throne he be assist by the counsel of the earl of orford it have indeed be in some degree grant that the bill require some amendment by propose that the necessary alteration may be make to such part of it as shall appear defective to the committee which would indeed be highly expedient if only some particular clause be exceptionable but my lord the intention of the bill be cruel and oppressive the measure by which that intention be promote be contrary to law and without precedent and the original principle be false as it suppose a criminal previous to the crime it be urge as the most pressing argument by the advocate for the bill that it ought to be pass to gratify the people i know not my lord upon what principle those who plead so earnestly for rigid justice can endeavor to influence we decision by any other motive or why they think it more equitable to sacrifice any man to the resentment of the people than to the malice of any single person nor can conceive why it should be think less criminal to sell we voice for popularity than for preferment as this be therefore my lord a bill contrary to all former law and inconsistent with itself as it only tend to produce a bad end by bad means and violate the constitution not to relieve but to oppress as the part singly consider be defective and the whole ground upon a false principle it neither require any longer debate nor deserve any farther consideration it be rather to be detest than criticise and to be reject without any superfluous attempt for its amendment -lrb- the aforementioned lord be all who speak in this debate the question be then put whether the bill should be commit it pass in the negative content 47 proxy 10 -- 57 not content 92 proxy 17 -- 109 but a protest be enter on this occasion sign by twenty-eight lord the former part of it be draw from the speech of the duke of argyle and the latter part of it from that of lord carteret -rrb- house of lord may 20 1742 on the security and protection of trade and navigation the same day that the lord read a first time the indemnification bill they read also for the first time a bill send from the common entitle _ a act for the better protect and secure the trade and navigation of this kingdom in time of war _ as this bill have a remarkable rise pass the common without a division and the end propose by it be so commendable it may be proper to give some account of it before we proceed to the debate thereon in the house of lord it may be remember that we have mention great cause of complaint on account of the loss sustain by the british merchant from the enemy 's privateer who be not sufficiently check the merchant and trader of london bristol and other city have apply to the administration in vain present petition to both house set forth among other thing that notwithstanding the grow insolence of the spanish privateer the application of the suffering merchant for protection and redress have be neglect that number of he majesty 's most useful subject have be reduce to want and imprisonment or compel by inhuman treatment and despairing of a cartel for the exchange of prisoner have enlist in the service of spain that there have be various neglect and delay in the appointment of convoy and some of the commander of the few that have be grant desert the ship under they care at sea and leave they as a prey to the enemy etc one petition farther say that the want of ship of force properly station encourage the enemy to increase the number of they privateer another that most of the capture be almost on we coast in the channel and sounding at a time when the naval force of britain be greater than ever be know a few ship of which might have ruin the enemy 's privateer one set of the petitioner apprehend that most of the capture might have be prevent have a few ship be properly station on this side cape finisterre and the commander keep to the strictest duty other petitioner be not a little alarmed not only at the increase and number of the spanish privateer lately equip but at the unexpected great strength the enemy have lately show in the mediterranean by which they trade must become more precarious than ever the last petition deliver in be from the mayor alderman and common of the city of london setting forth that they have see a powerful and well-provided fleet remain inactive in we own port or more ingloriously put to sea without the appearance of any enterprise in view while we trading vessel be daily expose to the privateer of a inconsiderable port and a feeble enemy hold we naval power in derision to the ruin of trade the enrich the enemy and the disgrace of the british name they general request be that they may have regular convoy and that the commander be order not to desert they charge when in danger that cruiser be properly station subject to such inspection as shall best answer the end design they all conclude with pray that the house would make such provision for the future security of the navigation and commerce of these kingdom as they shall think fit the petition be severally refer to the consideration of a committee of the whole house and the follow order make

and near the channel and sounding for want of which many ship have be take by the enemy some of they of considerable value to the great loss of many of he majesty 's subject the great advantage and encouragement of the enemy and the dishonor of this nation ii that the detention of the ship bind to portugal for near twelve month by the refusal of protection for some time and the delay of convoy afterwards give we rival in trade a opportunity of introduce new species of they woollen manufacture into portugal to the great detriment of this kingdom upon this foundation the house order that a bill be bring in for the better protect and secure the trade and navigation of this kingdom in time of war and that the lord mayor of london -lrb- since decease -rrb- and sir john barnard do prepare

office of lord high admiral for the time be house of lord June 1 1742 the bill for the security and protection of trade and navigation be this day read a second time in the house of lord the earl of winchelsea who have lately accept the chair at the admiralty board rise and speak as follow : my lord i know not by what accident the numerous defect and general impropriety of this bill have escape the attention of the other house nor be there any necessity for examine the motive upon which it pass or of inquire whether its reception be facilitate by the popularity of the title the influence and authority of those by whom it be propose or the imaginary defect of we present regulation which have be on some occasion represent to be such as it be scarcely possible to change but for the better the knowledge and experience of those who concur in send this bill for you lordship ' approbation can not but produce some degree of prepossession in its favor for how can it be imagine my lord that man of great ability and continual opportunity of observation should not be well verse in question relate chiefly to they private interest and discover the nearest way to they own success and yet my lord it will be find that they sagacity have perhaps never so apparently forsake they as on this occasion that no proposition be ever lay before this house in which more contract motive be discover and that the bill be such as might rather have be expect from petty trader unacquainted with the situation of kingdom the interest of prince the art of policy the law of they own country and the conduct of former war than by merchant of extensive traffick general correspondence and great attainment before i proceed my lord to confirm the character of the bill by a distinct consideration of the particular paragraph and a enumeration of the several impropriety and defect which may be find in it i think it not superfluous or unseasonable to remark one general error common to this with all other law of the same kind the error of prescribe rule to military operation of attempt to fix what be in its own nature variable as it must depend upon external cause to which the british legislature have yet find no means of extend its authority to direct upon remote conjecture and uncertain prospects the conduct of a commander be in my opinion my lord not more rational than to trace upon a chart the course of a ship and pronounce it criminal to deviate from it the one suppose a foreknowledge of the motion of the wind and the other of the counsel of we enemy nor can any thing be expect from such regulation but overthrow and disgrace i believe my lord that in run over the history of the world and examine the original of the mightiest empire and the sudden revolution which have be produce by the overpowering torrent of war which at different period of time have sweep the power of the earth before they it will be find that all rapid conquest and sudden extension of empire have be effect by sovereign prince at the head of army which act only by immediate command that few memorable action have be perform by delegated commander and that of those few whose name have descend to posterity those have generally be most successful who be invest with the largest power who act without control and be at liberty to snatch every opportunity and improve every favourable conjuncture without any necessity of communicate they scheme of wait for the result of tedious deliberation or of solicit a relaxation of former order but my lord though perhaps all positive prescription of the conduct of military undertaking have a tendency rather to obstruct than promote success yet as they may be draw up with different degree of wisdom and sagacity they may have a greater or less appearance of usefulness and reason such as have be well concerted may afford useful hint though they ought not to be enact with indispensable obligation and to consider even those in which less proof of skill and foresight can be discover may have at least this advantage that the proposal may not be speedily repeat nor we counsel embarrassed with absurd expedient i shall therefore lay before you lordship my opinion of every paragraph and show what be the objection which may be raise both to the whole bill in general and to its particular clause to the bill in general it must be object that it be fill with vague expression and idea so indeterminate that no man can tell when he have obey it here be many rule order to be observe when _ there shall be no just and sufficient reason _ for neglect they and some operation to be perform as often _ as there shall be occasion _ and ship be to cruise in a certain latitude unless _ there be a necessity of employ they elsewhere _ do not the title of this bill my lord give it some claim to a serious consideration and do not the integrity and capacity of those by whom it be draw up exempt they from contempt and ridicule i should be incline to treat a law like this with some degree of levity for who my lord can be serious when he consent be desire to a bill by which it be enact that man shall act on certain occasion as they shall think most expedient nor be this my lord the only instance of precipitancy and want of consideration for many of the injunction be without any penal sanction so that though we should pass this bill with the greatest unanimity we should only declare we opinion or offer we advice but should make no law or what with regard to the purpose of government be the same a law which may be break without danger but general objection my lord will naturally produce general evasion and a debate may be prolong without produce any clear view of the subject or any satisfactory decision of a single question : i shall therefore endeavor to range my objection in order and by examine singly every paragraph of the bill show the weakness of some expedient the superfluity of other and the general unfitness of the whole to produce the protection and security intend by it in the first clause alone may be find instance of all the impropriety which i have mention to you lordship it be propose that in a time of war between this empire and any other state such a number of ship shall be employ as cruiser or convoy in the channel as the admiralty shall judge most proper for that purpose what be this my lord but to continue to the admiralty the power which have be always execute what be it but to enact that the ship shall be station in time of war as the commissioner of the admiralty shall determine and direct of these ship it be farther enact that they shall be careen three time a-year or oftener if there shall be occasion but it be not declare who shall judge of the necessity of careen or who shall be punish for the neglect of it when it be requisite or for the permission or command of it when it be superfluous there be yet another regulation my lord in this clause which ought not to be pass without remark it be provide that the sailor employ in the cruiser and convoy in the channel shall not be turn over but to other cruiser and convoy by which i suppose it be intend that we outguard should be prevent from be weaken and that we merchant should never be destitute of protection a end truly laudable and which deserve to be promote by some establishment better concerted the expedient now propose seem to have be contrived upon the supposition that the admiralty may not always be very solicitous for the safety of the merchant and that therefore it be necessary to secure they by a law from the danger of be deprive of protection for upon the present establishment the removal of man from one ship to another must be make by the permission of the admiralty and when the right of such permission shall by this law be take away what new security will the merchant obtain the admiralty will still have the power though not of turn over the man yet of recall the ship and commerce suffer equally in either case by the second clause my lord there be still a power reserve to the admiralty of dismiss these guardian of commerce from they station and employ they _ in case of great necessity _ in the line of battle on this side cape finisterre not to cavil my lord at the term of _ great necessity _ of which it be apparent that the commissioner of the admiralty be to judge i would desire to be inform what measure be to be take if a royal navy should unluckily reeve beyond this cape which be mark out as the utmost bind of the power of the admiralty and should there be reduce to the necessity of engage desperately with a superior force or retire ignominiously before it be not we ship to pass a single league beyond they limit in the honor or preservation of they country be they to lie unactive within the sound of the battle and wait for they enemy on this side the cape the third clause my lord be if not absurd like the former yet so imperfectly draw up that it can produce no advantage for of what use will it be to station a officer _ where he majesty shall think fit _ at all the royal dock there be officer already station and in any other place what can a officer depute by he majesty do more than hire workman who will as cheerfully and as diligently serve any other person and why may not the captain of the vessel procure necessaries for money without the assistance of a commissioner in the fourth clause my lord nothing be propose but what be every day practice nor any authority confer upon the court of admiralty than that which it always possess of punish those who disobey they order the provision against the crime of wilfully spring a mast be at least useless for when do any man admit that he spring he mast by design or why should it be imagine that such a act of wickedness such flagrant breach of trust and apparent desertion of duty would in the present state of the navy escape the severest punishment would not all the officer and mariner on board the ship see that such a thing be wilfully do would not they cry out -- you be spring the mast and prevent it or discover the crime and demand punishment the fifth clause my lord be without any penal sanction and therefore can not be compulsive nor be any thing of importance propose in it which be not already in the power of the senate either house may now demand a account of the station and employment of the ship of war nor do the senate now omit to examine the conduct of we naval affair but because we attention be divert by more important employment which will not by this bill be contract or facilitate the use of the provision in the sixth clause my lord i be not able to conceive for to what purpose my lord should the ship appoint for any particular service be nominate at any stated time what consequence can such declaration of we design produce but that of inform we enemy what force they ought to provide against we in war my lord that commander have generally be esteem most prudent who keep he design most secret and assault the enemy in a unguarded quarter with superior and unexpected strength in the seventh clause many regulation be prescribe to the commander of those ship which be appoint to convoy the trading vessel these regulation my lord be not all equally unreasonable but some of they be such as it may on many occasion be impossible for the commander of he majesty 's ship to observe in such a manner as that the master of merchant ship may not imagine themselves neglect or forsake the captain of the convoy may be therefore harass by they with prosecution in which it may be difficult to make he innocence appear the convoy may be sometimes accuse of desert the trader when the trader in reality have forsake the convoy in confidence that they should either arrive safe at the port without protection or be able if they should happen to fall into the enemy 's hand to charge they misfortune upon the negligence of they protector the eighth clause my lord be so far from be such as might be expect from merchant that it seem rather to have be draw up by man who never see the sea nor hear of the violence of a storm for who that have the slightest idea of the uncertainty and hazard of a sailor 's condition who that have be ever tell of a shipwreck or but look on the picture of naval distress would propose that no ship should retire to a harbor or quit the station to which it be assign _ on any pretence whatsoever _ without permission which sometimes could not be obtain in many month and which never could be receive soon enough to allow of a remedy for sudden disaster or press calamity it might with equal reason be enact that no man should extinguish a fire without a act of the senate or repel a thief from he window without a commission of array it be happy my lord that this clause be not enforce by a penalty and therefore can never have the obligatory sanction of a law but since it may reasonably be suppose that the author of it intend that the observation should be by some means or other enjoin let we examine how much security it would add to we navigation and how much strength to we naval power if the breach of it have be make capital which be in itself by no means unreasonable for what punishment less than death can secure the observation of a law which without the hazard of life can not be obey let we therefore my lord suppose a crew of gallant sailor surprise in they cruise by such a hurricane as be frequent in the american sea which the highest perfection of skill and the utmost exertion of industry have scarcely enable they to escape let we consider they now with they mast break they ship shatter and they artillery throw into the sea unable any longer either to oppose a enemy or to resist the wave and yet forbid to approach the land and cut off from all possibility of relief till they have represent they distress to some distant power and receive a gracious permission to save they life misery like this my lord admit no exaggeration nor need i dwell long on the absurdity of establish regulation which can not be observe and which if they be enforce by any sanction proportion as all penal sanction ought to be to the temptation of violate they must drive all we sailor into foreign service or urge they upon the first distress to defiance of law and fill america with pirate and with rebel by the ninth clause my lord nothing be propose but a relaxation of the present discipline it require that the commander of ship of war shall send only once in six month those account of they conduct and they service which they be at present oblige to transmit by every ship that return from america so that by pass this bill we shall only be disable from receive regular and seasonable information of the transaction of we distant squadron and colony shall be disturb with groundless suspicion and tortured with unnecessary suspense i have arrive at length at the last clause a clause my lord worthy to be the conclude paragraph of a bill like this a clause in which the power of the admiralty be communicate to the governor of we colony man my lord not hitherto much celebrate for they superior wisdom moderation or integrity of whom at least it be no reproach to assert that they be know to be for the most part wholly unacquainted with maritime affair and very little famed for military knowledge and of whom it be above all to be consider that they generally commence merchant at they arrival in america and may more probably direct ship send to guard the colony to station in which they may preserve they own vessel than to those where they may contribute most to the general security of trade thus my lord i have examine without prejudice every paragraph of this bill and believe that from the objection which i have make it appear now plainly to you lordship that all the regulation which be of any use be such as be already establish by long custom or by former statute and such therefore as it be unnecessary to mention in a new law and that whatever be here to be find new be absurd unintelligible or pernicious this bill my lord be say to be found on the act make for the same purpose in the war of the queen anne but i can not forbear to observe that the original law though not one of those to which much of the success of that war be to be ascribe be draw up with more discernment than the bill before we it be at least intelligible the number of cruiser be limit and it be therefore possible to know when it be obey but of this bill i can confidently assert that as no man can understand so no man can observe it i have speak more largely my lord on this occasion because this bill relate particularly to my present employment in which as i desire to do my duty i desire to know it and surely i can not be condemn by you lordship for oppose a bill of which the only tendency be to make my province difficult to render one part of my office inconsistent with another and engage I in the task of superintend the execution of impracticable measure what influence my argument will have upon you lordship i can not foresee as every man flatter himself that he own opinion be right i hope to find this house concur in my sentiment but whatever may be the determination of you lordship i be so fully convince of the pernicious tendency of this bill and the embarrassment which must be produce by a attempt to execute it that if it be not reject by this house i shall willingly resign my office to other of more courage or of greater ability for i can have no hope of perform my duty under these restriction either to my own honor or to the advantage of my country the duke of bedford speak next to the following effect : -- my lord though the noble lord have produce very specious argument against every paragraph of the bill before we and though many of he observation be just and some of he objection not easily to be answer yet i can not admit that it will produce those fatal consequence which he seem to foresee nor be yet convince that it will be either pernicious or useless it have always my lord be the practice of this house to attend to every proposal for the publick advantage to consider it without any regard to the character of those by whom it be offer and to approve or reject it upon no other motive than those of justice and reason the same equity and prudence have always influence you lordship to distinguish between the several part of the same bill to reject those expedient of which however plausible either experience or reason may discover the impropriety and to retain those from which any real benefit can reasonably be expect we should never throw away gold because it be mingle with dross or refuse to promote the happiness of the nation because the expedient which be offer for that end happen to be conjoin with some other of a disputable nature by the prosecution of this method a method my lord too rational and just to be neglect or forget i doubt not but this bill which as i shall readily admit be not yet perfect may be improve into a law from which the nation will receive great advantage by which we trade will be extend and we riches increase many of the clause my lord may in my opinion admit of a easy vindication other may be amend by very slight alteration and very few be either wholly useless or manifestly improper the chief defect of the first clause be such that the noble lord have by declare he disapprobation of it give a very uncommon proof of he integrity disinterestedness and moderation for it be imperfect only by place too much confidence in the admiralty which be leave in full power to determine the number of cruiser in or near the channel and sounding the noble lord have remark that the act of queen anne on which the present bill be found exact a determinate number of ship to be employ in this particular service and that it be therefore more prudently draw up than the present bill but i can not see the wisdom of diminish the authority of the lord high admiral for have that act be extend in the same manner to other service it would have leave he only the name and shadow of a office without power and without use this clause my lord rightly understand be only a declaration of confidence in he majesty 's officer a evident confession of they ability to discern the interest of the publick and of they zeal for the prosecution of it with as little reason my lord can it be object that the ship be require to be careen three time a-year the necessity of careen frequently those ship of which the chief use arise from they celerity every sailor can declare to you lordship nor will any man whom he employment or he amusement have make acquaint with navigation allege that any thing be propose in the bill which it would not be detrimental to the publick service to neglect it have be object by the noble lord that they be direct to be careen _ oftener if there be occasion _ term by which a discretionary power be imply of which yet it do not appear in whose hand it be lodge let we consider my lord what inconvenience can arise from the clause as it now stand and what corruption or negligence can be encourage by it the discretionary right of bring the ship into the port to be careen oftener than thrice a-year must be without controversy place in the captain for none but those that be in the ship can discover the necessity of careen it or know the inconveniency that be produce by the adhesion of extraneous substance to its side and bottom i own my lord it may be object that every captain will by this clause be furnish with a excuse for desert he station at pleasure that under pretence of uncommon ardor to pursue the enemy he may waste he time in endless preparation for expedition that he may loiter in the port to careen he ship that before it be foul he may bring it back again and employ the crew in the same operation and that we merchant may be take at the mouth of the harbor in which we ship of war lie to be careen but my lord it be to be remember that in the third clause a commissioner be appoint by whom account be regularly to be transmit to the admiralty of the arrival and departure of every ship and by whom the conduct of every captain be to be inspect and that he may easily detect such truant commander as shall careen they ship only for the sake of desert they station nor can the merchant suffer by any negligence or corruption of the captain because it be intend that the place of every ship return into port shall be supply by another and that the same number shall be always in the same station unless more important service make they more necessary in another place this proviso my lord a proviso undoubtedly reasonable be establish in the second clause but have not have the good fortune to escape the censure of the noble lord who have inquire what must be the conduct of the commander of cruise vessel if a seafight should happen beyond the cape which they be in this clause forbid to pass that the clause may admit of expression not only more proper but more agreeable to the intention of those by whom it be draw up i can not deny for i suppose it very far from they design to limit the operation of we navy to any part of the ocean and be confident that they mean only that the cruiser should not be despatch to such a distance from they station as that we coast should be leave long unguarded or the enemy have time to collect he force and pour he navy or he privateer upon we defenceless trader if by the commissioner mention in the third clause be intend a new swarm of officer the proposition be such as i confess myself very far from approve for it will be to little purpose that we protect the trade if we invent new commissioner to devour its profit nor can we hope for any other consequence from additional wealth if it be procure by increase the influence of the crown but that we should become a more tempting prey to the harpy of a court but my lord to accomplish all that be intend by this clause there be not any need of new officer for there be not many port in which ship of war can be commodiously careen and perhaps there be not one which can be use for this purpose in which there be not already some officer of the crown whose employment allow he leisure sufficient for the execution of a new charge and whose present salary will afford a ample recompense for some casual addition of employment the fourth clause in which be provide that no commander shall wilfully spring he mast or desert he station be such as i should be willing with the noble lord to think unnecessary but must appeal to you lordship whether the late conduct of the convoy have not too evidently show the defect of we present establishment the injury my lord which the publick may suffer by the negligence of the commander of the ship of war be such as it be worthy of the legislature to obviate with the utmost caution and therefore it be by no means improper to enact a punishment for those who shall upon any false pretence leave they station for though such neglect of duty be in the present state of we naval establishment consider as disreputable and irregular yet it do not appear that it have be censure with the detestation which it deserve or punish with the severity necessary to its prevention it be observe my lord with relation to the follow paragraph that either house may at present require account of the conduct of the captain of the navy and that therefore it be unnecessary to provide by any new law that they shall be lay before they but if it be consider my lord how many inquiry which we have a right to make be year after year constantly omit and how many may be excite by curiosity to read account which lie before they who yet will not move the house to demand the account or engage in the debate which such a motion may produce it will not be think unnecessary to provide that they shall be subject to examination without the formality of a regular vote as to the sixth clause my lord which regard the nomination of convoy at a certain time i can discover no reasonable objection to such a provision or none that can preponderate against the advantage which may arise from it by the certain establishment of convoy the value of insurance may be nearly fix merchant will know what confidence be to be repose in the force of the ship and what they have perhaps have of late equal reason to examine how much trust can be place in the fidelity of the commander the nomination of convoy my lord be in my opinion more likely to affright we enemy and to deter they attempt than to encourage they by the information which it will afford they for nothing but we own negligence can conceal from we the naval strength of any power on earth and we may always while we be careful to preserve we maritime superiority protect we merchant so powerfully that none of we enemy shall be incite to attack they by the knowledge of the number and force of the ship appoint for they defense i come now my lord to the seventh clause and surely to ascertain the duty of the captain to whose protection we trading vessel be intrust can not appear superfluous to any of you lordship who have read the list of we loss hear the complaint of we merchant or make any inquiry into the conduct of we sea captain there be i fear too much reason to believe that some of they have with premeditated design desert the trader in place where they have know they most expose to the incursion of the enemy and it be to the last degree evident that other have manifest such contempt of the merchant and such a disregard of they interest as may most justly expose they to the suspicion of very criminal negligence of negligence which no community can be too watchful against or too severely punish it have be affirm by the noble lord that it be not equitable to subject the commander of convoy to penalty for the loss of the trading vessel which may perhaps either rashly or negligently quit they protection that it be not reasonable to subject they to penalty be undoubtedly true but my lord it be far from be equally certain that it be not just to expose they to a trial in a case in which it must be almost impossible to determine falsely in a case where the crew of perhaps twenty ship may be call as witness of they conduct and where none but those whose ship be lose can be under the least temptation to offer a false testimony against they on this occasion my lord it may not be improper to obviate the objection produce by the seeming omission of penal sanction which be only another proof of implicit confidence in the officer of the admiralty who have already the power allow to military court of proceed against those who shall deviate from they order this power which be in a great degree discretionary it be think improper to limit by ascertain the punishment of crime which so many circumstance may aggravate or diminish and therefore in my opinion this clause be far from be so defective as the noble lord represent it the last three clause by which the ship in america be prohibit to leave they station by which it be require that account should be once in six month transmit to the admiralty and by which the captain be subject to the command of the governor of we colony be in my opinion justly to be censure the first be impossible to be observe the second be unnecessary and the third will probably produce more inconveniency than benefit thus my lord i have endeavor to show that this bill though not perfect be yet such as with some emendation may produce great advantage to the trader of this empire for though it be undoubtedly a just observation that the success of military attempt can not be promote by rigid restriction and minute regulation yet it be equally certain that no nation have yet be so fortunate as to be serve by man of integrity superior to law or of wisdom superior to instruction and every government have find it necessary to direct the conduct of its officer by general rule though they have be allow to comply with particular circumstance and to give way to sudden accident i think it therefore my lord necessary to propose that this bill shall be more particularly examine in a committee that after have receive the necessary explanation and amendment it may be refer again to the other house lord delaware rise next and speak to the purpose following : -- my lord the noble duke have by he argument in favor of this bill give a very eminent proof of great ability he have show every clause in that light which may least expose to view its impropriety and defect but have at length only show that it be not impossible to make a useful law for the purpose mention in the title of this bill not that any of the expedient now propose will afford the desire advantage to the publick or obviate any of the inconveniency of which the trader have be so long and so importunately complain this bill my lord be indeed found upon a law make in a reign celebrate for the wisdom of we conduct and the success of we arm but it will not i suppose be assert that nothing be even in that period ill conduct nor will it be a argument sufficient for the justification of a expedient that it be practice in the victorious reign of queen anne if we inquire into the consequence of that law we shall find no inducement to revive it on this or any future occasion for it have no other effect than that of expose we to we enemy by divide we force a disadvantage of which we soon find the effect by the loss of two large ship of seventy gun and of a multitude of trading vessel which by that diminution of we naval armament necessarily fall into the hand of privateer and small cruiser that ravage the ocean without fear or molestation if we examine the present establishment of we navy my lord it will be discover that nothing be propose in this bill which be not more efficaciously perform by the method now in use and more judiciously establish by law of which long experience have show the usefulness this my lord will easily appear from the perusal of the order which every commander of a convoy regularly receive and of the print rule establish by he majesty in council for the royal navy in these my lord much more be comprehend than can properly be infer in a law not occasionally variable nor do i think any thing omit which a experienced and candid inquirer will think useful to the increase of we naval strength or necessary to the protection of we commerce in consider this bill i shall not trouble you lordship with a minute consideration of every single paragraph though every paragraph might furnish opportunity for animadversion but shall content myself with endeavor to evince the reasonableness of some of the objection make by the noble lord who speak first and enforce he opinion with such argument as have occur to I though indeed it require no uncommon sagacity to discover or superior skill in ratiocination to prove that where this bill will produce any alteration in we present scheme it will manifestly change it for the worse for surely my lord it will not be necessary to show by any elaborate and refined reasoning the absurdity of confine cruiser to particular station with a absolute prohibition to depart from they whatever may be the certainty of destruction or prospect of advantage if the intention of cruise ship be to annoy the enemy of the nation ought they to be deprive of the liberty of pursue they if they be design for the protection of we merchant must they not be allow to attend they till they be out of danger every one my lord have have opportunity of observe that there be man who be wholly engross by the present moment and who if they can procure immoderate profit or escape any impending danger be without the least solicitude with regard to futurity and who therefore live only by the hour without any general scheme of conduct or solid foundation of lasting happiness and who consequently be for ever oblige to vary they measure and obviate every new accident by some new contrivance by man of this disposition my lord a temper by which they be certainly very little qualified for legislator the bill now before we seem to have be draw up for they attention be evidently so engage by the present occurrence that there be no place leave for any regard to distant contingency the conclusion of this war be to they the period of human existence the end of all discord and all policy they consider spain as the only enemy with whom we can ever be at variance and have therefore draw up a law a law without any limitation of time to enable we to oppose she they have with great industry and long search discover that cruiser on this side cape finisterre may be of use against the spaniard and propose therefore that in all time of war they be to be despatch to that individual station though we should be engage in dispute with the northern crown or fit out fleet to make conquest in the east indy in all we war my lord however judiciously concerted and however happily conclude the pleasure of success have be abate by the mortification of loss and some complaint have be at all time mingle with the shout of triumph how much soever the glory of the nation have be elevated the fortune of particular person have be impaired and those have never think themselves recompense by the general advantage of the publick who have suffer by the acquisition of they they have always imagine themselves mark out for ruin by malevolence and resentment and have conclude that those disaster which fall upon they only by the common chance of war be bring on they by negligence or design the loss of we merchant in the present war must be acknowledge to have be more than common but if we examine accurately into the cause that may be assign for so great a number of capture we shall find they such as this law will have no tendency to remove such as might be easily imagine before the commencement of hostility and such as it will be extremely difficult on any future occasion of the same kind to hinder from produce the same effect the first and greatest cause my lord of the number of we loss be the number of we ship which can not all be sufficiently protect the extent therefore of we commerce in proportion to that of we enemy expose we to double disadvantage we necessarily lie open in more part to the depredation of privateer and have no encouragement to attempt reprisal because they have few ship of value to be seize the profit of we commerce naturally withhold we sailor from we ship of war and make part of we navy a idle show the certainty of plunder incite they to turn they merchant ship into cruiser and to suspend they trade for more profitable employment thus they at once increase the number of plunderer and take away from we the opportunity of repair we loss by the same practice and my lord if the loss of we merchant have be greater than in former war we trade be more extensive and we ship far more numerous nor be it to be forget that a very important part of we commerce be carry on before the eye of the spaniard so that they may issue out upon we merchant from they own coast and retire immediately beyond danger of pursuit but my lord neither the situation of spain nor the extent of we commerce would have make this war so destructive have not we merchant sometimes facilitate the attempt of we enemy by they own negligence or avarice i have be inform my lord that as the master of trading vessel complain of have be desert by they convoy the captain of the ship of war have in they turn exhibit such representation of the conduct of the trading master as may prove that they caution be not proportion to they clamor and that in however melancholy term they may recount the misery of captivity the calamity of ruin family and the interruption of the trade of britain they will not endeavor to escape they enemy at the expense of much circumspection and that the prospect of no large profit will be sufficient to overbalance the danger of those evil which they so pathetically lament it be not uncommon my lord when the fleet have enter the open sea for the trader to take different course both from the convoy and from each other and to disperse themselves beyond the possibility of receive assistance in danger or distress and what wonder be it if part of they be lose since only part of they can be protect it may be imagine my lord that this be only a excuse forge by the commander to cover they own negligence or treachery it may be ask what motive could induce the merchant to expose themselves to unnecessary danger or what proof they have ever give of such wild negligence of they own interest or safety as that they should be suspect of rush precipitately into the jaw of rapine this my lord be a objection specious in itself and such as those who have not inquire into the present state of we traffick will not very readily discover to be fallacious but it may easily be remove by show that the danger of be take by the enemy be generally not so great to those who have the direction of the ship as it be commonly believe by the present custom of insurance my lord the merchant exempt himself from the hazard of great loss and if he insure so much of the value of the ship and cargo that the chance of arrive first at market be equivalent to the remain part what shall hinder he from press forward at all event and direct he course intrepidly through sea crowd with enemy it be well know my lord that there be in a great part of mankind a secret malignity which make one unwilling to contribute to the advantage of another even when he own interest will suffer no diminution nor be it to be imagine that this disposition be less predominant in trader than in the other class of the community though it be exert on different occasion the envy of one part of mankind be excite by reputation or interest or dignity or power the trader for the most part envy nothing but money in which he have be teach from he infancy that every human excellence be comprehend and contribute to the increase of the riches of another with the same unwillingness with which a soldier would concur in the advancement of a inferior officer to a post of higher rank and authority than he own for this reason my lord there be generally a malevolence in the merchant against the insurer whom he consider as a idle caterpillar living without industry upon the labor of other and therefore when he lay down the sum stipulate for security he be almost in suspense whether he should not prefer the loss of the remain part of the value of he vessel to the mortification of see the insurer enjoy that money which fear and caution have influence he to pay this disposition undoubtedly incline he to proceed with less regard to he own security and betray he into danger which it be at least possible to avoid for to what purpose say he have i insure my ship if i be not to be set free from the necessity of anxiety and caution if i arrive safely at the port i shall dispose of my commodity with uncommon advantage if i miscarry the insurer will at least suffer with I and be deservedly punish for he suspicion and extortion i doubt not but some of you lordship will imagine that i be now indulge chimerical speculation that i be ascribe great force to weak motive and suppose man to act upon principle which in reality never operate in the human breast when i think disadvantageously of other my lord i be indeed always desirous to find myself mistaken and shall be please to hear on this occasion from any of you lordship who have converse at large among mankind that it be not common for one man to neglect he own interest for fear of promote that of another in the present question my lord i have only suppose that envy may be one motive among many and wish its influence be so small as that it might have be less proper to mention it the practice of insurance my lord whether it contribute or not to the number of the capture undoubtedly increase the clamor which they occasion for as the loss be extend the complaint be multiply and both the merchant and insurer take the liberty of censure the conduct of the naval officer and of condemn the measure of the government the ministry be charge with neglect the protection of commerce with oppress the merchant and with connive at the enemy 's preparation that they who most eagerly solicit the war may be the first that shall repent it another cause of the frequency of we loss in the present war be the general circulation of intelligence throughout europe by which it be make impossible to conceal from we enemy the state of we army we navy or we trade every regiment that be raise every ship that be build every fleet of trading vessel that lie wait for the wind be minutely register in the papers of the week and account of it transmit to every nation of the world where curiosity or interest will pay for information the spaniard therefore need only regulate they scheme accord to they instruction from britain and watch those fleet which be frequently send out for they may be confident that some master will wander from they protector entice by avarice negligence or temerity and that they shall have opportunity of enrich themselves without the necessity of engage the convoy to protect ship which be to be steer each at the will of the master be no less impossible my lord than to conduct a army of which every private man be at liberty to march accord to he own caprice to form and pursue he own plan of operation and to dispute and neglect the order of he leader nor be it more reasonable to subject the captain of the ship of war to penalty for the loss of a vessel over which they have no authority than to require from a officer in the army a account of the life of man who perish by disobey he command in my opinion my lord we might with far greater probability of success revive a precedent that may be find in the reign of king william in which it be appoint by a order of council that the name of every ship which go out with a convoy should be register and that the owner should give security to provide a sufficient number of arm and a proper quantity of ammunition to assist the imperial ship in annoying or repel the enemy with one injunction more of the utmost importance to the efficacious protection of we commerce and which therefore in every war ought to be repeat and enforce a injunction by which the master of the ship of trade be require to obey the direction of the commander of the convoy that some measure ought to be concerted for the preservation of we trade i be very far from deny and shall willingly concur in such as shall to I appear likely to promote the end propose by they we loss my lord be undoubtedly great though i believe far less than they be report by discontent and malevolence for if a ship be delay by a accidental hinderance or keep back by contrary wind for a few day there be man so watchful to snatch every opportunity of reproach the measure of the government that a clamor be immediately raise the ship be take the merchant be sacrifice and the nation betray while this report be convey from one to another and like other falsehood increase in its progress while every man add some circumstance of exaggeration or some new proof of the treachery of the ministry the ship enter the port and put a end indeed to the anxiety of the owner and insurer but by no means pacify the people or remove they prejudice against the conduct of they governor for as no man acknowledge himself the first author of the report no man think himself under any obligation to retract or confute it and the passion of the multitude be once in commotion can not be calm before another opportunity of the same kind may be offer for agitate they afresh to the expectation of the people my lord it be always proper to have some regard nor be there any valuable use of power but that of promote happiness and prevent or remove calamity but we be not to endeavor to pacify they by the appearance of redress which in reality will only increase those evil of which they complain nor to depress the reputation of this assembly by pass law which the experience of a single month will prove to be of no use of this kind my lord the bill now before we have be show by the noble lord that speak first on this occasion by whom every clause have be discover to be either defective or unnecessary and who have evince beyond all possibility of reply that the regulation here propose can be divide only into two kind of which one be already establish either by law or prescription and the other can not be admit without apparent injury both to we navy and we trade part of the clause the noble duke have indeed attempt to defend but have be oblige by he regard to reason and to truth to make such concession as be in my opinion sufficient argument for the rejection of the bill he have admit of almost every clause that it be imperfect that it may be amend by farther consideration and that though not wholly to be neglect it yet require some farther improvement to become effectual to the advantage of we merchant the last three clause he natural ability and just discernment immediately show he to be indefensible and he have too much regard to the interest of he country to attempt the vindication of a bill which could not be pass without weaken it by impair its naval force and yet more sensibly by diminish the reputation of its legislature i hope therefore my lord that i shall not undergo the common censure of disregard to we commercial interest or be rank amongst the enemy of the merchant though i declare that in my opinion this bill ought to be reject as unnecessary and injudicious and that we should only by consider in a committee what no consideration can amend waste that time in a fruitless attempt which may be spend much more usefully upon other subject lord carteret speak next to the follow purpose : -- my lord though i do not approve equally of every part of the bill now before we though i think some of the provision unnecessary other unlikely to produce any beneficial effect and some already establish by former act of the senate or rule of the admiralty yet i can not agree with the noble lord that it be unworthy of farther consideration in my opinion my lord it be necessary for many reason to amend this bill rather than reject it and i hope that when i shall have lay before you the result of those inquiry and those reflection which i have make on this occasion you lordship will judge it not improper to refer it to a committee nothing my lord be more necessary to the legislature than the affection and esteem of the people all government consist in the authority of the _ few _ over the _ many _ and authority therefore can be found only on opinion and must always fall to the ground when that which support it be take away for this reason my lord it be worthy of this most August and awful assembly to endeavor to convince the people of we solicitude for they happiness and we compassion for they suffering lest we should seem elevated by the casual advantage of birth and fortune above regard to the lower class of mankind lest we should seem exalted above other only to neglect they and invest with power only to exert it in act of wanton oppression lest high rank should in time produce hatred rather than reverence and superiority of fortune only tempt rapine and excite rebellion the bill now under we consideration my lord can not be reject without danger of exasperate the nation without afford to the discontented and malevolent a opportunity of represent this house as regardless of the publick misery and deaf to the cry of we fellow-subject languish in captivity and mourning in poverty the melancholy and dejected will naturally conceive we inebriate with affluence and elate with dignity endeavor to remove from we eye every spectacle of misery and to turn aside from those lamentation which may interrupt the enjoyment of we felicity nor indeed can it be justly say that such representation be without grounds when we consider the important occasion on which this bill be draw up the bitterness of those calamity which it be intend to redress and the authority by which it be recommend to we it may naturally be expect my lord that the title of a bill for the protection and security of trade should raise a uncommon degree of ardor and attention it might be conceive that every lord in this house would be ambitious of signalize he zeal for the interest of he country by propose on this occasion every expedient which experience or information have suggest to he and that instead of set ourselves free from the labor of inquiry and the anxiety of deliberation by raise objection to the bill and reject it we should labor with unanimous endeavor and incessant assiduity to supply its defect and correct its impropriety to show that a design so beneficial can never be propose to we without effect and that whenever we find honest zeal we shall be ready to assist it with judgment and experience compassion might likewise concur to invigorate we endeavor on this occasion for who my lord can reflect on family one day flourish in affluence and contribute to the general prosperity of they country and on a sudden without the crime of extravagance or negligence reduce to penury and distress harass by creditor and plunder by the vulture of the law without wish that such misfortune might by some expedient be avert but this my lord be not the only nor the greatest calamity which this bill be intend to prevent the loss of wealth however grievous be yet less to be dread than that of liberty and indigence add to captivity be the highest degree of human misery yet even this however dreadful be now the lot of multitude of we fellow-subject who be languish with want in the prison of spain surely my lord every proposal must be well receive that intend the prevention or relief of calamity like these surely the ruin of its merchant must alarm every trading nation nor can a british senate sit unconcerned at the captivity of those man by whom liberty be chiefly support of the importance of the merchant by whom this bill be recommend to we consideration and by whose influence it have already pass the other house it be not necessary to remind you lordship who know that to this class of man we nation be indebted for all the advantage that it possess above those which we behold with compassion or contempt for its wealth and power and perhaps for its liberty and civility to the merchant my lord we owe that we name be know beyond we own coast and that we influence be not confine to the narrow limit of a single island let we not therefore my lord reject with contempt what be propose and solicit by man of this class man whose experience and knowledge can not but have enable they to offer something useful and important though perhaps for want of acquaintance with former law they may have imagine those provision now first suggest which have only be forget and petition for the enaction of a new law when they need only a enforcement of former statute that we naval force have in the present war be misapply that we commerce have be expose to petty spoiler in a degree never know before that we convoy have be far from add security to we trader and that with the most powerful fleet in the world we have suffer all that can fall upon the most defenceless nation can not be deny nor be it any degree of temerity my lord to affirm that these misfortune have be bring upon we by either negligence or treachery for besides that no other cause can be assign for the loss which a powerful people suffer from a enemy of inferior force there be the strongest authority for assert that we maritime affair have be ill conduct and that therefore the regulation of they be very seasonably and properly solicit by the merchant for this assertion my lord we may produce the authority of the other house by which a remonstrance be draw up against the conduct of the commissioner of the admiralty this alone ought to influence we to a accurate discussion of this affair but when a authority yet more venerable be produce when it appear that he majesty by the dismission of the commissioner from they employment admit the justice of the representation of the common it surely can be of no use to evince by argument the necessity of new regulation it be indeed certain that man of integrity and prudence man of ability to discern they duty and of resolution to execute it can receive very little assistance from rule and prescription nor can i deny what the noble lord have affirm that they may be sometimes embarrass in they measure and hinder from snatch opportunity of success and comply with emergent occasion but my lord we be to consider mankind not as we wish they but as we find they frequently corrupt and always fallible if man be all honest and wise law of all kind would be superfluous a legislature would become useless and we authority must cease for want of object to employ it but we find my lord that there be man whom nothing but law and penalty can make supportable to society that there be man who if they be not tell they duty will never know it and who will at last only perform what they shall be punish for neglect be all man like the noble lord whom i be now attempt to answer vigilant to discover sagacious to distinguish and industrious to prosecute the interest of the publick i should be very far from propose that they should be constrain by rule or require to follow any guide but they own reason i should resign my own prosperity and that of my country implicitly into they hand and rest in full security that nothing would be omit that human wisdom could dictate for we advantage i be not persuade you lordship to lay restraint upon virtue and prudence but to consider how seldom virtue and authority be find together how often prudence degenerate into selfishness and all generous regard for the publick be contract into narrow view of private interest i be endeavor to show that since law must be equally obligatory to all it be the interest of the few good man to submit to restraint which though they may sometimes obstruct the influence of they virtue will abundantly recompense they by secure they from the mischief that wickedness reign almost without limit and operate without opposition might bring upon they it may not be improper to add my lord that no degree of human wisdom be exempt from error that he who claim the privilege of act at discretion subject himself likewise to the necessity of answer for the consequence of he conduct and that ill success will at least subject he to reproach and suspicion from which he whose conduct be regulate by established rule may always have a opportunity of set himself free fix and certain regulation be therefore my lord useful to the wisest and best man and to those whose ability be less conspicuous and whose integrity be at best doubtful i suppose it will not be doubt that they be indispensably necessary some of the expedient mention in this bill i shall readily concur with the noble lord in censure and reject i be very far from think it expedient to invest the governor of we colony with any new degree of power or to subject the captain of we ship of war to they command i have live my lord to see many succession of those petty monarch and have know few whom i would willingly trust with the exercise of great authority it be not uncommon my lord for those to be make cruel and capricious by power who be moderate and prudent in lower station and if the effect of exaltation be to be fear even in good man what may not be expect from it in those whom nothing but a distant employment could secure from the law and who if they have not be send to america to govern must probably have go thither on a different occasion the noble duke who have vindicate the bill with argument to which very little can be add and to which i believe nothing can be reply have express he unwillingness to concur in any measure for the execution of which new officer must be appoint a increase of officer my lord be indeed a dreadful sound a sound that can not but forebode the ruin of we country the number of officer already establish be abundantly sufficient for all useful purpose nor can any addition be make but to the ruin of we constitution i be therefore of opinion that no new officer be intend by those that draw up the bill and that they propose only to furnish those that loiter in we port at the expense of the publick with a opportunity of earn they salary by some useful employment i know not indeed my lord whether any good effect can be reasonably hope from this provision whether man accustom to connivance and negligence in affair of less importance ought to be trust with the care of we naval preparation and engage in service on which the prosperity of the publick may depend and can not conceal my apprehension that such man if commission to superintend other may themselves require a superintendent but my lord this and every other clause may in a committee be carefully examine and deliberately correct and since it appear evident to I that some law be necessary for the security of we commerce i think this bill ought not to be reject without farther consideration lord winchelsea rise again and speak thus : -- my lord as the known sincerity of that noble lord allow no room for suspect that he would bestow any praise where he do not believe there be some desert and as he penetration and acuteness secure he from be deceive by any false appearance of merit i can not but applaud myself for have obtain he esteem which i hope will not be forfeit by my future conduct have happily gain the regard of so exact a judge of mankind i be the less solicitous what opinion may be conceive of my ability or intention by those whose censure i less fear and whose praise i less value and shall therefore cheerfully hazard any degree of popularity which i may have hitherto possess by continue my opposition to this bill of which i be still convince that it will produce nothing but embarrassment loss and disgrace the necessity of gain and preserve the esteem of the people i very willingly allow but be of opinion that though it may sometimes be gain by flattering they passion and comply with they importunity by false appearance of relief and momentary alleviation of they grievance it be only to be preserve by real and permanent benefit by a steady attention to the great end of government and a vigorous prosecution of the means by which they may be obtain without regard to present prejudice or temporary clamor i believe my lord it will always be find that it be dangerous to gratify the people at they own expense and to sacrifice they interest to they caprice for i have so high a veneration of they wisdom as to pronounce without scruple that however they may for a time be deceive by artful misrepresentation they will at length learn to esteem those most who have the resolution to promote they happiness in opposition to they prejudice i be therefore confident my lord of regain the popularity which i may lose by declare once more that this bill ought to be reject since no endeavor shall be want to show how little it be necessary by a effectual protection of every part of we trade and a diligent provision for the naval service the duke of bedford rise and speak to this effect : -- my lord i be convince that this bill be very far from be either absurd or useless nor can imagine that they by whom it be draw up could fail of produce some expedient that may deserve consideration it be probable that a farther inquiry may show the propriety of some clause which at present appear most liable to censure and that if we reject this bill thus precipitately we shall condemn what we do not fully comprehend no clause appear to I more unworthy of the judgment and penetration of the merchant than the last nor be there any which i should have reject at the first perusal with less regret yet have take this opportunity of consider it a second time i find it by no means indefensible for the direction of ship station for the defense of we american territory be not commit to the governor alone the council of each province be join with they in authority by whom any private regard may be overborne and who can not be suppose to concur in any direction which will not promote the general interest of the colony i doubt not my lord but other clause have be equally mistaken and therefore think it necessary to consider they in a committee where every lord may declare he sentiment without the restraint of a formal debate and where the bill may be deliberately revise and accommodate more exactly to the present exigency of the nation lord winchelsea speak again in substance as follow : -- my lord the only reason which have be urge for consider this bill in a committee be the necessity of gratify the merchant and of show we concern for the prosperity of commerce if therefore it shall appear that the merchant be indifferent with regard to its success i hope it will be reject without opposition i be this morning my lord inform by a merchant who have many opportunity of acquaint himself with the opinion of the trading part of the nation that they be fully convince of the impossibility of adapt fixed rule to variable exigency or of establish any certain method of obviate the chance of war and defeat enemy who be every day alter they scheme and declare that they have no hope of security but from the vigilance of a board of admiralty solicitous for the welfare of the merchant and the honor of the nation lord cholmondeley rise and speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord as three clause of this bill have be universally give up and almost all the rest plainly prove by the noble lord to be either absurd or superfluous i can not see why it should not be reject without the solemnity of farther consideration to which indeed nothing but the title can give it any claim the title my lord be indeed specious and well fit to the design of gain attention and promote popularity but with this title there be nothing that correspond nor be any thing to be find but confusion and contradiction which grow more numerous upon farther search that the whole bill my lord be unnecessary can not be deny if it be consider that nothing be propose in it which be not already in the power of you lordship who may call at pleasure for the list of the navy the account of the cruiser the duty of they commission and the journal of they commander -lrb- as you do in the sixth of queen anne -rrb- and detect every act of negligence or treachery and every instance of desertion or of cowardice nothing be necessary to the regulation of we naval force but that you lordship vigilantly exert that power which be confer upon you by the constitution and examine the conduct of every officer with attention and impartiality no man then will dare to neglect he duty because no man can hope to escape punishment of this bill therefore since it be thus useless and inconsistent i can not but suspect my lord that it be concerted for purpose very different from those mention in the title which it have indeed no tendency to promote i believe my lord the projector of it intend not so much to advance the interest of the merchant as to depress the reputation of those whom they have long take every opportunity of load with reproach whom they have censure as the enemy of trade the corrupter of the nation and the confederate of spain to confirm these general calumny it be necessary to fix on some particular accusation which might raise the resentment of the people and exasperate they beyond reflection or inquiry for this purpose nothing be more proper than to charge they with betray we merchant to the enemy as no accusation could be more efficacious to inflame the people so none my lord could with more difficulty be confute some loss must be suffer in every war and every one will necessarily produce complaint and discontent every man be willing to blame some other person for he misfortune and it be therefore easy to turn the clamor of those whose vessel fall into the hand of the spaniard against the minister and commander of the ship of war these cry be naturally hear with the regard always pay to misfortune and distress and propagate with zeal because they be hear with pity thus in time what be at first only the outcry of impatience be by malicious artifice improve into settled opinion that opinion be diligently diffuse and all the loss of the merchant be imputed not to the chance of war but the treachery of the ministry but my lord the folly of this opinion however general and the falsehood of this accusation however vehement will become sufficiently apparent if you examine that bulky collection of papers which be now lay before you from which you will discover the number of we fleet the frequency of we convoy the station of we ship of war and the time of they departure and return you will find that no provision for war no expedient likely to promote success have be neglect that we have now more ship equip than in the late war with france that nothing can be add to the exactness with which we maritime force be regulate and that there be not the least reason to doubt of the fidelity with which it have be employ in every war my lord it be to be expect that loss will be suffer by private person on each side nor even in a successful war can the publick always hope to be enriched because the advantage may arise not immediately from capture but consequently from the treaty or condition in which a prosperous war may be suppose to terminate what concession we shall in this war extort from the spaniard what security will be procure for we merchant what recompense will be yield for we loss or what extent will be add to we commerce it can not yet be expect that any man should be able to declare nor will he majesty 's counsellor be require to give a account of futurity it be a sufficient vindication of they conduct and a evident proof of the wisdom with which the war have be conduct that we have hitherto gain more than we have lose this my lord will appear from a diligent and minute comparison of the capture on each side and a exact computation of the value of we loss and we prize it will be find that if the spaniard have take as it be not improbable a greater number of ship those which they have lose have be far more wealthy the merchant indeed seem to have distrust the strength of the evidence which they produce in support of they allegation by bring it only before the other house where as a oath could not be administer every man deliver what he believe as what he know and indulge himself without scruple in vent he resentment or declare he suspicion a method of allegation very proper to scatter reproach and gratify malevolence but of very little use for the discovery of truth have they come before you lordship every circumstance have be minutely examine every assertion compare with other evidence all exaggeration repress and all foreign consideration reject each part would have be impartially hear and it would have plainly be know to whom every loss be to be imputed the negligence or treachery of the commander of the convoy wherever it have be find would have be punish but they would not have charge they with those miscarriage which be produce only by the obstinacy or inattention of the master of the trading vessel such inquiry my lord they appear to have think it they interest to decline and therefore do not proceed on they petition to this house and if they do in reality avoid a rigorous examination what can be infer but that they intend rather to offer insinuation than proof and rather to scatter infamy than obtain justice and that nothing be indeed omit that could secure we own commerce or distress we enemy may reasonably be collect from the number and great strength of we fleet to which no empire in the world can oppose a equal force if it have not be supply with sailor without some delay and if these delay have give we enemy a opportunity of add to they security of fortify they port and supply they magazine it must be ascribe to the nature of we constitution that forbid all compulsory method of augment we force which must be consider as perhaps the only inconvenience to be throw into the balance against the blessing of liberty the difficulty of man we ship of war be indeed extremely perplexing man be naturally very little inclined to subject themselves to absolute command or to engage in any service without a time limited for they dismission man can not willingly rush into danger without the prospect of a large advantage they have generally some fondness for they present state of life and do not quit it without reluctance all these reason my lord concur to withhold the sailor from the navy in which they be necessarily govern with higher authority than in trading vessel in which they be subject to punishment and confine by strict regulation without any certain term of they bondage for such they who know not the necessity of subordination nor discover the advantage of discipline can not but account subjection to the will and order of another by serve the merchant they not only secure to themselves the liberty of change they master at pleasure but enjoy the prospect of a near and certain advantage they have not indeed any expectation of be suddenly enrich by a plate ship and of gain by one engagement such wealth as will enable they to spend the rest of they life in ease and affluence but they be sure of a speedy payment of they wages perhaps of some profit from petty commerce and of a opportunity of squander they at land in jollity and diversion they labor be cheerful because they know it will be short and they readily enter into a employment which they can quit when it shall no longer please they these consideration my lord have no influence upon the preparation of france and spain where no man be master of he own fortune or time or life and where the officer of the state can drive multitude into the service of the crown without regard to they private view inclination or engagement to man a fleet nothing be necessary but to lay a embargo on the trading vessel and suspend they commerce for a short time therefore no man dare refuse to enter into the publick service when he be summon nor if he should fly as we sailor from a impress would any man venture to shelter or conceal he absolute monarch have therefore this advantage over we that they can be sooner prepared for war and to this must be ascribe all the success which the spaniard have obtain this my lord will not be obviate by the bill now before we nor will it indeed procure any other benefit to the trade or any addition to the power of the nation of the ten clause comprise in the bill the greatest part be universally allow to be injudiciously and erroneously propose and those few which be think of more importance have be show to contain no new expedient nor to add any thing to the present regulation i can not therefore discover any reason my lord that should induce we to refer to a committee this bill of which part be confessedly to be reject and the rest be apparently superfluous -lrb- then the question be put whether the bill should be refer to a committee it pass in the negative content 25 not content 59 on the rejection of this bill by the lord a bill which related to a affair of no less importance than the security of trade and navigation and which have be unanimously pass by the common it be satirically remark that the upper house understand trade and navigation _ better _ than the lower however the circumstance that attend it make the publication of the bill with the amendment and the reason offer by the lord on both side expect with the more impatience -rrb- house of lord November 16 1742 parliament have meet accord to the royal summons on this day he majesty make a speech from the throne which be afterwards read by the president lord tweedale rise and speak as follow : my lord it be not without the highest satisfaction that every lover of mankind must look upon the alteration that have lately be produce in the state of europe nor can any briton forbear to express a immediate and particular pleasure to observe he country rise again into its former dignity to see he own nation shake off dependence and rouse from inactivity cover the ocean with she fleet and awe the continent with she army bid once more defiance to the rapacious invader of neighbouring kingdom and the daring projector of universal dominion once more exert she influence in foreign court and summon the monarch of the west to another confederacy against the power of france the queen of hungary who be lately oblige to retire at the approach of she enemy to leave she capital in danger of a siege and seek shelter in the remotest corner of she dominion who be lately so harass with invasion and so encircle with danger that she could scarcely fly from one ravager without the hazard of fall into the hand of another be now able to give law to she persecutor to return the violence which she have suffer and instead of implore mercy from those who have no regard but to they own interest and be determine to annihilate she family and divide she dominion now sit in full security on she throne direct the march of distant army and dictate the term on which those who have enter she dominion shall be suffer to escape such my lord be the present state of the german empire nor have the affair of the rest of europe be less change the power of the house of bourbon have be diminish on every side its alliance have be reject and its influence disregard the king of sardinium have openly engage to hinder the spaniard from erect a new kingdom in italy and though he have hitherto be somewhat embarrassed in he measure and oppress by the superiority of he enemy have at least by prevent the conjunction of the spanish army preserve the austrian from be overwhelm nor can the situation of he dominion and the number of he force suffer we to doubt that in a short time he will be able entirely to secure italy since he have already recover he country and drive back the spaniard into the bosom of france the condition of the other spanish army be such as no enemy can wish to be aggravate by new calamity they be shut up in a country without provision or of which the inhabitant be unwilling to supply they : on one side be neutral state to which the law of nation bar they entrance on another the mediterranean sea which can afford they only the melancholy prospect of hostile armament or sometimes of they own ship fall into the hand of the briton behind they be the troops of austrium ready to embarrass they march intercept they convoy and receive those whom famine and despair incite to change they master and to seek among foreign nation that ease and safety of which the tyranny of they own government and the madness of they own leader have deprive they such be they distress and so great they diminution that a few month must complete they ruin they must be destroy without the honor of a battle they must sink under the fatigue of hungry march by which no enemy be overtake or escape and be at length devour by those disease which toil and penury will inevitably produce that the diminution of the influence of the house of bourbon be not a empty opinion which we easily receive because we wish it to be true that other nation likewise see the same event with the same sentiment and prognosticate the decline of that power which have so long intimidate the universe appear from the declaration now make by he majesty of the conduct of the swedish court that nation which be lately govern by the counsel and glut with the bounty of france which watch the nod of she mighty patroness and make war at she command against the russian empire now begin to discover that there be other power more worthy of confidence and respect more careful to observe they engagement or more able to fulfil they she therefore request the british monarch to extricate she from those difficulty in which she be entangled by a blind compliance with french dictate to restore to she the dismembered province and recall that enemy which now impend over she capital and whom the french have neither interest to appease nor strength to resist such my lord be the present prospect which offer itself to he who survey europe with a political view and examine the present interest and disposition of neighbouring potentate such be the order which have be produce from general confusion and such the reestablishment of equal power which have succeed these concussion of the world it be no small addition to the pleasure which this change must afford every man who have either wisdom to discover he own happiness or benevolence to rejoice in that of other that it have be the effect not of chance but of conduct that it be not a unforeseen event produce by the secret operation of cause fortuitously concur but the result of a political and just design well concerted and steadily pursue that every advantage which have be gain be the consequence of measure lay to obtain it that we happiness have be procure by prudence and that we counsel have not be lucky but wise if we reflect my lord upon the cause which have contribute to the rescue of europe from impend slavery which have reestablish the queen of hungary in she dominion enable she to lay waste the territory of she invader confirm she friend in they fidelity and intimidate those whom rival interest incline to wish she fall or the hope of share in the plunder have incite to form design against she if we inquire to what it be to be ascribe that she be able to form new alliance and defend she dominion with confederate army we shall find it easy to trace all these revolution to one cause the steady and prudent conduct of the king of britain we sovereign my lord have look on the trouble of europe with that concern which publick virtue inspire he have see the suffering of this illustrious princess with that compassion which be always due to magnanimity oppressed and form resolution for she assistance with that ardor which courage naturally kindle but with that caution likewise and secrecy which experience dictate but he remember my lord that though he be the friend of the queen of hungary he be to consider himself as the father of the people of britain that he be not to exhaust the force of this nation in romantick expedition or exhaust its treasure in give assistance which be not need he therefore wait to observe the event of the war and to discover whether the incessant struggle of the austrian would be able to throw off the load with which they be oppress but he find that they spirit however ardent could not supply the want of strength he find that they be faint under insuperable labor and that though they be in no danger of be conquer by the valor of they enemy they must in a short time be weary with they number he majesty then know my lord that by send they speedy assistance he at once promote the interest of he people and gratify he own inclination he therefore supply the queen with such sum as enable she to levy new force and drive she enemy before she by procure a reconciliation with the king of prussium he free she from the nearest and most formidable danger and give she a opportunity to secure herself against the menace of other power but though she be set free from domestick danger though invasion be drive from she capital though captivity no longer pursue she flight nor usurpation hover over she throne she more distant dominion be still a prey to she enemy the spaniard have already land one army in italy with which another be hasten to join the success of this enterprise which would have gain the greatest part of italy could only be hinder by the king of sardinium who be therefore solicit by the spaniard and french to favor they design with the strongest protestation and the most magnificent promise but these be overbalance by the influence of the king of britain whose name be of sufficient importance to make the weaker part most eligible and to counterbalance the force of immediate interest thus be the passage into italy bar against the spaniard by obstacle which they can never surmount while the other army be besiege by we fleet and by the austrian and reduce instead of conquer kingdom to change they camp and regulate they march with no other view than to avoid famine while that prince whose dominion might most commodiously afford they succor and whom all the tie of nature and of interest oblige to assist they be awed by the british ship of war which lie at anchor before he metropolis and of which the commander upon the least suspicion of hostility against the queen of hungary threaten to batter he palace and destroy he city in this manner my lord have the king of britain assist the house of austrium with he treasure he influence and he navy thus do he subdue some enemy and restrain other thus do he hold the balance of the war and thus do he add the weight of power to the scale of justice but to secure the success that have be already obtain and to take from the enemy of liberty all hope of recover the advantage which they have lose he have now no longer confine he assistance to negotiation and pecuniary supplies he know that alliance be always best observe when they confer security or produce manifest advantage and that money will not be always equivalent to army he have therefore now act openly in defense of he ally have fill flander once more with british troops and garrison the frontier town with the force of that nation by which they be gain the veteran now see once more the plain over which he formerly pursue the squadron of france point the place where he seize the standard or break the line where he trample the oppressor of mankind with that spirit which be enkindle by liberty and justice he heart now beat once more at the sight of those wall which he formerly storm and he show the wound which he receive in the mine or on the breach the french now discover that they be not yet lord of the continent and that britain have other army ready to force once more the pass of schellembourg or break down the intrenchment of blenheim to wrest from they the sceptre of universal monarchy and confine they again to they own dominion to the british regiment he majesty have join a large body of the force of he own electorate without regard to the danger which may threaten he dominion in the absence of he troops have no other view than to secure the publick tranquillity at whatever hazard of he own and be convince that private interest be most effectually secure by a steady attention to general good these measure my lord undoubtedly demand we gratitude and applause gratitude be always due to favourable intention and diligent endeavor even when those intention be frustrated and those endeavor defeat and applause be often pay to success when it have be merely the effect of chance and be produce by measure ill adapt to the end which be intend by they but surely when just design have be happily execute when wise measure be bless with success neither envy nor hatred will dare to refuse they acclamation surely those will at least congratulate whom the corruption of they heart hinder from rejoice and those who can not love will at least commend here my lord i suspect no inclination to depreciate the happiness that we enjoy or to calumniate that virtue by which it have be obtain and therefore doubt not but you lordship will readily concur in the reasonable motion which i have now to offer : -- that a humble address be present to he majesty to return he the thanks of this house for he most gracious speech from the throne to declare we just sense of he majesty 's great care and vigilance for the support of the house of austrium and for restore and secure the balance of power to acknowledge he majesty 's great wisdom and attention to the publick welfare in send so considerable a body of he force into the low country and in strengthen they with he electoral troops and the hessian in the british pay and thereby form such a army as may defend and encourage those power who be well intentioned and give a real assistance to the queen of hungary and to assure he majesty of the concurrence and support of this house in this necessary measure to express we satisfaction in the good effect which the vigor exert by great britain in assist its ancient ally and maintain the liberty of europe have already have on the affair of the queen of hungary and on the conduct of several power and we hope that a steady perseverance in the same measure will inspire the like spirit and resolution in other power equally engage by treaty and common interest to take the like part to give he majesty the strongest assurance that this house have the honor and safety of he majesty the true interest and prosperity of he kingdom the security and advancement of they commerce the success of the war against spain and the reestablishment of the balance and tranquillity of europe entirely at heart that these shall be the great and constant object of we proceedings and resolution this house be determine to support he majesty in all just and necessary measure for attain those great and desirable end and to stand by and defend he majesty against all he enemy lord montfort speak next to the following effect : -- my lord the motion offer by the noble lord be in my opinion so proper and just so suitable to the dignity of this assembly and so expressive of the gratitude which the vigilance of he majesty for the publick good ought to kindle in every heart not chill by ungenerous indolence or harden by inveterate disaffection that i can not discover any reason for which it can be oppose and therefore hope that every lord will concur in it with no less alacrity and zeal than i now rise up to second it it may indeed naturally be hope from this house that he majesty 's measure will be readily approve since they be such as even malice and faction will not dare to censure or oppose such as calumny will not venture to defame and such as those who will not praise they can never mention if it be allow that the interest of france be opposite to that of britain that the equipoise of power on the continent be to be preserve if any of the counsel of we ancestor deserve we attention if we victory at cressy or at ramilly be justly celebrate by we historian the wisdom of we sovereign 's conduct can not be deny the french my lord whom we army in the reign of anne see fly before they who from divide kingdom and prescribe law to mankind be reduce to the defense of they own country who be drive from intrenchment to intrenchment and from one fortification to another now grow insolent with the pleasure of peace and the affluence of commerce have forget the power by which they scheme be baffle and they arrogance repress by which they fabrick of universal monarchy be shatter and themselves almost bury in the ruin infatuate with the contemplation of they own force elate with the number of they troops the magnificence of they city and the opulence of they treasury they have once more imagine themselves superior to resistance and again aspire to the command of the universe they have now for some time assume the haughty style of the legislator of mankind and have expect that prince should appeal to they as to the highest human tribunal and that nation should submit they claim to they arbitration they have already assume the distribution of dominion and expect that neither peace shall be conclude nor war proclaim but by they permission or advice by this gradation of exorbitant claim and oppressive measure have they at length arrive my lord at the summit of insolence by these step have they ascend once more the tower throne of universal monarchy nor be any thing want to complete they plan but that they ancient rival the german empire should be reduce to acknowledge they sovereignty and that the supreme dignity of europe should be the gift of the french bounty the death of the late emperor without son furnish they with a opportunity of execute they design too favourable to be neglect they now imagine it in they power not only to dispose of the imperial dignity but to divide the dominion of the house of austrium into many petty sovereignty incapable singly of oppose they and unlikely to unite in any common cause or to preserve a confederacy unbroken if they should by accident agree to form it they therefore send they army into germany to superintend the approach election and by hover over the territory of prince unable to resist they extort voice in favor of they ally a prince whose dominion must by they situation always oblige he to compliance with the demand and to concurrence in the scheme of he protector and who will rather act as the substitute of france than the emperor of germany but it be to no purpose that they have grace they dependant with titular honor and ensign of sovereignty if the house of austrium still retain its hereditary dominion and preserve its strength when it have lose its dignity they well know that army be equally formidable whether command by a emperor or a inferior sovereign and that a mere alteration of name though it might afford a slight and transient gratification to vanity would produce no real increase or diminution of power they therefore think it necessary to improve the present time of confusion and excite all the prince of the empire to revive they ancient claim upon the austrian territory claim which how long soever they have be forget howsoever abrogate by long prescription or annul by subsequent treaty be now again to become valid and to be decide by the arbitration of france but this project be defeat by the heroick constancy of the queen of hungary whose wisdom and resolution which will equal she name in future history with those of the most successful conqueror reject they mediation and refuse to own she right doubtful by submit it to be try they be oblige no longer to dissemble they design or make farther pretence to respect or tenderness she fall be necessary to they own exaltation they therefore kindle a general conflagration of war they excite all the prince to take arm against she and find it indeed no difficult task to persuade they to attack a princess whom they think unable to form a army whom they believe they should rather pursue than engage and whose dominion might be overrun without bloodshed and whom they should conquer only by march against such a combination as this a combination of monarch of which each appear able singly to have carry on a war against she nothing but the highest degree of magnanimity could have form a design of resist nor could that resistance have procure the least advantage or retard for a single day the calamity that be threaten have it not be regulate by every martial virtue have not policy unite with courage and caution with activity thus do the intrepidity of this princess my lord support she against the storm that shake she kingdom on every side thus do those whom she virtue gain over to she service and whom she example animated with contempt of superior number defend she against the force of all the surround nation lead on by monarch and elate with the prospect of a easy conquest but the utmost that could be hope from the most refined stratagem or the most exalted courage be only that she fate might be defer that she would not fall wholly unrevenged that she enemy would suffer with she and that victory would not be gain without a battle it be evident that bravery must in time give way to strength that vigor must be wearied and policy exhaust that by a constant succession of new force the most resolute troops must be overwhelm and that the house of austrium could only gain by the war the fatal honor of be gloriously extinguish this he majesty 's wisdom easily enable he to discover and he goodness incite he to prevent he call upon all the power who have promise to preserve the pragmatick sanction to have regard to the faith of nation and by fulfil they engagement to preserve the liberty of europe but the success of he remonstrance only afford a new instance of the weakness of justice when oppose to interest or fear all the potentate of the continent be restrain by the threat or gain by the promise of france and the disposal of the possession of the austrian house seem by the general consent of europe to be resign to the family of bourbon but we sovereign be not yet discourage from assert the rights which he have promise to maintain nor do he think the neglect or treachery of other a sufficient reason for refuse that assistance which justice and policy equally require he know the power of he own empire and though he do not omit to cultivate alliance he be conscious of he ability to proceed without they and therefore show by send he troops into the austrian territory that the measure of the sovereign of britain be not to be regulate by either he enemy or he confederate that this nation be yet able to support its own claim and protect those of its ally and that while we attack one of the kingdom of the house of bourbon we be not afraid to set the other at defiance the effect of this conduct my lord be immediately apparent the king of sardinium engage to oppose the entrance of the spaniard into italy the king of prussium not only make a peace with the queen of hungary by whom he be more to be dread than any other enemy but enter into a alliance with he majesty who have make no small addition to he influence by another treaty with the most powerful nation of the north thus my lord be the dreadful arm of france which be never employ but in the detestable and horrid plan of extend slavery and support oppression stop in the full career of success thus be the scheme of universal monarchy once more blast and the world teach that the preservation of the rights of mankind the security of religion and the establishment of peace be not impracticable that the power of britain be yet undiminished and that she spirit be not yet depress by he majesty 's conduct my lord the reputation of we country be now raise to its utmost height we be now consider as the arbiter of empire the protector of right the patron of distress and the sustainer of the balance of the world i can not therefore but conclude that no man in this illustrious assembly will be unwilling to acknowledge that wisdom and firmness which not only this nation but the greatest part of the universe will remember with gratitude in the remotest age and that the motion which i now second will be universally approve the speaker then read the motion and ask in the usual form whether it be they lordship ' pleasure that the question should be put upon which lord chesterfield rise up and speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord though the motion have be by the noble lord who make it introduce with all the art of rhetorick and enforce by he that second it with the utmost ardor of zeal and the highest rapture of satisfaction and gratitude though all the late measure have be recommend to we applause as proof of the strictest fidelity and the most sagacious policy and though i be very far from intend to charge they with weakness or injustice or from pretend to have discover in they a secret tendency to advance any interest in opposition to that of britain i be yet not able to prevail upon myself to suppress those scruple which hinder I from concur with they and from approve the address which be now propose i be less inclined my lord to favor the present motion because i have long be desirous of see the ancient method of general address revive by this house a method of address by which we prince be reverence without flattery and which leave we at liberty to honor the crown without descend to idolize the ministry i know not my lord what advantage have be procure by a annual repetition of the speech from the throne however gracious or excellent for ourselves we have certainly obtain no new confidence from the crown nor any higher degree of honor among the people the incense which from we censer have so long perfumed the palace have incline the nation to suspect that we be long enough inure to idolatry to offer up they property for a sacrifice whenever they shall be require and i can not dissemble my suspicion that a long continuance of this custom may give some ambitious or oppressive prince in some distant age when perhaps this beneficent and illustrious family may be extinct the confidence to demand it i can not but be of opinion and hope you lordship will be convince upon very short reflection that there be a style of servility which it become not this house to use even to we monarch : we be to remember indeed that reverence which be always due from subject but to preserve likewise that dignity which be inseparable from independence and legislative authority that we ought not to descend to the meanest of flattery that we ought to preserve the privilege of speak without exaggerated praise or affect acknowledgment we regard not only to ourselves but to we sovereign ought to remind we for nothing be more evident my lord than that no monarch can be happy while he people be miserable that the throne can be secure only by be guard by the affection of the people and the prince can only gain and preserve they affection by promote they interest and support they privilege but how my lord shall that monarch distinguish the interest of he people whom none shall dare to approach with information how shall they privilege be support if when they be infringe no man will complain and who shall dare to lay any publick grievance or private wrong before the king of britain if the highest assembly of the nation shall never address he but in term of flattery the necessity of put a end to this corrupt custom become every day more and more urgent the affair of europe be hasten to a crisis in which all we prudence and all we influence will be require and we ought therefore to take care not to perplex we resolution by voluntary ignorance or destroy we credit by a publick approbation of measure which we be well know not to understand i suppose none of you lordship who be not engage in the administration of affair will think it derogatory from the reputation of you ability and experience to confess that you do not yet see all the circumstance or consequence of the measure which you be desire to applaud measure which have be too lately take to discover they own tendency and with relation to which no papers have be lay before we we be tell of army join and treaty conclude and therefore call upon to praise the wisdom of we negotiation and the usefulness and vigor of we military preparation though we be neither acquaint on what term we alliance be form nor on what condition we auxiliary assist we this my lord be surely such treatment as no liberal mind can very patiently support it be little less than to require that we should follow we guide with we eye shut that we should place implicit confidence in the wisdom of we minister and have first suffer they to blind ourselves assist they afterwards to blind the people the longer i dwell upon the consideration of this motion the more argument arise to persuade I that we ought not hastily to agree to it my lord the address propose like the speech itself be of a very complicated and intricate kind and comprise in a few word many transaction of great importance crowd together with a artful brevity that the mind may be hinder by the multitude of image from a distinct and deliberate consideration of particulars here be act of negotiation confound with operation of war one treaty entangled with another and the union of the hanoverian with we troops mention almost in the same sentence with the spanish war this crowd of transaction so different in they nature so various in they consequence who can venture to approve in the gross or who can distinguish without long examination i hope my lord that i shall not be charge with want of candor in suppose the motion not to be a extemporaneous composition but to be draw up with art and deliberation it be well know that the address be often concerted at the same time that the speech be compose and that it be not uncommon to take advantage of the superiority which long acquaintance with the question give those who defend the motion above those who oppose it we be indeed tell that the visible effect of he majesty 's measure prove they expediency and that we may safely applaud that conduct of which we receive the benefit but my lord the advantage must be see or feel before they can be properly acknowledge and it have not be show that we have yet either intimidate the enemy of the queen of hungary whose interest we have be lately teach to believe inseparable from we own or encouraged any new ally to declare in she favor the dutch my lord be not yet rouse from they slumber of neutrality and how loudly soever we may assert we zeal or with whatever pomp we may display we strength they still seem to doubt either we integrity or force and be afraid of engage in the quarrel lest they should be either conquer or betray nor have the approach of we army however they may be delighted with the show inspire they with more courage though they be enforce by the troops of hanover the addition of these force to the british army have be mention as a instance of uncommon attention to the great cause of universal liberty as a proof that no regard have be pay to private interest and that all consideration be sacrifice to publick good but since no service can be so great but it may be overpay it be necessary that we may judge of the benefit to inform we on what term it have be obtain and how well the act of succession have be observe on this occasion though i be too well acquaint my lord with the maxim which prevail in the present age and have have too much experience of the motive by which the decision of the senate be influence to offer any motion of my own yet these reason will withhold I from concur with this i can not but be of opinion that the question ought to be postpone to another day in which the house may be fuller we deliberation be assist by the wisdom and experience of more than thirty lord who be now absent and the subject of inquiry of which many be new and unexpected may be more accurately consider nor can i prevail upon myself to return to general declaration any other than general answer lord carteret answer in substance as follow : -- my lord as there have arise no new question as he majesty in assist the queen of hungary have only follow the advice of the senate i be far from be able to discover why any long deliberation should be necessary to a concurrence with the motion now before we or whence any doubt can arise with regard to the effect of he majesty 's measure effect which no man will deny who will believe either he own eye or the testimony of other effect which every man who survey the state of europe must perceive and which we friend and we enemy will equally confess to these measure which we be now to consider it must be ascribe that the french be no longer lord of germany that they no longer hold the prince of the empire in subjection lay province waste at pleasure and sell they friendship on they own term by these measure have the dutch be deliver from they terror and encourage to deliberate freely upon the state of europe and prepare for the support of the pragmatick sanction but the common cause have be most evidently advance by gain the king of prussium by whose defection the balance of the war be turn and at least thirty thousand man take away from the scale of france this my lord be a change only to be effect by a patient expectation of opportunity and a politick improvement of casual advantage and by contrive method of reconcile the interest of prussium with the friendship of the queen of hungary for prince like other man be incline to prefer they own interest to all other motive and to follow that scheme which shall promise most gain that all this my lord have be effect can not be deny nor can it be say to have be effect by any other cause than the conduct of britain : have this nation look either with cowardly despair or negligent inactivity on the rise power of france and the trouble of the continent have the distribution of empire be leave to chance we thought confine wholly to commerce and we prospects not extend beyond we own island the liberty of europe have be at a end the french have establish themselves in the secure possession of universal monarchy would henceforth have set mankind at defiance and wanton without fear in oppression and insolence these my lord be consequence of the measure pursue by he majesty of which neither the reality nor the importance can be question and therefore they may doubtless be approve without hesitation for surely my lord the addition of the hanoverian troops to the force of we own nation can raise no scruple nor be represent as any violation of the act of settlement of the meaning of that memorable act i believe i do not need any information i know it be provide that this nation shall not be engage in war in the quarrel of hanover but i see no trace of a reciprocal obligation nor can discover any clause by which we be forbid to make use in we own cause of the alliance of hanover or by which the hanoverian be forbid to assist we i hope my lord this representation of the state of we transaction with hanover will not be charge with artifice or sophistry i know how invidious a task be undertake by he who attempt to show any connexion between interest so generally think opposite and be support in this apology only by the consciousness of integrity and the intrepidity of truth the assistance of hanover my lord be at this time apparently necessary we own troops join with the hessian compose a body too small to make any efficacious opposition to the design of france but by the addition of sixteen thousand man become sufficiently formidable to oblige she to employ those troops for the security of she frontier with which she intend to have overwhelm italy and to have exalt another spanish prince to a new kingdom the spaniard deprive of this assistance harass by the austrian with perpetual alarm and debar by we fleet from the supplies which be provide for they in they own country must languish with penury and hardship be equally cut off from succor and from flight thus my lord it be evident that the true and everlasting interest of britain have be steadily pursue that the measure form to promote it have be not only prudent but successful we do not engage sooner in the quarrel because we be not able to form a army sufficiently powerful a advantageous peace be only to be obtain by vigorous preparation for war nor be it to be expect that we enemy should court we friendship till they see that we opposition be really formidable such my lord be we present state we may reasonably hope that the french will desist from they design because they will have a confederacy to oppose more powerful than that by which they immortal monarch be lately humble and i hope that conduct will always be applaud in this house which enable we to repress the arrogance of france lord westmoreland then speak to the follow purport : -- my lord though the warmth with which the noble lord have defend the motion and the confidence with which he assert the propriety and efficacy of the measure to which it relate be such proof of the strength of he conviction as leave no room to doubt he sincerity yet as the same argument do not operate upon different mind with the same force i hope i shall not be think less sincere or less studious of the publick happiness or the honor of the crown though i presume to differ from he in the motion now before we i can not concur because though it should be allow to contain a just representation of foreign affair yet it appear to I to omit those consideration which i think it the duty of this house to offer to he majesty this nation be in my opinion expose to enemy more formidable than the french nor do i think that we be at leisure to defend the liberty of europe till we have make some provision for the security of we own or to regulate the balance of power till we have restore we constitution to its ancient equilibrium that there be flagrant proof of the most enormous corruption throughout the whole subordination of publick office that we publick fund be only nursery of fraud and that trust of every kind be only consider as a opportunity of plunder appear evidently from the universal prevalence of luxury and extravagance from the sudden affluence of private man from the wanton riot of they table the regal splendor of they equipage and the ostentatious magnificence of they building it be evident likewise that corruption be not confine to publick office that those who have lose they own integrity have endeavor to destroy the virtue of other that attempt have be make to subject the whole nation to the influence of corruption and to spread the contagion of bribery from the highest to the lowest class of the people it be therefore necessary before we engage in the consideration of foreign affair to prosecute the inquiry which be begin in the last session to trace wickedness to its source and drag the author of we misery into the light these my lord be the inquiry which the general voice of the people importunately demand these be the petition which ought never to be reject all party be now unite and all animosity extinguish nor be there any other clamor than for inquiry and punishment the other house my lord have be engage in the laudable attempt to detect those who have betray or plunder or corrupt they country and surely we ought to have so much regard to we own honor as not to suffer they to toil alone in a design so popular so just and so necessary while we amuse ourselves with applaud the sagacity of we minister who whatever they may hope themselves or promise other have not yet prevail on any foreign power to concur with they or to interpose in the affair of the continent and therefore i can not conceal my suspicion that instead of furnish any subject for panegyrick on we policy and caution we be now waste we treasure and we strength in a romantick expedition since therefore my lord we domestick evil seem to I most dangerous i move that in order to they speedy remedy and that the people may see we do not forget they immediate interest this addition be make to the motion now before we : and humbly to assure he majesty that we will apply we constant and persevere endeavor to calm and heal animosity and division unseasonable as they be at all time and most pernicious in the present juncture which the true fatherly tenderness of he majesty out of the abundance of he constant care for the rights and liberty of he people have so affectionately at the close of last session recommend from the throne by search thoroughly and effectually into the grounds which be or may be assign for publick discontent agreeably to the ancient rule and method of parliament this additional clause be deliver in write to the speaker he read it to the house but say that the noble lord speak so low that he could not tell where he propose to have it insert lord westmoreland then direct he to read the motion which do he desire that he clause might be add at the end upon this lord raymond speak as follow : -- my lord the addition which the noble lord have offer to the address propose can not in my opinion be properly admit as it have no relation to the precede clause but be rather inconsistent with they nor do i think it only improper with regard to the other part of the motion but unnecessary in itself since it have no reference to he majesty 's speech now under we consideration since it will facilitate none of we inquiry which may be carry on with equal vigor without any such unseasonable declaration of we design if therefore the motion for the amendment be not withdraw i shall move that the first question be first put -lrb- the question be then put with regard to the first motion and it pass in the affirmative without any division -rrb- house of common December 10 1742 motion in the committee of supplies for grant pay for sixteen thousand hanoverian troops for the four month last past sir william yonge open the debate and speak in substance as follow : -- sir though the general state of the kingdom of europe can not be suppose to be wholly unknown in this assembly yet since the decision of the question now before we must depend upon the conception which every man have form with regard to the affair on the continent it will be necessary to exhibit they to view in a narrow compass that nothing which may contribute to we information may be overlook or forget the late emperor for some time before he death finding that there remain little hope of male issue and that he family would be consequently in danger of lose part of the honor and dignity which it have so long enjoy turn he thought to the security of he hereditary dominion which he entail upon he eldest daughter to preserve they from be break into fragment and divide among the numerous pretender to they and that this settlement might be preserve from violation employ all the opportunity which any extraordinary conjuncture present to he of obtain the concurrence and ratification of the neighbouring state as it be always the interest of this nation to support the house of austrium as a counterbalance to the power of france it be easy to procure from we a solemn accession to this important settlement and we therefore promise to support it whenever it should be attack this be in reality only a promise to be watchful for we own advantage and to hinder that increase of the french influence which must at length be fatal to ourselves the like engagement be propose to many other power which proposal be by most of they accept and among other by france upon consideration of a very large increase of she dominion and it be hope that whatever might be determine by the elector with respect to the imperial dignity the hereditary dominion to the house of austrium would remain in the same family and that france would be hinder by she own engagement from disturb the peace of the empire but no sooner do the death of the emperor give the enemy of the house of austrium hope of gratify without danger they resentment and ambition than almost all the neighbouring prince begin to revive they pretension and appear resolve to recover by force what they allege to have be only by force withhold from they army be raise on all side invasion either attempt or threaten from every quarter and the whole world look upon the daughter of austrium either with pity or with joy as unable to make any stand against the general confederacy and under a necessity of yield to the most oppressive term and purchase peace from she enemy at they own price it can not be mention without indignation that this universal combination be form and conduct by the influence of the french who after have agree to the pragmatick sanction omit no endeavor to promote the violation of it and not only incite the neighbouring prince to assert they claim by promise of assistance but pour numerous army into the empire not only to procure by force and without the least regard to equity a election in favor of the duke of bavarium but to assist he in the invasion of the austrian dominion of which the settlement have be ratify by they concurrence purchase at a price which might justly have be think too great even though they have observe they stipulation the plea which they advance in vindication of they conduct it be not necessary to relate since however artfully they may be form the common sense of mankind must perceive they to be false it be to no purpose that they declare themselves not to have recede from they promise because they enter the empire only as auxiliary and they troops act under the command of the elector of bavarium since he that furnish troops for the invasion of those territory which he be oblige to protect may very justly be consider as a invader as he who assist a thief partake the guilt of theft all contract sir whether between state or private person be to be understand accord to the known intention of the two party and i suppose it will not be pretend by the most hardened advocate for the conduct of the french that the late emperor would have purchase at so dear a rate they accession to the pragmatick sanction if he have suppose that they still think themselves at liberty to employ all they treasure and they force in assist other to violate it it be well know that a unsuccessful war which the french be likewise suspect of assist have a short time before the death of the emperor weaken he force and exhaust he revenue and that therefore when he be surprise by death he leave he family impoverished and defenceless so that he daughter be without money or army and press by enemy on every side of she dominion be immediately reduce to such distress as perhaps she only be able to support and such difficulty as no other would have entertain the least hope of be able to surmount in the first crush of she calamity when she be drive by the torrent of invasion from fortress to fortress and from kingdom to kingdom it be not to be deny that most of the guarantee of the pragmatick sanction stand at gaze without attempt that relief which she incessantly call upon they to afford she and which indeed they could deny upon no other pretence than that they be convince it would be ineffectual that she ruin be not to be prevent and that she must be swallow up by the deluge of war which it appear impossible to resist or to divert the queen however determine to assert she rights and to defend she dominion and therefore assemble she force and make such opposition that some of she enemy find the war to which they be encourage only by a belief of the certainty of success likely to become more hazardous than they expect soon desist from they claim and consent to peace upon moderate condition and the most formidable of she enemy be alienate from the french by experience of they treachery and perhaps intimidate by the bravery of he enemy be at last willing to become neutral and to be satisfy with the recovery of he own claim without assist the elector of bavarium thus far have this illustrious princess struggle in the tempest of the continent with very little assistance from she confederate but it can not be suppose that these violent effort have not exhaust she strength or that she must not be at length overpower by the army which the french enraged at the disappointment of they scheme be send against she she have a incontestable claim to we assistance promise by the most solemn stipulation and therefore not to be withhold upon any view of present advantage the prudence and magnanimity which she have discover prove that she deserve to be support upon the common principle of generosity which would not suffer a brave man to look idly upon a heroine struggle with multitude and the opposition which she have be able to make alone show that assistance will not be vain these consideration though since the senate have determine to assist she they be not immediately necessary in a question which relate only to the manner in which that assistance shall be give be yet not entirely useless since they may contribute to overbalance any prejudice that may obstruct the scheme which have be form and quicken the endeavor of man who might be incline to reject those counsel to which any specious objection shall be raise or to lose that time in deliberation which ought to be employ in action as the assistance of this distressed princess have be already vote by the senate it be now no longer to be inquire what advantage can be gain to this nation by protect she or whether the benefit of victory will be equivalent to the hazard of war these question be already determine it have already appear necessary to this house to restore the balance of power by preserve the house of austrium and the only question therefore that remain be by what mean we shall endeavor to preserve it and whether the means that have already be use deserve we approbation among the several scheme that be propose for this end it appear most proper to the ministry to form a army in the low country whence they might be ready to march wherever they presence might be require and where they might be easily supply with necessaries this army be to be raise with expedition the affair of the queen of hungary could admit of no delay auxiliary troops be therefore to be hire and it appear to they more proper to hire the troops of hanover than of any other nation that the affair of the queen of hungary would admit of no delay and that therefore the army in the low country be very speedily to be form can not be doubt by any one that compare she power with that of the nation against which she be contend a nation incite by a long train of success to aspire to universal monarchy a nation which have long be assemble army and accumulate treasure in order to give law to the rest of the world which have for many year stand against the unite force of all the border power and to which the house of austrium be not equal in its full strength much less when its treasure have be exhaust and its troops destroy in a unfortunate war before the death of the emperor and when almost every part of its dominion be threaten by a particular power and the troops of each province be employ in the defense of they own town so that no great army could be collect because no place could be leave without defender such be the state of the austrian dominion when the troops of france break in upon they and in this state it must readily be acknowledge that neither courage nor prudence could procure success that no stratagem could long divert nor any resistance repel such superiority of power and that therefore relief must be speedy to be efficacious that to bring the relief which we have promise with expedition sufficient to procure any advantage to we ally to preserve she province from be lay waste she town from be storm and she army from be ruin to repress the confidence of the french and recall they from conquest to the defense of they own territory it be apparently necessary to hire foreign troops for to have send over all we own force have be to have tempt the french to change they design of invade the austrian dominion into that of attack britain and attempt to add this kingdom to they other conquest to have raise new troops with expedition equal to the necessity that demand they be either absolutely impossible or at least very difficult and when raise they would have be only new troops who whatever might be they courage would have be without skill in war and would therefore have be distrust by those whom they assist and despise by those whom they oppose nothing therefore remain but that auxiliary should be try and the only question then to be decide be what nation should be solicit to supply we nor be this so difficult to be answer as in former time since there be not the usual liberty of choice many of the prince who send they troops to fight for other power be at that time either influence by the promise or bribe by the money or intimidate by the force of france some of they be engage in scheme for enlarge they own dominion and therefore be unwilling to supply other with those troops for which they be themselves project employment and perhaps of some other it might reasonably be doubt whether they would not betray the cause which they should be retain to support and whether they would not in secret wish the depression of the queen of hungary by means of those invader whom they promise to resist sir amidst all these consideration which there be not time completely to adjust it be necessary to turn they eye upon some power to which none of these objection could be make and therefore they immediately fix upon the electorate of hanover as subject to the same monarch and of which therefore the troops might be properly consider as we national ally whose interest and inclination must be the same with we own and whose fidelity might be warrant by we own sovereign it be no small advantage that the contract for these troops could be make without the delay of tedious negotiation that they be ready to march upon the first notice and that they have be long learn in the exactest discipline the concurrence of all these circumstance easily determine we minister in they choice and the troops be order to join the briton in the low country a step which so much alarm the french that they no longer endeavor to push forward they conquest nor appear to entertain any other design than that of defend themselves and return in safety to they own country such be the conduct of we ministry such be they motive and such have be they success nor do i doubt but this house will upon the most rigorous examination find reason to approve both they integrity and prudence of they integrity they could give no greater proof than they confidence of the agreement of this house to measure which though conformable in general to we resolution be not particularly communicate to we because indeed it could not be do without loss of time which it be necessary to improve with the utmost diligence and a discovery of those design which ought only to be know by the enemy after they be execute of they prudence they success be a sufficient evidence and therefore i can not doubt but gentleman will give a sanction to they conduct by provide accord to the estimate before the committee for the support of troops which have be find of so great use lord powlett rise up next and speak to the effect follow : -- sir the honorable gentleman have with so much clearness and elegance display the state of europe explain the necessity of hire foreign troops and show the reason for which the troops of hanover be prefer to those of any other nation that i believe it not to be of any use to urge other argument than those which he have produce as therefore it be indisputably necessary to hire troops and none can be hire which can be so safely trust as those of hanover i can not but agree with the right honorable gentleman that this measure of he majesty ought to be support sir john st aubyn then speak as follow : -- sir it be with the greatest difficulty that i rise up to give you this trouble and particularly after the honorable gentleman with whom i be so very unequal to contend but when my assent be require to a proposition so big with mischief of so alarming a nature to this country and which i think notwithstanding what the honorable gentleman have most ingeniously say must determine from this very day who deserve the character and appellation of a briton i hope you will forgive I if i take this last opportunity which perhaps i may ever have of speak with the freedom of a briton in this assembly i be not able to follow the honorable gentleman in any refinement of reason upon we foreign affair i have not subtilty enough to do it nor be it in my way as a private country gentleman but though country gentleman have not that sagacity in business and for want of proper light be afford we the penetration of minister into publick affair yet give I leave to say they have one kind of sense which minister of state seldom have and at this time it be of so acute a nature that it must overthrow the argument of the most refined administration this be the sense of feel the universal distress of they country the utter incapacity it now lie under of sustain the heavy burden that be impose upon it this i take to be the first the great object of this day 's debate consider well you strength at home before you entangle yourselve abroad for if you proceed without a sufficient degree of that you retreat will be certain and shameful and may in the end prove dangerous without this first this necessary principle whatever may be the machination the visionary scheme of minister whatever colouring they may heighten they with to mislead we imagination they will prove in the end for no other purpose but to precipitate this nation by empty captivating sound into the private view and intrigue of some man so low perhaps in reputation and authority as to be abandon to the desperate necessity of found they ill possess precarious power upon the ruin of this country next to the consideration of we inward domestick strength what foreign assistance have we to justify this measure be we sure of one positive active ally in the world nay be not we morally certain that we nearest most natural ally disavow the proceeding and refuse to cooperate with we one need not be deep read in politick to understand that when one state separate itself from another to which it be naturally ally it must be for this plain reason that the interest be desert which be in common to they both and it be a invariable rule in this country a rule never to be depart from that there can no cause exist in which we ought to engage on the continent without the aid and assistance of that neighbouring state this be the test the certain mark by which i shall judge that the interest of this country be not at present the object in pursuit be any man then wild enough to imagine that the accession of sixteen thousand hanoverian mercenary will compensate for the loss of this natural ally no but it be say that this indicate such a firmness and resolution within ourselves that it will induce they to come in sir if they have any real proof of we firmness and resolution that the interest of this country be to be pursue i dare say they would not long hesitate but they look with a jealous eye upon this measure they consider it as a argument of you weakness because it be contrary to the genius and spirit of this country and may therefore lessen he majesty in the affection of he people they have for some year past look upon a british parliament as the corrupt engine of administration to exhaust the riches and impair the strength of this country they have hear it talk loudly indeed of the house of austrium when it be in you power to have raise she to that state in which she be properly to be consider as the support of the balance of europe if timid neutrality have not intervene and we naval strength have properly interpose to she assistance they have lately look upon this parliament and with the joy of a natural ally they have do it resent you injury bravely withstand the power that you might restore the authority of you government demand constitutional security appoint a parliamentary committee for inquiry and justice sir they now see that inquiry suppress and justice disappointed in this situation what expectation can we form of they accession to we talk bigly indeed of vindicate foreign rights but so weak and impotent at home as not to be able to recover we own privilege but this measure be say to be undertake in consequence of the advice of parliament there have be great stress lay upon this it have be loudly proclaim from the throne echo back again from hence and the whole nation be to be amuse with a opinion that upon this measure the fate of the house of austrium the balance and liberty of europe the salvation of this country depend but be this fatal measure the recommendation of parliament or be it the offspring of some bold enterprising minister hatch in the interval of parliament under the wing of prerogative daring to presume upon the corruption of this house as the necessary means of he administration the object indeed might be recommend but if any wrong measure be undertake to attain it that measure surely should be dropt for it be equally culpable to pursue a good end by bad measure as it be a bad end by those that be honest but as to the address i wish gentleman would a little consider the occasion which produce it sir it proceed from the warmth of expectation the exultation of we heart immediately after and with the same breath that you establish you committee of inquiry and it be no forced construction to say that it carry this testimony along with it that national security and grant supplies be reciprocal term but sir i must own for my part be the occasion never so cogent hanoverian auxiliary be the last that i would vote into british pay not upon the consideration only that we ought otherwise to expect they assistance and that we should rather make sure of other that might be engage against we but from this melancholy apprehension that administration will for ever have sagacity enough to find out such pretence that we may find it difficult to get rid of they again besides the elector of hanover as elector of hanover be a arbitrary prince he electoral army be the instrument of that power as king of great britain he be a restrained monarch and though i do not suspect he majesty and i dare say the heart of the british soldiery be as yet free and untainted yet i fear that too long a intercourse may beget a dangerous familiarity and they may hereafter become a joint instrument under a less gracious prince to invade we liberty he majesty if he be rightly inform i dare say would soon perceive the danger of the proposition which be now before you but as he have every other virtue he have undoubtedly a most passionate love for he native country a passion which a man of any sensation can hardly divest himself of and sir it be a passion the more easily to be flatter because it arise from virtue i wish that those who have the honor to be of he council would imitate he royal example and show a passion for they native country too that they would faithfully stand forth and say that as king of this country whatever interest may interfere with it this country be to be he first he principal care that in the act of settlement this be a express condition but what sluggish sensation what foul heart must those man have who instead of conduct he majesty 's right principle address themselves to he passion and misguide he prejudice make a voluntary overture of the rights and privilege of they country to obtain favor and secure themselves in power misconstrue that as a secondary consideration which in they own heart they know to be the first sir we have already lose many of those benefit and restriction which be obtain for we by the revolution and the act of settlement for god 's sake let we proceed no farther but if we be thus to go on and if to procure the grace and favor of the crown this be to become the flattering measure of every successive administration -- this country be undo mr bladen then rise up and speak to the follow purport : -- sir if zeal be any security against error i should not willingly oppose the honorable gentleman who have now declare he sentiment and declare they with such ardor as can hardly be produce but by sincerity and of whom therefore it can not be doubt that he have deliver he real opinion that he fear from the measure which he censure very great calamity that he think the publick tranquillity in danger and believe that he duty to he country oblige he to speak on this occasion with unusual vehemence but i be too well acquaint with he candor to imagine that he expect he assertion to be any farther regarded than they convince or that he desire to debar other from the same freedom of reason which he have himself use i shall therefore proceed to examine he opinion and to show the reason by which i be induce to differ from he the argument upon which he have chiefly insist be the danger of hire the troops of hanover in any circumstance and the impropriety of hire they now without the previous approbation of the senate the danger of take into we pay the force of hanover the contrariety of this conduct to the act of settlement and the infraction of we natural privilege and the violation of we liberty which be threaten by it have be assert in very strong term but i think not prove with proportionate force for we have hear no regular deduction of consequence by which this danger might be show nor have be inform how the engagement of sixteen thousand hanoverian to serve we against france for the ensue year can be consider as more destructive to we liberty than any other force it be indeed insinuate that this conduct will furnish a dangerous precedent of preference grant to hanover above other nation and that this preference may gradually be advance till in time hanover may by a servile ministry be prefer to britain itself and that therefore all such partiality ought to be crush in the beginning and its author pursue with indignation and abhorrence that to prefer the interest of hanover to that of britain would be in a very high degree criminal in a british ministry i believe no man in this house will go about to deny but if no better proof can be produce that such preference be intend than the contract which we be now desire to ratify it may be with reason hope that such atrocious treachery be yet at a great distance for how do the hire of hanoverian troops show any preference of hanover to britain the troops of hanover be not hire by the ministry as braver or more skilful than those of we own country they be not hire to command or to instruct but to assist we nor can i discover suppose it possible to have raise with equal expedition the same number of force in we own country how the ministry can be charge with prefer the hanoverian by expose they to danger and fatigue but if it be confess that such number would not possibly be raise or at least not possibly discipline with the expedition that the queen of hungary require it will be find that the hanoverian be at most not prefer to we own nation but to other foreigner and for such preference reason have be already give which i shall esteem conclusive till i hear they confute the other objection on which the honorable gentleman think it proper to insist be the neglect of demand from the senate a previous approbation of the contract which be now before we a neglect in he opinion so criminal that the ministry can not be acquit of arbitrary government of squander the publick money by they own caprice and of assume to themselves the whole power of government but the proof of this enormous usurpation have not yet be produce for it do not yet appear that there be time to communicate they design to the senate or that they would not have be defeat by communication and therefore it be yet not evident but that when they be censure for not have lay they scheme before the senate they be condemn for omit what be not possibly to be do or what could not have be do without betray they trust and injure they country it be allow that the senate have resolve to assist the queen of hungary and therefore nothing remain for the minister but to execute with they utmost address the resolution that have be form if for the prosecution of this design they should be find to have err in they choice of means they mistake unless some ill design may justly be suspect be to be imputed to the frailty of human nature and rather to be pity and relieve as misfortune than punish as crime but i doubt not that in the course of we deliberation we shall find reason for conclude that they have act not only with fidelity but prudence that they have choose the means by which the great end which the senate propose the succor of the queen of hungary and consequently the reestablishment of the balance of power will be most easily attain and that they have take into the pay of this nation those troops which may be trust with the greatest security as they have the same prince and the same interest but the honorable gentleman appear inclined to advance a new doctrine and to insinuate that when any vote be pass by the senate the minister be to suppose some condition which be to be observe though they be never mention and without which the voice of the senate be a empty sound in pursuance of this supposition he call upon we to recollect the time and circumstance in which this vote be pass he remind we that the concession be make in a sudden exultation of we heart in the rapture of triumph and amidst the shout of conquest when every man be form expectation which have never be gratify and plan scheme which could never be perfect he seem therefore to think that we minister insidiously take advantage of we intoxication and betray we in a fit of thoughtless jollity to a promise which when make we hardly understand and which we may therefore now retract he conclude that the concession which might then escape we ought not to have be snatch by we minister and make the foundation of they conduct because they know it be make upon false supposition and in prospect of a recompense that never would be grant i hope there be no necessity for declare that this reasoning can not safely be admit since if the vote of the senate be not a sufficient warrant for any measure no man can undertake the administration of we affair and that government which no man will venture to serve must be quickly at a end for my part i know not how the nation or the senate have be disappoint of any just expectation nor can i conceive that any such disappointment vacate they vote or annul they resolution and therefore i can not but think the ministry sufficiently justified if they can show that they have not deviate from they lord quarendon speak next to the effect follow : -- sir i be so far from think that the past conduct or the present proposal of the ministry deserve approbation that in my opinion all the argument which have be produce in they favor be apparently fallacious and even the position on which they be found and which be lay down as uncontrovertible be generally false it be first assert that we be indispensably oblige to assist the queen of hungary against france and to support she in the possession of the hereditary dominion of the austrian house and from thence be precipitately infer the necessity of assemble army and hire mercenary of exhaust we treasure and heap new burden upon the publick that we concur with other power in promise to support the pragmatick sanction be not to be deny nor do i intend to insinuate that the faith of treaty ought not strictly to be keep but we be not oblige to perform more than we promise or take upon ourselves the burden which be to be support by the united strength of many potentate and of which we only engage to bear a certain part we ought undoubtedly to furnish the troops which we promise and ought to have send they when they be first demand but there be no necessity that we should supply the deficiency of every other power and that we should determine to stand alone in defense of the pragmatick sanction that we should by romantick generosity impoverish we country and entail upon remotest posterity poverty and tax we ought to be honest at all event we be at liberty likewise to be generous at we own expense but i think we have hardly a right to boast of we liberality when we contract debt for the advantage of the house of austrium and leave they to be pay by the industry or frugality of succeed age it be therefore at least dubious whether we ought to hazard more than we promise in defense of the house of austrium and consequently the first proposition of those who have undertake the defense of the ministry require to be better establish before it become the basis of a argument but though it be allow that we ought to exceed we stipulation and engage more deeply in this cause than we have promise i can not yet discover upon what principle it can be prove that sixteen thousand hanoverian ought to be hire why be not we troops send which have be so long maintain at home only for oppression and show why have they not at last be show the use of those weapon which they have so long carry and the advantage of that exercise which they have be teach to perform with so much address why have they not at length be show for what they have so long receive they pay and inform that the duty of a soldier be not wholly perform by strut at a review if it be urge that so great a number could not be send out of the kingdom without expose it to insult and irruption let it be remember how small a force be find sufficient for the defense of the kingdom in the late war when the french be master of a fleet which dispute for many year the empire of the sea and it will appear whether it ought to be imputed to prudence or to cowardice that we minister can not now think the nation safe without thrice the number though we fleet cover the ocean and steer from one coast to another without a enemy but to show more fully the insufficiency of the vindication which have be attempt and prove that no concession will enable the ministry to defend they scheme even this assertion shall be admit we will allow for the present that it be necessary to garrison a island with numerous force against a enemy that have no fleet i will grant that invader may be convey through the air and that the formidable the detestable pretender may by some subterraneous passage enter this kingdom and start on a sudden into the throne yet will not all this liberality avail we minister since it may be object that new force might easily have be raise and we own island have be at once defend and the queen of hungary assist by we native troops since the necessity of expedition be urge it may reasonably be inquire what it be that appear so immediately necessary or what have be bring to pass by this wonderful expedition be it necessary to form a army to do nothing could not a expedition in which nothing be perform in which nothing be attempt have be delay for a short time and might not the queen of hungary have be preserve equally whether the troops of she ally sleep and fatten in she country or they own nothing surely can be more ridiculous than to expatiate upon the necessity of raise with expedition a useless body of force which have only be a burden to the country in which it have be station and for which pay be now demand though they have neither see a siege nor a battle though they have make no attempt themselves nor hinder any that might have be make by the enemy to make this plea yet more contemptible we be inform that if we have raise a army of we countryman they would have be unacquainted with arm and discipline and therefore they could not have do what have be do by these far-famed hanoverian this indeed i can not understand have never find that the briton need any document or rule to enable they to eat and drink at the expense of other to bask in the sun or to loiter in the street or perform any of the wonder that may be ascribe to we new auxiliary and therefore i can not but think that all the action of the four month for which those force expect to be pay might have be bring to pass by new-raised briton who might in the mean time have learn they exercise and have be make equal to any other soldier that have never see a battle but if foreign troops be necessary i be still at a loss to find out why those of hanover be choose since it appear to I that by hire out he troops to britain we monarch only weaken one hand to strengthen the other it might be expect that he should have employ these troops against france without hire since he be not less obliged either by treaty or policy to protect the house of austrium as elector of hanover than as king of britain since therefore the troops of hanover be hire without the consent of the senate they have hitherto perform nothing and since it be reasonable to expect that without be pay by britain they will be employ against the french i think it expedient to discharge they from we service and to delay the pay which be require for the last four month till it shall appear how they have deserve it mr fox then rise and speak to the follow purport : -- sir though the observation of the right honorable gentleman must be allow to be ingenious and though the eloquence with which he have deliver they naturally excite attention and regard yet i be oblige to declare that i have receive rather pleasure than conviction from he oratory and that while i applaud he imagination and he diction i can not but conclude that they have be employ in bestow ornament upon error i shall not indeed attempt to confute every assertion which i think false or detect the fallacy of every argument which appear to I sophistical but shall leave to other the province of show the necessity of engage in the war on the continent of employ a large force for the preservation of the house of austrium and of form that army with the utmost expedition and of take auxiliary into we pay and confine myself to this single question whether supposing auxiliary necessary it be not prudent to hire the troops of hanover nothing can be in my opinion more apparent than that if the necessity of hire troops be allow which surely can not be question the troops of hanover be to be choose before any other and that the ministry consult in they resolution the real interest of they country as well as that of we ally the great argument which have in all age be use against mercenary troops be the suspicion which may justly be entertain of they fidelity mercenary it be observe fight only for pay without any affection for the master whom they serve without any zeal for the cause which they espouse and without any prospect of advantage from success more than empty praise or the plunder of the field and therefore have no motive to incite they against danger nor any hope to support they in fatigue that they can lose nothing by flight but plunder nor by treachery but honor and that therefore they have nothing to throw into the balance against the love of life or the temptation of a bribe and will never be able to stand against man that fight for they native country under the command of general whom they esteem and love and whom they can not desert or disobey without expose themselves to perpetual exile or to capital punishment these argument have always be of great force and therefore that nation whose defense have be intrust to foreigner have always be think in danger of ruin yet there have be conjuncture in which almost every state have be oblige to rely upon mercenary and in compliance with immediate necessity to depend upon the fidelity of those who have no particular interest in support they but with much greater reason may we trust the success of the present war in some degree to the troops of hanover as they be perhaps the only foreign force against which the argument already recite be of no force they be foreigner indeed as they be bear in another country and govern by law different from ours but they be the subject of the same prince and therefore naturally fight under the same command they have the same interest with ourselves in the present contest they have the same hope and the same fear they recommend themselves equally to they sovereign by they bravery and can neither discover cowardice nor treachery without suffer all the punishment that can be fear by we native troops since they conduct must be censure by the same prince of whose approbation they be equally ambitious and of whose displeasure they be equally afraid as to the troops which any neutral prince might furnish there would be reason to fear that either for larger pay or upon any casual dispute that might arise they might be withdraw from we service when they be most need or transfer to the enemy at a time when he distress might compel he to offer high term and when therefore there be a near prospect of a advantageous peace but of the troops of hanover no such suspicion can be form since they can not engage against we without rebel against they prince for it can not be imagine that he majesty will fight on one side as elector of hanover and on the other as king of britain or that he will obstruct the success of he own arm by furnish the troops of hanover to the enemy of this kingdom it therefore appear very evident that we have more to hope and less to fear from the troops of hanover than from any other since they have the same reason with ourselves to desire the success of the queen of hungary and to dread the increase greatness of the french and that they can be suspect neither of treachery nor desertion it be not very consistent with that candor with which every man ought to dispute on publick affair to censure those measure which have be propose without propose other that be more eligible for it be the duty of every man to promote the business of the publick nor do i know why he that employ he sagacity only to obstruct it should imagine that he be of any use in the national council i doubt not but i shall hear many objection against the use of these troops and that upon this question virulence and ridicule will be equally employ but for my part i shall be little affected either with the laughter that may be raise by some or the indignation that may be express by other but shall vote for the continuance of these measure till better shall be propose and shall think that these troops ought to be retain unless it can be show that any other may be have who may be less dangerous or of greater use mr pitt then rise up and speak in substance as follow : -- sir if the honorable gentleman determine to abandon he present sentiment as soon as any better measure be propose i can not but believe that the ministry will very quickly be deprive of one of they ablest defender for i think the measure which have hitherto be pursue so weak and pernicious that scarcely any alteration can be propose that will not be for the advantage of the nation he have already be inform that there be no necessity of hire auxiliary troops since it do not yet appear that either justice or policy require we to engage in the quarrel of the continent that there be any need of form a army in the low country or that in order to form a army auxiliary be necessary but not to dwell upon disputable question i think it may be justly conclude that the measure of we ministry have be ill concerted because it be undoubtedly wrong to squander the publick money without effect and to pay army only to be a show to we friend and a jest to we enemy the troops of hanover whom we be now expect to pay march into the low country indeed and still remain in the same place they march to the place most distant from enemy least in danger of a attack and most strongly fortify if any attack have be design nor have any claim to be pay but that they leave they own country for a place of greater security it be always reasonable to judge of the future by the past and therefore it be reasonable to conclude that the service of these troops will not next year be of equal importance with that for which they be now to be pay and i shall not be surprise though the opponent of the ministry should be challenge after such another glorious campaign to propose better man and should be tell that the money of this nation can not be more properly employ than in hire hanoverian to eat and sleep but to prove yet more particularly that better measure may be take and that more useful troops may be retain and that therefore the honorable gentleman may be expect to quit those to whom he now adhere i shall show that in hire the force of hanover we have obstruct we own design that we have instead of assist the queen of hungary withdraw part of she ally from she and that we have burden the nation with troops from whom no service can be reasonably expect the advocate for the ministry have on this occasion affect to speak of the balance of power the pragmatick sanction and the preservation of the queen of hungary not only as if they be to be the chief care of britain which though easily controvertible might perhaps in compliance with long prejudice be admit but as if they be to be the care of britain alone as if the power of france be formidable to no other people as if no other part of the world would be injure by become a province to a universal monarchy and be subject to a arbitrary government of a french deputy by be drain of its inhabitant only to extend the conquest of its master and to make other nation equally miserable and by be oppress with exorbitant tax levy by military execution and employ only in support the state of its oppressor they dwell upon the importance of publick faith and the necessity of a exact observation of treaty as if the pragmatick sanction have be sign by no other potentate than the king of britain or as if the publick faith be to be obligatory to we only that we should inviolably observe we treaty and observe they though every other nation should disregard they that we should show a example of fidelity to mankind and stand firm though we should stand alone in the practice of virtue i shall readily allow and therefore i be far from advise that we should recede from we stipulation whatever we may suffer by perform they or neglect the support of the pragmatick sanction however we may be at present embarrassed or however inconvenient it may be to assert it but surely for the same reason that we observe we own stipulation we ought to incite other power likewise to the observation of theirs at least not contribute to hinder it but how be we present conduct agreeable to these principle the pragmatick sanction be confirm not only by the king of britain but by the elector likewise of hanover who be therefore equally oblige if treaty constitute obligation to defend the house of austrium against the attack of any foreign power and to send in he proportion of troops to the support of the queen of hungary whether these troops have be send those whose province oblige they to some knowledge of foreign affair can inform the house with more certainty than i but since we have not hear they mention in this debate and have find by experience that none of the merit of that electorate be pass over in silence it may i think fairly be conclude that the distress of the illustrious queen of hungary have yet receive no alleviation from she alliance with hanover that she complaint have move no compassion at that court nor the justice of she cause obtain any regard to what can we impute this negligence of treaty this disregard of justice this defect of compassion but to the pernicious counsel of those man who have advise he majesty to hire to britain those troops which he should have employ in the assistance of the queen of hungary for it be not to be imagine that he majesty have more or less regard to justice as king of britain than as elector of hanover or that he would not have send he proportion of troops to the austrian army have not the temptation of greater profit be industriously lay before he but this be not all that may be urge against this conduct for can we imagine that the power of france be less or that she design be less formidable to hanover than to britain nor be it less necessary for the security of hanover that the house of austrium should be reestablish in its former grandeur and enable to support the liberty of europe against the bold attempt for universal monarchy if therefore we assistance be a act of honesty and grant in consequence of treaty why may it not equally be require of hanover and if it be a act of generosity why should this nation alone be oblige to sacrifice she own interest to that of other or why should the elector of hanover exert he liberality at the expense of britain it be now too apparent that this great this powerful this formidable kingdom be consider only as a province to a despicable electorate and that in consequence of a scheme form long ago and invariably pursue these troops be hire only to drain this unhappy nation of its money that they have hitherto be of no use to britain or to austrium be evident beyond controversy and therefore it be plain that they be retain only for the purpose of hanover how much reason the transaction of almost every year have give for suspect this ridiculous ungrateful and perfidious partiality it be not necessary to mention i doubt not but most of those who sit in this house can recollect a great number of instance from the purchase of part of the swedish dominion to the contract which we be now call upon to ratify i hope few have forget the memorable stipulation for the hessian troops for the force of the duke of wolfenbuttel which we be scarcely to march beyond the verge of they own country or the ever memorable treaty of which the tendency be discover in the name the treaty by which we disunite ourselves from austrium destroy that building which we may perhaps now endeavor without success to raise again and weaken the only power which it be we interest to strengthen to dwell upon all the instance of partiality which have be show to remark the yearly visit that have be make to that delightful country to reckon up all the sum that have be spend to aggrandize and enrich it would be at once invidious and tiresome tiresome to those who be afraid to hear the truth and to those who be unwilling to mention fact dishonourable or injurious to they country nor shall i dwell any longer on this unpleasing subject than to express my hope that we shall not any longer suffer ourselves to be deceive and oppress that we shall at length perform the duty of the representative of the people and by refuse to ratify this contract show that however the interest of hanover have be prefer by the minister the senate pay no regard but to that of britain mr horace walpole then speak to the follow purpose : -- sir though i have long consider the mercenary scribbler of disaffection as the disgrace of the kingdom and the pest of society yet i be never so fully sensible of they pernicious influence i have hitherto imagine that the weekly journalist and the occasional pamphleteer be the oracle only of the lowest of the people and that all those whom they birth or fortune have exalt above the crowd and introduce to a more extensive conversation have consider they as wretch compel to write by want and oblige therefore to write what will most engage attention by flattering the envy or the malignity of mankind and who therefore propagate falsehood themselves not because they believe they and disseminate faction not because they be of any party but because they be either oblige to gratify those that employ they or to amuse the publick with novelty or disturb it with alarm that they work may not pass unregarded and they labor be spend in vain this be my opinion of the party writer and this i imagine the opinion of the rest of mankind who have the same opportunity of information with myself : nor should i readily have believe that any of they performance could have produce greater effect than those of inflame the lowest class of the people and incite drunkard to insult they superior have i not perceive that the honorable gentleman who speak last owe he opinion of the partiality show to the dominion of hanover to a late treatise which have on occasion of this contract be very industriously disperse among the people of this detestable pamphlet i know not the author nor think he deserve that any inquiry should be make after he except by a proclamation that may set a price upon he head and offer the same reward for discover he as be give for the conviction of wretch less criminal : nor can i think the lenity of the government easily to be distinguish from supineness and negligence while libel like this be dispersed openly in the street and sell in shop without fear and without danger while sedition be professedly promote and treason or sentiment very nearly border upon treason propagate without disguise the scribbler of this wicked treatise have endeavor to corrupt the principle of he majesty 's faithful subject not only by vilify the memory of the late king whose justice humanity and integrity be generally reverence but by insinuate likewise that we present most gracious sovereign have adopt the same scheme and endeavor to aggrandize hanover at the expense of britain that all the measure that have be take with regard to the affair of the continent have be contrived with no other view than that of advance the interest enlarge the bound and increase the riches of the hanoverian territory he declare that britain have be steer by the rudder of hanover and that the nation will soon be divide into two more opposite and irreconcilable party than ever yet disturb the publick peace briton and hanoverian that he himself whoever he be long for those time of division and confusion may be easily believe and the number of those who have the same wish with himself be i fear too great but i believe they hope will not be encourage nor they design promote in this house and that none of those who be intrust to represent they country will suffer themselves to be mislead by such wicked insinuation mr nugent then speak to this effect : -- sir i know not for what reason the honorable gentleman have think it convenient to retard the deliberation of this house by expatiate upon the falsehood and malignity of a pamphlet of which the author be unknown of which no man have attempt the vindication and which however diligently disperse or however generally credit appear to have have no great influence upon the nation nor to have produce any effect that might give just occasion to so tragical a outcry to censure as vehement and bitter as if the trumpet of rebellion have be sound as if half the people have take arm against they governor as if the commonwealth be on the brink of dissolution and army be in full march against the metropolis this pamphlet with the rest of the people i have read and though i be far from think that the censure of that honorable gentleman can make a defense necessary since indeed be have contented himself with invective instead of argument and whatever he may disapprove have confute nothing : and though i have no particular reason for expose myself as the champion for this author whoever he may be yet i can not forbear to affirm that i read some passage with conviction and that in my opinion they require a different answer from those which have be yet offer and that the impression which have be make upon the people will not be efface by clamor and rage and turbulence and menace which can affect only the person of the writer but must leave he reason in they full force and even with regard to he person will have very little effect for though some man in power may be offend it will not be easy to quote any law that have be break by he on this occasion i can not but animadvert i hope with the same pardon from the house as have be obtain by the honorable gentleman whom i be now follow upon a expression in frequent use among the follower of a court whenever they measure be censure with spirit and with justice the papers which they can not confute and which they have not yet be able to obtain the power of suppress be assert to _ border _ upon treason and the author be threaten with punishment when they have nothing to fear from a reply treason be happily den by we law and therefore every man may know when he be about to commit it and avoid the danger of punishment by avoid the act which will expose he to it but with regard to the _ border _ of treason i believe no man will yet pretend to say how far they extend or how soon or with how little intention he may tread upon they unhappy would be the man who should be punish for _ border _ upon guilt of which those fatal _ border _ be to be dilate at pleasure by he judge the law have hitherto suppose every man who be not _ guilty _ to be _ innocent _ but now we find that there be a kind of medium in which a man may be in danger without guilt and that in order to security a new degree of caution be become necessary for not only crime but the border of crime be to be avoid what improvement may be make upon this new system how far the border of treason may reach or what pain and penalty be design for the _ borderer _ no degree of human sagacity can enable we to foresee perhaps the border of royalty may become sacred as well as the border of treason criminal and as every placeman pensioner and minister may be say to border on the court a kind of sanctity may be communicate to he character and he that lampoon or oppose he may border upon treason to dismiss this expression with the contempt which it deserve yet not without the reflection which it naturally excite i shall only observe that all extension of the power of the crown must be dangerous to we and that whoever endeavor to find out new mode of guilt be to be look on not as a good subject but a bad citizen have thus show that the censure produce against this pamphlet be unintelligible and indeterminate i shall venture to mention some of the assertion which have heat the gentleman into so much fury assertion which i can not be suppose to favor since i wish they might be false and which i only produce in this place to give some whom they station make acquaint with publick affair a opportunity of confute they it be assert that the french appear to have treat all we armament with contempt and to have pursue all they scheme with the same confidence as if they have no other enemy to fear than the force of austrium this be indeed no pleasing observation nor can it be suppose to give satisfaction to any briton to find the reputation of we council and of we arm so much diminish to find the nation which lately give law to europe scarcely admit to friendship or think worthy of opposition in enmity to hear that those troops which in the day of we former monarch shake the throne of the continent be pass by without fear and without regard by army march against they ally those ally in whose cause they formerly fight in the field but the truth of the assertion be too plain to all the nation of the world and those whose interest it may be to conceal from they countryman what be know to all the continent may rage indeed and threaten but they can not deny it for what enterprise have we hitherto either prevent or retard what could we have do on one side or suffer on the other if we have be strike out from existence which have not be suffer or not do though we army have be review on the continent and to make yet a better show lengthen out by a line of sixteen thousand of the troops of hanover it be assert in the same treatise that the troops of hanover can not act against the king and that therefore they be a useless burden to the state that they compose a army of which no other effect will be find but that they eat and eat at the expense of britain this assertion be indeed somewhat more contestable than the former but be at least credible since if we may be permit on this as on other occasion to judge of the future from the past we may conclude that those who have let pass such opportunity as they enemy have in the height of contempt and security present to they will hardly ever repair the effect of they conduct by they bravery or activity in another campaign but that they will take the pay of britain and while they fatten in plenty and unaccustomed affluence look with great tranquillity upon the distress of austrium and in they indolence of gluttony stand idle spectator of that deluge by which if it be suffer to roll on without opposition they own halcyon territory must at last be swallow up the last assertion which i shall extract from this formidable pamphlet be more worthy of attention than the former but perhaps may be suspect to border more nearly upon treason : i shall however venture to quote and what be still more dangerous to defend it it be propose that instead of squander in this time of danger the expense of the publick upon troops of which it be at best doubtful whether they will be of any use to the queen of hungary whether they can legally engage against the king and whether they would be of any great use though they be set free from any other restraint than regard to they own safety instead of amusing we ally with a empty show of assistance of mock she calamity with unefficacious friendship and of expose ourselves to the ridicule of we enemy by idle armament without hostility by army only to be review and fleet only to be victual we should remit the sum require for the payment of the hanoverian to the queen of hungary by whom we know that it will be apply to the great purpose for which the senate grant it the establishment of the liberty of europe and the repression of the house of bourbon this proposal however contrary to the opinion of the minister i take the liberty of recommend to the consideration of the house as in my opinion the most effectual method of preserve the remains of the greatness of the house of austrium it be well know that these troops be hire at a rate which they never expect before that levy-money be pay for force levy before the commencement of the bargain that they be pay for act a long time before they begin to march and that since they appear to consider themselves as engage in the quarrel they march have be they whole performance a march not against the enemy but from he a march in which there be nothing to fear nor any thing to encounter and therefore i think it can not be deny that the publick treasure might have be better employ the same sum remit to the queen of hungary will enable she to hire a much greater number of troops out of she own dominion troops of whose courage she can have no doubt and whose fidelity will be strengthen by common interest and natural affection troops that will fight like man defend they wife and they child and who will therefore bear fatigue with patience and face danger with resolution who will oppose the french as they natural enemy and think death more eligible than defeat thus shall we assert the rights of mankind and support the faith of treaty oppose the oppressor of the world and restore we ancient ally to they former greatness without exhaust we own country for it be not impossible that by the proper use of this sum the queen may obtain such advantage in one campaign as may incline the french to desert the king and content themselves with the peaceable possession of they own territory for it be to be remember that they be now fight only for a remote interest and that they will not hazard much a firm resistance will easily incline they to wait for some more favourable opportunity and there will be then leisure for form we measure in such a manner that another opportunity may never be offer they but of the present scheme what effect can be expect but ignominy and shame disgrace abroad and beggary at home to this expense what limit can be set when be there to be a end of pay troops who be not to march against we enemy as they will at all time be of equal use there will be at all time the same reason for employ they nor can there ever be imagine less need of idle troops than in a time of war i be therefore afraid that in a short time the hanoverian may consider britain as a tributary province upon which they have a right to impose the maintenance of sixteen thousand man who be to be employ only for the defense of they own country though support at the expense of this i be afraid that we shall be teach to imagine that the appearance of the hanoverian be necessary in we own country perhaps to check the insolence of the son of freedom who without fear border upon treason i be afraid that he majesty or he successor may be advise by sycophant and slave to trust the guard of he person to the trusty hanoverian and advise to place no confidence in the native of britain for my part i think it a very wise precept by which we be direct to obviate evil in the beginning and therefore since in my opinion the influence of hanover must be destructive to the royal family and detrimental to those kingdom i shall endeavor to obviate it by vote against any provision for these useless mercenary and declare that i shall more willingly grant the publick money to any troops than those of hanover lord percival speak next as follow : -- sir i look upon the question now under you consideration to vary very little in reality from that which be debate here the first day of this session the principal point in the debate of that day be the same with that which be more regularly the debate of this _ whether the _ hanoverian _ force should be take into _ british _ pay _ sir i should then have offer my sentiment upon this question if so many other gentleman have not deliver my sense in so much a better manner than i think myself able to do that it would have appear a great presumption in I and would have give the house a unnecessary trouble the same reason have induce I to have be silent also upon this occasion if the temper of the time the little indulgence show by gentleman to one another when they happen to differ in political opinion and the popular circumstance in which i stand do not in some sort oblige I to protect the vote i then give and that which i now intend to give by the reason that induce I to give it sir there be three principal consideration in this question first whether we be to assist the house of austrium and balance of power at all aye or no then whether we ought to do it with we whole force and lastly whether the hanoverian troops should be make a part of that force as to the first consideration a new doctrine have be teach and inculcate for some month past that it be of no importance to this nation what may happen on the continent that this country be a island intrench within its own natural boundary it may stand secure and unconcerned in all the storm of the rest of the world this doctrine inconsistent as it be with all sense and reason contrary as it be to the universal principle of policy by which this nation have be govern from the conquest to this hour be yet openly profess and avow by many without these wall and though no man have yet venture to own this opinion publickly and directly in this house yet some gentleman even here in effect maintain it when they argue that in no case this nation ought to assist or support the balance of power without the concurrence of the dutch this tend inevitably to produce the same fatal effect it reduce this country to depend upon holland to be a province to holland and france would then have no more to do to become mistress of all europe than to gain over one single town of the united province or to corrupt a few member of the state it be therefore a doctrine of the greatest danger the only solid maxim be that whoever become master of the continent must in the end obtain the dominion of the sea to confirm this i may venture to cite a old example nor can i be accuse of pedantry in do of it since it be a instance draw from the last universal monarchy to which the world submit the roman have no sooner divided broken and subdue those power upon the continent of europe who have give a diversion in the great attempt they have long intend than they attack the carthaginian a maritime power potent in arm immensely opulent possess of the trade of the whole world and unrivalled mistress of the sea yet these people who enjoy no wealth pursue no commerce and at the commencement of they quarrel be not master of a single ship at length prevail against this enemy upon they proper element beat and destroy they fleet invade they dominion and subdue they empire from whence sir i must conclude that we can not wholly rely upon we situation or depend solely on we naval power and i may venture to reason upon this axiom _ that this nation must contribute to support the house of austrium and the balance of power in some degree _ the next question that occur be in what degree we ought to do it and whether we should do it with we whole force take therefore we footing here upon this axiom that we must contribute to it in some degree and take farther to we aid the reasoning of those gentleman who think it a work of such extreme danger and almost desperate the natural and evident conclusion can be only this that as we must do it so we must do it _ with the utmost vigor and with we whole force _ we come now to consider whether the hanoverian troops should be make part of that force there be several consideration previous to the decision of this question first whether they be _ as cheap _ as any other force we can hire then whether they be _ as good _ next whether they be as properly _ situate _ and whether they be _ as much to be depend upon _ if as to every one of these particulars the answer must be make in the affirmative i think it will go very far to determine the question now before you as to the first _ that they be as cheap _ nay upon the whole much cheaper the estimate now upon you table notwithstanding any cavil do sufficiently demonstrate _ that they be as good _ what man can doubt who know the character of the german nation what man can doubt who know the attention of he majesty to military discipline those gentleman can least pretend to doubt it who sometimes do not spare reflection upon that attention which they insinuate to be too great that these troops be not properly _ situate _ will be hardly assert at this time when they be actually now in flander and now act in conjunction with we troops let any man consider the map of europe let he observe the seat of the war and he must evidently see that whether they service may be require in flander whether upon the rhine or in the heart of germany in every one of these case the hanoverian force be _ as properly circumstance and situate as any troops in europe _ it remain in the last place to examine _ whether any other troops can be better depend upon _ and sure nothing can be more obvious than that we may rely with more security on these than any other they be subject of the same prince and of a prince indulgent to all he subject and accuse by those who differ in other point from I of be partial against the interest of he german dominion unless therefore we arraign the first principle upon which a free government can be support and without which every exercise of arbitrary power would be warrant we must allow that such a people will be faithful to such a prince will defend he with a strict fidelity and support he quarrel with the utmost zeal with a zeal which can never be expect from the mercenary troops of any other foreign power this naturally lead we to inquire what other troops we can depend upon the answer to this inquiry be short and positive that as affair now stand abroad we can depend upon none but these let we carry this consideration with we in a survey of all europe _ shall we take into we pay sixteen thousand of the dutch _ would this be the means of bring holland into alliance with we would they act at they own expense would they exert they own proper force would they pay they own troops in aid of the common cause when they find this nation ready to do it for they they would act like madman if they do _ shall we hire _ dane be there a gentleman in this house who be not convince that this power have be warped for some time past towards the interest of france when we hire these troops in the last instance do they not deceive we do they not even refuse to march nay farther be they not in all appearance now upon the point of be employ in a quarrel of they own a quarrel in which they will have need of all they force _ shall we then hire _ saxon a honorable gentleman seem to think that there may be some possibility of this and perhaps there may hereafter when the king of prussium 's view be know and the part he shall resolve to act but saxony be certainly now too much expose to and can not fail to be alarm at he grow power at the great augmentation of he army and the secret and vast design which he seem to meditate this measure therefore be not practicable in the present conjuncture that electorate can not hazard its own security in these precarious circumstance by lend out so great a body of its troops would gentleman advise the hire of prussian troops to serve we in this conjuncture they who do advise it must forget strangely the part so lately act by that prince and the variety of he conduct with regard to he different ally within the space of the two last year i shall guard myself in my expression and maintain a proper respect in discoursing of so great a character but i must say thus much that the ministry would act with great imprudence to put the safety of the british troops and to risk the fate of this army upon the event of such a measure i need not say more for it be not yet prove to we that this prince would -lrb- i wish there be no reason to believe he would not -rrb- lend we this body of he man though we should be dispose to take they into pay _ the swiss canton therefore now alone remain _ and indeed from they we probably might procure a greater number but i leave it to the judgment of any man of sense and candor whether any minister of this nation could warrant the employment of sixteen thousand swiss in this service for when we reflect upon the situation of these province and compare it with that of we british troops who be now in flander it be visible that they must pass four hundred mile upon the border of the rhine flank by the strong place of france during they whole march expose to the garrison and army upon that frontier by whom it can never be suppose that they would be suffer to pass unmolested when france must so well know the intention of they march to be for no other end but to make a conjunction with other troops in the british pay in order afterwards to invade or at least to interrupt the view of that kingdom with they unite force these reason sir prove invincibly to I that if we be to assist the house of austrium by a army we must of prudence nay of necessity in part compose that army of the hanoverian troops but yet there be another state of this question a alternative of which some gentleman seem very fond _ whether it would not be better to assist the queen of hungary with money only _ this opinion at first sight be extremely plausible if the queen of hungary have be able to do so much with a aid of 500000 _ l _ what might she not be able to do with a million more sir a million more would by no means answer in the same proportion when a sum be give she which with the best economy can suffice barely to put she troops in motion when the enemy be at she very gate she all at a immediate stake there can be no room for a misapplication of it but a sum so immense as that of a million and a half would dazzle the eye of a court so little use to see such sum and as a honorable gentleman -lrb- mr horace walpole -rrb- long verse in foreign affair and well acquaint with these matter tell you in a former debate would be much of it squander among the austrian minister and favorite i make no scruple to add to this that some small part might fall to the share of minister elsewhere but there be another danger which gentleman who contend for this measure do not consider : can they who profess a distrust of all minister and particularly those who be now employ at home they who have ever argue against all vote of credit upon this principle that it afford a opportunity to minister of defraud the service and of put large sum into the purse of the crown or into they private pocket can they now argue for this measure which i may be bold to say would be in effect the most enormous vote of credit that be ever give in the world gentleman insinuate that the take the hanoverian force into british pay be a criminal complaisance calculate only to confirm a infant and a totter administration but how much greater means for such a purpose would a alternative like this afford suppose a minister unfirm in he new-acquired power to ingratiate himself with he prince should propose a scheme to replenish the coffer of a exhaust civil list squander in such vile purpose that no man could have the hardiness to come to parliament or dare to hope a supply for it by any regular application to this house what method could be devise by such a minister himself to do the job more excellent than this for who can doubt that -lrb- guard it how you will -rrb- the queen of hungary might be induce in the condition in which she now stand to accept a million and to give a receipt in full for the whole sum how could you prevent a understanding of this kind between two court and how easy therefore might it be to sink 500000 _ l _ out of so vast a grant sir i will suspect no minister but i will trust none in this degree and i wonder other gentleman do not suspect if i do not from hence therefore i consider this as a proposition both fallacious and unsafe for though it be a fact that the same sum of money might maintain in austrium double the number of troops yet if no more than half that money should be apply -lrb- as i have show great reason to believe that it would not -rrb- to the use of the war it be evident that you would deceive yourselve and would have but a equal number of raw irregular undisciplined and much worse troops for it but sir there be yet a stronger argument against the supply in money only what be we view in support the queen of hungary we view be _ general _ and _ particular _ _ general _ to save the house of austrium and to preserve a balance of power _ particular _ to prevent the french from make any farther acquisition on this side of flander the first might possibly be answer in a good degree by give that princess a equivalent in money but the second can not be securely provide against without a army on this side of europe in the british pay sir be it not natural for every one of we to guard we vital part rather than we more remote member would not the queen of hungary -lrb- stipulate and condition with she as you please -rrb- apply the greatest part of these subsidy in defense of she dominion in the heart of germany might it not even induce she to enlarge she view and to think of conquest and equivalent for what she have already lose which it might be vain and ruinous for we to support she in would she not leave flander to shift for itself or still to be take care of by the dutch and britain in such a case if france should find it no longer possible to make any impression on she territory on the german side what must we expect to be the consequence i think it very visible she would on a sudden quit she expensive and destructive project on that quarter and there only carry on a defensive war while she fall with the greater part of she force at once upon the low country which would by this measure be wholly unprovided and she might there acquire in one campaign before any possibility of make head against she -lrb- which the dutch would hardly attempt and could certainly not alone be able to effect -rrb- all that she have be endeavor for the last century to obtain and what no union of power could be ever capable of regain from she all this will be effectually prevent by a army pay by we on this side of europe a army ready to march to the border of she country and to intercept she succor and supplies for the german war a army ready to protect the petty state whose interest and inclination it apparently must be to declare for we and to join they force with we when they no longer fear the power of france a army which may possibly give courage and spirit to greater power who may still doubt without these vigorous measure -lrb- after what they have formerly experience -rrb- whether they could even yet depend upon we a army -lrb- if the posture of affair should make it necessary -rrb- able to cause a powerful diversion to the french force by a attack upon lorrain and champagne and still within distance to return upon its stop in time to prevent the french from carry any point of consequence in flander should they then attempt it one argument more i beg leave to mention and it be of great weight admit that the sum raise upon the subject might be greater in the one case than the other the sum remit out of the kingdom would be infinitely less whatever be remit to the queen of hungary be bury in the remotest part of germany and can never return to we whereas in a war carry on by troops in we own pay on this side by much the greater part of the expense return to we again in part by the pay of officer by the supply of provision and necessaries in a country exhaust by army ammunition ordnance horse clothing accoutrements and a multitude of other article which i need not enumerate because experience which be the soundest reasoner fully prove it in the example of the last war at the conclusion of which notwithstanding the prodigious sum expend in it this nation feel no sensible effect from a diminution of its current specie sir i be prepare to have speak much more largely to this subject but my discourse have already be draw to a greater length than i imagine in treat upon the argument thus far i shall therefore avoid trouble you any farther upon it at this time i shall only observe that in my humble opinion it be sufficiently prove first that we must assist the house of austrium and that we must do it with all we force next that we can not do it with money only but in part with a land army and that this land army can not be conveniently -lrb- i may say possibly -rrb- compose at this time without the hanoverian troops this question therefore can i think be no longer debate but upon the foot of popular prejudice and insinuation of a improper connexion of hanoverian and british interest but as i could not enter into this subject without concern and indignation and as it be a very delicate point for I in particular to debate upon i shall leave this part of the question to other gentleman who can engage in it both with less inconvenience and with more ability than it be possible for I to do to which mr george grenville reply in substance : -- sir though i be far from think myself able to produce without study or premeditation a complete answer to the elaborate and artful harangue which you have now hear yet as i can not be convince of the reasonableness of the measure which have be defend with so much subtilty i shall at least endeavor to show that my disapprobation be not merely the effect of obstinacy and that i have at least consider the proposal of the ministry before i have venture to condemn they whether we ought to think ourselves indispensably oblige to maintain at all event the balance of power on the continent to maintain it without ally to maintain it against a combination of almost all europe i shall not now inquire i will suppose it for once we duty to struggle with impossibility and not only to support the house of austrium when it be attack but to raise it when it be fall fall by we own negligence and oppress with the weight of all the surround power and shall therefore at present only inquire by what mean we may afford that assistance with most benefit to we ally and least danger to ourselves with regard to we ally that assistance will be apparently most advantageous to she by which she strength will be most increase and therefore it may perhaps be more useful to she to find she money than troops but if we must supply she with troops i doubt not but it will readily appear that we may easily find troops which may be of more use and less expense than those of hanover it have be observe with regard to the convenient situation of those troops that it can not now be deny since they be act in flander in conjunction with the british force this be a assertion to which though it be utter with a air of victorious confidence though it be produce as a insuperable argument by which all those who intend opposition be to be reduce to silence and despair many objection may be make which it will require another harangue equally elaborate to remove that the troops of hanover be now act in conjunction with the briton i know not how any man can affirm unless he have receive intelligence by some airy messenger or have some sympathetick communication with they not indulge to the rest of mankind none of the account which have be bring hither of the affair of the continent have yet inform we of any action or tendency to action the hanoverian have indeed be review in conjunction with we force but have hitherto not act nor have the army yet cement the alliance by any common danger or show yet that they be friend otherwise than by sleep and eat together by eat at the expense of the same nation nor be i at present inclined to grant that either army be situate where it may be of most use to the queen of hungary for they now loiter in a country which no enemy threaten and in which nothing therefore can be fear a country very remote from the seat of war and which will probably be last attack if the assistance of the queen of hungary have be design there appear no reason why the hanoverian should have march thither or why this important conjunction should have be form since they might in much less time and with less expense have join the austrian and perhaps have enable they to defeat the design of the french and cut off the retreat of the army which be send to the relief of prague but this march though it would have be less tedious would have be more dangerous and would not have be very consistent with the design of those who be more desirous of receive wages than of deserving they nor be it likely that those who require levy-money for troops already levy and who demand that they should be pay a long time before they begin to march would hurry they to action or endeavor to put a period to so gainful a trade as that of hire troops which be not to be expose this conduct however visibly absurd i be very far from impute either to cowardice or ignorance for there be reason to suspect that they march into flander only because they could not appear in any other place as the ally of the queen of hungary without expose they sovereign to the imperial interdict it be therefore not only certain that these troops these boast and important troops have not yet be of any use but probable that no use be intend for they and that the sole view of those who have introduce they into we service be to pay they court by enrich hanover with the spoil of britain that this be in reality they intention appear from the estimate to which a appeal have be so confidently make but which if they be compare with a contract make for the troops of the same nation in the last war will show how much they price have rise since they sovereign be exalt to this throne though i can not find any proof that they reputation have increase nor can discover from they _ action _ in flander any reason to believe that they service will be greater it be now to little purpose to inquire whether there be any other troops that could have be more properly employ since it be certain that whatever may be the general character or the late conduct of other nation it be the interest of britain to employ rather any troops than these as any evil be rather to be choose than animosity between we sovereign and we fellow-subject and such animosity must inevitably arise from this detestable preference of the troops of hanover -lrb- the question be carry by 67 the aye be 260 no 193 this affair be again debate with vehemence upon the report on Monday December 13 1742 upon a question whether the levy-money should stand part of the general question which be carry by 53 aye 230 no 177 -rrb- house of lord February 1 1742-3 the order of the day for take into consideration the several estimate of the charge of the force in the pay of great britain be read upon which lord stanhope rise up and speak in substance as follow : -- my lord i have always understand that the peculiar happiness of the british nation consist in this that nothing of importance can be undertake by the government without the consent of the people as represent by the other house and that of you lordship whose large possession and the merit either of you ancestor or yourselve have give you the privilege of voting in you own right in national consultation the advantage of this constitution the security which it confer upon the nation and the restraint which it lay upon corrupt minister or ambitious prince be in themselves too obvious to admit of explanation and too well know in this great assembly by whose ancestor they be originally obtain and preserve at the frequent hazard of life and fortune for I to imagine that i can make they either more esteemed or better understand my intention my lord be not to teach other the regard which the constitution of we government or the happiness of the nation demand from they but to show how much i regard they myself by endeavor to preserve and defend they at a time when i think they invade and endanger upon the examination of the estimate now before we i can not but think it necessary my lord that every man who value liberty should exert that spirit by which it be first establish that every man should rouse from he security and awaken all he vigilance and all he zeal lest the bold attempt that have be now make should if it be not vigorously repress be a encouragement to the more dangerous encroachment and lest that fabrick of power should be destroy which have be erect at such expense and with such labor at which one generation have toil after another and of which the wisdom of the most experienced and penetrate statesman have be employ to perfect its symmetry and the industry of the most virtuous patriot to repair its decay the first object which the estimate force upon we observation be a numerous body of foreign troops for the levy and payment of which a very large sum be demand and demand at a time when the nation be to the last degree embarrassed and oppress when it be engage in a war with a powerful empire and almost overwhelm with the debt that be contract in former confederacy when it be engage in a war not for the recovery of forget claim or for the gratification of restless ambition not for the consumption of exuberant wealth or for the discharge of superfluous inhabitant but a war in which the most important interest be set to hazard and by which the freedom of navigation must be either establish or lose a war which must determine the sovereignty of the ocean the rights of commerce and the state of we colony a war in which we may indeed be victorious without any increase of we reputation but in which we can not be defeat without lose all we influence upon foreign power and become subject to the insolence of petty prince when foreign troops be hire at a time like this it be natural to expect that they have be procure by contract uncommonly frugal because no nation can be suppose to be lavish in a time of distress it be natural my lord to expect that they should be employ in expedition of the utmost importance because no trifling advantage ought to incite a people overburdened with tax to oppress themselves with any new expense and it may be justly suppose that these troops be hire by the advice of the senate because no minister can be suppose so harden in defiance of he country in contempt of the law and in disregard of the publick happiness as to dare to introduce foreigner into the publick service in prosecution of he own private scheme or to rob the nation which he profess to serve that he may increase the wealth of another but upon consideration of this estimate my lord all these expectation however reasonable in themselves however consistent with the declaration of the wisest statesman and the practice of former time will be disappoint for it will be find that the troops of which we be now to ratify the provision for they payment be raise at a expense never know on the like occasion before when the nation be far more able to support it that they have yet be employ in no expedition that they have neither fight a battle nor besiege a town nor undertake any design nor hinder any that have be form by those against whom they be pretend to have be raise that they have not yet draw a sword but at a review nor hear the report of fire-arm but upon a festival that they have not yet see a enemy and that they be post where no enemy be likely to approach they but this my lord be not the circumstance which ought in my opinion most strongly to affect we troops may be raise without be employ and money expend without effect but such measure though they ought to be censure and rectify may be bear without any extraordinary degree of indignation while we constitution remain unviolated temporary loss may be easily repair and accidental misconduct speedily retrieve but when the publick rights be infringe when the ministry assume the power of give away the property of the people it be then necessary to exert a uncommon degree of vigor and resentment it be as necessary to stop the encroachment of lawless power as to oppose the torrent of a deluge which may be perhaps resist at first but from which the country that be once overwhelm by it can not be recover to raise this ardor my lord to excite this laudable resentment i believe it will be only necessary to observe that those troops be raise without the advice or the consent of the senate that this new burden have be lay upon the nation by the despotick will of the minister and that the demand make for they support may be say to be a tax lay upon the people not by the senate but by the court the motive upon which the ministry have act on this occasion be so far as they can be discover and indeed there appear very little care to conceal they such as no subject of this crown ever dare to proceed upon before they be such as the act of settlement that act to which we sovereign owe he title to this throne ought for ever to have exclude from british council i should proceed my lord to explain this new method of impoverish we country and endeavor to show the principle from which it arise and the end which it must promote but some sudden indisposition oblige I to contract my plan and conclude much sooner than i intend with move that a humble address be present to he majesty to beseech and advise he majesty that consider the excessive and grievous expense incur by the great number of foreign troops now in the pay of great britain -lrb- expense so increase by the extraordinary manner as we apprehend of make the estimate relate thereunto and which do not appear to we conducive to the end propose -rrb- he majesty will be graciously please in compassion to he people load already with such numerous and heavy tax such large and grow debt and greater annual expense than this nation at any time ever before sustained to exonerate he subject of the charge and burden of those mercenary who be take into we service last year without the advice or consent of parliament lord sandwich speak next in support of the motion to the following effect : -- my lord though i hear the noble lord with so much pleasure that i could not but wish he have be able to deliver he sentiment more fully upon this important affair yet i think the motion so reasonable and just that though he might have set it yet more beyond the danger of opposition though he might have produce many argument in defense of it which perhaps will not occur to any other lord yet i shall be able to justify it in such a manner as may secure the approbation of the unprejudiced and disinterested and therefore i rise up to second it with that confidence which always arise from a consciousness of honest intention and of a impartial inquiry after truth the measure my lord which have give occasion to this motion have be for some time the subject of my reflection i have endeavor to examine they in they full extent to recollect the previous occurrence by which the ministry might have be influence to engage in they and to discover the certain and the probable consequence which they may either immediately or more remotely produce i have labor to collect from those who be suppose to be most acquaint with the state of europe and the scheme of british policy which be at present pursue the argument which can be offer in favor of these new engagement and have compare they with the conduct of former age upon the like occasion but the result of all my search into history all my conversation with politician of every party and all my private meditation have be only that i be every hour confirm by some new evidence in the opinion which i have first form and now imagine myself to know what i at first believe that we be entangled in a labyrinth of which no end be to be see and in which no certain path have yet be discover that we be pursue scheme which be in no degree necessary to the prosperity of we country by means which be apparently contrary to law to policy and to justice and that we be involve in a foreign quarrel only to waste that blood and exhaust that treasure which might be employ in recover the rights of commerce and regain the dominion of the sea to prosecute the war against spain with that vigor which interest and resentment might be expect to produce to repress that insolence by which we navigation have be confine and to punish that rapacity by which we merchant have be plunder and that cruelty by which we fellow-subject have be enslave tortured and murder have be a attempt in which every honest man would readily have concur and to which all those who have sense to discern they own interest or virtue to promote the publick happiness would cheerfully have contribute however load with tax oppress with a standing army and plunder by the vulture of a court : nor be the ancient spirit of the british nation so much depressed but that when spain have be subdue when we rights have be publickly acknowledge we loss repair and we colony secure when we ship have again sail in security and we flag awed the ocean of america we might then have extend we view to foreign country might have assume once more the guardianship of the liberty of europe have give law to the power of the continent and superintend the happiness of mankind but in the present situation of we affair when we have make war for year without advantage while we most important rights be yet subject to the chance of battle why we should engage in the defense of other prince more than we stipulation require i be not able to discover nor can i conceive what motive can incite we after have suffer so much from a weak enemy to irritate a stronger to the measure which be now pursue be there no other argument to be allege against they i should think it my lord a sufficient objection that they be unnecessary and that this be not a time for political experiment or for wanton expense i should think that the present distress of the publick ought to restrain you lordship from approve any step by which we burden may be make more heavy burden under which we be already sink and which a peace of more than twenty year have not contribute to lighten but that they be unnecessary my lord be the weakest allegation that can be offer for they be such as tend not only to obstruct the advancement of more advantageous design but to bring upon we the heaviest calamity they will not only hinder we from increase we strength but will sink we to the greatest degree of weakness they will not only impoverish we for the present which may be sometimes the effect of useful and beneficial design but may depress we below a possibility of recovery and reduce we to receive law from some foreign power this be indeed a dreadful prospect but what other can arise to we from a war with france with the most wealthy empire of the universe of which we be sufficiently show the strength in the late war by the resistance which all the surround nation find it able to make against they unite effort and which the debt that they then contract and the town that be then destroy will not easily suffer they to forget of this empire my lord thus powerful thus formidable neither the dominion be contract nor the trade impaired nor the inhabitant diminish the french army be no less numerous than under they late mighty monarch they territory be increase by new acquisition they trade have long be promote by the destruction of ours and they wealth have be by consequence increase they have not my lord like this unhappy nation be exhaust by temporary expedient and useless armament they have not harass they merchant to aggrandize the court nor throw away the opportunity which this interval of quiet have afford they in the struggle of faction they have not be multiply officer to betray the people and tax the people to support they oppressor but have with equal policy diligence and success recover the loss which they then sustain and enable themselves to make another stand against a general confederacy against this empire my lord be we now to be engage in a war without trade and without money load with debt and harass with exaction for what consequence can be expect from send we troops into the frontier town but that the french will charge we with begin hostility and declare war against we or attack we without a declaration and that we shall be oblige to stand alone against the whole power of the house of bourbon while all we ancient ally stand at a distance spiritless and intimidate or perhaps secretly incite we enemy against we in hope of share we plunder or of rise on we ruin i know it have be allege and allege with such a degree of confidence as it be reasonable to hope nothing could produce but a consciousness of truth that the dutch have already consent to assist we nor be it without regret that i find myself oblige to declare that this assertion be nothing more than one of those transient vision with which it have be for a long time the custom of british minister to delude the people to pacify they clamor and lull they in security one of those artifice from which nothing more be expect than that it shall operate upon the nation till the circumstance of we affair furnish out another which be likewise in a short time to be explode only to make way for new falsehood in a perpetual succession such my lord be the art of government discover by the wonderful sagacity of modern statesman who have find out that it be easier to palliate than to cure and that the people maybe quiet by political soporifick while disease be prey upon they while they strength decay and they vitals be consume that these falsehood prevail upon mankind and that after the discovery of one cheat another equally gross be patiently bear can not but raise the wonder of a man who view the world at a distance and who have not opportunity of inquire into the various motive of action or belief such a one would be incline to think we a nation of fool that must be still with rattle or amuse with bauble and would readily conclude that we minister be oblige to practice such fallacy because they could not prevail upon we by motive adapt to reasonable being but if we reflect my lord upon the different principle upon which report like these be propagate and oppose it will easily be discover that they success be not to be imputed either to superior art on one side or uncommon weakness on the other it be well know that they be promote by man hire for that purpose with large salary or beneficial employment and that they can be oppose only from a desire of detect falsehood and advance the publick happiness : it be apparent that those who invent those who circulate and perhaps part of those who counterfeit belief of they be incite by the prospect of private advantage and immediate profit and that those who stop they in they career by contradiction and objection can propose no other benefit to themselves than that which they shall receive in common with every other member of the community and therefore whoever have sufficiently observe mankind to discover the reason for which self-interest have in almost all age prevail over publick spirit will be able to see why report like these be not always suppress by seasonable detection a minister ought not to flatter himself that he have always deceive those who appear to credit he representation they silence be not so often the effect of credulity as of cowardice or indolence many be overborne by the pomp of great office and other who distinguish more clearly and judge with greater freedom be contented to enjoy they own reflection without reprove those whom they despair to reform this report of the engagement of the dutch in we measure shall however furnish we minister with no opportunity of boast they address nor shall it pass any longer without contradiction for i shall without any scruple affirm in the presence of this August assembly that the dutch have hitherto appear absolutely neutral that they have not show any approbation of we measure nor any inclination to assist we in they i know my lord how disagreeable this assertion may be to those whose interest it be that mankind should believe they of no less importance in the eye of foreign power than in they own and should imagine that the remotest nation of the world be influence by they motion and direct by they counsel but however they may resent this declaration i defy they to confute it and now call upon they to show that the dutch have engage in any measure for the support of the queen of hungary the late augmentation of twenty thousand man which may possibly be mention as a proof of they intention show nothing but that they pursue they own interest with they usual prudence and attention and with such as it be to be wish that we minister would condescend to learn from they and that they be too wise to suffer the town from which the austrian have by we persuasion withdraw they troops to fall into the hand of the french they have therefore substitute new garrison but seem to have no regard to the interest of the queen of hungary nor any other view than that of provide for they own security wait the event of the war and lay hold of any advantage that may accidentally be offer they it may be urge farther by those who be desirous to deceive other or willing to be deceive themselves that the province of holland have pass a vote for assist the queen of hungary with twenty thousand man but if it be remember my lord that this must be the general act of the united state and that every province have its own particular view to gratify and its own interest to reconcile with the general good it may be very reasonably suspect that this assistance be yet rather the object of hope than expectation it may justly be fear that before so many various disposition will unite and such different scheme will be make consistent the house of austrium may be extinguish that we force may be destroy and germany enslave by the french then my lord what will remain but that we shall curse that folly that involve we in distant quarrel and that temerity which send we out to oppose a power which we could not withstand and which incite we to waste that treasure in foreign country which we may quickly want for the defense of we own it must be indeed confess that if a estimate be to be make of we condition from the conduct of we minister the fear of exhaust we treasure must be merely panick and the precept of frugality which other state have grow great by observe be to be absolutely unnecessary it may reasonably be imagine that we have some secret mine or hide repository of gold which no degree of extravagance can drain and which may for ever supply the most lavish expense without diminution for upon what other supposition my lord can any man attempt a defense of the contract by which we have obtain for one campaign the service of the troops of hanover what but the confidence of fund that can never be deficient could influence they to conclude a stipulation by which levy-money be to be pay for troops of which not a single regiment be raise for we service or on the present occasion which be establish for the security of the electorate of hanover and would have be maintain though we have not engage in the affair of the continent what be the reason which induce we ministry to employ the force of hanover it be perhaps not necessary to inquire the only motive that ought to have influence they be the prospect of obtain they upon cheap term for my lord if the troops of hanover can not be obtain but at the same expense with those of britain i be not able to discover why they should be prefer i have never hear my lord any uncommon instance of hanoverian courage that should incline we to trust the cause of europe rather to that nation than to we own and be incline to believe that britain be able to produce man equal in all military virtue to any native of that happy country a country which though it be think worthy to be secure by a neutrality when all the neighbouring province be expose to the ravages of war i have never hear celebrate for any peculiar excellency and of which i can not but observe that it be indebted for its security rather to the precaution of its prince than the bravery of its inhabitant this demand of levy-money shock every briton yet more strongly on consider by whom it be require require by that family whom we have raise from a petty dominion for which homage be pay to a superior power and which be perhaps only suffer to retain the appearance of a separate sovereignty because it be not worth the labor and expense of a invasion because it would neither increase riches nor title nor gratify either avarice or ambition by a family whom from want and weakness we have exalt to a throne from whence with virtue equal to they power they may issue they mandate to the remotest part of the earth may prescribe the course of war in distant empire and dictate term of peace to half the monarch of the globe i should imagine my lord that when a king of the house of hanover survey he navy review he troops or examine he revenue behold the splendor of he court or contemplate the extent of he dominion he can not but sometimes however unwillingly compare he present state with that of he ancestor and that when he give audience to the ambassador of prince who perhaps never hear of hanover and direct the payment of sum by the smallest of which all he ancient inheritance would be dearly purchase and reflect as surely he sometimes will that all these honor and riches this reverence from foreign power and he domestick splendor be the gratuitous and voluntary gift of the mighty people of britain he should find he heart overflow with unlimited gratitude and should be ready to sacrifice to the happiness of he benefactor not only every petty interest or accidental inclination but even he repose he safety or he life that he should be ready to ease they of every burden before they complain and to aid they with all he power before they request he assistance that he should consider he little territory as only a contemptible province to he british empire a kind of nursery for troops to be employ without harass he more valuable subject it might be at least hope my lord that the prince of the house of hanover might have the same regard to this nation as to king from whom they never receive any benefit and whom they ought in reality always to have consider as enemy yet even from such levy-money be not always require or if require be not always receive there be once a time my lord before any of this race wear the crown of britain when the great french monarch lewi the fourteenth be under a necessity of hire auxiliary troops apply to the duke of hanover as a prince whose necessity would naturally incline he to set the life of he subject at a cheap rate the duke please with a opportunity of trafficking with so wealthy a monarch readily promise a supply of troops and demand levy-money to be pay he that he might be enable to raise they but hanoverian reputation be not then raise so high as that the french king should trust he with he money lewi suspect and make no scruple of declare he suspicion that the demand of levy-money be only a pretence to obtain a sum which would never afterwards be repay and for which no troops would be obtain and therefore with he usual prudence insist that the troops should first march and then be pay thus for some time the treaty be at a stand but the king be equally in want of man as the duke of money and perceive perhaps that it be really impracticable for so indigent a prince to raise troops without some pecuniary assistance offer he at length a small sum which be gladly accept though much below the original demand the troops be engage in the service of france and the duke of hanover think himself happy in be able to amuse himself at he leisure with the rattle of money such my lord be the condition on which the troops of hanover be furnish in former time and surely what could then be produce by the love of money or the awe of a superior power might now be expect as the effect of gratitude and kindness but not to dwell any longer my lord upon particular circumstance of measure of which the whole scheme be contrary to the apparent interest of this empire i shall not inquire farther why auxiliary be employ on this occasion rather than briton rather than those whose bravery be celebrate to the most distant corner of the earth why if mercenary be necessary those of hanover be prefer to other : or why if they be indeed preferable they be now to be hire at a higher rate than at any former time it appear to I of far more importance to undermine the foundation than to batter the superstructure of we present system of politick and of greater use to inquire why we have engage in a war on the continent than why we carry it on with ridiculous profusion it appear to I my lord that there be many reason which with the same circumstance would have withhold any nation but this from such a dangerous interposition the dutch we see be content to look on without action though they be more interested in the event and less embarrassed on any other side we be already engage in a war of which no man can foresee the conclusion but which can not be end unsuccessfully without the utmost danger to we most important interest and which yet have hitherto produce only loss and disgrace have impoverish we merchant and intimidate we soldier whether these loss be the effect of weakness or treachery be a question which i be not ambitious of endeavor to decide and of which the decision be indeed by no means necessary in the present debate since if we be too weak to struggle with spain unassisted as she be and embarrassed with different view i need not say what will be we condition when the whole house of bourbon shall be combine against we when that nation which stand alone for so many year against the unite effort of europe shall attack we exhaust with tax enervate with corruption and disunited from all ally whether the troops of hanover will assist we at that time i can not determine perhaps in the destruction of the british dominion it may be think expedient to secure a more valuable and important country by a timely neutrality but if we have any auxiliary from thence we must then necessarily obtain they upon cheaper term if we inactivity in the european sea and we ill success in those of america be as it be generally suspect the consequence of perfidious counsel and private machination if we fleet be send out with order to make no attempt against we enemy or we admiral command to retreat before they surely no higher degree of madness can be imagine than that of provoke new enemy before we have experience a change of counsel and find reason to place in we minister and statesman that confidence which war absolutely require this be the conduct my lord which i should think most rational even though we be attack in some of we real rights and though the quarrel about which we be debate be we own i should think the nearest danger the greatest and should advise patience under foreign insult till we have redress we domestick grievance till we have drive treachery from the court and corruption from the senate but much more proper do i think this conduct when we be invite only to engage in distant war in a dispute about the dominion of prince in the bowels of the continent of prince of whom it be not certain that we shall receive either advantage or security from they greatness or that we should suffer any loss or injury by they fall but my lord i know it will be answer that the queen of hungary have a right by treaty to we assistance and that in become guarantee of the pragmatick sanction we engage to support she in the dominion of she ancestor this my lord be a answer of which i do not deny the justness and of which i will not attempt to invalidate the strength i allow that such a stipulation be make and that treaty ought to be observe at whatever hazard with unviolated faith it have be indeed object that many nation engage with we in the same treaty whom interest or cowardice have incline to neglect it and that we ought not to become the standing garrison of europe or to defend alone those territory to the preservation of which so many state be oblige to contribute equally with ourselves but this my lord appear to I a argument of which the ill consequence can never be fully discover a argument which dissolve all the obligation of contract destroy the foundation of moral justice and lay society open to all the mischief of perfidy by make the validity of oath and contract dependant upon chance and regulate the duty of one man by the conduct of another i pretend not my lord to long experience and therefore in discuss intricate question may be easily mistaken but as in my opinion my lord morality be seldom difficult but when it be cloud with a intention to deceive other or ourselves i shall venture to declare with more confidence that in proportion as one man neglect he duty another be more strictly oblige to practice he own that he example may not help forward the general corruption and that those who be injure by the perfidy of other may from he sincerity have a prospect of relief i believe all politick that be not found on morality will be find fallacious and destructive if not immediately to those who practice they yet consequentially by they general tendency to disturb society and weaken those obligation which maintain the order of the world i shall therefore allow that what justice require from a private man become in parallel circumstance the duty of a nation and shall therefore never advise the violation of a solemn treaty the stipulation in which we engage when we become guarantee of the pragmatick sanction be doubtless to be observe and it be therefore one of the strongest objection against the measure which we be now pursue that we shall be perfidious at a greater expense than fidelity would have require and shall exhaust the treasure of the nation without assist the queen of hungary to explain this assertion my lord it be necessary to take a view of the constitution of the german body which consist of a great number of separate government independent on each other but subject in some degree to the emperor as the general head the subject of each state be govern by they prince and owe no allegiance to any other sovereign but the prince perform homage to the emperor and have thereby acknowledge himself he feudatory or dependant may be punish for rebellion against he the title of the emperor and consequently he claim to this allegiance and the right of issue the ban against those who shall refuse it be confirm by many solemn acknowledgment of the diet and amongst other by the grant of a pecuniary aid this the present emperor have indisputably receive a aid have be already grant he in the diet of a subsidy for eighteen month and therefore none of the troops of germany can now be employ against he without subject the prince to whom they belong to the censure of the ban a kind of civil excommunication to what purpose then my lord be we to hire at a rate never pay or perhaps demand before troops which can not serve we without subject they prince to the charge of rebellion or how shall we assist the queen of hungary by collect force which dare not act against the only enemy which she have now to fear or in what new difficulty shall we be engage should the inestimable dominion of hanover be subject to the imperial interdiction these my lord be question to which i hope we shall hear a more satisfactory answer than i be able to conceive for indeed i do not see what remain but to confess that these troops be hire only for a military show to amuse this nation with a false appearance of zeal for the preservation of europe and to increase the treasure of hanover at the expense of britain these be design my lord which no man will avow and yet these be the only design which i can yet discover and therefore i shall oppose all the measure that tend to they execution if the heat of indignation or the asperity of resentment or the wantonness of contempt have betray I into any expression unworthy of the dignity of this house i hope they will be forgive by you lordship for any other degree of freedom i shall make no apology have as a peer a right to deliver my opinion and as a briton to assert the independence of my native country when i see or imagine myself to see that it be ignominiously and illegally subject to the promotion of the petty interest of the province of hanover lord carteret then rise and make answer to the following effect : -- my lord as i doubt not but i shall be able to justify the measure which be now pursue in such a manner as may entitle they to the approbation of you lordship i propose to hear all the objection that should be make before i attempt a vindication that the debate might be shorten and that the argument on both side might be consider as place in the full strength of opposition and that it might be discern how objection however specious in themselves would vanish before the light of reason and truth but the noble lord have make it necessary for I to alter my design by a speech which i will not applaud because it have in my opinion a ill tendency nor censure because it want neither the splendor of eloquence nor the art of reasoning and have no other defect than that which must always be produce by a bad cause fallacy in the argument and error in the assertion this speech i be oblige to answer because he lordship have be please to call out for any lord who will assert that the dutch have agree to concur with we in assist the queen of hungary that all the province of that republick have agree to assist we be indeed not true nor do i know my lord by whom or upon what authority it be assert but the concurrence of the province of holland the most important of all and whose example the rest seldom delay to follow have be obtain which be sufficient to encourage we to vigorous resolution by which the rest may be animated to a speedy compliance the concurrence of this province have be already the consequence of the measure which have be lately pursue measure from which though just and successful the ministry can not claim much applause because all choice be deny and they be oblige either to remain passive spectator of the ruin of europe and by consequence of britain or to do what they have do and surely my lord that necessity which deprive they of all claim to panegyrick will be likewise a sufficient security from censure there be indeed no reason to fear censure from judge so candid and experienced as you lordship to whom it may without difficulty be prove that the balance of europe have already change its position and the house of bourbon be now not able to preponderate against the other power by enter into a alliance with sardinium we have take from the crown of spain all the weight of the territory of italy of which the austrian force be now in possession without fear or danger of be interrupt while the pass of the ocean be shut by the fleet of britain and those of the mountain by the troops of sardinium those unhappy force which be transport by the spanish fleet be not only lose to they native country but expose without provision without ammunition without retreat and without hope : nor can any human prospect discover how they can escape destruction either by the fatigue of march or the want of necessaries or the superior force of a army well supply and elate with success this my lord be a embarrassment from which the spaniard would gladly be free at any expense from which they would bribe we to relieve they by permit the demolition of new fortress or restore the army which we lose at carthagena of this alliance the queen of hungary already find the advantage as it preserve country in she possession which if once lose it might be impossible to recover and set she free from the necessity of divide she army for the protection of distant territory thus my lord the spaniard be obstruct and distrust of they army one be condemn to waste away at the foot of impassable mountain only to hear of the destruction of they countryman whom they be endeavor to relieve and the establishment of peace in these region of which they have project the conquest and the other yet more unfortunate have be successfully transport only to see that fleet which permit they passage preclude they supplies and hinder they retreat nor do we my lord after have thus efficaciously oppose one of the prince of the house of bourbon fear or shun the resentment of the other we doubt not to show that britain be still able to retard the arm of the haughty french and to drive they back from the invasion of other kingdom to the defense of they own the time be at hand my lord in which it will appear that however the power of france have be exaggerate with whatever servility she protection have be court and with whatever meanness she insolence have be bear this nation have not yet lose its influence or its strength that it be yet able to fill the continent with army to afford protection to its ally and strike terror into those who have hitherto trample under foot the faith of treaty and rights of sovereign and range over the dominion of the neighbouring prince with the security of lawful possessor and the pride of conqueror it have be object by the noble lord that this change be not to be expect from a army compose of auxiliary troops from any of the province of the german empire because they can not act against the general head i can easily my lord solve this difficulty from my long acquaintance with the constitution of the empire which i understand before the noble lord who have entertain you with a discourse upon it be in be but i will not engross you time or retard you determination by a superfluous disquisition which may be now safely omit since i be allow by he majesty to assure you lordship that the hessian and hanoverian troops shall be employ in assist the queen of hungary and that they have already receive order to make the preparation necessary for march into the empire after this declaration my lord the most formidable objection against the present measure will i hope be no more hear in this debate for it will be by no means proper for any lord to renew it by inquire whether he majesty 's resolution be not a breach of the imperial constitution or whether it will not expose he electoral dominion to danger for it be not we province to judge of the law of other nation to examine when they be violate or to enforce the observation of they nor be it necessary since the interest of britain and hanover be irreconcilably opposite to endeavor the preservation of dominion which they own sovereign be incline to hazard thus my lord i hope it appear that the common interest of britain and europe be steadily pursue that the spaniard feel the effect of a war with britain by they distress and embarrassment that the queen of hungary discover that the ancient ally of she family have not desert she and that france amidst she boast and she project perceive the determine opposer of she grandeur again set she at defiance the duke of bedford speak to the following effect : -- my lord the assurance which the noble lord who speak last declare himself to have conceive of be able to demonstrate the propriety of the present measure must surely arise from some intelligence which have be hitherto suppress or some knowledge of future event peculiar to himself for i can not discover any force in the argument which he have be please to use that could produce in he such confidence of success nor any circumstance in the present appearance of europe that do not seem to demand a different conduct the reasonableness of we measure at this time as at all other must be evince by argument draw from a attentive review of the state of we own country compare with that of the neighbouring nation for no man will deny that those method of proceeding which be at one time useful may at another be pernicious and that either a gradual rotation of power or a casual variation of interest may very properly produce change in the counsel of the most steady and vigorous administration it be therefore proper in the examination of this question to consider what be the state of we own nation and what be to be hope or fear from the condition of those kingdom which be most enable by they situation to benefit or to hurt we : and in inquiry my lord a inquiry that can give little pleasure to a honest and benevolent mind it immediately occur that we be a nation exhaust by a long war and impoverish by the diminution of we commerce and the result therefore of this first consideration be that those measure be most eligible which be most frugal and that to waste the publick treasure in unnecessary expense or to load the people with new tax only to display a mockery of war on the continent or to amuse ourselves we ally or we enemy with the idle ostentation of unnecessary number be to drain from the nation the last remains of its ancient vigor instead of assist its recovery from its present languor but money however valuable however necessary have sometimes be imprudently and unseasonably spare and a ill-timed parsimony have be know to hasten calamity by which those have be deprive of all who would not endeavor to preserve it by the loss of part it be therefore to be consider whether measure less expensive would not have be more dangerous and whether we have not by hire foreign troops though at a very high rate at a rate which would have be demand from no other nation purchase a exemption from distress insult and invasion the only nation my lord whom we have any reason to suspect of a design to invade we or that have power to put any such design in execution be well know to be the french and spaniard from these indeed it may justly be expect that they will omit no opportunity of gratify that hatred which difference of religion and contrariety of interest can not fail to continue from age to age and therefore we ought never to imagine ourselves safe while it be in they power to endanger we but of these two nation my lord the one be already disarm by the navy of britain which confine she fleet to they harbor and as we have be just now inform preclude she army from supplies : the other be without a fleet able to transport a army she troops be disperse in different country and she treasure exhaust by expedition or negotiation equally expensive there be therefore my lord no danger of a invasion even though we have no force by which it could be oppose but much less be it to be fear when it be remember that the sea be cover with we ship of war and that all the coast of europe be awed and alarm by the navy of britain this then my lord be surely the time when we ought not to have sacrifice any immediate and apparent interest to the fear of attempt from spain or france when we might without danger have assist we ally with we national troops and have spare that money which we have so lavishly bestow upon auxiliary when we might securely have show the power of the continent how much the british valor be yet to be fear and how little we late loss or disgrace be to be imputed to the decline of we courage or we strength i suppose my lord no man will confess that foreign troops have be hire as more to be trust for they skill or bravery than we own to dispute the palm of courage with any nation would be a reproach to the british name and if we soldier be not at least equally discipline with those of other country it must be own that tax have be long pay to little purpose that the glitter of review have be justly ridicule as a empty show and that we have long be flatter by we minister and general with false security but though i be far from believe that the army have be support only for the defense of we country and though i know that they officer be frequently engage in employment more important in the opinion of they director than that of regulate the discipline of they regiment and teach the use of arm and the science of war yet as i believe the courage of briton such as may often supply the want of skill i can not but conclude that they be at least as formidable as the troops of other country especially when i remember that they enter the field incite and support by the reputation of they country why then my lord be the nation condemn to support at once a double burden to pay at home a army which can be of no use and to hire auxiliary perhaps equally unactive to make war if any war be intend at a unnecessary expense and to pay at once a fleet which only float upon the ocean a army which only awe the village from which it be support and a body of mercenary of which no man can yet conjecture with what design they have be retain that they be intend for the support of the queen of hungary have be indeed assert and this contract have be produce as a instance of the zeal of we minister for the assertion of the pragmatick sanction the preservation of the liberty of europe and the suppression of the ambitious enterprise of the house of bourbon but surely my lord have the assistance of that illustrious princess be they sole or principal intention have they in reality dedicate the sum which be to be receive by the troops of hanover to the sacred cause of publick faith and universal liberty they might have find method of promote it much more efficaciously at no greater expense have they remit that money to the queen she would have be enable to call nation to she standard to fill the plain of germany with the hardy inhabitant of the mountain and the desert and have deluge the empire of france with multitude equally daring and rapacious who would have descend upon a fruitful country like vulture on they prey and have lay those province in ruin which now smile at the devastation of neighbouring country secure in the protection of they mighty monarch by this method of carry on the war we might have secure we ally from danger which i can not but think imminent and formidable though it seem at present not to be fear by so large a addition to she troops she would have be enable to frustrate those design which she success may incline the king of prussium to form against she for with whatever tranquillity he may now seem to look upon this general commotion he conduct give we no reason to imagine that he have change he maxim that he be now forgetful or negligent of he own interest or that he will not snatch the first opportunity of aggrandize himself by new pretension to the queen of hungary 's dominion at least my lord it may without scruple be assert that the hope which some either form or affect of engage he in a confederacy for the support of the pragmatick sanction be merely chimerical he who have hitherto consider no interest but he own he who have perhaps endanger himself by attempt to weaken the only power to which he as well as the other prince of the empire can have recourse for protection from the ambition of france and have therefore break the rule of policy only to gratify a favorite passion will scarcely concur in the exaltation of that family which he have so lately endeavor to depress and which he have so much exasperate against he if he be at length my lord alarm at the ambition of the house of bourbon and have learn not to facilitate those design which be in reality form against himself it can not be doubt that he look with equal fear on the house of austrium that he know he safety to consist only in the weakness of both and that in any contest between they the utmost that can be hope from he be neutrality but my lord he whose security depend only on a supposition that man will not deviate from right reason or true policy be in a state which can afford he very little tranquillity or confidence : whatever be necessarily to be preserve ought to be defend not only from certain and constant danger but from casual and possible injury and amongst the rest from those which may proceed from the mutability of will or the depravation of understand nor shall we sufficiently establish the house of austrium if we leave it liable to be shake whenever the king of prussium shall feel he ambition rekindle or he malevolence excite we must not leave it dependant on the friendship or policy of the neighbouring power but must enable it once more to awe the empire and set at defiance the malice of its enemy this my lord might have be do by a liberal subsidy by which army might have be levy garrison establish and city fortify and why any other method be pursue what reason can be assign what but a inclination to aggrandize and enrich a contemptible province and to deck with the plunder of britain the electorate of hanover it have be suspect my lord -lrb- nor have the suspicion be without foundation -rrb- that we measure have long be regulate by the interest of he majesty 's electoral territory these have be long consider as a gulf into which the treasure of this nation have be throw and it have be observe that the state of the country have since the accession of its prince to this throne be change without any visible cause affluence have begin to wanton in they town and gold to glitter in they cottage without the discovery of mine or the increase of they trade and new dominion have be purchase of which it can scarcely be imagine that the value be pay out of the revenue of hanover this my lord be unpopular illegal and unjust yet this might be bear in consideration of great advantage of the protection of we trade and the support of we honor but there be man who dare to whisper and who perhaps if they suspicion receive new confirmation will publickly declare that for the preservation of hanover we commerce have be neglect and we honor impair that to secure hanover from invasion the house of bourbon have be court and the family of austrium embarrassed and depressed these man assert without hesitation that when we enter into a league with france against the emperor and the spaniard in the reign of the late emperor no part of the british dominion be in danger and that the alarm which be raise to reconcile the nation to measure so contrary to those which former age have pursue be a fictitious detestable artifice of wicked policy by which britain be engage in the defense of dominion to which we owe no regard as we can receive no real advantage from they it be to be wish that no late instance could be produce of conduct regulate by the same principle and that this shameful this pernicious partiality have be universally allow to have cease with the late reign but it have never yet be show that the late neutrality by which hanover be preserve do not restrain the arm of britain nor when it have be ask why the spanish army be when within reach of the cannon of the british navy peaceably transport to italy have any other reason be assign than that the transport could not be destroy without a breach of the neutrality of hanover this my lord be a subject on which i could have only be induce to dwell by my zeal for the present establishment and my personal affection for he majesty it be universally allow that not only the honor and prosperity but the safety of a british monarch depend upon the affection of he subject and that neither splendid levee nor large revenue nor stand army can secure he happiness or he power any longer than the people be convince of he tenderness and regard of he attention to they complaint and he zeal for they interest if therefore it should ever be generally believe that we king consider this nation only as appendent to he electoral dominion that he promote the interest of he former subject at the expense of those by whom he have be exalt to this awful throne and that we commerce we treasure and we life be sacrifice to the safety or to the enlargement of distant territory what can be expect what but murmur disaffection and distrust and they natural consequence insurrection and rebellion rebellion of which no man can foresee the event and by which that man may perhaps be place upon the throne whom we have so wisely exclude and so solemnly abjure of this unreasonable regard to the interest of hanover the contract which we be now consider exhibit if not a proof too apparent to be deny yet such a appearance as we ought for we own sake and that of he majesty to obviate and therefore i think the address which be now propose in the highest degree reasonable and be convince that by comply with we request he majesty will regain the affection of many of he subject whom a long train of pernicious measure have fill with discontent and preserve the loyalty of many other who by artful representation of the motive and consequence of this contract may be alienate and pervert lord bathurst reply to the follow purport : -- my lord as i have no reason to doubt of the noble duke 's affection to the present royal family i be convince that the ardor of he expression be the effect of he zeal and that the force of he representation proceed only from the strength of he conviction and therefore i be far from intend to censure any accidental negligence of language or any seeming asperity of sentiment i know that the openness and dignity of mind which have incite he to declare he opinion with so much freedom will induce he likewise to retract it when he shall be convince that he have be deceive by false representation or that he have form he conclusion too hastily without a attentive examination of the question in its whole extent i shall therefore endeavor to explain the motive upon which all these measure have be form which we have hear so warmly censure and show that they be the consequence not of haste and negligence but of vigilance and circumspection that they be form upon a deliberate survey of the complicated interest of the european power and dictate not by a partiality to hanover but a faithful attention to the interest of britain it have be already observe by a noble lord that there be no choice allow we that the state of europe require that we should not sit unactive and that yet there be no other method of act by which we could benefit we ally or injure we enemy and that therefore though we interposition have not produce all the effect which we zeal might incline we to wish yet we conduct ought not to be condemn because though we do not press forward through the nearest path to the great object of we pursuit we exert we utmost speed in the only way that be leave open this my lord be in my opinion a very just apology nor do i see that this vindication can be confute or invalidate otherwise than by show that some different measure measure equally reasonable be equally in we power but because the plea of necessity may perhaps be evade and because it be at least please to discover that what be necessary be likewise convenient i shall endeavor to show that we measure have produce already such effect as have sufficiently reward we expense and that we may yet reasonably hope that greater advantage will arise from they there be indeed some whom it will not be easy to satisfy some who declare not against the manner in which the war be prosecute but against the war itself who think the power of france too formidable to be oppose and the british people too much exhaust or enervate to hold any longer the balance of the continent i have indeed my lord always declare myself of a different opinion and have frequently endeavor to rouse other from a kind of indolent despair and tame acquiescence in the attempt of the french by representation of the wealth and force the influence and alliance of we own nation i have often assert that i do not doubt but she conquest might be stop by vigorous opposition and that the current of she power which have by artificial machine of policy be raise higher than its source would subside and stagnate when its course be no longer assist by cowardice and its way level by submission these my lord be my sentiment and this be my language at a time when all the power of europe conspire to flatter the pride of france by fall at she foot when she nod be solicitously watch by all the prince of the empire when there be no safety but by she protection nor any enterprise but by she permission when she wealth influence the council of nation when war be declare at she command in the remotest corner of europe and every contest be submit to she arbitration even at this time my lord be i sufficiently confident of the power of my own country to set at defiance in my own mind this gigantick state i consider all addition to its greatness rather as the tumor of disease than the shooting of vigor and think that its nerve grow weaker as its corpulence increase of my own nation i see that neither its number nor its courage be diminish i have no reason to believe we soldier or we sailor less brave than they father and therefore imagine that whenever they should be lead out against the same enemy they would fight with the same superiority and the same success but for these hope my lord i be sometimes pity by those who think themselves better acquaint with the state of europe than myself and sometimes ridicule by those who have be long accustom to depress they own country and to represent britain as only the shadow of what it once be to deride we army and we fleet and describe we impoverished and corrupted sink into cowardice and delighted with slavery that my opinion be now likely to be justified and that those who have hitherto so confidently oppose I will soon be oblige to acknowledge they mistake be of very small importance nor be my self-love so predominant as to incline I to reckon the confirmation of my prediction or the vindication of my sagacity among the benefit which we be now about to receive we be now soon to be convince that france be not irresistible nor irresistible to britain we be now to see the embroiler of the universe entangled in they own scheme and the depopulator of kingdom destroy in those field which they have so wantonly lay waste we shall see justice triumphant over oppression and insolence trample by those whom she have despise we shall see the power of europe once more equally balanced and the balance place again in the hand of britain if it be require upon what event these expectation be found and if it be allege that we have no such resolution to hope from the measure that have be hitherto pursue it have be affirm by a noble lord that we army in flander be useless and that we motion have give neither courage nor strength to any other power that the queen of hungary be yet equally distressed and that the french still pursue they scheme without any interruption from we or we ally i shall hope by a impartial account of the present state of the continent to show that he assertion be groundless and he opinion erroneous the inactivity of we army in flander have indeed furnish a popular topick of declamation and ridicule it be well know how little the bulk of mankind be acquaint either with art of policy or of war how imperfectly they must always understand the conduct of minister or general and with what partiality they always determine in favor of they own nation ignorance my lord conjoin with partiality must always produce expectation which no address nor courage can gratify and it be scarcely therefore to be hope that the people will be satisfy with any account of the conduct of we general which do not inform they of siege and battle slaughter and devastation they expect that a british army should overrun the continent in a summer that town should surrender at they summons and legion retire at they shout that they should drive nation before they and conquer empire by march over they such my lord be the effect which the people of britain expect and as they have hitherto be disappoint they disappointment incline they to complain they think a army useless which gain no victory and ask to what purpose the sword be draw if the blood of they enemy be not to be shed but these be not the sentiment of you lordship whose acquaintance with publick affair inform you that victory be often gain where no standard be take nor newspaper fill with list of the slay and that by draw the sword opportunely the necessity of striking be often prevent you know that the army which hover over a country and draw the force which defend it to one part may destroy it without invade it by expose it to the invasion of another and that he who withhold a army from action be not less useful to he ally than he that defeat it this my lord be the present use of we troops in flander the french be keep in continual terror and be oblige to detach to that frontier those troops which have they not be thus divert would have be employ in the empire and surely a army be not unactive which withhold a double number from prosecute they design that we motion have not encourage other power to fulfil they engagement or to unite in the defense of the general liberty of europe can not truly be assert the dutch apparently waken from they slumber whether it be real or affect they at least discover less fear of the french and have already give such proof of they inclination to join with we as may encourage we to expect that they will in a short time form with we another confederacy and employ they utmost effort in the common cause what they have already offer will at least enable we to assist the queen of hungary with greater number and she to employ she troops where she be most press for they have engage to garrison the town of flander which since they can not be evacuate be in effect a offer of auxiliary troops since if those force have be add to the austrian army a equal number of austrian must have be subduct to garrison the frontier it be therefore without reason that narrow-minded censurer charge we with become the slave of the dutch with fight they battle and defend they barrier while they pursue they commerce in tranquillity enjoy peace at the expense of british blood and grow rich by the profusion of british treasure it appear that they concur in the preservation of themselves and of europe though with delay and caution since though they do not send force into the field they supply the place of those which be send and enable other to destroy those whom they be not yet persuade to attack themselves the constitution of that republick be indeed such as make its alliance not valuable on sudden emergency in proportion to its wealth and power the determination of large assembly be always slow because there be many opinion to be examine many proposal to be balanced and many objection to be answer but with much more difficulty must any important resolution be form where it must be the joint act of the whole assembly where every individual have a negative voice and unanimity alone can make a decision obligatory wherever this be the form of government the state lie at the mercy of every man who have a vote in its council and the corruption or folly or obstinacy of one may retard or defeat the most important design lay he country open to the inroad of a enemy dissolve the most solemn alliance and involve a nation in misery this my lord i need not observe to be the dutch constitution nor need i tell this assembly that we be not always to judge of the general inclination of that people by the procedure of they deputy since particular man may be influence by private view or corrupt by secret promise or bribe and those design may be retard by they artifice which the honest and impartial universally approve this be perhaps the true reason of the present delay which have furnish occasion to such loud complaint complaint of which we may hope quickly to have a end since it can hardly be doubt but the general voice of the people will there as in other place at last prevail and the prejudice or passion of private man give way to the interest of the publick that the queen of hungary be now equally distressed and that she have receive no advantage from the assistance which we have at so great a expense appear to give she be likewise very far from be true let any man compare she present condition with that in which she be before britain engage in she cause and it will easily be perceive how much she owe to the alliance of this nation she be then fly before she enemy and reduce to seek for shelter in the remotest part of she dominion while she capital be fortify in expectation of a siege those who then be distribute she province and who almost hover over she only remain kingdom be now retire before she troops the army by which it be intend that she territory in italy should be take from she be now starve in the country which it presume to invade and the troops which be send to its assistance be languish at the foot of mountain which they will never pass these be the effect my lord of those measure which for want of be completely understand or attentively consider have be so vehemently censure these measure my lord however injudicious however unseasonable have embarrass the design of france and give relief to the queen of hungary they have animated the dutch to action and kindle in all the power of europe who be intimidate by the french army new hope and new resolution they have indeed make a general change in the state of europe and give a new inclination to the balance of power not many month have elapse since every man appear to consider the sovereign of france as the universal monarch whose will be not to be oppose and whose force be not to be resist we now see he menace despise and he proposition reject every one now appear to hope rather than to fear though lately a general panick be spread over this part of the globe and fear have so engrossed mankind that scarcely any man presume to hope but it be object my lord that though we measure should be allow not to have be wholly ineffectual and we money appear not to have be squander only to pay the troops of hanover yet we conduct be very far from merit either applause or approbation since much greater advantage might have be purchase at much less expense and by method much less invidious and dangerous the queen of hungary might in the opinion of these censurer have raise a hundred thousand man with the money which we must expend in hire only sixteen thousand and might have destroy those enemy whom we have hitherto not dare to attack those who make this supposition the foundation of they censure appear not to remember that the queen of hungary 's dominion like those of other prince may by war be in time exhaust that the loss of inhabitant be not repair in any country but by slow degree and that there be no place yet discover where money will procure soldier without end or where new harvest of man rise up annually ready to fight those quarrel in which they predecessor be sweep away if the money have instead of be employ in hire auxiliary be remit to the queen it be not probable that she could at any rate have bring a new army together but it be certain that she new troops must have be without arm and without discipline it might have be find perhaps in this general disturbance of the world not easy to have supply they with weapon and it be well know how long time be require to teach raw force the art of war and enable they to stand before a veteran enemy it be therefore necessary to assist she rather with troops than money and since troops be necessarily to be hire why should we employ the force of hanover less willingly than those of any other nation to assert that they have more or less courage than other be chimerical nor can any man suppose they either more brave or timorous than those of the neighbouring country without discover the meanest prejudice and the narrowest conception without show that he be wholly unacquainted with human nature and that he be influence by the tale of nurse and the boast of child there be therefore no objection against the troops of hanover that be not of equal strength against all foreign troops and there be at least one argument in they favor that they be subject of the same prince and that therefore we could have no reason to fear they defection or to suspect they fidelity the electorate of hanover with whatever contempt or indignation some person may affect to mention it be to be consider at least as a state in alliance with britain and to receive from we that support which the term of that alliance may demand any other regard my lord indeed it be not necessary to contend for since it can not be prove that in this transaction we have act otherwise than as with ally or hire the troops on condition which those of any other nation would not have obtain or on any which they will not deserve since you lordship have receive assurance that they be ready to enter the field and to march into germany against the common enemy that we might have raise new troops in we own nation and have augment we army with a equal number of man can not be deny nor do i doubt my lord but we countryman would be equally formidable with any other force but it must be remember that a army be not to be levy in a instant and that we native however warlike be not bear with the knowledge of the use of arm and who know whether europe might not have be enslave before a british army could have be raise and discipline for its deliverance whether this account of we measure will satisfy those who have hitherto condemn they i be not able to foretel there be indeed some reason for suspect that they blame not because they disapprove but because they think it necessary either to the character of discernment or of probity to censure the ministry whatever maxim be pursue of this disposition it be no slight proof that contrary measure have be sometimes condemn by the same man with the same vehemence and that even compliance with they demand have not still they outcry when the ministry appear unwilling to engage in the war of germany without the concurrence of the other power who have engage to support the pragmatick sanction they be hourly reproach with be the slave of france with betray the general cause of europe and with repress that generous ardor by which we ancestor have be incite to stand forth as the asserter of universal liberty and to fight the quarrel of mankind they be mark out as either coward or traitor and doom to infamy as the accomplice of tyranny engage in a conspiracy against they ally they country and they posterity at length the briton have rouse again and again declare themselves the supporter of right whenever injure they have again raise they standard in the continent and prepare to march again through those region where they victory be yet celebrate and they bravery yet reverence the hill of germany will again sound with the shout of that people who once march to she deliverance through all the obstruction that art or power could form against they and which break through the pass of schellembourg to rout the army that be range behind it now it might be expect my lord that at least those who be before dissatisfied should declare they approbation for surely where peace or neutrality be improper there be nothing left but war yet experience show we that man resolve to blame will never want pretence for vent they malignity and where nothing but malignity be the consequence of opposite measure we must necessarily conclude that there be a fixed resolution to blame and that all vindication will be ineffectual some have indeed find out a middle course between censure and approbation and declare that they think these measure now justifiable because we have proceed too far to retreat with honor and that though at first a better scheme might have be form yet this which have hitherto be pursue ought not now to be change i my lord though it be not of very great importance to confute a opinion by which the measure of the government will not be obstruct can not forbear to declare myself of different sentiment and to assert in opposition to artful calumny and violent invective that the present measure be originally right that they be such as prudence would dictate and experience approve and such as we ought again to take if we have again the power of choice i be indeed far from doubt but these measure will in a short time be justify by success a criterion by which however unjustly the greatest part of mankind will always judge of the conduct of they governor for it be apparent my lord that howsoever the french power commerce and wealth have be exaggerate by those that either love or fear they they will not long be able to stand against we they fund will in a short time fail they and they army must be disband when they can no longer be pay lest instead of protect they country they should be incline to plunder it the abundance of we wealth my lord and the profit of we commerce be sufficiently apparent from the price of we stock which be never before support at the same height for so long a time and of the fall of which neither a actual war with spain nor the danger which have be suggest of another with france with france in the full possession of all its boast advantage have yet be able to produce any token another proof of the exuberance of we riches and the prosperity of we commerce by which they be acquire be the facility with which the government can raise in a instant the greatest sum and the low interest at which they be obtain if we compare we state in this respect with that of france the insuperable difficulty under which they must contend with we will sufficiently discover themselves it be well know my lord that we have lately raise the money which the service of each year require at the interest of three for a hundred nor be it likely that there will be any necessity of larger interest though we annual demand be to be equal to those of the last war but the french be well know to raise the sum which they exigency require on very different term and to have pay ten for a hundred for all the money which they late project have require project which they can not pursue long at such enormous expense and by which they country must in a short time be ruin even without opposition while we can therefore raise three million for less than the french can obtain one and by consequence support three regiment at the same expense as one be support in they service we have surely no reason to dread the superiority of they number or to fear that they will conquer by exhaust we thus my lord i have deliver my opinion with freedom and impartiality and shall patiently hearken to any objection that shall arise against it support by the consciousness that a confutation will only show I that i have be mistaken but will not deprive I of the satisfaction of reflect that i have not be want to my country and that if i have approve or defend improper measure i at least consult no other interest than that of britain lord hervey speak next to the following effect : -- my lord it be not without that concern which every man ought to feel at the apparent approach of publick calamity that i have hear the measure which be now the subject of we inquiry so weakly defend when they vindication be endeavor with so much ardor and labor with so much address the objection which press upon the mind at the first and slightest view of we proceedings be such as require the closest attention such as can not but alarm every man who have study the interest of he country and who sincerely endeavor to promote it and therefore it might be hope that those who appear to have think they insufficient be able to produce in opposition to they the strongest argument and the clearest deduction when we attempt the consideration of we present condition and inquire by what mean we prosperity may be secure the first reflection that occur be that we be trader that all we power be the consequence of we wealth and we wealth the product of we trade it be well know that trade can only be pursue under the security of peace that a nation which have a larger commerce must make war on disadvantageous term against one that have less as of two contiguous country the more fruitful have most to fear from a invasion by its neighbor it be visible likewise to any man who consider the situation of britain that there be no nation by which we trade can in time of war be so much obstruct as by france of which the coast be opposite to ours and which can send out small vessel and seize we merchant in the mouth of we harbor or in the channel of which we boast the sovereignty : and all those who have hear or read of the last war in which we gain so much honor and so little advantage know that the privateer of france injured we more than its navy or its army and that a thousand victory on the continent where we be only contend for the rights of other be a very small recompense for the obstruction of we commerce nor can he feel much tenderness for mankind who would purchase by the ruin and distress of a thousand family industrious and innocent the momentary festivity of a triumph or the idle glare of a illumination yet my lord this nation however zealous for its commerce be about to engage in a war in a war with the only state by which we commerce can be impaired it be about to support new army on the continent without ally and without treasure that we be without treasure and that we trade by which only we fund can be supply have lately be very much diminish be too easy to prove in opposition to the specious display which the noble lord who speak last have be please to make of the exuberance of we wealth if the abundance of we riches be such as it have be represent why be no measure form for the payment of the publick debt of which no man will say that they be not in themselves a calamity and the source of many calamity yet greater of which it can not be deny that they multiply dependence by which we constitution may sometimes be endanger why be those debt not only unpaid but increase by annual addition to such a height that the payment of they must soon become desperate and the publick sink under the burden that we trade my lord and by consequence we wealth be of late diminish may be prove beyond controversy even to those whose interest it be not to believe it and upon whom therefore it can not be expect that argument will have a great effect the produce of the custom be the last year less by half a million than the mean revenue and as we custom must always bear a certain proportion to trade we may form a indisputable estimate from they of its increase or its decline the rise of we stock my lord be such a proof of riches as dropsical tumor be of health it show not the circulation but the stagnation of we money and though it may flatter we with a false appearance of plenty for a time will soon prove that it be both the effect and cause of poverty and will end in weakness and destruction when commerce flourish when its profit be certain and secure man will employ they money in the exchange of commodity by which greater advantage may be gain than by put it into the hand of broker but when every ship be in danger of be intercept by privateer and the insurer divide the profit of every voyage with the merchant it be natural to choose a safer though a less profitable traffick and rather to treasure money in the fund than expose it on the ocean but my lord the minister themselves have sufficiently declare they opinion of the state of the national wealth by the method which they have take to raise those supplies of which they boast with how great facility they be raise when they find that new expense require new tax it be necessary to examine what could be tax or upon which part of the nation any other burden could be lay without immediate ruin they turn over the catalogue of all we manufacture and find that scarcely any of the conveniency or even the necessaries of life be without a impost they examine all the class of we trader and readily discover that the greatest number of those who endeavor to support themselves by honest industry be struggle with poverty and scarcely able to provide to-day what would be necessary to-morrow they see we prison crowd with debtor and we papers fill with the name of bankrupt of whom many may be suppose to have miscarry without idleness extravagance or folly they see therefore my lord that industry must sink under any addition to its load a consideration which could afford no proof of the abundance of we wealth they see that we commodity would be no longer manufacture if they tax be increase and therefore it be necessary to raise money by some other method since all those which have be hitherto practice be preclude this my lord be no easy task but however difficult it have be accomplish and to those great politician must posterity be indebted for a new scheme of supply the expense of a war in the time of the late ministry it have be observe that drunkenness be become a vice almost universal among the common people and that as the liquor which they generally drink be such that they could destroy they reason by a small quantity and at a small expense the consequence of general drunkenness be general idleness since no man would work any longer than be necessary to lay he asleep for the remain part of the day they remark likewise that the liquor which they generally drink be to the last degree pernicious to health and destructive of that corporeal vigor by which the business of life be to be carry on and a law be therefore make by which it be intend that this species of debauchery so peculiarly fatal should be prevent against the end of this law no man have hitherto make the least objection no one have dare to signalize himself as a open advocate for vice or attempt to prove that drunkenness be not injurious to society and contrary to the true end of human be the encouragement of wickedness of this shameful kind wickedness equally contemptible and hateful be reserve for the present ministry who be now about to supply those fund which they have exhaust by idle project and romantick expedition at the expense of health and virtue who have discover a method of recruit army by the destruction of they fellow-subject and while they boast themselves the assertor of liberty be endeavor to enslave we by the introduction of those vice which in all country and in every age have make way for despotick power even this expedient my lord must in a short time fail they the product of vice as well as of commerce must in time be exhaust and what will then remain the honest and industrious must feel the weight of some new imposition which the sagacity of experienced oppression may find means to lay upon they they will then first find the benefit of this new law since they may by the use of those liquor which be indulge they put a speedy end to that life which they make unable to support the means by which the expense of we present design be to be support such means my lord as be never yet practice by any state however exhaust or however endanger means which a wise nation would scarcely use to repel a invader from the capital or to raise work to keep off a general inundation raise yet stronger motion of indignation when it be consider for what design these expense be require we be now my lord raise army and hire auxiliary for a expedition of which no necessity can be discover and from which neither honor nor advantage can be expect we be about to force from the people the last remains of they property and to harass with exaction those who be already languish with poverty not for the preservation of we liberty or the defense of we country but for the support of the pragmatick sanction for the execution of a very unjust scheme form by the late king to which he purchase at different time on different emergency the concurrence of other power but to which he fail to put the last seal of confirmation perhaps in hope of a male heir and leave the design which he have so long and so industriously labor to be at last complete by the kindness of he ally have by a unsuccessful war against the turk exhaust he treasure and weaken he troops whether we shall now engage in this design whether we shall for the defense of the pragmatick sanction begin another war on the continent of which the duration can not be determine the expense estimate or the event foresee whether we shall contend at once with all the prince of the house of bourbon and entangle ourselves in a labyrinth of different scheme whether we shall provoke france to interrupt we commerce and invade we colony and stand without the assistance of a single ally against those power that lately set almost all europe at defiance be now to be determine by you lordship it can scarcely be expect that the french will treat we only as auxiliary and satisfy themselves with attack we only where they find themselves oppose by we : they will undoubtedly my lord consider we as principal since they can suffer little more by declare war against we these my lord be the danger to be fear from the measure which we be now persuade to pursue but persuade by argument which in my opinion ought to have very little influence upon we and which have not yet be able however artfully or zealously enforce to prevail upon the dutch to unite with we it have indeed be assert that the dutch appear incline to assist we : but of that inclination stronger proof ought surely to be produce before we take auxiliary into pay and transport troops into another country which have be so often represent to have be raise for the defense of they own or collect money from the publick by the propagation of wickedness of this favourable inclination in the dutch i be the more doubtful because it be contrary to the expectation of all mankind and to the maxim by which they have generally regulate they conduct there have be many late instance of they patient submission to the invasion of privilege to which they have think themselves entitle and of they preference of peace though sometimes purchase with the loss of honor or what may be suppose to touch a dutchman much more nearly of profit to the devastation and expense and hazard of war and it can hardly be suppose by any who know they character that they will be more zealous for the rights of other than for they own or that they will for the support of the queen of hungary sacrifice that security and tranquillity which they have prefer at the expense of they commerce at one time and by passive submission to insult at another that a nation like this my lord will in the quarrel of another engage in any but moderate measure be not to be expect : it be not improbable that they may endeavor by embassy and negotiation to adjust the present dispute or offer they mediation to the contend power but i be very far from imagine that they will find in themselves any disposition to raise army or equip fleet that they will endanger the barrier which have be so dearly purchase or expose themselves to the hazard and terror of a french war and be therefore incline to believe that if any tendency towards such measure now appear it be only the effect of the present heat of some vehement declaimer or the secret machination of some artful projector among they who have form chimerical plan of a new system of europe and have in they imagination regulate the distribution of dominion and power or who perhaps have diminish they patrimony by negligence and extravagance and hope to repair they in time of confusion and to glean part of that harvest of treasure which the publick must be oblige to yield in time of war i be still incline to believe that the true interest of the republick will be consult that policy will prevail over intrigue and that only moderate measure will be pursue by the general council of the state moderate measure my lord if not always the most honorable in the opinion of mind vitiate by false notion of grandeur be at least always the most safe and be therefore eligible at least till the scene of affair begin to open and the success of a more vigorous conduct may with some degree of certainty be foreknow and it must at least be think imprudent for those to hazard much who can gain nothing and therefore it will not be easy to assign any reason that may justify we conduct on the present occasion it be not improbable my lord that those who have now obtain the direction of we affair may be influence by the general disapprobation which the british people show of the pacifick conduct of the late ministry and may have resolve to endeavor after applause by show more spirit and activity but my lord of two opposite scheme it be not impossible that both may be wrong and that the middle way only may be safe nor be it uncommon for those who be precipitately fly from one extreme to rush blindly upon another but we ministry my lord have find out a method of complicating error which none of they predecessor however stigmatize for ignorance and absurdity have hitherto be able to attain they have be able to reconcile the extreme of folly and to endanger the publick interest at the same time by inactivity and romantick temerity no accusation against the late ministry be more general more atrocious or more adapt to incense the people than that of neglect the war against spain : this be the subject of all the invective which be vent against they in the senate or dispersed among the people for this they be charge with a secret confederacy against they country with disregard of its commerce and its arm and with a design to ruin the nation for no other end than to punish the merchant to this accusation my lord diligently propagate willingly receive and to confess the truth confirm by some appearance do those owe they power who now preside over the affair of the nation and it might therefore have be hope that by they promotion one of we grievance would have be take away and that at least the war against spain would have be vigorously prosecute but this ministry my lord have only furnish a new instance of the credulity of mankind of the delusion of outward appearance and of the folly of hope with too great ardor for any event and of trust any man with too great confidence no sooner be they possess of the power to which they ambition have so long aspire and of the salary which have with so much eagerness be covet by they avarice than they forget the complaint of the merchant the value of commerce the honor of the british flag the danger of we american territory and the great importance of the war with spain and contented themselves with order convoy for we merchant instead of destroy the enemy by whom they be molest the fleet which be float from one coast to another in the mediterranean and which sometimes strike terror into the harmless inhabitant of a open coast or threaten but only threaten destruction to a unfortified town i be very far from consider as armament fit out against the spaniard who neither feel nor fear any great injury from they : they trade may be indeed somewhat impeded but that inconvenience be amply compensate by they depredation upon we merchant : they navy may be confine to they own port or to those of france but these navy be not very necessary to they since they be not sufficiently powerful to oppose we on the ocean and therefore they who be thus confine suffer less than those who confine they we have indeed the empty pleasure of see ourselves lord of the sea and of shake the coast with volley of we cannon but we purchase the triumph at a very high price and shall find ourselves in time weaken by a useless ostentation of superiority the only part of the spanish dominion in which they can receive any hurt from we force be those country which they possess in america and from which they receive the gold and silver which inflame they pride and incite they to insult nation more powerful than themselves by seize any part of those wealthy region we shall stop the fountain of they treasure reduce they to immediate penury and compel they to solicit peace upon any condition that we shall condescend to offer they the necessity of invade these country my lord be perfectly understand and very distinctly explain when the force destine for that expedition be delay and when the attempt at carthagena miscarry nothing be more pathetical than the complaint of the patriot who spare no labor to inform either the senate or the nation of the advantage which success would have procure but what measure have be take to repair we loss or to regain we honor or what new scheme have be form for make a attack more forcible upon some weaker part every one can remember that the miscarriage of that enterprise be imputed not to its difficulty nor to the courage of the spaniard nor to the strength of they work but to the unskilfulness of we officer and the impropriety of the season and it be therefore without doubt think not impossible to attack the spanish colony with success but why then my lord have they hitherto suffer the spaniard to discipline they troops and strengthen they work at leisure that at length they may securely set we at defiance and plunder we merchant without fear of vengeance thus my lord have we real interest be neglect in pursuit not of any other scheme of equal advantage but of the empty title of the arbiter of europe we have suffer we trade to be destroy and we country impoverish for the sake of hold the _ balance of power _ that variable balance in which folly and ambition be perpetually change the weight and which neither policy nor strength could yet preserve steady for a single year in the prosecution of this idle scheme we be about to violate all the maxim of wisdom and perhaps of justice we be about to destroy the end by the means which we make use of to promote it to endanger we country more by attempt to hinder the change which be project in europe than they accomplishment will endanger it and to deliver up ourselves to france before she make any demand of submission from we if any excuse could be make for expedition so likely to end in ruin it must be that justice require they and that if we suffer we at least suffer in support of right and in a honest endeavor to promote the execution of the great law of moral equity that if we fail of success we shall always have the consolation of have mean well and of have deserve those victory which we could not gain but upon a impartial survey of the cause in which we be go to engage and on which we be about to hazard we own happiness and that of we posterity i can discover no such apparent justice on the side of the queen of hungary as ought to incite distant nation to espouse she quarrel to raise army in she favor to consider she cause as that of human nature and to prosecute those that invade she territory as the enemy of general society the pragmatick sanction my lord by which she claim all the hereditary dominion of she family can not change the nature of right and wrong nor invalidate any claim before subsist unless by the consent of the prince by whom it be make the elector of bavarium may therefore urge in he own defense that by the elder sister he have a clear and indisputable right a right from which he never recede as he never concur in the pragmatiok sanction he may therefore charge this illustrious princess for whom so many troops be raise and for whom so much blood be about to be shed with usurpation with detention of the dominion of other potentate and with a obstinate assertion of a false title that the pragmatick sanction be generally understand to be unjust appear sufficiently from the conduct of those power who though engage by solemn stipulation to support it yet look unconcerned on the violation of it and appear convinced that the prince who be now divide among themselves the austrian dominion produce claim which can not be oppose without a manifest disregard of justice the pretension of these prince ought indeed to have be more attentively consider when this guaranty be first demand for it be evident that either no such compact ought to have be make or that it ought now to be observe and that those who now justify the neglect of it by urge its injustice ought to have refuse accession to it for the same reason but it be probable that they will urge in they defense what can not easily be confute that they consent be obtain by misrepresentation and that he who have promise to do any thing on the supposition that it be right be not bind by that promise when he have discover it to be wrong but though justice may my lord be pretend i be far from doubt that policy have in reality supply the motive upon which these power proceed since the world be evidently govern more by interest than virtue i think it not unreasonable to imagine that they form they measure accord to they own expectation of advantage and as i do not believe we countryman distinguish from the rest of mankind by any peculiar disregard of themselves it may not be improper to examine even in this place whether by restore the house of austrium to its ancient greatness we shall promote we own happiness or that of the empire or of the rest of europe to ourselves my lord i do not see what assistance can be give in time of danger by this house however powerful or however friendly for i suppose we shall never suffer it to grow powerful by sea as well as by land and by sea only can we receive benefit or injury what advantage the rest of europe may promise themselves from the restoration of the austrian power may be learn my lord from the history of the great emperor charle the fifth who for many year keep the world in continual alarm range from nation to nation with incessant and insatiable ambition make war only for the extinction of the protestant religion and employ he power and he ability in harass the neighbouring prince and disturb the tranquillity of mankind nor do he successor my lord though weaken by the division of he dominion enjoy they power with greater moderation or exert it to better purpose it be well know that they endeavor the subversion of both the liberty and religion of the subordinate state of the empire and that the great king of sweden be call into germany as well for the preservation of the protestant religion as of the rights of the elector this my lord be so generally know and confess that puffendorf the best writer on the german constitution have declare it disadvantageous to the empire to place at its head a prince too powerful by he hereditary dominion since they will always furnish he with force to oppress the weaker prince and it be not often find that he who have the power to oppress be restrain by principle of justice it appear therefore to I my lord that the late election of a emperor be make with sufficient regard to the general good and that therefore neither policy nor equity oblige we to act in a manner different from the other power who be join in the same engagement of whom i do not learn by any of the common channel of intelligence that any of they intend the support of the pragmatick sanction for no newspaper or pamphlet have yet inform we that any of the other power be hire auxiliary or regulate the march of they troops or make any uncommon preparation which may foretoken a expedition against the emperor or he ally yet my lord they be not restrain from attack the emperor by so strong objection as may be make to the present design for they owe he no obedience as they sovereign nor have contribute to the acquisition of he honor they have not like he majesty give they vote for he exaltation to the imperial seat nor have acknowledge he right by grant he a aid they might therefore without charge of disloyalty or inconsistency endeavor to dethrone he but how he majesty can engage in any such design after have zealously promote he advancement and confirm he election by the usual acknowledgment i be not able to understand it be evident that the king of prussium believe himself restrain by he own act and think it absurd to fight against a emperor who obtain the throne by he choice he therefore have with he usual wisdom refuse to engage in the confederacy nor have either promise or concession be able to obtain more from he than a bare neutrality whether indeed any more than a neutrality be intend even by this pompous armament for which we be now require to provide i maybe allow to doubt since the troops that be hire at so high a rate be such as can not act against the enemy of the queen of hungary without breach of the imperial constitution it have be already justly observe in this debate that when the emperor have obtain from the diet a aid of fifty month that act be consider as a authentick recognition of he title nor can any of the german prince afterwards make war against he without subject he dominion to the imperial interdict and lose the privilege of he sovereignty that the present emperor have already receive this acknowledgment and be confess by he majesty as elector of hanover to be legally invest with the imperial dignity be well know and therefore i can not by any method of reasoning discover nor have yet find any man able to inform I why the troops of hanover be choose before those of any other nation for a design which they can not execute without ruin they sovereign if they fail and infringe the constitution of the empire if they should happen to succeed i should therefore have imagine that the assistance of the queen of hungary be only pretended and that the force be only design to breathe the air of the continent and to display they scarlet at the expense of britain have not the noble lord who speak third in this debate inform we that they will in reality march into germany a design my lord so romantick unseasonable and dangerous that though i can not doubt it after such assurance i should not have believe it on any other a design which i hope every man who regard the welfare of this kingdom will indefatigably oppose and which every briton must wish that some lucky accident may frustrate to send a army into germany my lord be to hazard we native country without necessity without temptation without prospect or possibility of advantage it be to engage in a quarrel which have no relation to we dominion or rights or commerce a quarrel from which however it be decide we can neither hope for any increase of we wealth we force or we influence but which may involve we in a war without end in which it will be difficult to obtain the victory and in which we must yet either conquer or be undo surely my lord a expedition like this be never undertake before without consult the senate and declare the motive on which it be design surely never be any supply of this nature demand without some previous discovery to this house of the importance of the service for which they be require to provide on this occasion my lord all the council of the government be cover by a cloud of affect secrecy nor be any knowledge of we affair to be gain but from papers which be not to be regard here the print vote of the other house i be always my lord incline to suspect unusual secrecy and to imagine that man either conceal they measure because they can not defend they or affect a appearance of conceal they when in reality they have yet project nothing and draw the veil with uncommon care only lest it should be discover that there be nothing behind it as when palace be show those apartment which be empty be carefully lock up to confess my opinion without reserve i be not so much inclined to believe that we minister ' design be bad as that they design nothing and suspect that this mighty army so lavishly pay and collect from such distant part be to regulate its motion by accident and to wait without action till some change in the state of europe shall make it more easy for we minister to form they scheme i hope my lord that by some accident more favourable than we have at present reason to expect we german expedition will be retard till we minister shall awaken from they present dream of deliver europe from the french ambition and of restore the ancient greatness of the house of austrium i hope every day as it add to they experience will diminish that ardor which be generally the effect of imperfect view which be commonly raise by partial consideration and end in inconsiderate undertaking i hope they will in time think it no advantage to they fellow-subject to be doom to fight the battle of other nation and to be call out into every field where they shall happen to hear that blood be to be shed i hope they will be teach that the only business of britain be commerce and that while we ship pass unmolested we may sit at ease whatever be the design or action of the potentate on the continent that none but naval power can endanger we safety and that it be not necessary for we to inquire how foreign territory be distribute what family approach to its extinction or where a successor will be find to any other crown than that of britain if these maxim be once generally understand from how much perplexity would we council be set free how many thousand of we fellow-subject would be preserve from slaughter and how much would we wealth be increase by save those sum which be yearly squander in idle expedition or in negotiation equally useless and perhaps equally expensive have these principle be receive by we forefather we might now have give law to the world and perhaps we posterity will with equal reason say how happy how great and formidable they should have be have not we attempt to fix and to hold the balance of power and neglect the interest of we country for the preservation of the house of austrium thus my lord i have endeavor to explain and enforce my opinion of the measure in which we minister have engage the nation and hope that i shall not be accuse of be influence in my determination by personal prejudice nor of have change my opinion with regard to publick affair in consequence of any change of the person by whom they be conduct for if my sentiment have ever be think important enough to be retain in memory i can with the utmost confidence appeal to all those who can recollect what i have formerly say when the reestablishment of the house of austrium be the subject of we consultation and defy the most rigorous and attentive examiner of my conduct to prove that there ever be a time in which i think it necessary or expedient for the british nation to be entangled in dispute on the continent or to employ she arm in regulate the pretension of contend power i be always of opinion my lord that peace be the most eligible state and that the ease of security be to be prefer to the honor of victory i always think peace particularly necessary to a trading people and as i have yet find no reason to alter my sentiment and as auxiliary can not be of any use but in time of war i shall endeavor to promote peace by join in the motion lord cholmondeley speak to this effect : -- my lord notwithstanding the atrocious charge which have be urge with so much vehemence against the ministry notwithstanding the folly and absurdity which some lord have imagine themselves to have discover in the present measure i can not yet prevail upon myself whatever may be my veneration for they integrity or my confidence in they ability to approve the motion for which they so earnestly contend to comply with this motion my lord would be in my opinion to betray the general cause of mankind to interrupt the success of the assertor of liberty to give up all the continent at once to the house of bourbon to defeat all the measure of we ancestor and ourselves and to invite the oppressor of mankind to extend they claim of universal dominion to the island of britain of the measure which we be now to consider i think the defense at once obvious and unanswerable and should advise that instead of exert a useless sagacity in uncertain conjecture on future event or display unseasonable knowledge by the citation of authority or the recollection of ancient fact every lord should attentively compare the state into which europe be reduce soon after the death of the late emperor with that in which it now appear and inquire to what cause such sudden and important change be to be ascribe he will then easily discover the efficacy of the british measure and be convince that nothing have be omit which the interest of this nation require when i hear it ask by the noble lord what effect have be produce by we armament and expense for what end auxiliary be hire and why we army be transport into flander i can not but suspect my lord that this affectation of ignorance be only intend to irritate they opponent that they suppress fact with which they be well acquaint only that they may have a opportunity of give vent to they passion of display they imagination in artful reproach and exercise they eloquence in splendid declamation i believe they hide what they know where to find only to oblige other to the labor of produce it and ask question not because they want or desire information but because they hope to weary those whose station condemn they to the task of answer they the effect my lord which the assistance give by we to the queen of hungary have already produce be the recovery of one kingdom and the safety of the rest the exclusion of the spaniard from italy on the one part and on the other the confinement of they in it without either the supplies for war or the necessaries of life these my lord be surely great advantage but these be not the greatest which we have reason to hope we vigor and resolution have at last animated the dutch to suspend for a time they attention to trade and money and to consider what they seldom much regard the state of other nation the most rich and powerful of they province have already determine to concur in the reestablishment of the house of austrium and if the approbation of the rest be necessary it be likely to be obtain by the same method of proceed thus my lord we have a prospect of do that which the minister of queen anne whose fidelity wisdom and address have be so often and so invidiously commend think they greatest honor and the strongest proof of they ability we may soon form another confederacy against the house of bourbon at a time when loui the fourteenth be not at its head at a time when it be exhaust by expensive project and when therefore it can not make the same resistance as when it be before attack by pursue the scheme which be now form with steadiness and ardor we may perhaps reinstate all those nation in they liberty whom cowardice or negligence or credulity have during the last century deliver up to the ambition of france we may confine that swell monarchy which have from year to year tear down the boundary of its neighbor within its ancient limit and disable it for age from give any new alarm to mankind and from make any other effort for the acquisition of universal dominion we may reestablish the house of austrium as the great barrier of the world by which it be preserve on one part from be lay waste by the barbarity of the turk and on the other from be enslave by politer tyrant and overrun by the ambition of france elevated with such success and encourage by such prospects we ought surely my lord to press forward in a path where we have hitherto find no difficulty and which lead directly to solid peace and happiness which no danger or terror can hereafter interrupt : we ought instead of relax to redouble we effort and to remember that by exert all we strength and all we influence for a short time we shall not only secure ourselves and we posterity from insolence and oppression but shall establish the tranquillity of the world and promote the general felicity of the human species for these great purpose my lord be those auxiliary retain of which some lord now require the dismission and those army transport which part of the nation be by false report incline to recall but i hope that such unreasonable demand will not be gratify and that the faith of treaty the tie of friendship the call of justice and the expectation of we ally will easily prevail upon you lordship to despise the murmur of prejudice and the outcry of faction lord bath reply to the following effect : -- my lord as i be far from think that my advice or opinion can be of any use in this illustrious assembly i should have listen in silence to this debate important as it be have i not think it my duty to defend here what i approve in the council and consider it as a act of cowardice and meanness to fall passively down the stream of popularity and to suffer my reason and my integrity to be overborne by the noise of vulgar clamor which have be raise against the measure of the government by the low art of exaggeration fallacious reasoning and partial representation it be not without concern my lord that even in this house i observe some inclination to gratify the prejudice of the people and to confirm they in they contempt of the foreign troops by the poor artifice of contemptuous language to dispute about word be indeed seldom useful and when question so weighty as these be before we may be justly censure as improper i shall therefore only observe that the term mercenary which be in the motion apply to the force of hanover seem design rather to affect the passion than influence the reason and intend only to express a partiality which can not be justified but it be far more necessary my lord to consider upon what motive the troops of hanover be hire than by what denomination they may most properly be call and therefore i shall endeavor to explain the reason which induce the ministry to retain they and which i suppose have prevail upon the common to provide for they support it have be ask why the troops of hanover be prefer to those of any other nation and it have be insinuate that we determination be influence by motive very different from that regard which every briton owe to the interest of he native country but to this imputation however specious and however popular it may be with great security reply that there be no preference because there be no choice that there be a necessity for hire troops and that no other troops be to be obtain and whoever shall endeavor to invalidate this defense must engage in a undertaking of which i can boldly affirm that he will find it very difficult he must show what power would have be able or willing to have furnish we with troops on this occasion and i be confident that whoever shall with this design take a deliberate survey of the several kingdom and state of europe will find that there be no other prince to whom we could have apply on this occasion without greater inconveniency than can reasonably be fear from the present stipulation with hanover the reason indeed for which this stipulation be make appear so strong when it be consider in the council that it be unanimously determine necessary nor be the conclusion hastily make in a assembly of particular person who might be suspect of favor it from private view and of be convene on purpose to put it in execution : it be debate by a great number with great solemnity nor can any man say that he only yield to what he find it in vain to oppose for the consent give be not a tacit acquiescence but a verbal approbation so far be this part of we measure from be the advice of any single man or transact with that solicitous secrecy which be the usual refuge of bad design it have be assert likewise my lord and with much greater appearance of justice that this whole design have be form and conduct without the concurrence or approbation of the senate and that therefore it can be consider only as a private scheme to be execute at the publick expense as a plan form by the ministry to aggrandize or ingratiate themselves at the hazard of the nation but even this my lord be a misrepresentation though a misrepresentation more artful and more difficult to defeat because in order to the justification of we measure it be necessary to take a review of past transaction and to consider what be necessarily imply by former determination of the senate the period my lord to which this consideration will necessarily carry we back be the time at which after the late tedious war a peace be on whatever term conclude with france it be well know that the confederate demand among other advantage a cession of that part of flander which have be for many year in the possession of spain and which open a way by which the ambition of the house of bourbon might make inroad at pleasure into the dominion of either the austrian or dutch this they be immediately interested in prevent and as we know the necessity of preserve the equipoise of power we likewise be remotely engage to promote any measure by which it might be secure in this demand therefore all the confederate power naturally unite and by they united influence enforce compliance but though it be easy with no great profundity of political knowledge to discover from whom these province should be take away to whom they should be give be a question of more difficulty since they might add to the power that have opportunity of improve they such a increase of commerce and wealth as might defeat the end for which they be demand and destroy the balance of power by transfer too much weight into another scale and mankind have learn my lord by experience that exorbitant power will always produce exorbitant pride that very few when they can oppress with security will be contain within the bound of equity by the restraint of morality or of religion and that therefore the only method of establish a lasting peace be to divide power so equally that no party may have any certain prospect of advantage by make war upon another for this reason my lord it be apparently contrary to we interest to grant those province to those to whom by they situation they might have be most useful such country and such manufacture in the hand of a people verse perhaps beyond all other both in the science and the stratagem of trade and always watchful to improve every opportunity of increase they riches would have enable they in a short time to purchase a interest in the council of all the monarch of the world to have maintain fleet that might have cover the ocean and to have obtain that universal dominion to which the french have so long aspire and which it be perhaps more for the interest of mankind that if slavery can not be prevent they should obtain as they would perhaps use they power with more generosity the same reason my lord naturally make the dutch unwilling to put these province in the hand of britain for we likewise make a profession of trade though we do not pursue it with the same ardor or to confess the truth with the same success : it be not however to be imagine that there would not be find among we some man of sagacity to discern and of industry to improve the opportunity which the new dominion would have put into we hand of vend we manufacture in part where at present they be very little known nor be this the only danger to be fear from such a increase of dominion : the dutch have not yet forget that though we at first rescue they from slavery patronise the infancy of they state and continue we guardianship till it be grow up to maturity and enable to support itself by its own strength yet we afterwards make very vigorous attempt to reduce it to its original weakness and to sink it into pupillage again that we attempt to invade the most essential part of its rights and to prescribe the number of ship that it should maintain they know likewise my lord that by the natural rotation of human affair the same counsel may in some future reign be again pursue or that some unavoidable conflict of interest may produce a contest that can be decide only by the sword and then it may easily be perceive how much they would be endanger by the neighborhood of british garrison and of country where we might maintain numerous army at a very small expense it be therefore no subject of wonder that a nation much less subtile than the dutch should find out how much it be they interest that we should be confine within the limit of we own island and that we should not have it in we power to attack they with army as well as fleet and at once to obstruct they commerce and invade they country there remain therefore my lord no power but the emperor to whom these province could be consign and to he therefore they be give but give only in trust for the joint advantage of the whole confederacy he indeed enjoy they revenue on condition that he shall support the garrison necessary to they defense but he can not transfer they to any other power or alienate they to the detriment of those nation who concur in acquire they it may not be improper my lord to observe that on this contract depend the justice of we conduct with regard to the company establish at ostend for carry on a trade to the east indy these province be grant to the confederate power and consign to the emperor to be enjoy by he for the common benefit : it be therefore plainly intend by this contract that he should use none of the advantage which these new dominion afford he to the detriment of those power by whose gift he enjoy they nor could it be suppose that the dutch and briton debar each other from those opportunity of trade only to enable the emperor to rival they both the town therefore my lord be at this time determine by the senate to be the general property of all the confederate power acquire by they unite arm and to be preserve for they common advantage as the pledge of peace and the palladium of europe if therefore it should at any time happen that they should be endanger either by the weakness or neglect of any one of those power the rest be to exert they right and endeavor they preservation and security nor be there any new stipulation or law necessary for this since with respect to the confederate it be imply in the original stipulation and with regard to the senate of britain in the approbation which be bestow upon that contract when it be make the time my lord in which this common right be to be exert be now arrive the queen of hungary invade in she hereditary dominion and press on every side by a general combination of almost all the surround prince declare herself no longer able to support the garrison of the barrier and inform we that she intend to recall she troops for the defense of they own country what then be more apparent my lord than that either these town must fall again into the hand of the french and that we shall be oblige to recover they if they can ever be recover at the expense of another ten year ' war or that either we or the dutch must send troops to supply the place of those which the necessity of they sovereign oblige she to withdraw that the town of flander should be resign gratuitously to france that the enemy of mankind should be put in possession of the strongest bulwark in the world surround by field and pasture able to maintain they garrison without expense will not be propose by any of this assembly but it may easily and naturally be object that the dutch ought to garrison these town as more nearly interested in they preservation and more commodiously situate for they defense nor can it be indeed deny that the dutch may be justly censure for they neglect as they appear to leave the common cause to we protection and to prefer they commerce and they ease to they own safety and the happiness of the world this my lord have be very warmly assert in they own assembly nor have there be want man of spirit and integrity amongst they who have despise the gold and promise and detect the artifice of france who have endeavor by all the art of argument and persuasion to rouse they countryman to remembrance of they former danger and to a inquiry into they real interest who have advise the levy of new force and the establishment of a new confederacy who have call upon the state to face danger while it be yet distant and to secure they own country by pour they garrison into the town and citadel by which they frontier be protect if they argument however just have not yet attain they end it be to be imputed to the constitution embarrass by the combination of different interest which must be reconcile before any resolution can be form a single town my lord can by refuse its consent put a stand to the most necessary design and it be easily to be imagine that by a monarch equally crafty and rich a single town may sometimes be bribe into measure contrary to the publick interest but my lord the negligence of the dutch be a motive which ought to incite we to vigor and despatch since it be not for the sake of the dutch but ourselves that we desire the suppression of france if the dutch be at length convinced of the ease of slavery and think liberty no longer worth the labor of preserve it -- if they be tire with the task of labor for the happiness of other and have forsake the stand on which they be place as the general watch of the world to indulge themselves in tranquillity and slumber -- let not we my lord give way to the same infatuation let not we look with neglect on the deluge that roll towards we till it have advance too far to be resist let we remember that we be to owe we preservation only to ourselves and redouble we effort in proportion as other neglect they duty let we show mankind that we be neither afraid to stand up alone in defense of justice and of freedom nor unable to maintain the cause that we have undertake to assert but if it should be think by any of this noble assembly that the concurrence of the dutch be absolutely necessary to a prospect of success it may be reasonably answer that by engage in measure which can leave no doubt of either we power or we sincerity the concurrence of the dutch be most likely to be obtain by this method of proceed my lord be form the last mighty confederacy by which the house of bourbon be almost shake into ruin the dutch then as now be slow in they determination and perhaps equally diffident of they own strength and we firmness nor do they agree to declare war against france till we have transport ten thousand man into flander and convinced they that we be not invite they to a mock alliance but that we really intend the reduction of that empire which have so long extend itself without interruption and threaten in a short time to swallow up all the western nation thus my lord it appear that the measure which have be pursue be just politick and legal that they have be prescribe by the decree of former senate and therefore can not be censure as arbitrary and that they have a tendency to the preservation of those territory which it be once think so much honor to acquire : and it may be yet farther urge that though they be to be consider only as the first tendency to secure greater design they have already produce effect apparently to the advantage of the common cause and have oblige the french to desist from they pursuit of the queen of hungary and rather to inquire how they shall return home than how they shall proceed to farther conquest in condemnation of these measure my lord it have indeed be urge that a moderate conduct be always eligible and that nothing but ruin and confusion can be expect from precipitation and temerity moderation my lord be a very captivating sound but i hope it will have now no influence on this assembly because on this occasion it can not properly be employ i have always be teach that moderation be only useful in form determination or design but that when once conviction be attain zeal be to take place and when a design be plan it ought to be execute with vigor the question be not now my lord whether we shall support the queen of hungary but in what manner she shall be support and therefore it can not be doubt but that such support should be grant she as may be effectual and i believe it will not be think that we can assist she without exert a uncommon degree of vigor and show that we consider ourselves as engage in a cause which can not be abandon without disgrace and ruin if the noble lord have before he enter upon he encomium on moderation consider what effect could be promise from he favorite virtue he would have have no inclination to display he eloquence upon it by moderation my lord uninterrupted moderation of more than twenty year have we become the scorn of mankind and expose ourselves to the insult of almost every nation in the world by moderation have we betray we ally and suffer we friendship to lose all its value by moderation have we give up commerce to the rapacity of a enemy formidable only for he perseverance and suffer we merchant to be ruin and we sailor to be enslave by moderation have we permit the french to grasp again at general dominion to overrun germany with they army and to endanger again the liberty of mankind and by continue for a very few year the same laudable moderation we shall probably encourage they to shut up we ship in we harbor and demand a tribute for the use of the channel i need not observe to you lordship that all the great action that have in all age be achieve have be the effect of resolution diligence and daring activity virtue wholly opposite to the calmness of moderation i need not observe that the advantage enjoy at present by the french be the consequence of that vigor and expedition by which they be distinguish and which the form of they government enable they to exert have they my lord instead of pour army into the austrian dominion and procure by the terror of they troops the election of a emperor pursue these measure of moderation which have be so pathetically recommend how easily have they design be defeat have they lose time in persuade the queen of hungary by a solemn embassy to resign she dominion or attempt to influence the diet by amicable negotiation army have be levy and the pass of germany have be shut against they they have be oppose on the frontier of they own dominion by troops equally numerous and warlike with they own and instead of impose a sovereign on the empire have be perhaps pursue into they own country but my lord whether moderation be not recommend to they by such powerful oratory as you lordship have hear or whether its advocate meet with a audience not easily to be convince it be plain that they seem to have act upon very different principle and i wish they policy have not be so strongly justify by its success by send a army into germany my lord when there be no force ready to oppose they they reduce all the petty prince to immediate submission and oblige those to welcome they as friend who would gladly have unite against they as the inveterate enemy of the whole german body and who have they be firmly join by they neighbor under a general sense of they common danger would have easily raise a army able to have repel they this my lord be the effect of vigor a effect very different from that which we have a opportunity of experience as the consequence of moderation it be to no purpose that we endeavor to alarm mankind by remonstrance and to procure assistance by entreaty and solicitation the universal panick be not to be remove by advice and exhortation and the queen of hungary must have sink under the weight of a general combination against she have we not at last rise up in she defense and with we sword in we hand set a example to the nation of europe of courage and generosity it then quickly appear my lord how little be to be expect from cold persuasion and how necessary it be that he who would engage other in a task of difficulty should show himself willing to partake the labor which he recommend no sooner have we declare we resolution to fulfil we stipulation and order we troops to march for the relief of the queen of hungary than other prince discover that they have the same disposition though they have hitherto think it prudent to conceal they that they equally with ourselves hate and fear the french that they be desirous to repress they insolence and oppose they conquest and only wait for the motion of some power who might stand at the head of the confederacy and lead they forwards against the common enemy the liberal promise of dominion make by the french by which the sovereign of germany have be tempt to concur in a design which they think themselves unable to oppose be now no longer regard they be consider only as the boast of imaginary greatness which would at last vanish into air and every one know that the ultimate design of europe be to oppress equally she enemy and friend they wisely despise she offer and either desist from the design to which they have be incite by she or declare themselves ready to unite against she this my lord have be the consequence of assemble the army which by the motion now under we consideration some of you lordship seem desirous to disband a inclination of which i can not discover from whence it can arise for what my lord must be the consequence if this motion should be comply with what but the total destruction of the whole system of power which have be so laboriously form and so strongly compacted what but the immediate ruin of the house of austrium by which the french ambition have be so long restrain what but the subversion of the liberty of germany and the erection of a universal empire to which all the nation of the earth must become vassal should the auxiliary troops be disband the queen of hungary would find what benefit she have receive from they by the calamity which the loss of they would immediately bring upon she all the claim of all the neighbouring prince who be now awed into peace and silence would be revive and every one would again believe that nothing be to be hope or fear but from france the french would again rush forward to new invasion and spread desolation over other country and the house of austrium would be more weakened than by the loss of many battle in its present state the support of the house of austrium appear not indeed much to engage the attention of those by whom this motion be support it have be represent as a house equally ambitious and perfidious with that of bourbon and equally a enemy both to liberty and to true religion and a very celebrated author have be quote to prove that it be the interest of the german themselves to see a prince at they head whose hereditary dominion may not incite he to exert the imperial power to the disadvantage of the inferior sovereign in order to the consideration of these objection it be necessary to observe my lord that national alliance be not like league of friendship the consequence of a agreement of disposition opinion and affection but like association of commerce form and continue by no similitude of any thing but interest it be not therefore necessary to inquire what the house of austrium have deserve from we or from mankind because interest not gratitude engage we to support it it be useless to urge that it be equally faithless and cruel with the house of bourbon because the question be not whether both shall be destroy but whether one should rage without control it be sufficient for we that they interest be opposite and that religion and liberty may be preserve by they mutual jealousy and i confess my lord that be the austrian about to attain unlimited power by the conquest or inheritance of france and spain it would be no less proper to form confederacy against they the testimony which have be produce of the convenience of a weak emperor be to be consider my lord as the opinion of a author whose birth and employment have taint he with a inveterate hatred of the house of austrium and fill he imagination with a habitual dread of the imperial power he be bear my lord in sweden a country which have suffer much by a long war against the emperor he be a minister to the elector of brandenburgh who naturally look with envy on the superiority of austrium and could not but wish to see a weaker prince upon the imperial throne that they own influence might be greater nor can we wonder that a man thus bear and thus support should adopt a opinion by which the pride of he master would be flatter and perhaps the interest of he own country promote it be likewise my lord to be remark that there be then no such necessity for a powerful prince to stand at the head of the german and to defend they with he own force till they could unite for they own preservation the power of france have not then arrive at its present height nor have they monarch openly threaten to enslave all the nation of europe the prince of the empire have then no oppression to fear but from the emperor and it be no wonder that when he be they only enemy they wish that he power be reduce how much the state of the continent be now change be not necessary to mention nor what alteration that change have introduce into the politick of all nation those who formerly dread to be overwhelm by the imperial greatness can now only hope to be secure by it from the torrent of the power of france and even those nation who have formerly endeavor the destruction of austrium may now rejoice that they be sheltered by its interposition from tyrant more active and more oppressive but my lord though it should be grant that the house of austrium ought not to be support it will not in my opinion follow that this motion deserve we approbation because it will reduce we to a state of imbecility and condemn we to stand as passive spectator of the disturbance of the world without power and without influence ready to admit the tyrant to whom chance shall allot we and receive those law which the prevail power shall vouchsafe to transmit whether we ought to support the house of austrium to prevent its utter subversion or restore it to its former greatness whatever may be my private opinion i think it not on this occasion necessary to assert it be sufficient to induce we to reject this motion that we ought to be at least in a condition that may enable we to improve those opportunity that may be offer and to hinder the execution of any design that may threaten immediate danger to we commerce or we liberty another popular topick my lord which have be echo on the present occasion be the happiness of peace and the blessing of uninterrupted commerce and undisturbed security we be perpetually tell of the hazard of war whatever may be the superiority of we skill or courage of the certainty of the expense the bloodshed and the hardship and doubtfulness of the advantage which we may hope from they and it be daily urge with great vehemence that peace upon the hardest condition be preferable to the honor of conquest and the festivity of triumph these maxim my lord which be generally true in the sense which they author intend may be very properly urge against the wild design of ambition and the romantick undertaking of wanton greatness but have no place in the present inquiry which relate to a war not make by caprice but force upon we by necessity a war to which all the encomium on peace must in reality incite because peace alone be the end intend to be obtain by it of the necessity of peace to a trading nation it be not possible my lord to be ignorant and therefore no man can be imagine to propose a state of war as eligible in itself war my lord be in my opinion only to be choose when peace can be no longer enjoy and to be continue only till a peace secure and equitable can be attain in the present state of the world my lord we fight not for laurel nor conquest but for existence should the arm of france prevail and prevail they must unless we oppose they the briton may in a short time no longer be a nation we liberty will be take away we constitution destroy we religion persecute and perhaps we name abolish for the prevention of calamity like these not for the preservation of the house of austrium it be necessary my lord to collect a army for by a army only can we liberty be preserve and such a peace obtain as may be enjoy without the imputation of supineness and stupidity of this the other house appear to be sufficiently convinced and have therefore grant money for the support of the auxiliary troops nor do i doubt but you lordship will concur with they when you shall fully consider the motive upon which they may be suppose to have proceed and reflect that by dismiss these troops we shall sacrifice to the ambition of the french the house of austrium the liberty of europe we own happiness and that of we posterity and that by resolve to exert we force for a short time we may place the happiness of mankind beyond the reach of attack and violation lord carteret reply to the following effect : -- my lord the consideration which be lay before you by the noble lord who make and second the motion be so important in themselves and have be urge with so much force and judgment that i shall not endeavor to add any new argument since where those fail which have be already offer it be not likely that any will be effectual : but i shall endeavor to preserve they in they full force by remove the objection which have be make to they the first consideration that claim we attention be the reverence due to the senate to the great council of the nation which ought always to be consult when any important design be form or any new measure adopt especially if they be such as can not be defeat by be make publick and such as a uncommon degree of expense be necessary to support these principle my lord which i suppose no man will contest have be so little regard by the ministry on the present occasion that they seem to have endeavor to discover by a bold experiment to what degree of servility senate may be reduce and what insult they will be teach to bear without resentment for they have without the least previous hint of they design make a contract for a very numerous body of mercenary nor do they condescend to inform the senate till they ask for money to pay they to execute measure first and then to require the approbation of the senate instead of advice be surely such a degree of contempt as have not often be show in the most arbitrary reign and such as would once have provoke such indignation in the other house that there would have be no need in this of a motion like the present but my lord in proportion as the other house seem incline to pay a implicit submission to the dictate of the ministry it be we duty to increase we vigilance and to convince we fellow-subject by a steady opposition to all encroachment that we be not as we have be sometimes style a useless assembly but the last resort of liberty and the chief support of the constitution the present design of those who have thus dare to trample upon we privilege appear to be nothing less than that of reduce the senate of britain to the same abject slavery with those of france to show the people that we be to be consider only as they agent to raise the supplies which they shall be please under whatever pretence to demand and to register such determination as they shall condescend to lay before we this invasion of we rights my lord be too flagrant to be bear though be the measure which we be thus tyrannically require to support really conducive in themselves to the interest of britain which indeed might reasonably have be expect for what head can be imagine so ill form for politick as not to know that the first act of arbitrary power ought to be in themselves popular that the advantage of the effect may be a balance to the means by which it be produce but these wonderful politician my lord have heap one blunder upon another they have disgust the nation both by the means and the end and have insult the senate with no other view than that of plunder the people they have venture without the consent of the senate to pursue measure of which it be obvious that they be only keep secret because they easily foresee that they would not be approve for that the hire of mercenary from hanover my lord would have be reject with general indignation that the proposal would have produce hiss rather than censure and that the argument which have be hitherto use to support it would if personal regard do not make they of some importance produce laughter oftener than reply can not surely be doubt it have be say in vindication of this wise scheme that no other troops could be obtain but those of hanover a assertion which i hope i may be allow to examine because it be yet a bare assertion without argument and against probability since it be generally know how willingly the prince of germany have on all former occasion send out they subject to destruction that they might fill they coffer with they pay nor do i doubt but that there be now in the same country the usual superabundance of man and the usual scarcity of money i make no question my lord that many a german prince would gladly furnish we with man as a very cheap commodity and think himself sufficiently reward by a small subsidy there could be no objection to these troops from the constitution of the empire which be not of equal force against the force of hanover nor do i know why they should not rather have be employ if they could have be obtain at a cheaper price the absurdity of pay levy-money for troops regularly keep up and of hire they at a higher rate than be ever pay for auxiliary before have be so strongly urge and so fully explain that no reply have be attempt by those who have hitherto oppose the motion have rather endeavor to divert we attention to foreign consideration than to vindicate this part of the contract which be indeed too shameful to be palliate and too gross to be overlook it be however proper to repeat my lord that though it can not be confute it may be forget in the multitude of other object that this nation after have exalt the elector of hanover from a state of obscurity to the crown be condemn to hire the troops of hanover to fight they own cause to hire they at a rate which be never demand for they before and to pay levy-money for they though it be know to all europe that they be not raise on this occasion nor be this the only hardship or folly of this contract for we be to pay they a month before they march into we service we be to pay those for do nothing of whom it might have be without any unreasonable expectation hope that they would have exert they utmost force without pay for it be apparent my lord that if the design of france be such as the noble lord who oppose the motion represent they hanover be much nearer to danger than britain and therefore they only fight for they own preservation since though they have for a single year be bless with a neutrality it can not be imagine that the same favor will be always grant they or that the french when they have overrun all the rest of germany will not annex hanover to they other dominion besides my lord it be well know that hanover be equally engage by treaty with britain to maintain the pragmatick sanction and that a certain proportion of troops be to be furnished but my lord as to the march of that body of force i have yet hear no account will any lord say that they have march i therefore suppose that the wisdom and justice of we minister have comprehend they in the sixteen thousand who be to fatten upon british pay and that hanover will support the pragmatick sanction at the cost of this inexhaustible nation the service which those troops have already do to the common cause have be urge with great pomp of exaggeration of which what effect it may have have upon other i be not able to say for my part i be convince that the great happiness of this kingdom be the security of the established succession and be therefore always of opinion that no measure can serve the common cause the cause of liberty or of religion or of general happiness by which the royal family lose the affection of the people and i can with great confidence affirm that no attempt for many year have raise a greater heat of resentment or excited louder clamor of indignation than the hire of hanoverian troops nor be this discontent raise only by artful misrepresentation form to inflame the passion and perplex the understand it be a settle and rational dislike which every day contribute to confirm which will make all the measure of the government suspect and may in time if not obviate break out in sedition a jealousy of hanover have indeed for a long time prevail in the nation the frequent visit of we king to they electoral dominion contrary to the original term on which this crown be confer upon they have incline the people of britain to suspect that they have only the second place in the affection of they sovereign nor have this suspicion be make less by the large accession make to those dominion by purchase which the elector never appear able to make before they exaltation to the throne of britain and by some measure which have be apparently take only to aggrandize hanover at the expense of britain these measure my lord i be very far from impute to we sovereign or he father the wisdom of both be so well know that they can not be imagine to have incur either by contempt or negligence the disaffection of they subject those my lord be only to be blame who conceal from they the sentiment of the nation and for the sake of promote they own interest betray they by the most detestable and pernicious flattery into measure which could produce no other effect than that of make they reign unquiet and of exasperate those who have concur with the warmest zeal in support they on the throne it be not without a uncommon degree of grief that i hear it urge in defense of this contract that it be approve by a very numerous council for what can produce more sorrow in a honest and a loyal breast than to find that we sovereign be surround by counsellor who either do not know the desire and opinion of the people or do not regard they who be either so negligent as not to examine how the affection of the nation may be best preserve or so rash as to pursue those scheme by which they hope to gratify the king at whatever hazard and who for the sake of flattering he for a day will risk the safety of he government and the repose of he life it have with regard to these troops be ask by the noble lord who speak last what be the intent of this motion but to disband they what else indeed can be intend by it and what intention can be more worthy of this August assembly by a steady pursuit of this intention my lord we shall regain the esteem of the nation which this daring invasion of we privilege may be easily suppose to have impair we shall give we sovereign a opportunity by a gracious condescension to we desire to recover those affection of which the pernicious advice of flatterer have deprive he we shall obviate a precedent which threaten destruction to we liberty and shall set the nation free from a universal alarm nor in we present state be it to be mention as a trifling consideration that we shall hinder the wealth of the nation from be ravish from we merchant we farmer and we manufacturer to be squander upon foreigner and foreigner from whom we can hope for no advantage but it may be ask my lord how the great cause of liberty be to be support how the house of austrium be to be preserve from ruin and how the ambition of france be to be repress how all this be to be effect my lord i be very far from conceive myself qualify to determine but surely it will be very little hinder by the dismission of troops whose allegiance oblige they not to fight against the emperor and of whom therefore it do not easily appear how they can be very useful ally to the queen of hungary but whatever service be expect from they it may surely my lord be perform by the same number of british troops and that number may be send to supply they place without either delay or difficulty i will venture to say without any hazard if it be object as it have often be that by send out we troops we shall leave we country naked to invasion i hope i may be allow to ask who will invade we the french be well know to be the only people whom we can suspect of any such design they have no fleet on this side of they kingdom and they ship in the mediterranean be block up in the harbor by the navy of britain we shall still have at home a body of seven thousand man which be think a sufficient security in the late war when the french have a fleet equal to we own why we should now be in more danger from without i can not discover and with regard to intestine commotion they will be prevent by compliance with the present motion for nothing can incite the people of britain to oppose those who have openly dismiss the troops of hanover but my lord i be not yet at all convinced that the end for which those troops be say to be hire ought to be pursue or can be attain by we and if the end be in itself improper or impossible it certainly follow that the means ought to be lay aside if we consider the present state of the continent we shall find no prospect by which we can be encourage to hazard we force or we money the king of sardinium have indeed declare for we and oppose the passage of the spaniard but he appear either to be deficient in courage or in prudence or in force for instead of give battle on he frontier he have suffer they with very little resistance to invade he territory to plunder and insult he subject and to live at he expense and it may be suspect that if he can not drive they out of he country he will in time be content to purchase they departure by grant they a passage through it and rather give up the dominion of he ally to be ravage than preserve they at the expense of he own if we turn we eye towards the dutch we shall not be more encouraged to engage in the war on the continent for whatever have be assert of they readiness to proceed in conjunction with we they appear hitherto to behold with the most supine tranquillity the subversion of the german system and to be satisfy with a undisturbed enjoyment of they riches and they trade nor be there any appearance my lord that they concurrence be withhold only by a single town as have be insinuate for the vote of any single town except amsterdam may be overrule and the resolution have pass the necessary form when it be oppose by only one voice if we take a view my lord of they late conduct without suffer we desire to mislead we understanding we shall find no reason for imagine that they propose any sudden alteration of they conduct which have be hitherto consistent and steady and appear to arise from establish principle which nothing have lately happen to incline they to forsake when they be solicit to become like we the guarantee of hanover they make no scruple of return with whatever unpoliteness a absolute refusal nor could they be prevail upon to grant what we appear to think that we be honor in be admit to bestow when they be call upon to fulfil they stipulation and support the pragmatick sanction they evade they own contract till all assistance would have be too late have not a lucky discovery of the french perfidy separate the king of prussium from they and what reason my lord can be give why they should now do what they refuse when it might have be much more safely and more easily effect do they suffer the queen of hungary to be oppress only to show they own power and affluence by relieve she or can it be imagine that pity have prevail over policy or cowardice they who in contempt of they own treaty refuse to engage in a cause while it be yet doubtful will certainly think themselves justified in abandon it when it be lose and will urge that no treaty can oblige they to act like madman or to undertake impossibility i be therefore convinced my lord that they will not enter into a offensive treaty and that they have only engage to do what they own interest require from they without any new stipulation to preserve they own country from invasion by send garrison into the frontier town which they may do without any offence to france or any interruption of they own tranquillity many other treaty have be mention my lord and mention with great ostentation as the effect of consummate policy which will i suspect appear to be at least only defensive treaty by which the contracting power promise little more than to take care of themselves in this state of the world my lord when all the power of the continent appear benumb by a lethargy or shackle by a panick to what purpose should we lavish in hire and transport troops that wealth which contest of nearer importance immediately require it be well know to we merchant whose ship be every day seize by privateer that we be at war with spain and that we commerce be every day impair by the depredation of a enemy whom only we own negligence enable to resist we but i doubt my lord whether it be know in spain that they monarch be at war with britain otherwise than by the riches of we nation which be distribute among they privateer and the prisoner who in the town on the coast be wander in the street for i know no inconvenience which they can be suppose to feel from we hostility nor in what part of the world the war against they be carry on before the war be declare it be well remember by whom and with how great vehemence it be every day repeat that to end the war with honor we ought to _ take and hold _ what my lord do we _ hold _ or what have we _ take _ what have the war produce in its whole course from one year to another but defeat loss and ignominy and how shall we regain we honor or retrieve we wealth by engage in another war more dangerous but less necessary we ought surely to humble spain before we presume to attack france and we may attack france with better prospects of success when we have no other enemy to divert we attention or divide we force that we ought indeed to make any attempt upon france i be far from be convince because i do not now discover that any of the motive subsist which engage we in the last confederacy the house of austrium though overborne and distressed be then powerful in itself and possess of the imperial crown it be now reduce almost below the hope of recovery and we be therefore now to restore what we be then only to support but what my lord be in my opinion much more to be consider the nation be then unanimous in one general resolution to repress the insolence of france no hardship be insupportable that conduce to this great end nor any tax grievous that be apply to the support of the war the account of a victory be esteem as a equivalent to excise and to publick debt and the possession of we and we posterity be cheerfully mortgage to purchase a triumph over the common enemy but my lord the disposition of the nation with regard to the present war be very different they discover no danger threaten they they be neither invade in they possession by the army nor interrupted in they commerce by the fleet of france and therefore they be not able to find out why they must be sacrifice to a enemy by whom they have be long pursue with the most implacable hatred for the sake of attack a power from which they have hitherto feel no injury and which they believe can not be provoke without danger nor oppose without such a profusion of expense as the publick be at present not able to bear it be not to be suppose my lord that the bulk of the british people be affect with the distress or inflamed by the magnanimity of the queen of hungary this illustrious daughter of austrium whose name have be so often echo in these wall and of whom i be far from deny that she deserve we admiration we compassion and all the assistance which can be give she consistently with the regard due to the safety of we own country be to the greatest part of the people a imaginary princess whose suffering or whose virtue make no other impression upon they than those which be record in fictitious narrative nor can they easily be persuade to give up for she relief the produce of they land or the profit of they commerce some indeed there be my lord whose view be more extensive and whose sentiment be more exalt for it be not to be suppose that either knowledge or generosity be confine to the senate or the court : but these my lord though they perhaps may more readily approve the end which the ministry pretend to pursue be less satisfied with the means by which they endeavor to attain it by these man it be easily discover that the hope which some so confidently express of prevail upon the dutch to unite with we for the support of the pragmatick sanction be without foundation they see that they consent to place garrison in the frontier town however it may furnish a subject of exultation to those whose interest it be to represent they as ready to concur with we be only a new proof of what be never doubt they unvariable attention to they own interest since they must for they own security preserve they own barrier from be seize by france by this act they incur no new expense they provoke no enemy nor give any assistance to the queen of hungary by which they can raise either resentment in one part or gratitude in the other and therefore it be not hard to perceive that whatever be pretend the dutch hitherto observe the most exact law of neutrality and it be too evident that if they refuse they assistance we have very little to hope from a war with france nor be this the only objection against the present measure for it be generally and not without sufficient reason suspect that the real assistance of the queen of hungary be not intend since the troops which have be hire under that pretence be such as can not march against the emperor it be know that the hessian have absolutely refuse to infringe the constitution of the german body by attack he who be by a legal grant acknowledge its head nor be it easy to conceive why there should be a different law for hanover than for the other electorate the long stay of the troops in flander a place where there be no enemy to encounter nor ally to assist be a sufficient proof that there be nothing more design than that the troops of hanover shall loiter on the verge of war and receive they pay for feast in they quarter and show they arm at a review and that they in reality design nothing but to return home with full pocket and enjoy the spoil of britain there may indeed be another reason my lord which hinder the progress of the united force and by which the briton and hanoverian may be both affect though not both in the same degree it be by no means unlikely that the king of prussium have forbid they to advance and declare that the king who be choose by he suffrage shall be support by he arm if this be he resolution he be well know to want neither spirit nor strength to avow and support it and there be reason sufficient to convince we that he have declare it and that we troops be now patiently wait the event of a negotiation by which we be endeavor to persuade he to alter he design if indeed it be desire that he should alter it for it be not certain that the elector of hanover can desire the restoration of the house of austrium to a hereditary enjoyment of the imperial dignity nor can it easily be show why the politick of one house should differ from those of all the other prince of the german empire the other prince my lord have long wish for a king with whom they might treat upon the level a king who might owe he dignity only to they vote and who therefore would be willing to favor they in gratitude for the benefit they know that the prince of the house of austrium consider they advancement to the empire as the consequence of they numerous force and large dominion and make use of they exaltation only to tyrannise under the appearance of legal right and to oppress those as sovereign whom they would otherwise have harass as conqueror before we can therefore hope for the concurrence of the prince of the empire we must inform they of we design if any design have be yet lay out be it you intention to restore the house of austrium to the full enjoyment of its former greatness this will certainly be openly oppose by all those power who be strong enough to make head against it and secretly obstruct by those whose weakness make they afraid of publick declaration do you intend to support the pragmatick sanction this can only be do by defeat the whole power of france and for this you must necessarily provide troops who shall dare to act against the present king so that it appear my lord that we be attempt nothing or attempt impossibility that either we have no end in view or that we have make use of a absurd choice of means by which it can not be attain whatever be we design with regard to germany the war against spain be evidently neglect and indeed one part of we conduct prove at once that we intend neither to assist the austrian nor to punish the spaniard since we have in a great measure disabled ourselves from either by the neutrality which captain martin be say to have grant and by which we have allow a asylum both to the troops of spain which shall fly before the austrian and the privateer which shall be chase by we ship in the mediterranean i be therefore convinced my lord that we design be not such as they be represent or that they will not be accomplish by the measure take i be convince in a particular manner that the troops of hanover can be of no use and that they will raise the resentment of the nation already overwhelm with unnecessary burden i know likewise that they have be take into pay without the consent of the senate and be convince that if no other objection could be raise we ought not to ratify a treaty which the crown have make without lay it before we in the usual manner i need not therefore inform you lordship that i think the motion now under you consideration necessary and just and that i hope upon a attentive examination of the reason which have be offer you lordship will concur in it with that unanimity which evidence ought to enforce and that zeal which ought to be excite by publick danger to which the duke of newcastle make answer to the follow purport : -- my lord i know not by what imaginary appearance of publick danger the noble lord be so much alarmed nor what fear they be which he endeavor with so much art and zeal to communicate to this assembly for my part i can upon the most attentive survey of we affair discover nothing to be fear but calumny and misrepresentation and these i shall henceforward think more formidable since they have be able to impose upon a understanding so penetrate as that of he lordship and have prevail upon he to believe what be not only false but without the appearance of truth and to believe it so firmly as to assert it to you lordship one of the fact which he have thus implicitly receive and thus publickly mention be the neutrality suppose to have be grant to the king of sicily from which he have amuse himself and you lordship with deduce very destructive consequence that perhaps need not to be allow he even upon supposition of the neutrality but which need not now be dispute because no neutrality have be grant captain martin when he treat with the king very cautiously decline any declaration of the intention of the british court on that particular and confine himself to the subject of he message without give any reason for hope or despair of a neutrality so that if it shall be think necessary we be this hour at liberty to declare war against the king of sicily and may pursue the spaniard with the same freedom on he coast as on those of any other power and prohibit any assistance from be give by he to they army in italy he lordship 's notion of the interposition of the king of prussium in the king 's favor be another phantom raise by calumny to terrify credulity a phantom which will i hope be entirely dissipate when i have inform the house that the whole suspicion be without foundation and that the king of prussium have make no declaration of any design to support the king or of oppose we in the performance of we treaty this prince my lord however powerful active or ambitious appear to be satisfy with he acquisition and willing to rest in a inoffensive neutrality such my lord and so remote from truth be the representation which the enemy of the government have with great zeal and industry scatter over the nation and by which they have endeavor to obviate those scheme which they would seem to favor for by sink the nation to a despair of attain those end which they declare at the same time necessary not only to we happiness but to we preservation what do they less than tell we that we must be content to look unactive on the calamity that approach we and prepare to be crush by that ruin which we can not prevent from this cold dejection my lord arise that despair which so many lord have express of prevail upon the dutch to unite with we the determination of that people be indeed always slow and the reason of they slowness have be already give but i be inform that the general spirit which now reign among they be likely soon to overrule the particular interest of single province and can produce letter by which it will appear that have only one town oppose those measure to which they concurrence be now solicit it have be long since overrule for there want not among they man equally enamoured of the magnanimity and firmness of the queen of hungary equally zealous for the general good of mankind equally zealous for the liberty of europe and equally convinced of the perfidy the ambition and the insolence of france with any lord in this assembly these man my lord have long endeavor to rouse they country from the sloth of avarice and the slumber of tranquillity to a generous and extensive regard for the universal happiness of mankind and be now labor in the general assembly to communicate that ardor with which they be themselves inflamed and to excite that zeal for publick faith of which they superior knowledge show they the necessity it have be indeed insinuate that all they consultation tend only to place garrison in those town from which the queen of hungary have withdraw she force but this supposition my lord as it be without any support from fact be likewise without probability for to garrison the barrier town require no previous debate nor deliberation since it never be oppose even by those by whom the assistance of the queen of hungary have be most retard nor have even the deputy of dort whose obstinacy have be most remarkable deny the necessity of secure the confines of they country by possess with they own troops those place which the austrian be oblige to forsake they present dispute my lord must be therefore on some other question and what question can be now before they which can produce any difficulty but that which regard the support of the pragmatick sanction if these deliberation should be so far influence by the arrival of the army in the pay of britain as to end in a resolution to send a sufficient number of force into germany it will not be deny that the troops which give occasion for this debate have really be useful to the common cause nor will he majesty lose the affection of any of he subject by the false account which have be spread of a invidious preference give to the troops of hanover that every government ought to endeavor to gain the esteem and confidence of the people i suppose we be all equally convinced but i for my part be very far from think that measure ought only to be pursue or reject as they be immediately favor or dislike by the populace for as they can not know either the cause or the end of publick transaction they can judge only from fallacious appearance or the information of those whose interest it may perhaps be to lead they away from the truth that monarch will be most certainly and most permanently popular who steadily pursue the good of he people even in opposition to they own prejudice and clamor who disregard calumny which though they may prevail for a day time will sufficiently confute and slight objection which he know may be answer and answer beyond reply such my lord be the objection which have be hitherto raise against the troops of hanover of which many arise from ignorance and many from prejudice and some may be suppose to be make only for the sake of give way to invective and indulge a petulant inclination of speak contemptuously of hanover with this view my lord it have be ask why the hanoverian be prefer to all other nation why they have be select from all other troops to fight against france the cause of europe they be choose my lord because they be most easily to be procure of the other nation from whom force have usually be hire some be engage in the care of protect or the design of extend they own dominion and other have no troops levy nor could therefore furnish they with speed enough for the exigence that demand they it have be ask with a air of triumph as a question to which no answer could be give why a equal number of briton be not send since they valor might be esteem at least equal to that of hanoverian i be far my lord from intend to diminish the reputation of the british courage or detract from that praise which have be gain by such gallant enterprise and preserve by a long succession of danger and of victory nor do i expect that any nation will ever form a just claim to superiority the reason therefore my lord for which the troops of hanover be hire be not that the bravery of we countryman be doubt but that the transportation of such number might leave we naked to the insult of a enemy for though the noble lord have declare that after have send sixteen thousand into flander we should still have reserve for we defense a body of seven thousand equal to that to which the protection of this kingdom be intrust in the late war he opinion will upon examination be find to have arise only from the enumeration of the name of we regiment many of which be far from be complete and some almost merely nominal so that perhaps if a body of sixteen thousand more have be send there would not have remain a single regiment to have repel the crew of any daring privateer that should have land to burn we village and ravage the defenceless country it be desire my lord by the queen of hungary that a british army might appear on the continent in she favor for she know the reputation and terror of we arm and as she demand be equitable in itself and honorable to the nation it be comply with and as many of we native troops be send as it be think convenient to spare the rest be necessarily to be hire and it be the business of those lord who defend the motion to show from whence they could be call more properly than from hanover it have be urge with great warmth that the contract make for these troops have not be lay before the senate a charge which the noble lord who speak last but one have show to be ill ground because the former determination of the senate enable the crown to garrison the frontier town without any new deliberation but which may be perhaps more satisfactorily confute by show that it be a accusation of neglect that which be in reality not possible to be perform or which at least could not be perform without subject the government to imputation yet more dangerous than those which it now suffer the account my lord by which the ministry be determine to send the army into flander arrive only fifteen day before the recess of the senate nor be the resolution form as it may easily be imagine till several day after so that there be very little time for senatorial deliberation nor be it perhaps convenient to publish at that time the whole scheme of we design but let we suppose my lord that the senate have a few day before they rise be consult and that a vote of credit have be require to enable the crown to hire force during the interval of the session what would those by whom this motion be support have urge against it would they not with great appearance of reason have allege the impropriety of such a application to the thin remains of a senate from which almost all those have retire whom they employment do not retain in the neighborhood of the court would it not have be echo from one corner of these kingdom to another that the ministry have betray they country by a contract which they dare not lay before a full senate and of which they would trust the examination only to those whom they have hire to approve it would not this have be generally assert and generally believe would not those who distinguish themselves as the opponent of the court have urge that the king ought to exert he prerogative and trust the equity of the senate for the approbation of he measure and the payment of the troops which he have retain for the support of the common cause the cause for which so much zeal have be express and for which it could not with justice be suspect that any reasonable demand would be deny would not the solicitation of a grant of power without limit to be exert wholly at the discretion of the ministry be censure as a precedent of the utmost danger which it be the business of every man to oppose who have not lose all regard to the constitution of he country these insinuation my lord be foresee and allow by the ministry to be specious and therefore they determine to avoid they by pursue they scheme at they own hazard without any other security than the consciousness of the rectitude of they own design and to trust to the equity of the senate when they should be lay before they at a time when part of they effect might be discover and when therefore no false representation could be use to mislead they judgment they know the zeal of the common for the great cause of universal liberty they know that they measure have no other tendency than the promotion of that cause and therefore they confidently form those expectation which have not deceive they that the pay of the troops would be readily grant and order they therefore to march though if the common have disapprove they plan they must have return into they own country or have be support at the expense of the electorate the objection raise against these troops have apparently have no influence in the other house because supplies have be grant for they pay and i believe they will upon examination be find by you lordship not to deserve much regard it be assert that they can not act against the emperor establish and acknowledge by the diet without subject they country to a interdict and it be therefore suspect that they would in reality be of no use this suspicion my lord i suppose it be now not necessary to censure since you have hear from he majesty that they be prepare to march and as the consequence of they conduct can only affect the electorate its propriety or legality with regard to the constitution of the empire fall not properly under we consideration how he majesty 's measure may be defend even in this view i suppose i need not inform any of this assembly it be well know that the emperor be choose not by the free consent of the diet in which every elector vote accord to he own sense but by a diet in which one vote of the empire be suspend without any regard to law or justice and in which the rest be extort by a french army which threaten immediate ruin to he who should refuse he consent the emperor thus choose be likewise afterwards recognize by the same power upon the same motive and the aid be grant as the vote be give by the influence of the army of france for this reason my lord the queen of hungary still refuse to give the elector of bavarium the style and honor which belong to the imperial dignity she consider the throne as still vacant and require that it should be fill by a uninfluenced election it have be observe my lord that he majesty give he vote to the elector of bavarium and it have be therefore represent as a inconsistency in he conduct that he should make war against he but my lord it will by no means follow that because he vote for he he think he lawfully elect nor that it be unjust to dispossess he though it be to be observe that we be not make war to dethrone the emperor however elect but to support the pragmatick sanction this observation though somewhat foreign from the present debate i have think it not improper to lay before you lordship that no scruple might remain in the most delicate and scrupulous and to show that the measure of he majesty can not be justly charge with inconsistency but this my lord be not the only nor the greatest benefit which the queen of hungary have receive from these troops for it be highly probable that the state will be induce to concur in the common cause when they find that they be not incite to a mock confederacy when they perceive that we really intend to act vigorously that we decline neither expense nor danger and that a compliance with we demand will not expose they to stand alone and unassisted against the power of france elate by success and exasperate by opposition if this my lord should be the consequence of we measure and this consequence be perhaps not far distant it will no longer be i hope assert that these mercenary be a useless burden to the nation that they be of no advantage to the common cause or that the people have be betray by the ministry into expense merely that hanover might be enrich when the grand _ confederacy _ be once revive and revive by any universal conviction of the destructive measure the insatiable ambition and the outrageous cruelty of the french what may not the friend of liberty presume to expect may they not hope my lord that those haughty troops which have be so long employ in conquest and invasion that have lay waste the neighbouring country with slaughter and devastation will be soon compel to retire to they own frontier and be content to guard the verge of they native province may we not hope that they will soon be drive from they post that they will be force to retreat to a more defensible station and admit the army of they enemy into they dominion and that they will be pursue from fortress to fortress and from one intrenchment to another till they shall be reduce to petition for peace and purchase it by the alienation of part of they territory i hope my lord it may be yet safely assert that the french however powerful be not invincible that they army may be destroy and they treasure exhaust that they may therefore be reduce to narrow limit and disabled from be any longer the disturber of the peace of the universe it be well know my lord that they wealth be not the product of they own country that gold be not dig out of they mountain or roll down they river but that it be gain by a extensive and successful commerce carry on in many part of the world to the diminution of we own it be know likewise that trade can not be continue in war without the protection of naval armament and that we fleet be at present superior in strength to those of the greatest part of the universe unite it be therefore reasonably to be hope that though by assist the house of austrium we should provoke the french to declare war against we they hostility would produce none of those calamity which seem to be dread by part of this assembly and that such a confederacy might be form as would be able to retort all the machination of france upon herself as would tear she province from she and annex they to other sovereignty it have be urge that no such success can be expect from the conduct which we have lately pursue that we who be thus daring the resentment of the most formidable power in the universe have long suffer ourselves to be insult by a enemy of far inferior force that we have be defeat in all we enterprise and have at present appear to desist from any design of hostility that the spaniard scarcely perceive that they have a enemy or feel any of the calamity or inconveniency of war and that they be every day enrich with the plunder of britain without danger and without labor that the war against spain have not hitherto be remarkably successful must be confess and though the spaniard can not boast of any other advantage than the defense of they own dominion yet they may perhaps be somewhat elated as they have be able to hold out against a enemy superior to themselves but my lord i be far from believe that they consider the war against we as a advantage or that they do not lament it as one of the heaviest calamity that could fall upon they if it be ask in what part of they dominion they feel any effect of we hostility i shall answer with great confidence that they feel they in every part which be expose to the evil of a naval war that they be in pain wherever they be sensible that they be wound wherever they be not sheltered from we blow by the interposition of the nation of the continent if we examine my lord the influence of we european armament we shall find that they ship of war be shut up in the harbor of france and that the fleet of both nation be happily block up together so that they can neither extricate each other by concerted motion in which we attention might be distract and we force divide nor by they unite force break through the bar by which they be shut up from the use of the ocean but this my lord however important with respect to we be perhaps the smallest inconvenience which the spaniard feel from we naval superiority they have a army my lord in italy expose to all the misery of famine while we fleet prohibit the transportation of those provision which have be store in vessel for they supply and which must be probably soon make defenceless by the want of ammunition and fall into the hand of they enemy without the honor of a battle but what to the pride of a spaniard must be yet a more severe affliction they have on the same continent a natural confederate who be yet so intimidate by the british fleet that he dare neither afford they refuge in he dominion nor send he troops to they assistance the queen amidst all the scheme which she unbounded ambition form for the exaltation of she family find she own son after have receive a kingdom from she kindness restrain from support she and reduce to preserve those territory which she have bestow upon he by abandon she from whom he receive they these my lord be the inconveniency which the spaniard feel from we fleet in the mediterranean and even these however embarrassing however depress be lighter than those which we american navy produce it be apparent that money be equivalent to strength a proposition of which if it could be doubt the spanish monarchy would afford sufficient proof as it have be for a long time support only by the power of riches it be therefore impossible to weaken spain more speedily or more certainly than by intercept or obstruct the annual supplies of gold and silver which she receive from she american province by which she be once enable to threaten slavery to all the neighbouring nation and incite to begin with the subjection of this island she mighty scheme of universal monarchy and by which she have still continue to exalt herself to a equality with the most powerful nation to erect new kingdom and set at defiance the austrian power these supplies my lord be now if not wholly yet in a great measure withhold and by all the effort which the spaniard now make they be exhaust they vitals and waste the natural strength of they native country while they make war with adventitious treasure and only squander one year what another would repay they it be not easy to foresee how long they pride would incline they to hold out against superior strength while they be only engage in a naval war they might have persist for a long time in a kind of passive obstinacy and while they be engage in no foreign enterprise might have support that trade with each other which be necessary for the support of life upon the credit of those treasure which be annually heap up in they storehouse though they be not receive and by which upon the termination of the war all they debt might at once be pay and all they fund be reestablish but at present my lord they condition be far different they have be tempt by the prospect of enlarge they dominion to raise army for distant expedition which must be support in a foreign country and can be support only by regular remittance of treasure and have form these project at a time when the means of pursue they be cut off they have by one war increase they expense when they receipt be obstruct by another in this state my lord i be certain the spaniard be very far from think the hostility of britain merely nominal and from inquire in what part of the world they enemy be to be find the troops in italy see they sail in triumph over the mediterranean intercept they provision and prohibit those succor which they expect from they confederate of sicily in spain they tax and they poverty poverty which every day increase inform they that the sea of america be possess by the fleet of britain by whom they mine be make useless and they wealthy dominion reduce to a empty sound they may indeed comfort themselves in they distress with the advantage which they troops have gain over the king of sardinium and with the entrance which they have force into he dominion but this can afford they no long satisfaction since they will probably never be able to break through the pass at which they have arrive or to force they way into italy and must perish at the foot of inaccessible rock where they be now support at such a expense that they be more burdensome to they own master than to the king of sardinium of this prince i know not why it have be assert that he will probably violate he engagement to britain and austria that he will purchase peace by perfidy and grant a passage to the army of spain he conduct have certainly give hitherto no reason for such a imputation he have oppose they with fortitude and vigor and address nor have he fail in any of the duty require of a general or a ally he have expose he person to the most urgent danger and he dominion to the ravages of war he have reject all the solicitation of france and set she menace at defiance and surely my lord if no private man ought to be censure without just reason even in familiar discourse we ought still to be more cautious of injure the reputation of prince by publick reproach in the solemn debate of national assembly the same licentiousness of speech have not indeed be extend to all the prince mention in this debate the emperor have be treat with remarkable decency as the lawful sovereign of germany as one who can not be oppose without rebellion and against whom we therefore can not expect that the troops of hanover should presume to act since they must expose they country to the severity of the imperial interdict the noble lord who have thus ardently assert the rights of the emperor who have represent in such strong language the crime of violate the german constitution and have commend the neutrality of the king of prussium as proper to be imitate by all the rest of the prince ` of the empire have forget or hope that other would forget the injustice and violence by which he exalt himself to the throne from which they appear to think it a sacrilegious attempt to endeavor to thrust he down they forget that one of the vote be illegally suspend and that the rest be extort by the terror of a army they forget that he invite the french into the empire and that he be guilty of all the ravages which have be commit and all the blood that have be shed since the death of the emperor in the defense of the pragmatick sanction which he invade though ratify by the solemn consent of the imperial diet in defense of the pragmatick sanction my lord which all the prince of the empire except he majesty saw violate without concern be we now require to exert we force we be require only to perform what we promise by the most solemn treaty which though they have be break by the cowardice or ambition of other power it will be we greatest honor to observe with exemplary fidelity with this view as you lordship have already be inform the hanoverian troops will march into the empire nor have they march be hitherto delay either because there be yet no regular scheme project or because they be oblige to wait for the permission of the king of prussium or because they intend only to amuse europe with a empty show : they be detain my lord in flander because it be believe that they be more useful there than they would be in any other place because they at once encourage the state alarm the french defend the low country and keep the communication open between the queen 's dominion and those of she ally nor be these advantage my lord chimerical and such as be only suggest by a warm imagination for it be evident that by keep they station in those country they have change the state of the war that they have protect the queen of hungary from be oppress by a new army of french and give she a opportunity of establish herself in the possession of bavarium that the french force instead of be send either to the assistance of the king of spain against the king of sardinium or of the emperor for the recovery of those dominion which he have lose by a implicit confidence in they alliance have be necessarily draw down to the opposite extremity of they dominion where they be of no use either to they own country or to they confederate the unite troops of britain and hanover therefore carry on the war by live at ease in they quarter in flander more efficaciously than if they have march immediately into bavarium or bohemia thus my lord i have endeavor to show the justice of we design and the usefulness of the measure by which we have endeavor to execute they and doubt not but you lordship will upon consider the argument which have be urge on either side and those which you own reflection will suggest allow that it be not only just but necessary to take into we pay the troops of hanover for the support of the pragmatick sanction and the preservation of the house of austrium and that since the same reason which induce the government to hire they still make it necessary to retain they you will prefer the general happiness of europe the observation of publick faith and the security of we own liberty and those of we posterity to a small alleviation of we present expense and unanimously reject a motion which have no other tendency than to resign the world into the hand of the french and purchase a short and dependant tranquillity by the loss of all those blessing which make life desirable lord lonsdale speak next to the following effect : -- my lord notwithstanding the confidence with which the late measure of the government have be defend by they author i be not yet set free from the scruple which my own observation have raise and which have be strengthen by the assertion of those noble lord who have speak in vindication of the motion many of the objection which have be raise and enforce with all the power of argument have yet remain unanswered or those answer which have be offer be such as leave the argument in its full strength many of the assertion which have be produce seem the effect of hope rather than conviction and we be rather tell what we be to hope from future measure than what advantage we have receive from the past i be indeed one of those whom it will be difficult to convince of the propriety of engage in a new war when we be unsuccessful in that which we have already undertake and of provoke a more powerful enemy when all we attempt be baffle by a weaker and can not yet set myself free from the apprehension of new defeat and new disgrace from the arm of france after have long see how little we be able to punish the insolence of spain i can not but fear that by a ill-timed and useless opposition to scheme which however destructive or unjust we can not obviate we shall subject ourselves to numberless calamity that the ocean will be cover with new fleet of privateer that we commerce will be interrupt in every part of the world and that we shall only provoke france to seize what she would at least have spare some time longer but my lord if it be grant that the pragmatick sanction be obligatory to we though it be violate by every other power that we should labor to reduce the power of europe to a equipoise whenever accident or folly produce any alteration of the balance and that we be now not to preserve the house of austrium from fall but raise it from the dust and restore it to its ancient splendor even at the hazard of a war with that power which now give law to all the western nation yet it will not surely be assert that we ought to be without limit that we ought to preserve the house of austrium not only by the danger of we own country but by its certain ruin and endeavor to avert the possibility of slavery by subject ourselves to misery more severe than the utmost arrogance of conquest or the most cruel wantonness of tyranny would inflict upon we i have observe that many lord have express in this debate a uncommon ardor for the support of the queen of hungary nor be it without pleasure that i see the most laudable of all motive justice and compassion operate in this great assembly with so much force may you lordship always continue to stand the great advocate for publick faith and the patron of true greatness in distress may magnanimity always gain you regard and calamity find shelter under you protection i likewise my lord desire to be remember among those who reverence the virtue and pity the misery of this illustrious princess who look with detestation on those who have invade the dominion which they have oblige themselves by solemn treaty to defend and who have take advantage of the general confederacy against she to enrich themselves with she spoil who have insult she distress and aggravate she misfortune but my lord while i feel all these sentiment of compassion for the queen of hungary i have not yet be able to forget that my own country claim a nearer regard that i be oblige both by interest and duty to preserve myself and my posterity and my fellow-subject from those misery which i lament when they happen to other however distant i can not but remember that i be not to save another from destruction by destroy myself nor to rescue austrium by the ruin of britain though i be therefore my lord not unwilling to assist the queen of hungary i think it necessary to fix the limit of we regard to inquire how far we may proceed with safety and what expense the nation can bear and how those expense may be best employ the danger of the queen of hungary ought not to have a effect which would be reproachful even if the danger be we own it ought not so far to engross we faculty as to hinder we from attend to every other object the man who run into a greater evil to avoid a less evidently show that he be defective either in prudence or in courage that either he want the natural power of distinguish or that he dread of a approach or he impatience of a present evil have take it away let we therefore examine my lord the measure with which those who be intrust with the administration of publick affair would persuade we to concur and inquire whether they be such as can be approve by we without danger to we country let we consider my lord yet more nearly whether they be not such as we ourselves could not be prevail upon even to regard as the object of deliberation be we not dazzle on one part by glare prospects of triumph and honor of the reduction of france and the rescue of the world of the propagation of liberty and the defense of religion and intimidate on the other by the view of approach calamity the cruelty of persecution and the hardship of slavery all the art of exaggeration my lord have be practice to reconcile we to the measure which be now propose and indeed all be necessary for the expense to which we be about to condemn this nation be such as it be not able to bear and to which no lord in this house would consent be he calm enough to number the sum to prove the truth of this assertion one question be necessary be any lord in this assembly willing to assist the queen of hungary at the expense of sixteen hundred thousand a year i think the universal silence of this assembly be a sufficient proof that no one be willing i will however repeat my question be any lord in this assembly willing that this nation should assist the queen of hungary at the annual expense of sixteen hundred thousand pound the house be as i expect still silent and therefore i may now safely proceed upon the supposition of a unanimous negative nor do any thing remain in order to evince the impropriety of the measure which we be about to pursue but that every lord may reckon up the sum require for the support of those troops let he take a view of we military estimate and he will quickly be convince how much we be condemn to suffer in this cause he will find that we be about not only to remit yearly into a foreign country more than a million and a half of money but to hazard the life of multitude of we fellow-subject in a quarrel which at most affect we but remotely that we be about to incur as auxiliary a expense greater than that which the principal sustain the sum which i have mention my lord enormous as it may appear be by no means exaggerate beyond the truth whoever shall examine the common military estimate will easily be convince that the force which we now maintain upon the continent can not be support at less expense and that we be therefore about to exhaust we country in a distant quarrel and to lavish we blood and treasure with useless profusion this profusion my lord be useless at least useless to any other end than a ostentatious display of we force and we riches not because the balance of power be irrecoverably destroy not because it be contrary to the natural interest of a island to engage in war on the continent nor because we shall lose more by the diminution of we commerce than we shall gain by a annual victory it be useless not because the power of france have by long negligence be suffer to swell beyond all opposition nor because the queen of hungary ought not to be assist at the hazard of this kingdom though all these reason be of importance enough to claim we consideration it be useless my lord because the queen of hungary may be assist more powerfully at less charge because a third part of this sum will enable she to raise and to maintain a greater body of man than have now be send she nor will the troops which she may be thus enable to raise my lord be only more numerous but more likely to prosecute the war with ardor and to conclude it therefore with success they will fight for the preservation of they own country they will draw they sword to defend they house and they estate they wife and they child from the rage of tyrant and invader they will enter the field as man who can not leave it to they enemy without resign all that make life valuable and who will therefore more willingly die than turn they back it may reasonably be imagine my lord that the queen will place more confidence in such force than in troops which be to fight only for honor or for pay and that she will expect from the affection of she own subject a degree of zeal and constancy which she can not hope to excite in foreigner and that she will think herself more secure in the protection of those whose fidelity she may secure by the solemnity of a oath than those who have no particular regard for she person nor any obligation to support she government it be no inconsiderable motive to this method of assist we ally that we shall entirely take away from france all pretence of hostility or resentment since we shall not attack she troops or invade she frontier but only furnish the queen of hungary with money without direct she how to apply it i be far my lord from be so much intimidate by the late increase of the french greatness as to imagine that no limit can be set to they ambition i be far from despair that the queen of hungary alone support by we with pecuniary assistance may be able to reduce they to solicitation for peace by drive they out of she dominion and pursue they into they own but as the chance of war be always uncertain it be surely most prudent to choose such a conduct as may exempt we from danger in all event and since we be not certain of conquer the french it be in my opinion most eligible not to provoke they because we can not be conquer without ruin this method be yet eligible on another account by proceed with frugality we shall gain time to observe the progress of the war and watch the appearance of any favourable opportunity without exhaust ourselves so far as to be make unable to improve they the time my lord at which we shall be thus exhaust at which we shall be reduce to a absolute inability to raise a army or equip a fleet be not at a great distance if we late profusion be for a short time continue we shall quickly have drain the last remains of the wealth of we country we have long go on from year to year raise tax and contracting debt and unless the riches of britain be absolutely unlimited must in a short time reduce they to nothing we expense be not all indeed equally destructive some though the method of raise they be vexatious and oppressive do not much impoverish the nation because they be refund by the extravagance and luxury of those who be retain in the pay of the court but foreign war threaten immediate destruction since the money that be spend in distant country can never fall back into its former channel but be dissipate on the continent and irrecoverably lose when this consideration be present to my mind and on this occasion no man who have any regard for himself or he posterity can omit it i can not but think with horror on a vote by which such prodigious sum be waft into another region : i can not but tremble at the sound of a tax for the support of a foreign war and think a french army land on we coast not much more to be dread than the annual payment to which we appear now to be condemn and from which nothing can preserve we but the address which be now propose by what argument the common be persuade or by what motive incite to vote a supply for the support of this mercenary force i have not yet hear nor as a member of this house my lord be it necessary for I to inquire they authority though mention with so much solemnity on this occasion be to have no influence on we determination if they be mistaken it be more necessary for we to inquire with uncommon caution if they be corrupt it be more necessary for we to preserve we integrity if we be to comply blindly with they decision we knowledge and experience be of no benefit to we country we only waste time in useless solemnity and may be once more declare useless to the publick the common my lord do not imagine themselves nor be imagine by the nation to constitute the legislature the people when any uncommon heat prevail in the other house disturb they debate and overrule they determination have be long accustomed to expect redress and security from we calmer counsel and have consider this house as the place where reason and justice may be hear when by clamor and uproar they be drive from the other on this occasion my lord every briton fix he eye upon we and every man who have sagacity enough to discover the dismal approach of publick poverty now supplicate you lordship by agree to this address to preserve he from it then the speaker speak to the follow purport : -- my lord have very attentively observe the whole progress of this important debate and consider with the utmost impartiality the argument which have be make use of on each side i can not think the question before we doubtful or difficult and hope that i may promote a speedy decision of it by recapitulate what have be already urge that the debate may be consider at one view and by add some observation which have arise to my own thought on this occasion at the first view of the question before we in its present state no man can find any reason for prejudice in favor of the address propose this house be indeed yet divide and many lord have speak on each side with great force and with great address but the authority of the other house add to the number which have already declare in this for the support of the foreign troops be sufficient to turn the balance in the opinion of any man who contents himself to judge by the first appearance of thing and must incline he to imagine that position at least more probable which be ratify by the determination of one house and yet undecided by the other i know my lord what may be object to these observation on the other house and readily agree with the noble lord that we determination ought not to be influence by theirs but on this occasion i introduce they decision not as the decree of legislator but as the result of the consideration of wise man and in this sense it may be no less reasonable to quote the determination of the common than to introduce the opinion of any private man whose knowledge or experience give he opinion a claim to we regard nor do i mention the weight of authority on one side as sufficient to influence the private determination of any in this great assembly it be the privilege and the duty of every man who possess a seat in the highest council of he country to make use of he own eye and he own understanding to reject those argument of which he can not find the force whatever effect they may have upon other and to discharge the great trust confer upon he by consult no conscience but he own yet though we be by no means to suffer the determination of other man to repress we inquiry we may certainly make use of they to assist they we may very properly therefore inquire the reason that induce the other house to approve those bill which be bring before they since it be not likely that they consent be obtain without argument at least probable though they be not to be by we consider as conclusive upon they authority the chief advantage which the publick receive from a legislature form of several distinct power be that all law must pass through many deliberation of assembly independent on each other of which if the one be agitate by faction or distract by division it may be hope that the other will be calm and united and of which it can hardly be fear that they can at any time concur in measure apparently destructive to the commonwealth but these inquiry my lord however proper or necessary be to be make by we not in solemn assembly but in we private character and therefore i shall not now lay before you lordship what i have hear from those whom i have consult for the sake of obtain information on this important question or shall at least not offer it as the opinion of the common or pretend to add to it any influence different from that of reason and truth the argument which have be offer in this debate for the motion be indeed such as do not make any uncommon expedient necessary they will not drive the advocate for the late measure to seek a refuge in authority instead of reason they require in my opinion only to be consider with a calm attention and they force will immediately be at a end the most plausible objection my lord be that the measure to which you approbation be now desire be concerted and execute without the concurrence of the senate and it be therefore urge that they can not now deserve we approbation because it be not ask at the proper time in order to answer this objection my lord it be necessary to consider it more distinctly than those who make it appear to have do that we may not suffer ourselves to confound question real and personal to mistake one object for another or to be confound by different view that the consent of the senate be not ask my lord suppose it a neglect and a neglect of a criminal kind of a tendency to weaken we authority and shake the foundation of we constitution which be the utmost that the most ardent imagination or the most hyperbolical rhetorick can utter or suggest may be indeed a just reason for invective against the minister but be of no force if urge against the measure to take auxiliary into we pay may be right though it might be wrong to hire they without apply to the senate as it be proper to throw water upon a fire though it be convey to the place without the leave of those from whose well it be draw or over whose ground it be carry if the liberty of europe be really in danger if we treaty oblige we to assist the queen of hungary against the invader of she dominion if the ambition of france require to be repress and the power of germany to be animated against she by the certain prospect of a vigorous support i can not discover the propriety of this motion even suppose that we have not find from the minister all the respect that we have a right to demand as a lawful authority may do wrong so right may be sometimes do by a unlawful power and surely though usurpation ought to be punish the benefit which have be procure by it be not to be throw away we may retain the troops that have be hire if they be useful though we should censure the ministry for take they into pay but the motion to which we concurrence be now require be a motion by which we be to punish ourselves for the crime of the minister by which we be about to leave ourselves defenceless because we have be arm without we consent and to resign up all we rights and privilege to france because we suspect that they have not be sufficiently regard on this occasion by we minister those noble lord who have dwell with the greatest ardor on this omission have make no proposition for censure those whom they condemn as the author of it though this objection must terminate in a inquiry into they conduct and have no real relation to the true question now before we which be whether the auxiliary be of any use if they be useless they ought to be discharge without any other reason if they be necessary they ought to be retain whatever censure may fall upon the ministry i be indeed far from think that when you lordship have sufficiently examine the affair you will think you privilege invade or the publick trepan by artifice into expensive measure since it will appear that the ministry in reality prefer the most honest to the safest method of proceeding and choose rather to hazard themselves than to practice or appear to practice any fraud upon they country when it be resolve in council to take the troops of hanover into the pay of britain a resolution which as you lordship have already be inform be make only a few day before the senate rise it be natural to consider whether the consent of the senate should not be demand but when it appear upon reflection that to bring a affair of so great importance before the last remnant of a house of common after far the greater part have retire to the care of they own affair would be suspect as fraudulent and might give the nation reason to fear that such measure be intend as the minister be afraid of lay before a full senate it be think more proper to defer the application to the next session and to venture upon the measure that be form upon a full conviction of they necessity this conduct my lord be exactly conformable to the demand of those by whom the court have hitherto be oppose and who have signalize themselves as the most watchful guardian of liberty among these man vote of credit have never be mention but with detestation as act of implicit confidence by which the riches of the nation be throw down at the foot of the ministry to be squander at pleasure when it have be urge that emergency may arise during the recess of the senate which may produce a necessity of expense and that therefore some credit ought to be give which may enable the crown to provide against accident it have be answer that the expense which be incur during the recess of the senate will be either necessary or not that if they be necessary the ministry have no reason to distrust the approbation of the senate but if they be useless they ought not to expect it and that instead of desire to be exempt from any subsequent censure and to be secure in exaction or prodigality by a previous vote they ought willingly to administer the publick affair at they own hazard and await the judgment of the senate when the time shall come in which they proceedings be lay before it such have hitherto be the sentiment of the most zealous advocate for the rights of the people nor do i expect from any man who desire to appear under that character that he would censure the ministry for have throw themselves upon the judgment of the senate and neglect to secure themselves by any previous application for have trust in they own integrity and expose they conduct to a open examination without subterfuge and without precaution i do not imagine my lord that a senate upon whose decision all the measure which have be take so apparently depend would have be style a senate convene only to register the determination of the ministry or that any of you lordship would think he privilege diminish because money be not demand before the use of it be fully know if we lay aside my lord all inquiry into precedent and without regard to any political consideration examine this affair only by the light of reason it will surely appear that the ministry could not by any other method of proceed have show equal regard to the senate or equal confidence in they justice and they wisdom have they desire a vote of credit it might have be justly object that they require to be trust with the publick money without declare or be able to declare how it be to be employ that either they question the wisdom or honesty of the senate and therefore durst undertake nothing till they be secure of the supplies necessary for the execution of it have they inform both house of they whole scheme they might have be still charge and charge with great appearance of justice with have prefer they own safety to that of the publick and have rather discover they design to the enemy than trust to the judgment of the senate nor could any excuse have be make for a conduct so contrary to all the rule of war but such as must have dis-honoured either the minister or the senate such as must have imply either that the measure intend be unworthy of approbation or that they be by no means certain that even the best conduct would not be censure these objection they foresee and allow to be valid and therefore generously determine to pursue the end which every man be suppose to approve by the best means which they could discover and to refer they conduct to a full senate in which they do not doubt but they integrity and perhaps they success would find they vindicator instead of apply therefore to the remains of the common a few day before the general recess instead of assemble they friend by private intimation at a time when most of those from whom they might have dread opposition have retire they determine to attempt at they own hazard whatever they judge necessary for the promotion of the common cause and to refer they measure to the senate when it should be again assemble the manner in which one of the noble lord who have speak in support of the address have think it necessary that they should have apply to we be indeed somewhat extraordinary such as be certainly without precedent and such as be not very consistent with the constituent rights of the different power of the legislature he lordship have be please to remark that the crown have enter into a treaty and to ask why that treaty be not previously lay before the senate for its approbation i know not my lord with what propriety this contract for the troops of hanover can be term a treaty it be well know that no power in this kingdom can enter into a treaty with a foreign state except the king and it be equally certain that with regard to hanover the same right be limit to the elector this treaty therefore my lord be a treaty of the same person with himself a treaty of which the two counterpart be to receive they ratification from be sign with the same hand this surely be a treaty of a new kind such as no national assembly have yet consider have any other power of britain than its king or in hanover any other than the elector the right of enter into publick engagement a treaty might have be make but as the constitution of both nation be form the treaty be merely chimerical and absolutely impossible have such a treaty as be thus vainly imagine be really make it would yet be as inconsistent with the fundamental establishment of the empire to require that before it be ratify it should have be lay before the senate to make treaty as to make war be the acknowledged and established prerogative of the crown when war be declare the senate be indeed to consider whether it ought to be carry on at the expense of the nation and if treaty require any supplies to put they in execution they likewise fall properly at that time under senatorial cognizance : but to require that treaty shall not be transact without we previous concurrence be almost to annihilate the power of the crown and to expose all we design to the opposition of we enemy before they can be complete if therefore the troops of hanover can be of use for the performance of we stipulation if they can contribute to the support of the house of austrium the ministry can not in my opinion be censure for have take they into british pay nor can we refuse we concurrence with the common in provide for they support unless it shall appear that the design for which all we preparation have be make be such as can not be execute or such as ought not to be pursue several argument have be offer to prove both these position one noble lord have assert that it be by no means for the advantage either of ourselves or any other nation to restore the house of austrium to its ancient elevation another that it be by the imperial constitution unlawful for any of the prince of germany to make war upon the emperor solemnly acknowledge by the diet they have endeavor to intimidate we by turn we view to the difficulty by which we attempt be obstruct difficulty which they affect to represent as insuperable at least to this nation in its present state with this design my lord have the greatness of the french power be exaggerate the faith of the king of sardinium question and the king of prussium represent as determine to support the pretension of the emperor with this view have we natural strength be depreciate and all we measure and hope have be ridicule with wantonness not very consistent with the character of a british patriot most of these argument my lord have be already answer and answer in such a manner as have i believe not fail of convince every lord of they insufficiency unless perhaps those be to be except ty whom they be offer it have with great propriety be observe that the inconsistency imputed to he majesty in oppose the emperor for whom he vote be merely imaginary since it be not a necessary consequence that he for whom he vote be therefore lawfully elect and because he majesty do not engage in this war for the sake of dethrone the emperor but of support the pragmatick sanction nor do he oppose he as the head of the german body but as the invader of the dominion of austrium with regard to the propriety of maintain the austrian family in its present possession and of raise it if we arm should be prosperous to its ancient greatness it have be show that no other power be able to defend europe either against the turk on one part or the french on the other two power equally profess the destructive intention of extend they dominion without limit and of trample upon the privilege and liberty of all the rest of mankind it have be show that the general scheme of policy uniformly pursue by we ancestor in every period of time since the increase of the french greatness have be to preserve a equipoise of power by which all the smaller state be preserve in security it be apparent that by this scheme alone can the happiness of mankind be preserve and that no other family but that of austrium be able to balance the house of bourbon this equipoise of power have by some lord be imagine a airy scheme a please speculation which however it may amuse the imagination can never be reduce to practice it have be assert that the state of nation be always variable that dominion be every day transfer by ambition or by casualty that inheritance fall by want of heir into other hand and that kingdom be by one accident divide at one time and at other time consolidate by a different event that to be the guardian of all those whose credulity or folly may betray they to concur with the ambition of a artful neighbor and to promote the oppression of themselves be a endless task and that to obviate all the accident by which province may change they master be a undertaking to which no human foresight be equal that we have not a right to hinder the course of succession for we own interest nor to obstruct those contract which independent prince be persuade to make however contrary to they own interest or to the general advantage of mankind and it have be conclude by those reasoner that we should show the highest degree of wisdom and the truest though not the most refined policy by attend steadily to we own interest by improve the dissension of we neighbor to we own advantage by extend we commerce and increase we riches without any regard to the happiness or misery freedom or slavery of the rest of mankind i believe i need not very laboriously collect argument to prove to you lordship that this scheme of selfish negligence of supine tranquillity be equally imprudent and ungenerous since if we examine the history of the last century we shall easily discover that if this nation have not interpose the french have now be master of more than half europe and it can not be imagine that they would have suffer we to set they at defiance in the midst of they greatness that they would have spare we out of tenderness or forborne to attack we out of fear what the spaniard attempt though unsuccessfully from a more distant part of the world in the pride of they american affluence would certainly have be once more endeavor by france with far greater advantage and as it may be imagine with a different event that it would have be endeavor can not be doubt because the endeavor would not have be hazardous by once defeat we fleet they might land they force which might be waft over in a very short time and by a single victory they might conquer all the island or that part of it at least which be most worth the labor of conquest and though they should be unsuccessful they could suffer nothing but the mortification of they pride and would be in a short time enable to make a new attempt thus my lord if we could preserve we liberty in the general subjection of the western part of the world we should do it only by turn we island into a garrison by lay aside all other employment than the study of war and by make it we only care to watch we coast : a state which surely ought to be avoid at almost any expense and at any hazard to think that we could extend we trade or increase we riches in this state of the continent be to forget the effect of universal empire the french my lord would then be in possession of all the trade of those province which they have conquer they would be master of all they port and of all they shipping and you lordship may easily conceive with what security we should venture upon the ocean in a state of war when all the harbor of the continent afford shelter to we enemy if the french privateer from a few obscure creek unsupported by a fleet of war or at least not support by a navy equal to we own could make such devastation in we trade as enable they country to hold out against the confederacy of almost all the neighbouring power what my lord might not be dread by we when every ship upon the ocean should be a enemy when we should be at once overborne by the wealth and the number of we adversary when the trade of the world should be in they hand and they navy no less numerous than they troops i have make this digression my lord i hope not wholly without necessity to show that the advantage of preserve the equipoise of europe be not as they have be sometimes conceive empty sound or idle notion but that by the balance of one nation against another both the safety of other country and of we own be preserve and that therefore it require all we vigilance and all we resolution to establish and maintain it that there may come a time in which this scheme will be no longer practicable when a coalition of dominion may be inevitable and when one power will be necessarily exalt above the rest be indeed not absolutely impossible and therefore not to be peremptorily deny but it be not to be infer that we care be vain at present because perhaps it may some time be vain hereafter or that we ought now to sink into slavery without a struggle because the time may come when we strongest effort will be ineffectual it have indeed be almost assert that the fatal hour be now arrive and that it be to no purpose that we endeavor to raise any farther opposition to the universal monarchy project by france we be tell that the nation be exhaust and dispirit that we have neither influence nor riches nor courage remain that we shall be leave to stand alone against the unite house of bourbon that the austrian can not and that the dutch will not assist we that the king of sardinium will desert he alliance that the king of prussium have declare against we and therefore that by engage in the support of the pragmatick sanction we be about to draw upon ourselves that ruin which every other power have foresee and shun i be far from deny my lord that the power of france be great and dangerous but can draw no consequence from that position but that this force be to be oppose before it be still greater and this danger to be obviate while it be yet surmountable and surmountable i still believe it by unanimity and courage if we wealth my lord be diminish it be time to confine the commerce of that nation by which we have be drive out of the market of the continent by destroy they shipping and intercept they merchant if we courage be depress it be depress not by any change in the nature of the inhabitant of this island but by a long course of inglorious compliance with the demand and of mean submission to the insult of other nation to which it be necessary to put a end by vigorous resolution if we ally be timorous and waver it be necessary to encourage they by vigorous measure for as fear so courage be produce by example : the bravery of a single man may withhold a army from flight and other nation will be ashamed to discover any dread of that power which france along set at defiance they will be less afraid to declare they intention when they be convince that we intend to support they and if there be in reality any prince who do not favor we design he will be at least less inclined to obstruct it as he find the opposition which he must encounter more formidable for this reason my lord i be far from discover the justness of the opinion which have prevail very much in the nation on this occasion that we be not to act without ally because ally be most easily to be procure by act and because it be reasonable and necessary for we to perform we part however other power may neglect theirs the advice which the senate have often repeat to he majesty have be to oppose the progress of france and though it should be allow that he have be advise to proceed in concert _ with he ally _ yet it must be understand to suppose such ally as may be find to have courage and honesty enough to concur with he it can not be intend that he should delay he assistance till corruption be reclaim or till cowardice be animated for to promise the queen of hungary assistance on such term would be to insult she calamity and to withhold we succor till she be irrecoverably ruin the senate could not insist that we should stand neuter till all those who be engage by treaty to support the pragmatick sanction should appear willing to fulfil they stipulation for even france be to be number among those who have promise to support the house of austrium in its possession however she may now endeavor to take they away even with regard to that power from which most assistance may be reasonably expect nothing would be more imprudent than to declare that we determine not to act without they for what then would be necessary but that the french influence one town in they province or one deputy in they assembly and ruin the house of austrium in security and at leisure without any other expense than that of a bribe it be therefore necessary to transport we troops into flander to show the world that we be no longer incline to stand idle spectator of the trouble of europe that we no longer intend to amuse ourselves or we confederate with negotiation which might produce no treaty or with treaty which might be break whenever the violation of they afford any prospect of that advantage we be now resolve to sacrifice the pleasure of neutrality and the profit of peaceful traffick to the security of the liberty of europe and the observation of publick faith this necessity be so generally allow that when the first body of troops be send over no objection be make by those who find themselves incline to censure the conduct of we affair but that they be not sufficiently numerous to defend themselves and would be take prisoner by a french detachment the ministry be therefore ask why they do not send a larger force why they engage in hostility which could only raise the laughter of we enemy and why if they intend war they do not raise a army sufficient to prosecute it a army my lord a army truly formidable be now raise and assemble on the frontier of france ready to assist we ally and to put a stop to the violence of invasion we now see ourselves once again unite with the house of austrium and may hope once more to drive the oppressor of mankind before we but now my lord a clamor be propagate through the nation that these measure which have be so long desire be pernicious and treacherous that we be arm not against france but against ourselves that we army be send over either not to fight or to fight in a quarrel in which we have no concern to gain victory from which this nation will receive no advantage or to bring new dishonor upon they country by a shameful inactivity this clamor which if it have be confine to the vulgar have be perhaps of no great importance nor could have promote any of the design of those by whom it be raise have be mention in this house as a argument in favor of the motion which be now under the consideration of you lordship and it have be urge that these measure can not be proper because all measure by which he majesty 's government be make unpopular must in the end be destructive to the nation on this occasion my lord it be necessary to consider the nature of popularity and to inquire how far it be to be consider in the administration of publick affair if by popularity be mean only a sudden shout of applause obtain by a compliance with the present inclination of the people however excite or of whatsoever tendency i shall without scruple declare that popularity be to be despise it be to be despise my lord because it can not be preserve without abandon much more valuable consideration the inclination of the people have in all age be too variable for regard but if by popularity be mean that settle confidence and lasting esteem which a good government may justly claim from the subject i be far from deny that it be truly desirable and that no wise man ever disregard it but this popularity my lord be very consistent with contempt of riotous clamor and of mistaken complaint and be often only to be obtain by a opposition to the reign opinion and a neglect of temporary discontent opinion which may be inculcate without difficulty by favorite orator and discontent which the eloquence of seditious writer may easily produce on ignorance and inconstancy how easily the opinion of the vulgar may be regulate by those who have obtain by whatever method they esteem the debate of this day my lord may inform we since if the measure against which this motion be intend be really unpopular as they have be represent it be evident that there have be lately a very remarkable change in the sentiment of the nation for it be yet a very little time since the repression of the insolence of france and the relief of the queen of hungary be so generally wish and so importunately demand that have measure like these be then form it be not improbable that they might have reconcile the publick to that man whom the united voice of the nation have long labor to overbear it be indeed urge with a degree of confidence which ought in my opinion to proceed from stronger proof than have yet be produce that no hostility be intend that we armament on the continent be a idle show a inoffensive ostentation and that the troops of hanover have be hire only to enrich the electorate under the appearance of assist the queen of hungary whom in reality they can not succor without draw upon they country the imperial interdict it have be allege my lords-that these measure have be concerted wholly\/or the advantage of hanover that this kingdom be to be sacrifice to the electorate and that we be in reality intend to be make tributary to a petty power in confirmation of these suggestion advantage have be take from every circumstance that could admit of misrepresentation the constitution of the empire have be falsely quote to prove that they can not act against the emperor and they inactivity in flander have be produce as a proof that they do not intend to enter germany whoever shall consult the constituent and fundamental pact by which the german form of government be establish will find my lord that it be not in the power of the emperor alone to lay any of the state of germany under the ban and that the elector be independent in they own dominion so far as that they may enter into alliance with foreign power and make war upon each other it appear therefore my lord that no law prohibit the elector of hanover to send he troops to the assistance of the queen of hungary he may in consequence of treaty march into germany and attack the confederate of the emperor or what be not now intend even the emperor himself without any dread of the severity of the ban nor do the continuance of the force in flander show any unwillingness to begin hostility or any dread of the power of either prussium whose prohibition be merely imaginary or of france who be not less perplexed by the neighborhood of we army than by any other method that could have be take of attack she for be oblige to have a equal force always in readiness to observe they motion she have not be able to send a new army against the austrian but have be oblige to leave the emperor at they mercy and suffer they to recover bohemia without bloodshed and establish themselves at leisure in bavarium nor be this my lord the only advantage which have be gain by they residence in flander for the united province have be animated to a concurrence in the common cause and have consent so far to depart from they darling neutrality as to send twenty thousand of they force to garrison the barrier of which no man i suppose will say that it be not of great importance to the queen of hungary since it set she free from the necessity of distract she view and divide she force for the defense of the most distant part of she dominion at once nor will it be affirm that this advantage could have probably be gain without convince we ally of we sincerity by send a army into the continent if it be ask what be farther to be expect from these troops it ought to be remembered my lord with how little propriety we minister can be require to make publick a scheme of hostile operation and how much we should expose ourselves to we enemy should a precedent be establish by which we general would be incapacitate to form any private design and a end would be for ever put to military secrecy what necessity there can be for propose argument like these i be not indeed able to discover since the objection which have be make seem to proceed rather from obstinacy than conviction and the reflection that have be vent seem rather the product of wit irritated by malevolence than of reason enlighten by calm consideration the minister have be reproach with hanoverian measure without any proof that hanover be to receive the least advantage and have be charge with betray they country by those who can not show how they country be injure nor can prove either that interest or faith would allow we to sit inactive in the present disturbance of europe or that we could have act in any other manner with equal efficacy it be so far from be either evident or true my lord that britain be sacrifice to hanover that hanover be evidently hazard by she union with britain have this electorate now any other sovereign than the king of great britain it might have be secure by a neutrality and have look upon the misery of the neighbouring province without any diminution of its people or disturbance of its tranquillity nor could any danger be dread or any inconvenience be feel but from a open declaration in favor of the pragmatick sanction why the hire of the troops of any particular country should be consider as a act of submission to it or of dependency upon it i can not discover nor can i conceive for what reason the troops of hanover should be more dangerous or less popular at this than at any former time or why the employment of they should be consider as any particular regard if any addition of dominion have be to be purchase for the electorate by the unite arm of the confederate army i should perhaps be incline to censure the scheme as contrary to the interest of my native country nor shall any lord more warmly oppose design that may tend to aggrandize another nation at the expense of this but to hire foreigner of whatever country only to save the blood of briton be in my opinion a instance of preference which ought to produce rather acknowledgment of gratitude than sally of indignation upon the most exact survey of this debate i will boldly affirm that i never hear in this house a question so untenable in itself so obstinately or so warmly debate but hope that the sophistry which have be use however artful and the declamation which have be pronounced however pathetick will have no effect upon you lordship i hope that as the other house have already agree to support the auxiliary which have be retain and which have be prove in this debate to be retain for the strongest reason and the most important purpose you lordship will show by reject this motion that you be not less willing to concur in the support of publick faith and that you will not suffer posterity to charge you with the exaltation of france and the ruin of europe -lrb- the question be then put and determine in the negative by 90 against 35 -rrb- after the conclusion of this long debate the ministry do not yet think they victory in repel this censure sufficiently apparent unless a motion be admit which might imply a full and unlimited approbation of they measure and therefore the earl of scarborough rise and speak to the following effect : -- my lord it have be justly observe in the debate of this day that the opinion of the people of britain be regulate in a great measure by the determination of this house that they consider this as the place where truth and reason obtain a candid audience as a place sacred to justice and to honor into which passion partiality and faction have be very rarely know to intrude and that they therefore watch we decision as the great rule of policy and standing maxim of right and readily believe these measure necessary in which we concur and that conduct unblameable which have gain we approbation this reputation my lord we ought diligently to preserve by a unwearied vigilance for the happiness of we fellow-subject and while we possess it we ought likewise to employ its influence to beneficial purpose that the cause and the effect may reciprocally produce each other that the people when the prosperity which they enjoy by we care incline they to repose in we a implicit confidence may find that confidence a new source of felicity that they may reverence we because they be secure and happy and be secure and happy because they reverence we this great end my lord it will not be very difficult to attain the foundation of this exalted authority may easily be lay and the superstructure raise in a short time the one may be lay too deep to be undermine and the other build too firmly to be shake at least they can be impaired only by ourselves and may set all external violence at defiance to preserve the confidence of the people and consequently to govern they without force and without opposition it be only necessary that we never willingly deceive they that we expose the publick affair to they view so far as they ought to be make publick in they true state that we never suffer false report to circulate under the sanction of we authority nor give the nation reason to think we be satisfy when we be in reality suspicious of illegal design or that we suspect those measure of latent mischief with which we be in reality completely satisfied but it be not sufficient my lord that we publish ourselves no fallacious representation of we counsel it be necessary likewise that we do not permit they to be publish that we obviate every falsehood in its rise and propagate truth with we utmost diligence for if we suffer the nation to be deceive we be not much less criminal than those who deceive it at least we must be confess no longer to act as the guardian of the publick happiness if we suffer it to be interrupt by the dispersion of report which we know to be at once false and pernicious of these principle which i suppose will not be contest a easy application may be make to the business of the present day a question have be debate with great address great ardor and great obstinacy which be in itself though not doubtful yet very much diffused complicate with a great number of circumstance and extend to a multitude of relation and be therefore a subject upon which sophistry may very safely practice she art and which may be show in very different view to those whose intellectual light be too much contract to receive the whole object at once it may easily be assert by those who have long be accustom to affirm without scruple whatever they desire to obtain belief that the argument in favor of the motion which have now be reject by you lordship be unanswerable and it will be no hard task to lay before they audience such reason as though they have be easily confute by the penetration and experience of you lordship may to man unacquainted with politick and remote from the source of intelligence appear very formidable it be therefore not sufficient that you lordship have reject the former motion and show that you do not absolutely disapprove the measure of the government since it may be assert and with some appearance of reason that barely not to admit a motion by which all the measure of the last year would have be at once over-turned and annihilate be no proof that they have be fully justified and warmly confirm since many of the transaction might have be at least doubtful and yet this motion not have be proper in a affair of so great importance my lord a affair in which the interest of all the western world be engage it be necessary to take away all suspicion when the nation be about to be involve in a war for the security of ourselves and we posterity in a war which however prosperous must be at least expensive and which be to be carry on against a enemy who though not invincible be in a very high degree powerful it be surely proper to show in the most publick manner we conviction that neither prudence nor frugality have be want that the inconveniency which will be always feel in such contention be not bring upon we by wantonness or negligence and that no care be omit by which they be alleviate and that they may be bear more patiently because they can not be avoid this attestation my lord we can only give by a solemn address to he majesty of a tendency contrary to that of the motion now reject and by such a attestation only can we hope to revive the courage of the nation to unite those in the common cause of liberty whom false report have alienate or shake and to restore to he majesty that confidence which all the subtilty of faction have be employ to impair i therefore move that a humble address be present to he majesty import that in the unsettled and dangerous situation of affair in europe the send a considerable body of british force into the austrian netherland and augment the same with sixteen thousand of he majesty 's electoral troops and the hessian in the british pay and thereby in conjunction with the queen of hungary 's troops in the low country form a great army for the service of the common cause be a wise useful and necessary measure manifestly tend to the support and encouragement of he majesty 's ally and the real and effectual assistance of the queen of hungary and the restore and maintain the balance of power and have already produce very advantageous consequence the earl of oxford speak next to the following effect : -- my lord the necessity of support we reputation and of preserve the confidence of the publick i be by no means incline to dispute be convince that from the instant in which we shall lose the credit which we ancestor have deliver down to we we shall be no longer consider as a part of the legislature but be treat by the people only as a assembly of hireling and dependant convene at the pleasure of the court to ratify its decision without examination to extort tax promote slavery and to share with the ministry the crime and the infamy of cruelty and oppression for this reason it be undoubtedly proper that we avoid not only the crime but the appearance of dependence and that every doubtful question should be freely debate and every pernicious position publickly condemn and that when we decision be not agreeable to the opinion or expectation of the people we should at least show they that they be not the effect of blind compliance with the demand of the ministry or of a implicit resignation to the direction of a party we ought to show that we be unprejudiced and ready to hear truth that we determination be not dictate by any foreign influence and that it will not be vain to inform we or useless to petition we in these principle i agree with the noble lord who have make the motion but in the consequence which be on this occasion to be draw from they i can not but differ very widely from he for in my opinion nothing can so much impair we reputation as a address like that which be propose a address not found either upon fact or argument and from which the nation can collect only that the protection of this house be withdraw from they that they be give up to ruin and that they be to perish as a sacrifice to the interest of hanover let we consider what we be now invite to assert and it will easily appear how well this motion be calculate to preserve and to advance the reputation of this house we be to assert my lord the propriety of a new war against the most formidable power of the universe at a time when we have be defeat and disgrace in we conquest with a kingdom of inferior force we be to declare we readiness to pay and to raise new tax since no war can be carry on without they at a time when we commerce the great source of riches be obstruct when the interest of debt contract during a long war and a peace almost equally expensive be prey upon we estate when the profit of the trade of future age and the rent of the inheritance of we latest descendant be mortgage and what ought yet more to affect we at a time when the outcry of distress be universal when the misery of hopeless poverty have sink the nation into despair when industry scarcely retain spirit sufficient to continue she labor and all the lower rank of mankind be overwhelm with the general calamity there may perhaps be some among you lordship who may think this representation of the state of the publick exaggerate beyond the truth there be many in this house who see no other scene than the magnificence of feast the gaiety of ball and the splendor of a court and it be not much to be wonder at if they do not easily believe what it be often they interest to doubt that this luxury be support by the distress of million and that this magnificence expose multitude to nakedness and famine it be my custom when the business of the senate be over to retire to my estate in the country where i live without noise and without riot and take a calm and deliberate survey of the condition of those that inhabit the town and village about I i mingle in they conversation and hear they complaint i enter they house and find by they condition that they complaint be just i discover that they be daily impoverished and that they be not able to struggle under the enormous burden of publick payment of which i be convince that they can not be levy another year without exhaust the people and spread universal beggary over the nation what can be the opinion of the publick when they see a address of this house by which new expense be recommend will they not think that they state be desperate and that they be sell to slavery from which nothing but insurrection and bloodshed can release they if they retain any hope of relief from this house they must soon be extinguish when they find in the next clause that we be sink to such a degree of servility as to acknowledge benefit which be never receive and to praise the invisible service of we army in flander if it be necessary my lord to impose upon the publick let we at least endeavor to do it less grossly let we not attempt to persuade they that those force have gain victory who have never see a enemy or that we be benefit by the transportation of we money into another country if it be necessary to censure those noble lord who have support the former motion and to punish they for daring to use argument which could not be confute for this be the apparent tendency of the present motion let we not lose all consideration of ourselves nor sacrifice the honor of the house to the resentment of the ministry for my part my lord i shall continue to avow my opinion in defiance of censure motion and address and as i struggle against the former ministry not because i envied or hate they but because i disapprove they conduct i shall continue to oppose measure equally destructive with equal zeal by whomsoever they be project or by whomsoever patronise lord carteret speak next to the follow purpose : -- my lord after so full a defense of the former motion as the late debate have produce it be rather with indignation than surprise that i hear that which be now offer it have be for a long time the practice of those who be support only by they number to treat they opponent with contempt and when they can not answer to insult they and motion have be make not because they be think right by those who offer they but because they would certainly be carry and would by be carry mortify they opponent this my lord be the only intent of the present motion which can promote no useful purpose and which though it may flatter the court must be consider by the people as a insult and therefore though i believe all opposition fruitless i declare that i never will agree to it and to show my lord that i do not oppose the ministry for the sake of obstruct the publick counsel or of irritating those whom i despair to defeat and that i be not afraid of trust my conduct to the impartial examination of posterity i shall beg leave to enter with my protest the reason which have influence I in this day 's deliberation that they be consider when this question shall no longer be a point of interest and we present jealousy and animosity be forget -lrb- it be carry in the affirmative by 78 against 35 -rrb- house of lord February 21 1742-3 debate on spirituous liquor the bill for alter the duty on spirituous liquor and permit they again to be sell with less restraint which be send up by the common to the house of lord produce there very long and serious deliberation to which the lord have every day each a particular summons as in case of the highest concern the bill be entitle a act for repeal certain duty on spirituous liquor and on licens for retail the same and for lay other duty on spirituous liquor and on licens for retail the say liquor the duty which be propose to be repeal be those lay by the act 9 geo ii which permit no person to sell spirituous liquor in less quantity than two gallon without a license for which fifty pound be to be pay whereas by the new bill a small duty per gallon be lay on at the still-head and the license be to cost but twenty shilling which be to be grant only to such as have licens for sell ale on the credit of this act as soon as it be pass by the common the ministry borrow a large sum at three per cent but it be understand that the sink fund be pledge as a collateral security to pay any deficiency in about a fortnight this bill pass all the form in the house of common almost without opposition and with little or no alteration from the scheme bring into the committee on way and mean for raise the supply for the current year by mr sandy then chancellor of the exchequer it be immediately carry up to the house of lord where it be read for the first time on the 17th of February and order a second reading on the twenty-second on that day the commissioner of excise accord to a order of the house bring a account of the sum arise by the last act and a yearly account for several year past and attend be interrogate concern the execution of the last act the bishop of orford particularly inquire whether it have be effectually put in force and question of the same kind be ask by lord lonsdale and other to which the commissioner answer that it have be diligently and vigorously execute so far as they or they officer have power to enforce it but that the justice have not always be equally zealous in second they endeavor and that it be impossible to discover all the petty dealer by whom it be infringe spirituous liquor still continue to be sell in small obscure shop and at the corner of the street a motion be also make that three of the physician of most note for they learning and experience should be summon to attend the house to declare they opinion with regard to the effect of spirituous liquor upon the human body but this be reject by 33 against 17 the bill be read the second time on the day appoint when the question be put whether it should be commit lord hervey rise and speak to the following effect : -- my lord though i doubt not but the bill now before we will be promote in this house by the same influence by which it have be conduct through the other yet i hope its success will be very different and that those art by which its consequence however formidable have be hitherto conceal or by which those whose business it be to have detect and expose they have be induce to turn they eye aside will not be practice here with the same efficacy though they should happen to be attempt with the same confidence i hope that zeal for the promotion of virtue and that regard to publick happiness which have on all occasion distinguish this illustrious assembly will operate now with uncommon energy and prevent the approbation of a bill by which vice be to be make legal by which the fence of subordination be to be throw down and all the order of society and decency of regular establishment be obliterate by universal licentiousness and lose in the wild confusion of debauchery of debauchery encourage by law and promote for the support of measure expensive ridiculous and unnecessary a law of so pernicious a tendency shall at least not pass through this house without opposition nor shall drunkenness be establish among we without the endeavor of one voice at least to withhold its progress for i now declare that i oppose the commitment of this bill and that i be determine to continue my opposition to it in all the step by which the form of we house make it necessary that it should pass before it can become a law nor do i speak my lord on this occasion with that distrust and mental hesitation which be both natural and decent when question be dubious when probability seem to be almost equally divide when truth appear to hover between two party and by turn to favor every speaker when specious argument be urge on both side and the number of circumstance to be collect and of relation to be adjust be so great that a exact and indubitable decision be scarcely to be attain by human reason i do not my lord now speak with the diffidence of inquiry or the uncertainty of conjecture nor imagine that i be now examine a political expedient of which the success can only be perfectly know by experience and of which therefore no man can absolutely determine whether it will be useful or pernicious or a metaphysical difficulty which may be discuss for ever without be decide in consider this bill my lord i proceed upon state and invariable principle i have no fact to examine but such as to the last degree be notorious such as have be experienced every hour since the existence of society and shall appeal not to transitory opinion or casual assertion but to the law of all civilized nation and to the determination of every man whose wisdom or virtue have give he a claim to regard all the decree of all the legislator of the earth or the declaration of wise man all the observation which nature furnish and all the example which history afford concur in condemn this bill before we as a bill injurious to society destructive of private virtue and by consequence of publick happiness detrimental to the human species and therefore such as ought to be reject in that assembly to which the care of the nation be commit that assembly which ought to meet only for the benefit of mankind and of which the resolution ought to have no other end than the suppression of those vice by which the happiness of life be obstruct or impair the bill now before you my lord be fundamentally wrong as it be form upon a hateful project of increase the consumption of spirituous liquor and consequently of promote drunkenness among a people reproach already for it throughout the whole world it contain such a concatenation of enormity teem with so vast a number of mischief and therefore produce in those mind that attend to its nature and pursue its consequence such endless variety of argument against it that the memory be perplex the imagination crowd and utterance overburdened before any one of its pernicious effect be fully dilate a thousand other appear the hydra still shoot out new head and every head vomit out new poison to infect society and lay the nation desolate i be therefore at a loss my lord not how to raise argument against this bill which can not be read or mention without furnish they by thousand but how to methodise those that occur to I and under what head to range my thought that i may pursue my design without confusion that i may understand myself and be understand by you lordship a multitude of consideration be obvious all of importance sufficient to claim attention and to outweigh the advantage propose by this hateful bill but which can not all be mention or at least not with that exactness which they deserve i shall therefore confine myself at present to three consideration and shall entreat the attention of you lordship while i examine the bill now before we with regard to its influence on the health and moral of the people the argument by which it have be hitherto support and the effect which it will have on the sink fund the first head my lord be so copious that i find myself very little relieved by the division which i have make the moral argument though separate from those which be either political or temporary be sufficient to overpower the strongest reason and overflow the most extensive comprehension it be not necessary i suppose to show that health of body be a blessing that the duty of life in which the greatest part of the world be employ require vigor and activity and that to want strength of limb and to want the necessary support of nature be to the lower class of mankind the same i need not observe to you lordship whose legislative character oblige you to consider the general concatenation of society that all the advantage which high station or large possession can confer be derive from the labor of the poor that to the plough and the anvil the loom and the quarry pride be indebted for its magnificence luxury for its dainty and delicacy for its ease a very little consideration will be sufficient to show that the lowest order of mankind supply commerce with manufacturer navigation with mariner and war with soldier that they constitute the strength and riches of every nation and that though they generally move only by superior direction they be the immediate support of the community and that without they concurrence policy would project in vain wisdom would end in idle speculation and the determination of this assembly would be empty sound it be therefore my lord of the utmost importance that all practice should be suppress by which the lower order of the people be enfeebled and enervate for if they should be no longer able to bear fatigue or hardship if any epidemical weakness of body should be diffuse among they we power must be at a end we mine would be a useless treasure and would no longer afford we either the weapon of war or the ornament of domestick elegance we should no longer give law to mankind by we naval power nor send out army to fight for the liberty of distant nation we should no longer supply the market of the continent with we commodity or share in all the advantage which nature have bestow upon distant country for all these my lord be the effect of indigent industry and mechanick labor all these blessing or conveniency be procure by that strength of body which nature have bestow upon the native of this country who have hitherto be remarkably robust and hardy able to support long fatigue and to contend with the inclemency of rigorous climate the violence of storm and the turbulence of wave and who have therefore extend they conquest with uncommon success and be equally adapt to the toil of trade and of war and have excel those who endeavor to rival they either in the praise of workmanship or of valor but my lord if the use of spirituous liquor be encourage they diligence which can only be support by health will quickly languish every day will diminish the number of the manufacturer and by consequence augment the price of labor those who continue to follow they employment will be partly enervate by corruption and partly make wanton by the plenty which the advancement of they wages will afford they and partly by the knowledge that no degree of negligence will deprive they of that employment in which there will be none to succeed they all we commodity therefore will be work with less care and at a higher price and therefore will be reject at foreign market in favor of those which other nation will exhibit of more value and yet at a lower rate no sooner my lord will this bill make drunkenness unexpensive and commodious no sooner will shop be open in every corner of the street in every petty village and in every obscure cellar for the retail of these liquor than the workroom will be forsake when the artificer have by the labor of a small part of the day procure what will be sufficient to intoxicate he for the remain hour for he will hold it ridiculous to waste any part of he life in superfluous diligence and will readily assign to merriment and frolick that time which he now spend in useful occupation but such be the quality of these liquor that he will not long be able to divide he life between labor and debauchery he will soon find himself disable by he excess from the prosecution of he work and those shop which be before abandon for the sake of pleasure will soon be make desolate by sickness those who be before idle will become diseased and either perish by untimely death or languish in misery and want a useless burden to the publick nor my lord will the nation only suffer by the deduction of such number from useful employment but by the addition of great multitude to those who must be support by the charity of the publick the manufacturer who by the use of spirituous liquor weaken he limb or destroy he health at once take from the community to which he belong a member by which the common stock be increase and by leave a helpless family behind he increase the burden which the common stock must necessarily support and the trader or husbandman be oblige to pay more towards the maintenance of the poor by the same accident which diminish he trade or he harvest which take away part of the assistance which he receive and raise the price of the rest that these liquor my lord liquor of which the strength be heighten by distillation have a natural tendency to inflame the blood to consume the vital juice destroy the force of the vessel contract the nerve and weaken the sinew that they not only disorder the mind for a time but by a frequent use precipitate old age exasperate disease and multiply and increase all the infirmity to which the body of man be liable be generally know to all whose regard to they own health or study to preserve that of other have at any time engage they in such inquiry and would have be more clearly explain to you lordship have the learn physician be suffer to have give they opinion on this subject as be yesterday propose why that proposal be reject my lord for what reason in the discussion of so important a question any kind of evidence be refuse posterity will find it difficult to explain without impute to you lordship such motive as i hope will never operate in this assembly it will be perhaps think that the danger be generally know though not acknowledge and that those who resolve to pass the bill have no other care than to obstruct such information as might prove to mankind that they be incite by other design than that of promote the publick good it be not however necessary that any very curious inquiry should be make for the discovery of that which indeed can not be conceal and which every man have a opportunity of remark that pass through the street so publick so enormous and so pernicious have be this dreadful method of debauchery that it have excite and baffle the diligence of the magistrate who have endeavor to stop its progress or hinder its effect they find they effort ineffectual and they diligence not only not useful to the publick but dangerous to themselves they quickly experience my lord the folly of those law which punish crime instead of prevent they they find that legal authority have little influence when oppose to the madness of multitude intoxicate with spirit and that the voice of justice be but very little hear amidst the clamor of riot and drunkenness we live my lord in a nation where the effect of strong liquor have be for a long time too well know we know that they produce in almost every one a high opinion of he own merit that they blow the latent spark of pride into flame and therefore destroy all voluntary submission they put a end to subordination and raise every man to a equality with he master or he governor they repress all that awe by which man be restrain within the limit of they proper sphere and incite every man to press upon he that stand before he that stand in the place of which that sudden elevation of heart which drunkenness bestow make he think himself more worthy pride my lord be the parent and intrepidity the fosterer of resentment for this reason man be almost always incline in they debauch to quarrel and to bloodsh they think more highly of they own merit and therefore more readily conclude themselves injure they be wholly divest of fear insensible of present danger superior to all authority and therefore thoughtless of future punishment and what then can hinder they from express they resentment with the most offensive freedom or pursue they revenge with the most daring violence thus my lord be forget dispute often revive and after have be long reconcile be at last terminate by blow thus be life destroy upon the most trifling occasion upon provocation often imaginary upon chimerical point of honor where he who give the offence perhaps without design support it only because he have give it and he who resent it pursue he resentment only because he will not acknowledge he mistake thus be life lose my lord at a time when those who set they to hazard be without consciousness of they value without sense of the law which they violate and without regard to any motive but the immediate influence of rage and malice when we consider my lord these effect of drunkenness it can be no subject of wonder that the magistrate find himself overborne by a multitude unite against he and unite by general debauchery government my lord subsist upon reverence and what reverence can be pay to the law by a crowd of which every man be exalt by the enchantment of those intoxicate spirit to the independence of a monarch the wisdom of a legislator and the intrepidity of a hero when every man think those law oppressive that oppose the execution of he present intention and consider every magistrate as he persecutor and enemy law my lord suppose reason for who ever attempt to restrain beast but by force and therefore those that propose the promotion of publick happiness which can be produce only by a exact conformity to good law ought to endeavor to preserve what may properly be call the publick reason they ought to prevent a general depravation of the faculty of those whose benefit be intend and whose obedience be require they ought to take care that the law may be know for how else can they be observe and how can they be know or at least how can they be remember in the heat of drunkenness that the law be universally neglect and defy among the lower class of mankind among those whose want of the light of knowledge and instruction make positive and compulsory direction more necessary for the regulation of they conduct be apparent from the representation of the magistrate in which the general disorder of this great city the open wickedness the daring insolence and unbounded licentiousness of the common people be very justly describe they wickedness and insolence my lord be indeed such that order be almost at a end rank no longer confer respect nor do dignity afford security the same confidence produce insult and robbery and that insensibility with which debauchery arm the mind equally against fear and pity frequently aggravate the guilt of robbery with greater crime those who be so unhappy as to fall into the hand of thief heat by spirit into madman seldom escape without suffer greater cruelty than the loss of money that the use of these poisonous draught quickly debilitate the limb and destroy the strength of the body however this quality may impair we manufacture weaken we army and diminish we commerce however it may reduce we fleet to a empty show and enable we enemy to triumph in the field or we rival to supplant we in the market can scarcely my lord come under consideration when we reflect how debauchery operate upon the moral it be happy my lord that those who be incline to mischief be disabled in a short time from execute they intention by the same cause which excite they that they be oblige to stop in the career of they crime that they be preserve from the hand of the executioner by the liquor which expose they to it and that palsy either disable they from pursue they villany or fever put a end to they life it be happy my lord that what be thus violent can not be last that those life which be employ in mischief be generally short and that since it be the quality of this malignant liquor to corrupt the mind it likewise destroy the body but this effect my lord be not constant or regular man sometimes continue for many year to supply the expense of drunkenness by rapine and to exasperate the fury of rapine by drunkenness and therefore though there could be any one so regardless of the happiness of mankind as to look without concern upon they who hurry themselves to the grave with poison he may yet be incite by he own interest to prevent the progress of this practice a practice which tend to the subversion of all order and the destruction of all happiness it be well know my lord that publick happiness must be on a state proportion to publick virtue that mutual trust be the cement of society and that no man can be trust but as he be reputed honest to promote trust my lord be the apparent tendency of all law when the tie of morality be enforce by penal sanction man be more afraid to violate they and therefore be trust with less danger but when they no longer fear the law they be to be restrain only by they conscience and if neither law nor conscience have any influence upon they conduct they be only a herd of wild beast let loose to prey upon each other and every man will inflict or suffer pain as he meet with one stronger or weaker than himself thus my lord will all authority cease property will become dangerous to he that possess it and confusion will overspread the whole community nor can it be easily conceive by the most extensive comprehension how far the mischief may spread or where the chain of destructive consequence will end if we consider we fleet or we army my lord it be apparent that neither obedience nor fidelity can be expect from man upon whom all the tie of morality and all the sanction of law have lose they influence they will mutiny without fear and desert without scruple and like wild beast will upon the least provocation turn upon those by whom they ought to be govern but drunkenness my lord not only corrupt man by take away the sense of those restraint by which they be generally keep in awe and withhold from the perpetration of villany but by superad the temptation of poverty temptation not easily to be resist even by those whose eye be open to the consequence of they action and which therefore will certainly prevail over those whose apprehension be lay asleep and who never extend they view beyond the gratification of the present moment drunkenness my lord be the parent of idleness for no man can apply himself to the business of he trade either while he be drink or when he be drunk part of he time be spend in jollity and part in imbecility when he be amidst he companion he be too gay to think of the consequence of neglect he employment and when he have overburdened himself with liquor he be too feeble and too stupid to follow it poverty my lord be the offspring of idleness as idleness of drunkenness the drunkard 's work be little and he expense be great and therefore he must soon see he family distressed and he substance reduce to nothing : and surely my lord it need not much sagacity to discover what will be the consequence of poverty produce by vice it be not to be expect my lord that a man thus corrupt will be warn by the approach of misery that he will recollect he understanding and awaken he attention that he will apply himself to he business with new diligence endeavor to recover by a increase of application what he have lose by inattention and make the remembrance of he former vice and the difficulty and disease which they bring upon he a incitement to he industry a confirmation of he resolution and a support to he virtue that this be indeed possible i do not intend to deny but the bare possibility of a event so desirable be the utmost that can be admit for it can scarcely be expect that any man should be able to break through all the obstacle that will obstruct he return to honesty and wisdom he companion will endeavor to continue the infatuate amusement which have so long delude he he appetite will assist they solicitation the desire of present ease by which all mankind be sometimes lead aside from virtue will operate with unusual strength since to retrieve he misconduct he must not only deny himself the pleasure which he have so long indulge but must bear the full view of he distress from which he will naturally turn aside he eye the general difficulty of reformation will incline he to seek for ease by any other means and to delay that amendment which he know to be necessary from hour to hour and from day to day till he resolution be too much weaken to prove of any effect and he habit confirm beyond opposition at length necessity immediate necessity press upon he he family be make clamorous by want and he call of nature and of luxury be equally importunate he have now lose he credit in the world and none will employ he because none will trust he or employment can not immediately be perhaps obtain because he place have for a long time be supply by other and even if he could obtain a readmission to he former business he want be now too great and too press to be supply by the slow method of regular industry he must repair he loss by more efficacious expedient and must find some method of acquisition by which the importunity of he creditor may be satisfied industry be now by long habit of idleness become almost impracticable he attention have be long amuse by please object and dissipate by jollity and merriment be not readily recall to a task which be unpleasing because it be enjoin and he limb enervate by hot and strong liquor liquor of the most pernicious kind can not support the fatigue necessary in the practice of he trade what be once wholesome exercise be now insupportable fatigue and he have not now time to habituate himself by degree to that application which he have intermit that labor which he have disuse or those art which he have forget in this state my lord he easily persuade himself that he condition be desperate that no legal method will relieve he and that therefore he have nothing to hope but from the effort of despair these thought be quickly confirm by he companion whom the same misconduct have reduce to the same distress and who have already try the pleasure of be support by the labor of other they do not fail to explain to he the possibility of sudden affluence and at worst to celebrate the satisfaction of short-lived merriment he therefore engage with they in they nocturnal expedition a association of wickedness be form and that man who before he taste this infatuating liquor contribute every day by honest labor to the happiness or convenience of life who support he family in decent plenty and be himself at ease become at once miserable and wicked be detest as a nuisance by the community and hunt by the officer of justice nor have mankind any thing now to wish or hope with regard to he but that by he speedy destruction the security of the road may be restore and the tranquillity of the night be set free from the alarm of robbery and murder these my lord be the consequence which necessarily ensue from the use of those pernicious those infatuate spirit which have justly alarmed every man whom pleasure or sloth have not wholly engrossed and who have ever look upon the various scene of life with that attention which they importance demand among these my lord the clergy have distinguish themselves by a zealous opposition to this grow evil and have warn they hearer with the warmest concern against the misery and wickedness which must always be the attendant or the follower of drunkenness one among they -lrb- footnote : bishop of sarum -rrb- whose merit have raise he to a seat in this August assembly and whose instruction be enforce by the sanctity of he life have in a very cogent and pathetical manner display the enormity of this detestable sin the universality of its prevalence and the malignity of its effect and in he discourse on the infirmary of this city have observe with too much justness that the lowest of the people be infect with this vice and that _ even necessity be become luxurious _ many other authority -lrb- footnote : he read the preamble to a former bill the opinion of the college of physician -rrb- might be produce and some other i have now in my hand but the recital of they would waste the day to no purpose : for surely it be not necessary to show by a long deduction of authority the guilt of drunkenness or to prove that it weaken the body or that it deprave the mind that it make mankind too feeble for labor too indolent for application too stupid for ingenuity and too daring for the peace of society this surely my lord be therefore a vice which ought with the utmost care to be discourage by those whose birth or station have confer upon they the province of watch over the publick happiness and which surely no prospect of present advantage no argument of political convenience will prevail upon this house to promote that the natural and evident tendency of this bill be the propagation of drunkenness can not be deny when it be consider that it will increase the temptation to it by make that liquor which be the favorite of the common people more common by multiply the place at which it be sell so that none can want a opportunity of yield to any sudden impulse of he appetite which will solicit he more powerfully and more incessantly as they be more frequently and more easily gratify in defense of a bill like this my lord it might be expect that at least many specious argument should be offer it may be justly hope that no man will rise up in opposition to all law of heaven and earth to the wisdom of all legislator and the experience of every human be without have form such a train of argument as will not easily be disconcert or have form at least such a chain of sophistry as can not be break but with difficulty and yet my lord when i consider what have be offer by all who have hitherto appear either in publick assembly or in private conversation as advocate for this bill i can scarcely believe that they perceive themselves any force in they own argument and be incline to conclude that they speak only to avoid the imputation of be able to say nothing in defense of they own scheme that they hope be not to convince by they reason but to overpower by they number that they be themselves influence not by reason but by necessity and that they only encourage luxury because money be to be raise for the execution of they scheme : and they imagine that the people will pay more cheerfully for liberty to indulge they appetite than for any other enjoyment the argument which have be offer my lord in vindication of this bill or at least which i have hitherto hear be only two and those two so unhappily associate that they destroy each other whatever shall be urge to enforce the second must in the same proportion invalidate the first and whoever shall assert that the first be true must admit that the second be false these position my lord the unlucky position which be lay down by the defender of this pernicious bill be that it will supply the necessity of the government with a very large standing revenue on the credit of which strengthen by the additional security of the sink fund a sum will be advance sufficient to support the expense of a foreign war and that at the same time it will lessen the consumption of the liquor from whence this duty be to arise by what art of political ratiocination these proposition be to be reconcile i be not able to discover it appear evident my lord that large revenue can only be raise by the sale of large quantity and that larger quantity will in reality be sell as the price be little or nothing raise and the vender be greatly increase if this will not be the effect my lord and if this effect be not expect why be this bill propose as sufficient to raise the immense sum which we present exigency require can duty be pay without consumption of the commodity on which they be lay and be there any other use of spirituous liquor than that of drink they surely my lord it be not expect that any argument should be admit in this house without examination and yet it might be justly imagine that this assertion could only be offer in full confidence of a implicit reception and this tenet be propose only to those who have resign they understanding to the dictate of the ministry for it be imply in this position that the plenty of a commodity diminish the demand for it and that the more freely it be sell the less it will be buy it imply that man will lay voluntary restraint upon themselves in proportion as they be indulge by they governor and that all prohibitory law tend to the promotion of the practice which they condemn it imply that a stop can only be put to fornication by increase the number of prostitute and that theft be only to be restrain by leave you door open i be for my part convince that drunkard as well as thief be make by opportunity and that no man will deny himself what he desire merely because it be allow he by the law of he country this my lord be so evident that i shall no longer dwell upon the assertion that the unbounded liberty of retailing spirit will make spirit less use in the nation but shall examine the second argument and consider how far it be possible or proper to raise supplies by a tax upon drunkenness that large sum will be raise by the bill to which the consent of you lordship be now require i can readily admit because the consumption of spirit will certainly be greater and the licens take for retail they so numerous that a much lower duty than be propose will amount yearly to a very large sum for if the felicity of drunkenness can be more cheaply obtain by buy spirit than ale when both be to be find at the same place it be easy to see which will be prefer this argument therefore be irrefragable and may be urge in favor of the bill without danger of confutation but my lord it be the business of governor not so much to drain the purse as to regulate the moral of the people not only to raise tax but to levy they in such a manner as may be least burdensome and to apply they to purpose which may be most useful not to raise money by corrupt the nation that it may be spend in enslave it it have be mention by a very celebrated writer as a rational practice in the exercise of government to tax such commodity as be abuse to the increase of vice that vice may be discourage by be make more expensive and therefore the community in time be set free from it : but the tax which be now propose my lord be of a different kind it be a tax lay upon vice indeed but it be to arise from the licens grant to wickedness and its consequence must be the increase of debauchery not the restraint it be a tax which will be readily pay because it will be little feel and because it will be little feel it be hope that multitude will subject themselves to it the act which be now to be repeal be indeed of a very different nature though perhaps not free from very just objection it have this advantage at least that so far as it be put in execution it obstruct drunkenness nor have the examination of the officer of excise discover any imperfection in the law for it have only fail because it be timorously or negligently execute why it be not vigorously and diligently enforce i have never yet be able to discover if the magistrate be threaten by the populace the necessity of such law be more plainly prove for what justify the severity of coercion but the prevalence of the crime and what may not be fear from crowd intoxicate with spirit whose insolence and fury be already such that they dare to threaten the government by which they be debar from the use of they this my lord be a reflection that ought not to be pass slightly over the nature of we constitution happy as it be must be acknowledge to produce this inconvenience that it incline the common people to turbulence and sedition the nature of spirituous liquor be such that they inflame these disposition already too much predominant and yet the turbulence of the people be make a reason for licensing drunkenness and allow without limitation the sale of those spirit by which that turbulence must be certainly increase it may be perhaps urge -lrb- for indeed i know not what else can be decently allege -rrb- that there be a necessity of raise money that no other method can be invent and that therefore this ought not to be oppose i know my lord that minister generally consider as the test of each man 's loyalty the readiness with which he concur with they in they scheme for raise money and that they think all opposition to these scheme which be calculate for the support of the government the effect of a criminal disaffection that they always think it a sufficient vindication of any law that it will bring in very large sum and that they think no measure pernicious nor law dangerous by which the revenue be not impaired if government be institute only to raise money these ministerial scheme of policy would be without exception nor could it be deny that the present minister show themselves by this expedient uncommon master of they profession but the end of government be only to promote virtue of which happiness be the consequence and therefore to support government by propagate vice be to support it by means which destroy the end for which it be originally establish and for which its continuance be to be desire if money therefore can not be raise but by this bill if the expense of the government can not be defray but by corrupt the moral of the people i shall without scruple declare that money ought not to be raise nor the design of the government support because the people can suffer nothing from the failure of publick measure or even from the dissolution of the government itself which will be equally to be dread or avoid with a universal depravity of moral and a general decay of corporeal vigor even the insolence of a foreign conqueror can inflict nothing more severe than the disease which debauchery produce nor can any thing be fear from the disorder of anarchy more dangerous or more calamitous than the madness of sedition or the misery which must ensue to each individual from universal wickedness such my lord be the expedient by which we be now about to raise the supplies for the present year and such be the new method of taxation which the sagacity of we minister have luckily discover a foreign war be to be support by the destruction of we people at home and the revenue of the government to be improve by the decay of we manufacture we be to owe henceforward we power to epidemical disease we wealth to the declension of we commerce and we security to riot and to tumult there be yet another consideration my lord which ought well to be regard before we suffer this bill to pass many law be merely experimental and have be make not because the legislature think they indisputably proper but because no better could at that time be strike out and because the argument in they favor appear stronger than those against they or because the question to which they related be so dark and intricate that nothing be to be determine with certainty and no other method could therefore be follow but that of make the first attempt at hazard and correct these error or supply these defect which might hereafter be discover by those light which time should afford though i be far from think my lord that the question relate to the effect of this law be either doubtful or obscure though i be certain that the means of reform the vice which its advocate pretend it be design to prevent be obvious and easy yet i should have hope that the projector of such a scheme would have allow at least the uncertainty of the salutary effect expect from it and would therefore have make some provision for the repeal of it when it should be find to fail but my lord we minister appear to have think it sufficient to endear they to they country and immortalize they name that they have invent a new method of raise money and seem to have very little regard to any part of the art of government they will at least in they own opinion have deserve applause if they leave the publick revenue greater by whatever diminution of the publick virtue they have therefore my lord wisely contrived a necessity of continue this law whatever may be its consequence and how fatal soever its abuse for they not only mortgage the duty upon spirit for the present supply but substitute they in the place of another security give to the bank by the pot act and therefore since it will not be easy to form another tax of equal produce we can have very little hope that this will be remit there will be indeed only one method of set the nation free from the calamity which this law will bring upon it and as i doubt not but that method will at last be follow it will certainly deserve the attention of you lordship as the third consideration to which in we debate on this bill particular regard ought to be pay that the license of drunkenness and the unlimited consumption of spirituous liquor will fill the whole kingdom with idleness disease riot and confusion can not be doubt nor can it be question but that in a very short time the senate will be crowd with petition from all the trading body in the kingdom for the regulation of the workman and servant for the extinction of turbulence and riot and for the removal of irresistible temptation to idleness and fraud these representation may be for a time neglect but must soon or late be hear the minister will be oblige to repeal this law for the same reason that induce they to propose it idleness and sickness will impair we manufacture and the diminution of we trade will lessen the revenue they will then my lord find that they scheme with whatever prospects of profit it may now flatter they be form with no extensive view and that it be only the expedient of political avarice which sacrifice a greater distant advantage to the immediate satisfaction of present gain they will find that they have corrupt the people without obtain any advantage by they crime and that they must have recourse to some new contrivance by which they own error may be retrieve in this distress my lord they can only do what indeed they now seem to design they can only repeal this act by charge the debt which it have enable they to contract upon the sink fund upon that sacred deposit which be for a time suppose unalienable and from which arise all the hope that be sometimes form by the nation of be deliver from that load of impost which it can not much longer support they can only give security for this new debt by disable we for ever from pay the former the bill now before we my lord will therefore be equally pernicious in its immediate and remoter consequence it will first corrupt the people and destroy we trade and afterwards intercept that fund which be appropriate to the most useful and desirable of all political purpose the gradual alleviation of the publick debt i hope my lord that a bill of this portentous kind a bill big with innumerable mischief and without one beneficial tendency will be reject by this house without the form of commitment that it will not be the subject of a debate amongst we whether we shall consent to poison the nation and that instead of inquire whether the measure which be now pursue by the ministry ought to be support at the expense of virtue tranquillity and trade we should examine whether they be not such as ought to be oppose for they own sake even without the consideration of the immense sum which they apparently demand i be indeed of opinion that the success of the present scheme will not be of any benefit to the nation and believe likewise that there be very little prospect of success i be at least convinced that no advantage can countervail the mischief of this detestable bill which therefore i shall steadily oppose though i have already dwell upon this subject perhaps too long yet as i speak only from a unprejudiced regard to the publick i hope if any new argument shall be attempt that i shall be allow the liberty of make a reply lord bathurst reply to the follow purport : -- my lord i doubt not but the noble lord have deliver on this occasion he real sentiment and that in he opinion the happiness of we country the regard which ought always to be pay to the promotion of virtue require that this bill should be reject i be far from suspect that such a appearance of zeal can conceal any private view or that such pathetick exclamation can proceed but from a mind really affect with honest anxiety this anxiety my lord i shall endeavor to dissipate before it have be communicate to other for i think it no less the duty of every man who approve the publick measure to vindicate they from misrepresentation than of he to whom they appear pernicious or dangerous to warn he fellow-subject of that danger i my lord be one of those who be convince that the bill now before we which have be censure as fundamentally wrong be in reality fundamentally right that the end which be propose by it be just and the means which be prescribe in it will accomplish the purpose for which they be contrived the end of this bill my lord be to diminish the consumption of distilled spirit to restrain the populace of these kingdom from a liquor which when use in excess have a malignity to the last degree dangerous which at once inebriate and poison impair the force of the understanding and destroy the vigor of the body and to attain this i think it absolutely right to lay a tax upon these liquor of the vice of drunkenness my lord no man have a stronger abhorrence than myself of the pernicious consequence of these liquor which be now chiefly use by the common people no man be more fully convinced and therefore none can more zealously wish that drunkenness may be suppress and distil spirit withhold from the people the disorder mention by the noble lord be undoubtedly the consequence of the present use of these liquor but these be not its worst effect the offender against the law may by the law be sometimes reclaim and at other time cutoff nor can these practice however injurious to particular person in any great degree impair the general happiness the worst effect therefore of the use of spirit be that idleness and extravagance which it have introduce among the common people by which we commerce must be obstruct and we present riches and plenty every day diminish this pernicious practice my lord be disseminate farther than could be reasonably believe by those whose interest have not incite or curiosity induce they to inquire into the practice of the different class of man it be well know that the farmer have be hitherto distinguish by the virtue of frugality temperance and industry that they labor hard and spend little and be therefore justly consider as a innocent and useful part of the community whose employment and parsimony preserve they in a great measure from the general infection of vice which spread its influence among the trader and man of estate but even this abstemious class of man my lord have of late relax they frugality and suffer themselves to be tempt by this infatuating liquor nor be any thing now more common than to find it in those house in which ale a few year ago be the highest pitch of luxury to which they aspire and to see those hour waste in intoxicating entertainment which be formerly dedicate wholly to the care of they farm and the improvement of they fortune thus my lord it appear that the corruption be become universal and therefore that some remedy ought to be attempt nor can i conceive any measure more consistent with justice or more likely to produce the end intend by they than those which be now offer to you consideration by which the liquor will be make dearer too dear to be lavishly drink by those who be in most danger of use it to excess and the number of those who retail it will be diminish by the necessity of take a license and of renew they every year at the same expense the inefficacy my lord of violent method and the impossibility of a total deprivation of any enjoyment which the people have by custom make familiar and dear to they sufficiently appear from the event of the law which be now to be repeal it be well know that by that law the use of spirituous liquor be prohibit to the common people that retailer be deter from vend they by the utmost encouragement that could be give to informer and that discovery be incite by every art that could be practice and offender punish with the utmost rigor yet what be the effect my lord of all this diligence and vigor a general panick suppress for a few week the practice of sell the prohibit liquor but in a very short time necessity force some who have nothing to lose to return to they former trade these be suffer sometimes to escape because nothing be to be gain by inform against they and other be encourage by they example to imitate they though with more secrecy and caution of those indeed many be punish but many more escape and such as be fine often find the profit greater than the loss the prospect of raise money by detect they practice incite many to turn information into a trade and the facility with which the crime be to be prove encourage some to gratify they malice by perjury and other they avarice so that the multitude of information become a publick grievance and the magistrate themselves complain that the law be not to be execute the perjury of informer be now so flagrant and common that the people think all information malicious or at least think themselves oppress by the law they look upon every man that promote its execution as they enemy and therefore now begin to declare war against informer many of whom they treat with great cruelty and some they murder in the street by they obstinacy they at last weary the magistrate and by they violence they intimidate those who might be incline to make discovery so that the law however just might be the intention with which it be enact or however seasonable the method prescribe by it have be now for some year totally disused nor have any one be punish for the violation of it because no man have dare to offer information even the vigilance of the magistrate have be oblige to connive at these offence nor have any man be find willing to engage in a task at once odious and endless or to punish offence which every day multiply and of which the whole body of the common people a body very formidable when unite be universally engage the practice therefore of vend and of drinking distil spirit have prevail for some time without opposition nor can any man enter a tavern or a alehouse in which they will be deny he or walk along the street without be incite to drink they at every corner they have be sell for several year with no less openness and security than any other commodity and whoever walk in this great city will find he way very frequently obstruct by those who be sell these pernicious liquor to the greedy populace or by those who have drink they till they be unable to move but the strongest proof of the inefficacy of the late law and consequently of the necessity of another which may not be so easily elude or so violently resist be give by the papers which lie upon the table from these it appear that the quantity of spirit distil have increase from year to year to the present time and therefore that drunkenness be become more prevalent and the reason for repress it more urgent than ever before let we therefore calmly consider my lord what can in this exigence be do that the people should be allow to poison themselves and they posterity without restraint be certainly not the intent of any good man and therefore we be now to consider how it may be prevent that the people be infect with the vice of drunkenness that they debauch themselves chiefly with spirituous liquor and that those liquor be in a high degree pernicious be confess both by those who oppose the bill and those who defend it but with this advantage on the part of those that defend it that they only propose a probable method of reform the abuse which they deplore i know that the warm resentment which some lord have on former occasion express against the disorder which distil liquor be suppose to produce may naturally incline they to wish that they be totally prohibit and that this _ liquid fire _ as it have be term be to be extinguish for ever whether such wish be not more ardent than rational whether they zeal against the abuse of thing indifferent in themselves have not as have often happen in other case hurry they into a indiscreet censure of the lawful use i shall not now inquire because it be superfluous to dispute about the propriety of measure of which the possibility may be justly question this last act my lord be of this kind the duty establish by it be so high that they wholly debar the lower class of the people from the liquor on which they be lay and therefore it be find by a very short experience that it be impossible to preserve it from violation that there would be no end of punish those who offend against it and that severity produce rather compassion than terror those who have suffer the penalty be consider as person under unjust persecution whom every one be oblige by the tie of humanity to encourage reward and protect and those who inform against they or encouraged information be detest as the oppressor of the people the law have indeed this effect that it debar at least for a short time all those from retailing spirit who live in reputation and therefore encourage other to vend they in private place where they be more likely to be drink to excess have therefore make trial of violent and severe method and have a opportunity of obtain a full conviction of they inefficacy it be surely proper to profit by we experience by that experience which show we that the use of distilled liquor under its present discouragement have every year increase and therefore prove at once the unprofitableness of the law now in force and the necessity of some other by which the same purpose may be more certainly promote the reformation of a vice so prevalent must be slow and gradual for it be not to be hope that the whole bulk of the people will at once be divest of they habit and therefore it will be rational to endeavor not wholly to debar they from any thing in which however absurdly they place they happiness but to make the attainment of it more and more difficult that they may insensibly remit they ardor and cease from they pursuit this my lord be propose in the present bill which by the duty which be to be lay upon distil spirit will raise the price a third part and as it be reasonable to expect hinder a third part of the consumption for it be observe that those who drink they set no limit to they excess but indulge they appetite to the utmost of they power if he therefore who use to spend threepence a-day in spirit can now have no more than could formerly be buy for twopence he must necessarily content himself with only two third of the quantity which he have hitherto drink and therefore must by force though perhaps not by inclination be less intemperate it be not to be doubt my lord but that spirit will by this additional duty be make one third part dearer for it have be hitherto observe that retailer levy upon the buyer twice the duty that be pay to the government as be every day apparent in other commodity so that the yearly quantity of spirit which be usually distil will cost five hundred thousand pound more than before a tax which i suppose those who be charge with this kind of debauchery will not be suppose able to pay and which yet must be pay by they unless they will be content with a less quantity that spirit will now be sell in every publick-house of whatever denomination have be i believe justly assert but the assertion have not be properly urge as a argument against the bill one of the circumstance which have contribute to the enormous abuse of these liquor have be the practice of retail they in obscure place by person without character and without money who therefore neither fear penalty nor infamy and offend against law and decency with equal security but when the cheapness of licens shall make it convenient for every man that please to retail spirit in a publick manner they will be generally drink in house visit by publick officer observe by the neighbouring inhabitant and frequent by person of moral and civility who will always endeavor to restrain all enormous excess and oblige the master of the house to pay some regard to the law those whose appetite be too importunate to be restrain may now gratify they without be tempt to enter into house of infamy or mingle with beggar or thief or ` profligate and therefore though the use of spirit should continue the same its consequence will be less fatal since they may be have without the necessity of associate with wickedness but my lord it be not improbable that by this bill the number of retailer at least in this city where they be most pernicious may be lessen it be well know that the reason for which they be sell in cellar and in the street be the danger of retail they in other place and that if they be generally sell by those who could procure the best of each sort these petty trader would be immediately undo for it be reasonable to imagine my lord that they buy the cheapest liquor and sell they at the dearest rate when therefore reputable house shall be open for the sale of these liquor decency will restrain some and prudence will hinder other from endanger they health by purchase those liquor which be offer in the street and from hazard they moral or perhaps they life by drink to excess in obscure place it be likewise to be remembered my lord that many of those who now poison they countryman with petty shop of debauchery be not able to purchase a license even at the cheap rate at which it be now propose and that therefore they will be restrain from they trade by a legal inability for it be not my lord to be imagine that they will be defend with equal zeal by the populace when the liquor may be have without they assistance nor will information be equally infamous when it be not the act only of profligate who pursue the practice of it as a trade but of the proper officer of every place incite by the lawful vender of the same commodity or of the vender themselves who will now be numerous enough to protect each other and whom they common interest will incite against clandestine dealer the price of licens therefore appear to I very happily adjust : have it be greater there would not have be a sufficient number of lawful retailer to put a stop to clandestine seller and if it be lower every petty dealer in this commodity might by pretend to keep a alehouse continue the practice of afford a harbor to thief and of propagate debauchery thus my lord it appear to I that the bill will lessen the consumption of these destructive spirit certainly in a great degree by raise the price and probably by transfer the trade of sell they into more reputable hand what more can be do by human care or industry i do not conceive to prohibit the use of they be impossible to raise the price of they to the same height with that of foreign spirit be indeed practicable but surely at this time no eligible method for so general be this kind of debauchery that no degree of expense would entirely suppress it and as foreign spirit if they be to be sell at the same price would always be prefer to we own we should only send into other nation that money which now circulate among ourselves and impoverish the people without reform they the regulation provide by the bill before we be therefore in my opinion the most likely method for recover the ancient industry and sobriety of the common people and my lord i shall approve it till experience have show it to be defective i shall approve it not with a view of obtain or secure the favor of any of those who may be think to interest themselves in its success but because i find some new law for this purpose indispensably necessary and believe that no better can be contrived we be now my lord to contend with the passion of all the common people we be endeavor to reform a vice almost universal a vice which however destructive be now no longer reproachful we have try the force of violent method and find they unsuccessful we be now therefore to treat the vulgar as child with a kind of artful indulgence and to take from they secretly and by degree what can not be wholly deny they without exasperate they almost to rebellion this be the first attempt and by this if one third of the consumption be diminish we may next year double the duty and by a new augmentation of the price take away another third and what will then be drink will perhaps by the strictest moralist be allow to be rather beneficial than hurtful by this gradual procedure we shall give those who have accustom themselves to this liquor time to reclaim they appetite and those that live by distil opportunity of engage in some other employment we shall remove the distemper of the publick without any painful remedy and shall reform the people insensibly without exasperate or persecute they the bishop of oxford speak to the follow purport : -- my lord as i be not yet convince of the expedience of the bill now before we nor can discover any reason for believe that the advantage will countervail the mischief which it will produce i think it my duty to declare that i shall oppose it as destructive to virtue and contrary to the inviolable rule of religion it appear to I my lord that the liberty of sell liquor which be allow to be equally injurious to health and virtue will by this law become general and boundless and i can discover no reason for doubt that the purchaser will be multiply by increase the number of the vender and the increase of the sale of distilled spirit and the propagation of all kind of wickedness be the same i must conclude that bill to be destructive to the publick by which the sale of spirit will be increase it have be urge that other more vigorous method have be try and that they be now to be lay aside because experience have show they to be ineffectual because the people unanimously assert the privilege of debauchery oppose the execution of justice and pursue those with the utmost malice that offer information i should think my lord that government approach to its dissolution that be reduce to submit its decree to they judgment who be chiefly accuse of the abuse of these liquor for surely when the lowest the most corrupt part of the people have obtain such a degree of influence as to dictate to the legislature those law by which they expect to be govern all subordination be at a end this my lord i hope i shall never see the state of my own country : i hope i shall never see the government without authority to enforce obedience to the law nor have i indeed see any such weakness on this occasion : the opposition that be make and the discontent that be excite be no greater than might be reasonably expect when the vice which be to be reform be so enormously predominant nor be the effect of the law less than any one who foresee such opposition might reasonably have conceive in this city alone there be before the commencement of that law fifteen hundred large shop in which no other trade be carry on than that of retailing these pernicious liquor in which no temptation to debauchery be forget and what can not be mention without horror back room and secret place be contrived for receptacle of those who have drink till they have lose they reason and they limb there they be crowd together till they recover strength sufficient to go away or drink more these pestilential shop these storehouse of mischief will upon the encouragement which this law will give they be set open again new invitation will be hang out to catch the eye of passenger who will again be entice with promise of be make drunk for a penny and that universal debauchery and astonishing licentiousness which give occasion to the former act will return upon we it be to little purpose my lord that the licens for sell distil spirit be to be grant only to those who profess to keep house for the sale of other liquor since nothing will be more easy than to elude this part of the law whoever be incline to open a shop for the retail of spirit may take a license for sell ale and the sale of one barrel of more innocent liquor in a year will entitle to dispense poison with impunity and to contribute without control to the corruption of mankind it be confess that since this law be make these liquor have be sell only at corner of the street in petty shop and in private cellar and therefore it must be allow that if the consumption have increase it have at least increase less than if the free and open sale have be permit for the necessity of secrecy be always a restraint and every restraint must in some degree obstruct any practice since those that follow it under restraint would pursue it more vigorously if that restraint be take away and those that be now totally hinder would at least be more strongly tempt by greater liberty and where the temptation be more powerful more will probably be overcome by it but my lord however the law may in this crowded city have be elude and defy however drunkenness may here have be protect by the insolence which it produce and crime have be sheltered by the multitude of offender i be inform that in part less populous the efficacy of the late act never be deny and that it have in many part rescue the people from the misery of debauchery and only fail in other by the negligence of those to whom the execution of it be commit negligently and faintly as it be execute it do in effect hinder many from pursue this destructive kind of trade and even in the metropolis itself almost a total stop be for a time put to the use of spirit and have the magistrate perform they duty with steadiness and resolution it be probable that no plea would have arise in favor of this bill from the inefficacy of the last i can not indeed deny that the multitude of false informer furnish the magistrate with a very specious pretence for relax they vigilance but it be only my lord a specious pretence not a warrantable reason for the same diligence should have be use to punish false informer as clandestine retailer the trader in poison and in perjury should have be both pursue with incessant vigor the sword of justice should have be draw against they nor should it have be lay aside till either species of wickedness have be exterminate in the execution of this as of other penal law my lord it will be always possible for the judge to be mislead by false testimony and therefore the argument which false information furnish may be use against every other law where information be encouraged yet my lord it have be long the practice of this nation to incite criminal to detect each other and when any enormous crime be commit to proclaim at once pardon and reward to he that shall discover he accomplice this my lord be a apparent temptation to perjury and yet no inconvenieucy have arise from it that can reasonably induce we to lay it aside perjury may in the execution of this law be detect by the same means as on other occasion and whenever it be detect ought to be rigorously punish and i doubt not but in a short time the _ difficulty _ and _ inconveniency _ which be assert in the preamble of this bill to have _ attend the put the late act in execution _ would speedily have vanish the number of delinquent would have be every day lessen and the virtue and industry of the nation would have be restore it be not indeed assert that the execution of the late act be impossible but that it be attend with difficulty and when my lord be any design of great importance effect without difficulty it be difficult without doubt to restrain a nation from vice and to reform a nation already corrupt be still more difficult but as both however difficult be necessary it be the duty of government to endeavor they till it shall appear that no endeavor can succeed for my part my lord i be not easily persuade to believe that remissness will succeed where assiduity have fail and therefore if it be true as be suppose in the preamble that the former act be ineffectual by any defect in itself i can not conceive that this will operate with greater force i can not imagine that appetite will be weaken by lessen the danger of gratify they or that man who will break down the fence of the law to possess themselves of what long habit have in they opinion make necessary to they will neglect it merely because it be lay in they way with regard to this act my lord it be to be inquire whether it be likely to be execute with more diligence than the former and whether the same obstacle may not equally obstruct the execution of both the great difficulty of the former method a method certainly in itself reasonable and efficacious arise from the necessity of receive information from the meanest and most profligate of the people who be often tempt to lay hold of the opportunity which that law put into they hand of relieve they want or gratify they resentment and very frequently intimidate the innocent by threat of accusation which be not easily to be confute they be therefore equally dangerous to those that obey the act and to those that disregard it for they sometimes put they threat in execution and raise prosecution against those who have commit no other crime than that of refuse to bribe they to silence a abuse so notorious my lord produce a general detestation of all informer or at least concur with other cause to produce it and that detestation become so prevalent in the mind of the populace that at last it become to the highest degree dangerous to attempt the conviction of those who in the most open and contemptuous manner every day violate the law of they country and in time the retailer trust to the protection of the people lay aside all caution at least in this great city and prosecute they former practice with the utmost security this my lord be the chief difficulty and inconvenience hitherto discover in the law which be now to be repeal thus be its execution obstruct and the provision enact by it make ineffectual this defect therefore ought to be chiefly regard in any new regulation but what security my lord be provide against the same evil in the bill before we or why should we imagine that this law will be execute with less opposition than the last the informer will undoubtedly be of the same class as before they be still to be incite by a reward and therefore it may be reasonably fear that they will act upon the same motive and be persecute with the same fury to obviate this inconvenience appear to I very easy by convert the duty upon licens to a large duty upon the liquor to be pay by the distiller the payment of which will be carefully exact by proper officer who though they employment be not very reputable pursue it at least without any personal danger and who inform they superior of any attempt to defraud the revenue without be censure as officious or revengeful and therefore be without any terror to hinder they from they duty it have be assert indeed that the price of a license be now so small that none who be incline to deal in spirit will neglect to secure themselves from punishment and vexation by procure it and that no man will subject himself to the malice of a profligate by carry on a illicit trade which the annual expense of twenty shilling will make legal if this argument be just my lord and to the greatest part of this assembly i believe it will appear very plausible how will this law lessen the consumption of distilled liquor it be confess that it will hinder nobody from sell they and it have be find by experience that nothing can restrain the people from buy they but such law as hinder they from be sell this plea therefore by remove a objection to a particular clause will strengthen the great argument against the tenor of the bill that instead of lessen it will increase the consumption of those liquor which be allow to be destructive to the people to enfeeble the body and to vitiate the mind and consequently to impair the strength and commerce of the nation and to destroy the happiness and security of life that the cheapness of licens will induce multitude to buy they may be expect but it can not be hope that every one will cease to sell spirit without a license for they be as i be inform offer every hour in the street by those to whom twenty shilling make a very large sum and who therefore will not or can not purchase a license these ought undoubtedly to be detect and punish but there be no provision make for discover they but what have be find already to be ineffectual it appear therefore my lord that this bill will increase the number of lawful retailer without diminish that of private dealer so that the opportunity of debauchery will be multiply in proportion to the number who shall take licens there be another fallacy by which the duty upon distilled liquor have be hitherto avoid and which will still make this bill equally useless as the former for the end which be to be promote by it it be expect my lord by those who purchase spirit from the distiller that they should be of a certain degree of strength which they call proof : if they be of a lower degree they price be diminish and if of a higher it be raise proportionally because if the spirit exceed the degree of strength require they may be mix with other liquor of little value and still be sell to the drinker at the common price it be therefore the practice of the distiller to give they spirit thrice the degree of strength require by which contrivance though they pay only the duty of one pint they sell they liquor at the price of three because it may be increase to thrice the quantity distil and yet retain sufficient strength to promote the purpose of wickedness this practice my lord should be likewise obviate for while one gallon after have pay the present low duty which be lay upon it may be multiply to three the additional price will in the small quantity which be usually demand become imperceptible but to show yet farther the inefficacy of this bill let we suppose what will not be find by experience that a halfpenny be add to the price of every pint it will yet be very practicable to revel in drunkenness for a penny since a very small quantity of these hateful liquor be sufficient to intoxicate those who have not be habituate to the use of they who though they reformation be undoubtedly to be desire do not so much demand the care of the legislature as those who be yet untainted with this pernicious practice and who may perhaps by the frequency of temptation and the prevalence of example be induce in time to taste these execrable liquor and perish in they first essay of debauchery for such be the quality of these spirit that they be sometimes fatal to those who indiscreetly venture upon they without caution and whose stomach have not be prepare for large draught by proper gradation of intemperance a single spoonful have be find sufficient to hurry two child to the grave it be therefore my opinion that those whose station and employment make it they duty to superintend the conduct of they fellow-subject ought to contrive some other law on this occasion ought to endeavor to rescue the common people from the infatuation which be become general amongst they and to withhold from they the means of wickedness that instead of comply with they prejudice and flattering they appetite they should exert that authority with which they be intrust in a steady and resolute opposition to predominant vice and without have recourse to gentle art and temporize expedient snatch out of they hand at once those instrument which be only of use for criminal purpose and take from they mouth that draught with which however delicious it may seem they poison at once themselves and they posterity the only argument which can be offer in defense of this bill be the necessity of support the expense of the war and the difficulty of raise money by any other method the necessity of the war my lord i be not about to call in question nor be it very consistent with my character to examine the method in which it have be carry on but this i can boldly assert that however just however necessary however prudently prosecute and however successfully conclude it can produce no advantage equivalent to the national sobriety and industry and be certain that no publick advantage ought to be purchase at the expense of publick virtue but my lord i hope we be not yet reduce to the unhappy choice either of corrupt we people or submit to we enemy nor do i doubt but that supplies may be obtain by method less pernicious to the publick and that fund sufficient for the present occasion may be establish without a legal establishment of drunkenness i hope my lord we shall not suffer we endeavor to be baffle by the obstinacy of drunkard and that we shall not desist from endeavor the recovery of the nation from this hateful vice because we first attempt have fail since it fail only by the negligence or the cowardice of those whose duty require they to promote the execution of a just law against the bill now before we i have think it my duty to declare as it appear to I opposite to every principle of virtue and every just purpose of government and therefore though i have engross so much of you time in speak on a subject with which it can not reasonably be expect that i should be well acquaint i hope i shall easily be pardon by you lordship since i have no private view either of interest or resentment to promote and have speak only what my conscience dictate and my duty require lord talbot then rise up and speak to the follow purport : -- my lord i be ashamed that there should be any necessity of oppose in this assembly a bill like that which be now before we a bill crowd with absurdity which no strength of eloquence can exaggerate nor any force of reason make more evident this bill my lord be however the first proof that we new minister have give of they capacity for the task which they have undertake this be a specimen of they sagacity and be design by they as a instance of the gentle method by which the expense of the government be hereafter to be levy upon the people the nation shall no longer see its manufacture subject to impost nor the fruit of industry take from the laborious artificer but drunkenness shall hereafter supply what have hitherto be pay by diligence and traffick the restraint of vice shall be take away the barrier of virtue and religion broken and a universal licentiousness shall overspread the land that the scheme of the ministry may be execute what be the project my lord that be to be pursue by such means it be not my present purpose to inquire : it be not necessary to add any aggravation to the present charge or to examine what have be the former conduct or what will be the future action of man who lie open by they present proposal to the most atrocious accusation who be publickly endeavor the propagation of the most pernicious of all vice who be lay poison in the way of they countryman poison by which not only the body but the mind be contaminate who be attempt to establish by a law a practice productive of all the misery to which human nature be incident a practice which will at once disperse disease and sedition and promote beggary and rebellion this my lord be the expedient by which the acuteness of we ministry propose to raise the supplies of the present year and by this they hope to convince the nation that they be qualify for the high trust to which they be advanced and that they owe they exaltation only to the superiority of they ability the extent of they knowledge and the maturity of they experience : by this masterstroke of policy they hope to lay for they authority a firm and durable foundation and to possess themselves by this happy contrivance at once of the confidence of the crown and the affection of the people but my lord i be so little convinced of they ability that amidst all the exultation which this new scheme produce i will venture to predict the decline of they influence and to fix the period of they greatness for i be persuade that notwithstanding the readiness with which they have hitherto sacrifice the interest of they country notwithstanding the desperate precipitation with which they have blindly engage in the most dangerous measure they will not be able to continue a year in they present station the bill now under we consideration my lord will undoubtedly make all those they enemy whom it do not corrupt for what can be expect from it but universal disorder and boundless wickedness wickedness make insolent by the protection of the law and disorder promote by all those whose wealth be increase by the increase of the revenue of the government have it be urge my lord in defense of this bill that it be necessary to raise money and that money could only be raise by increase the consumption of distilled spirit it would have be apparent that it be well calculate to promote the purpose intend but surely to assert that it will obstruct the use of these liquor be to discover a degree either of ignorance of effrontery or of folly by which few statesman have be hitherto distinguish if we receive without examination the estimate which have be lay down and allow the duty to rise as high as those by whom it be project have venture to assert the price of these liquor can be raise but a halfpenny a pint and there be few even among the lowest of those who indulge themselves in this fatal luxury whom the want of a single halfpenny can often debar from it and though these accurate calculator should insist that man may sometimes be compel to sobriety by this addition to the expense of be drunk yet how far will this restraint be find from be equivalent to the new temptation which will be throw into the way of thousand yet uncorrupted by the multitude of new shop that will be open for the distribution of poison ` and the security which debauchery will obtain from the countenance of the legislature what will be the consequence of any encouragement give to a vice already almost irresistibly prevalent i can not determine but surely nothing be too dismal to be expect from universal drunkenness from a general depravity of all the most useful part of mankind from a epidemical fury of debauchery and a unbounded exemption from restraint how little any encouragement be want to promote the consumption of those execrable liquor how much it concern every man who have be inform of they quality and who have see they consequence to oppose the use of they with he utmost influence appear from the enormous quantity which the still of this nation annually produce the number of gallon which appear from the account on the table to have be consume last year be seven million ' a quantity sufficient to-destroy the health interrupt the labor and deprave the moral of a very great part of the nation a quantity which if it be suffer to continue undiminished will even without any legal encouragement of its use in a short time destroy the happiness of the publick and by impair the strength and lessen the number of manufacturer and labourer introduce poverty and famine instead therefore of promote a practice so evidently detrimental to society let we oppose it with the most vigorous effort let we begin we opposition by reject this bill and then consider whether the execution of the former law shall be -- enforce or whether another more efficacious can be form lord cholmondeley then speak to the following effect : -- my lord though it be undoubtedly the right of every person in this assembly to utter he sentiment with freedom yet surely decency ought to restrain we from virulent and justice from undeserved reproach we ought not to censure any conduct with more severity than it deserve nor condemn any man for practice of which he be innocent this rule which will not i suppose be controvert have not in my opinion be very carefully observe in this debate for surely nothing be more unjust than to assert or insinuate that the government have look idly upon the advance of debauchery or have suffer drunkenness to prevail without opposition of the care with which this licentiousness have be oppose no other proof can be require than the law which have in the present reign be make against it soon after the succession of he majesty the use of compound spirit be prohibit but this law be elude by substitute liquor so draw as not to be include in the statute it be soon after repeal and the people be for a time indeed suffer to drink distilled liquor without restraint because a proper method of restrain they be not easily to be find how-difficult it be to contrive means by which this vice might safely be prevent appear more plainly soon afterwards when the outrageous licentiousness of the populace make it necessary to contrive some new law by which the use of that liquor might be prohibit to which so much insolence idleness and dissoluteness be imputed the law which it be now propose to repeal be then zealously promote by those who be then most distinguish for they virtue and they prudence every man who have any regard for the happiness of the publick be alarm at the inundation of licentiousness that overflow this city and begin to spread itself to the remoter part of the kingdom and it be determine that nothing but a total prohibition of distilled liquor could preserve the peace and restore the virtue of the nation a law be therefore make which prohibit the retail of distilled spirit and it be expect that the people would immediately return to the use of more innocent and healthful liquor and that the new art of sudden intoxication would be wholly suppress but with how little knowledge of the disposition of the nation this hope be form the event quickly discover for no sooner be the darling liquor withhold than a general murmur be raise over all part of this great city and all the lower order of the people testify they discontent in the most open manner multitude be immediately tempt by the prospect of uncommon gain to retail the prohibit liquor of these many be detect and many punish and the trade of information be so lucrative and so closely follow that there be no doubt but the law would produce the effect expect from it and that the most obstinate retailer would by repeat prosecution be discourage from the practice but no sooner do the people find they favorite gratification in real danger than they unanimously engage in its defense they discover that without informer the new law be without operation and the informer be therefore persecute by they without mercy and without remission till at last no man would venture to provoke the resentment of the populace for the reward to which information entitle he thus my lord one law have be elude by artifice and another defeat by violence the practice of drinking spirit however pernicious still continue to prevail the magistrate could not punish a crime of which they be not inform and they could obtain no information of a practice vindicate by the populace it be not indeed to be allow that the custom of drinking distilled liquor however prevalent have yet arise to the height at which the noble lord who speak last seem to imagine it arrive for though it be undoubtedly true that seven million of gallon be annually distil it be not to be imagine that the whole quantity be waste in debauchery some be exhaust by the necessity and some by the conveniency of life a great part be export to other country and the distillery promote many other purpose than those of riot and licentiousness that too much however be use by the common people and that intemperance have for some time prevail in a degree unknown to any former age can not be deny and therefore some means of reclaim they ought to be try what then my lord be to be do the first law be elude the second be defy : the first be execute but produce no restraint the second produce a restraint so violent that it can not be execute that the present law be ineffectual can not be doubt by those who assert that the quantity of spirit distil have every year increase and there seem to remain therefore no other choice than that of suffer this increase to proceed or to endeavor to prevent it by new regulation the present law ought to be repeal because it be useless but surely some other ought to supply its place which may be more easily enforce and less violently oppose the bill now before we my lord will in my opinion answer all the purpose of the last without noise and without disturbance by lessen the price of licens it will put a stop to clandestine retail and by raise that of the liquor it will hinder the common people from drink they in they usual excess those who have hitherto lose they reason and limb twice a-day by they drunkenness will not be able under the intended regulation to commit the same crime twice in a week and as the temptation of cheapness will be take away it may be hope that the next generation will not fall into the same vice since therefore my lord the argument in favor of this bill be at least plausible and specious since the design appear to be worthy of this assembly and the method propose such as may be hope to produce the effect which the projector of the bill desire and since the opinion of this house be at least divide and the other have pass it almost without opposition we ought at least in my opinion not to reject it with precipitation but to refer it to a committee that it may be fully consider and those objection which can not be answer remove by proper alteration lord carteret speak to the follow purport : -- my lord the bill now under we consideration appear to I to deserve a much more close regard than seem to have be pay to it in the other house through which it be hurry with the utmost precipitation and where it be pass almost without the formality of a debate nor can i think that earnestness with which some lord seem incline to press it forward here consistent with the importance of the consequence which may be with great reason expect from it it have be urge that where so great a number have form expectation of a national benefit from any bill so much deference at least be due to they judgment as that the bill should be consider in a committee this my lord i admit to be in other case a just and reasonable demand and will readily allow that the proposal not only of a considerable number but even of any single lord ought to be fully examine and regularly debate accord to the usual form of this assembly but in the present case my lord and in all case like the present this demand be improper because it be useless and it be useless because we can do now all that we can do hereafter in a committee for the bill before we be a money bill which accord to the present opinion of the common we have no right to amend and which therefore we have no need of consider in a committee since the event of all we deliberation must be that we be either to reject or pass it in its present state for i suppose no lord will think this a proper time to enter into a controversy with the common for the revival of those privilege to which i believe we have a right and such a controversy the least attempt to amend a money bill will certainly produce to desire therefore my lord that this bill may be consider in a committee be only to desire that it may gain one step without opposition that it may proceed through the form of the house by stealth and that the consideration of it maybe delay till the exigency of the government shall be so great as not to allow time for raise the supplies by any other method by this artifice gross as it be the patron of this wonderful bill hope to obstruct a plain and open detection of its tendency they hope my lord that the bill shall operate in the same manner with the liquor which it be intend to bring into more general use and that as those that drink spirit be drunk before they be well aware that they be drink the effect of this law shall be perceive before we know that we have make it they intent be to give we a dram of policy which be to be swallow before it be taste and which when once it be swallow will turn we head but my lord i hope we shall be so cautious as to examine the draught which these state empiric have think proper to offer we and i be confident that a very little examination will convince we of the pernicious quality of they new preparation and show that it can have no other effect than that of poisoning the publick the law before we my lord seem to be the effect of that practice of which it be intend likewise to be the cause and to be dictate by the liquor of which it so effectually promote the use for surely it never before be conceive by any man intrust with the administration of publick affair to raise tax by the destruction of the people nothing my lord but the destruction of all the most laborious and useful part of the nation can be expect from the license which be now propose to be give not only to drunkenness but to drunkenness of the most detestable and dangerous kind to the abuse not only of intoxicate but of poisonous liquor nothing my lord be more absurd than to assert that the use of spirit will be hinder by the bill now before we or indeed that it will not be in a very great degree promote by it for what produce all kind of wickedness but the prospect of impunity on one part or the solicitation of opportunity on the other either of these have too frequently be sufficient to overpower the sense of morality and even of religion and what be not to be fear from they when they shall unite they force and operate together when temptation shall be increase and terror take away it be allow by those who have hitherto dispute on either side of this question that the people appear obstinately enamour of this new liquor it be allow on both part that this liquor corrupt the mind enervate the body and destroy vigor and virtue at the same time that it make those who drink it too idle and too feeble for work and while it impoverish they by the present expense disable they from retrieve its ill consequence by subsequent industry it might be imagine my lord that those who have thus far agree would not easily find any occasion of dispute nor would any man unacquainted with the motive by which senatorial debate be too often influence suspect that after the pernicious quality of this liquor and the general inclination among the people to the immoderate use of it have be generally admit it could be afterwards inquire whether it ought to be make more common whether this universal thirst for poison ought to be encourage by the legislature and whether a new statute ought to be make to secure drunkard in the gratification of they appetite to pretend my lord that the design of this bill be to prevent or diminish the use of spirit be to trample upon common sense and to violate the rule of decency as well as of reason for when do any man hear that a commodity be prohibit by license its sale or that to offer and refuse be the same action it be indeed plead that it will be make dearer by the tax which be propose and that the increase of the price will diminish the number of the purchaser but it be at the same time expect that this tax shall supply the expense of a war on the continent : it be assert therefore that the consumption of spirit will be hinder and yet that it will be such as may be expect to furnish from a very small tax a revenue sufficient for the support of army for the reestablishment of the austrian family and the repression of the attempt of france surely my lord these expectation be not very consistent nor can it be imagine that they be both form in the same head though they may be express by the same mouth it be however some recommendation of a statesman when of he assertion one can be find reasonable or true and this praise can not be deny to we present minister for though it be undoubtedly false that this tax will lessen the consumption of spirit it be certainly true that it will produce a very large revenue a revenue that will not fail but with the people from whose debauchery it arise we minister will therefore have the same honor with they predecessor of have give rise to a new fund not indeed for the payment of we debt but for much more valuable purpose for the exaltation of we heart under oppression for the elevation of we spirit amidst miscarriage and disappointment and for the cheerful support of those debt which we have lose hope of pay they be resolve my lord that the nation which nothing can make wise shall while they be at its head at least be merry and since publick happiness be the end of government they seem to imagine that they shall deserve applause by a expedient which will enable every man to lay he care asleep to drown sorrow and lose in the delight of drunkenness both the publick misery and he own surely my lord man of this unbounded benevolence and this exalted genius deserve such honor as be never pay before they deserve to bestride a butt upon every signpost in the metropolis or to have they countenance exhibit as token where this liquor be to be sell by the license which they have procure they must be at least remembered to future age as the happy politician who after all expedient for raise tax have be employ discover a new method of drain the last relick of the publick wealth and add a new revenue to the government nor will those who shall hereafter enumerate the several fund now establish among we forget among the benefactor to they country the illustrious author of the _ drinking fund _ may i be allow my lord to congratulate my countryman and fellow-subject upon the happy time which be now approach in which no man will be disqualify for the privilege of be drunk when all discontent and disloyalty shall be forget and the people though now consider by the ministry as they enemy shall acknowledge the lenity of that government under which all restraint be take away but to a bill for such desirable purpose it would be proper my lord to prefix a preamble in which the kindness of we intention should be more fully explain that the nation may not mistake we indulgence for cruelty nor consider they benefactor as they persecutor if therefore this bill be consider and amend -lrb- for why else should it be consider -rrb- in a committee i shall humbly propose that it shall be introduce in this manner : whereas the design of the present ministry whatever they be can not be execute without a great number of mercenary which mercenary can not be hire without money and whereas the present disposition of this nation to drunkenness incline we to believe that they will pay more cheerfully for the undisturbed enjoyment of distilled liquor than for any other concession that can be make by the government be it enact by the king 's most excellent majesty that no man shall hereafter be deny the right of be drunk on the following condition this my lord to trifle no longer be the proper preamble to this bill which contain only the condition on which the people of this kingdom be to be allow henceforward to riot in debauchery in debauchery license by law and countenance by the magistrate for there be no doubt but those on whom the inventor of this tax shall confer authority will be direct to assist they master in they design to encourage the consumption of that liquor from which such large revenue be expect and to multiply without end those licens which be to pay a yearly tribute to the crown by this unbounded license my lord that price will be lessen from the increase of which the expectation of the efficacy of this law be pretend for the number of retailer will lessen the value as in all other case and lessen it more than this tax will increase it besides it be to be consider that at present the retailer expect to be pay for the danger which he incur by a unlawful trade and will not trust he reputation or he purse to the mercy of he customer without a profit proportion to the hazard but when once the restraint shall be take away he will sell for common gain and it can hardly be imagine that at present he subject himself to information and penalty for less than sixpence a gallon the specious pretence on which this bill be found and indeed the only pretence that deserve to be term specious be the propriety of taxing vice but this maxim of government have on this occasion be either mistaken or perverted vice my lord be not properly to be tax but suppress and heavy tax be sometimes the only means by which that suppression can be attain luxury my lord or the excess of that which be pernicious only by its excess may very properly be tax that such excess though not strictly unlawful may be make more difficult but the use of those thing which be simply hurtful hurtful in they own nature and in every degree be to be prohibit none my lord ever hear in any nation of a tax upon theft or adultery because a tax imply a license grant for the use of that which be tax to all who shall be willing to pay it drunkenness my lord be universally and in all circumstance a evil and therefore ought not to be tax but punish and the means of it not to be make easy by a slight impost which none can feel but to be remove out of the reach of the people and secure by the heaviest tax levy with the utmost rigor i hope those to whose care the religion of the nation be particularly consign will unanimously join with I in maintain the necessity not of tax vice but suppress it and unite for the rejection of a bill by which the future as well as present happiness of thousand must be destroy lord lonsdale speak as follow : -- my lord the bill now before we have from its first appearance in the other house seem to I of such importance as to deserve the greatest attention and to demand the most diligent inquiry and i have therefore consider it with uncommon care and pursue all those inquiry from which i could expect any assistance for discover its tendency and its consequence with the nicest and most anxious vigilance that my attention and diligence may not wholly terminate in the gratification of idle and useless curiosity it be proper to inform you lordship of they result by which i hope to convince you as i be myself convince that this bill can not become a law without endanger the life of thousand without disperse disease over the nation or without multiply crime beyond the possibility of restraint or punishment that it will fill the land with confusion for a time by infatuate the people and afterwards lay it desolate by destroy they all my inquiry my lord have have one constant and uniform effect on what side soever i have turn my speculation i have find new argument against this bill and have discover new mischief comprise in it mischief which however some may endeavor to overlook they and other to despise they will be find in a short time too general to be conceal and too formidable to be neglect the first consideration in which the necessity of deliberate on this bill engage I related to the quality of the liquor which be mention in it with regard to this question my lord there be no possibility of long suspense for the pernicious effect of spirit be confess equally by all those who countenance and oppose this new project nor could any man take a survey of this city without meeting in he way such object as might make all farther inquiry superfluous the idleness the insolence the debauchery of the common people and they natural and certain consequence poverty disease misery and wickedness be to be observe without any intention of indulge such disagreeable speculation in every part of this great metropolis whoever shall pass along the street will find wretch stretch upon the pavement insensible and motionless and only remove by the charity of passenger from the danger of be crush by carriage or trample by horse or strangle with filth in the common sewer and other less helpless perhaps but more dangerous who have drink too much to fear punishment but not enough to hinder they from provoke it who think themselves in the elevation of drunkenness entitle to treat all those with contempt whom they dress distinguish from they and to resent every injury which in the heat of they imagination they suppose themselves to suffer with the utmost rage of resentment violence of rudeness and scurrility of tongue no man can pass a single hour in publick place without meet such object or hear such expression as disgrace human nature such as can not be look upon without horror or hear without indignation and which there be however no possibility of remove or prevent whilst this hateful liquor be publickly sell but the visible and obvious effect of these pernicious draught however offensive or inconvenient be yet much less to be dread than they more slow and secret operation that excess of distilled spirit inflame the poor to insolence and fury that it expose they either to hurt by make they insensible of danger or to punishment by make they fearless of authority be not to be reckon the most fatal consequence of they use for these effect though they frequency make it necessary to suppress they with regard to each individual be of no long duration the understanding be in a short time recover after a single debauch and the drunkard may return to he employment but though the pleasure of drunkenness be quickly at a end its pain be of longer continuance these liquor not only infatuate the mind but poison the body nor do they produce only momentary fury but incurable debility and linger disease they not only fill we street with madman and we prison with criminal but we hospital with cripple those who have for a time infested the publick walk with they insult quickly disturb they with they lamentation and be soon reduce from bully to beggar and oblige to solicit alms from those they use to threaten and insult nor do the use of spirit my lord only impoverish the publick by lessen the number of useful and laborious hand but by cut off those recruit by which its natural and inevitable loss be to be supply the use of distilled liquor impair the fecundity of the human race and hinder that increase which providence have ordain for the support of the world those woman who riot in this poisonous debauchery be quickly disabled from bear child by bring on themselves in a short time all the infirmity and weakness of age or what be yet more destructive to general happiness produce child diseased from they birth by the vice of they parent child whose blood be taint with inveterate and accumulate malady for which no cure can be expect ` and who therefore be a additional burden to the community and must be support through a miserable life by that labor which they can not share and must be protect by that community of which they can not contribute to the defense thus my lord be the great source of power and wealth dry up the number of the people be every day diminish and by consequence we army must be weaken we trade abandon and we land uncultivated to diminish the people of any nation be the most atrocious political crime that it be possible to commit for it tend not to enslave or impoverish but to annihilate not to make a nation miserable but to make it no longer a nation such my lord be the effect of distilled liquor effect of which i would not have shock you with the enumeration have it not be with a design of prevent they and surely no man will be charge with so trivial a offence as negligence of delicacy when he be plead not for the honor or the life of a single man but for the peace of the present age the health of posterity and the existence of the british people after have examine the nature of these liquor it be natural to inquire how much they be in use whether mankind appear to know they quality and avoid and detest they like other poison or whether they be consider as inoffensive and drink like other liquor to raise the spirit or to gladden the heart whether they make part of social entertainment and whether they be hand round at publick table without any suspicion of they fatal consequence it be well know my lord that these liquor have not be long in use among the common people spirit be at first only import from foreign country and be by consequence too dear for the luxury of the vulgar in time it be discover that it be practicable to draw from grain and other product of we own soil such liquor as though not equally please to elegant palate with those of other nation resemble they at least in they inebriating quality and might be afford at a easy rate and consequently generally purchase this discovery my lord give rise to the new trade of distil which have be now for many year carry on in this nation and of the progress of which since the duty be lay upon its produce a exact account may be easily obtain which i think so necessary in we deliberation on this bill that i have procure it to be draw out from this account my lord it will be discover what can not be relate without the utmost grief that there have prevail for many year a kind of contagious infatuation among the common people by which they have be incite to poison themselves and they child with distil spirit they have forsake those liquor which in former time enliven they conversation and exalt they merriment and instead of ale and beer riot of late in distilled spirit the amazing increase of the consumption of spirit for the last ten year be a proof too evident of the prevalence of this destructive species of drunkenness and i shall therefore without trouble you lordship with earlier account only mention in round number the vast quantity for which the duty have be pay for a few year in that period in the year 1733 the number of gallon distil be three million and nine hundred thousand which in 1735 be increase to five million and three hundred thousand soon afterwards the law be make which we be now persuade to repeal by the execution of which however feeble and irresolute the number be reduce in the first year afterwards to three million and might perhaps by steady perseverance have be every year lessen but in a short time the people prevail in the contest with the legislator they intimidate information and wearied prosecution and be at length allow to indulge themselves in the enjoyment of they favorite vice without any farther molestation the effect of this indulgence my lord have be very remarkable nor can it be deny that the government betray great weakness in suffer the law to be overrule by drunkenness and the meanest and most profligate of the people to set the statute at defiance for the vice which have be so feebly oppose spread wider and wider and every year add regularly another million of gallon to the quantity of spirit distil till in the last year they rise to seven million and one hundred thousand gallon such my lord be at present the state of the nation twelve million of gallon of these poisonous liquor be every year swallow by the inhabitant of this kingdom and this quantity enormous as it be will probably every year increase till the number of the people shall be sensibly diminish by the disease which it must produce nor shall we find any decay of this pernicious trade but by the general mortality that will overspread the kingdom at least if this vice should be suppress it must be suppress by some supernatural interposition of providence for nothing be more absurd than to imagine that the bill now before we can produce any such effect for what my lord encourage any man to a crime but security from punishment or what tempt he to the commission of it but frequent opportunity we be however about to reform the practice of drinking spirit by make spirit more easy to be procure we be about to hinder they from be buy by exempt the vender from all fear of punishment it have indeed be assert that the tax now to be lay upon these liquor will have such wonderful effect that those who be at present drunk twice a-day will not be henceforward able to commit the same crime twice a-week a assertion which i could not hear without wonder at the new discovery which ministerial sagacity can sometimes make in deliberation on a subject of such importance my lord no man ought to content himself with conjecture where certainty may at whatsoever expense of labor be attain nor ought any man to neglect a careful and attentive examination of he notion before he offer they in publick consultation for if they be erroneous and no man can he certain that he be in the right who have never bring he own opinion to the test of inquiry he expose himself to be detect in ignorance or temerity and to that contempt which such detection naturally and justly produce or if he audience submit they reason to he authority and neglect to examine he assertion in confidence that he have sufficiently examine they himself he may suffer what to a honest mind must be far more painful than any personal ignominy he may languish under the consciousness of have influence the publick counsel by false declaration and have by he negligence betray he country to calamity which a closer attention might have enable he to have foresee whether the noble lord who allege the certainty of reformation which this bill will produce ever examine he own opinion i know not but think it necessary at least to consider it more particularly to supply that proof of it which if it be true he neglect to produce or to show if it be find false how little confident assertion be to be regard between twice a-day and twice a-week the noble lord will not deny the proportion to be as seven to one and therefore to prevent drunkenness in the degree which he persuade we to expect the price of the liquor must be raise in the same proportion but the duty lay upon the gallon will not increase the price a fifth part even though it should not be elude by distil liquor of a extraordinary strength one fifth part of the price be therefore in he lordship 's estimate equal to the whole price seven time multiply such be the argument which have be produce in favor of this bill and such be the diligence with which the publick happiness be promote by those who have hope of be enrich by publick calamity as the tax will not make a fifth part of the price and even that may be in some measure evade the duty pay for licens scarcely deserve consideration for it be not intend to hinder retailer but to make they useful in some degree to the ministry by pay a yearly tax for the license of poisoning it be therefore apparent upon the noble lord 's supposition that the price of the liquor will be raise in consequence of this tax that no man can be hinder from more than a fifth part of he usual debauchery which however would be some advantage to the publick but even this small advantage can not be expect from the bill because one part will obstruct the benefit that might be hope from another the duty upon liquor however inconsiderable will be necessarily a augmentation of the price to the first buyer but probably that augmentation will be very little feel by the consumer for my lord it must be consider that many circumstance concur to constitute the price of any commodity the price of what be in itself cheap may be raise by the art or the condition of those that sell it what be engross by a few hand be sell dearer than when the same quantity be disperse in many and what be sell in security and under the protection of the law be cheaper than that which expose the vender to prosecution and penalty at present my lord distil spirit be sell in opposition to the law of the kingdom and therefore it be reasonable as have be before observe to believe that a extraordinary profit be expect because no man will incur danger without advantage it be at present retail for the greatest part by indigent person who can not be suppose to buy it in large quantity and consequently not at the cheapest rate and who must of necessity gain a large profit because they be to subsist upon a very small stock these cause concur may be easily imagine to raise the price more than a fifth part above the profit which be expect in other traffick but when this bill shall become a law the necessity of large profit will no longer subsist for there will then be no danger in retailing spirit and they will be chiefly sell in house by person who can afford to purchase they in great quantity who can be trust by the distiller for the usual time allow in other trade and who therefore may sell they without any exorbitant advantage besides my lord it be reasonable to imagine that the present profit to the retailer be very great since like that which arise from the clandestine exportation of wool it be sufficient to tempt multitude to a breach of the law a contempt of penalty and a defiance of the magistrate and it may be therefore imagine that there be room for a considerable abatement of the price which may subtract much more than be add by this new duty this deduction from the price my lord will probably be soon produce by the emulation of retailer who when the trade become safe and publick will endeavor to attract buyer by low rate for what the noble lord whose ingenious assertion i be now oppose have declare with respect to trader that for a tax of a penny upon any commodity they oblige the consumer to advance twopence be not universally true and i believe it be as likely that the people will insist upon have the same liquor at the usual price without regard to the tax as that the vender will be able to raise they price in a unreasonable proportion the obstinacy of the people with regard to this liquor my lord have already appear and i be incline to believe that they who have confessedly conquer the legislature will not suffer themselves to be overcome in the same cause by the avarice of alehouse keeper i be therefore confident my lord that this bill will produce no beneficial effect even in this city and that in the country where the sale of spirit be hinder by the late law or where at least it might have be hinder in a great measure it will propagate wickedness and debauchery in a degree never yet know the torrent of licentiousness will break at once upon it and a sudden freedom from restraint will produce a wanton enjoyment of privilege which have never be think so valuable have they never be take away thus while the crowd of the capital be every day thin by the licensed distributor of poison the country which be to be consider as the nursery in which the human species be chiefly propagate will be make barren and that race of man will be intercept which be to defend the liberty of the neighbouring nation in the next age which be to extend we commerce to other kingdom or repel the encroachment of future usurpation the bill my lord will therefore produce none of the advantage which those who promote it have have the confidence to promise the publick but let we now examine whether they have not be more sagacious in secure the benefit which they expect from it themselves that one of the intention of it be to raise a sum to supply the present exigency of the government be not deny that this be the only intention be generally believe and believe upon the strongest reason for it be the only effect which it can possibly produce and to this end it be calculate with all the skill of man long verse in the laudable art of contrive tax and of raise money i have already show to you lordship that seven million of gallon of spirit be annually distil in this kingdom this consumption at the small duty of sixpence a gallon now to be impose will produce a yearly revenue of # 175000 and the tax upon licens may be rate at a very large sum so that there be a fund sufficient i hope for the expense which a land war be to bring upon we but we be not to forget my lord that this be only the produce of the first year and that the tax be likely to afford every year a larger revenue as the consumption of those liquor under its late discouragement have advance a million of gallon every year it may be reasonably imagine that by the countenance of the legislature and the protection of authority it will increase in a double proportion and that in ten year more twenty million will be distil every year for the destruction of the people thus far my lord the scheme of the ministry appear prosperous but all prosperity at least all the prosperity of dishonesty must in time have a end the practice of drinking can not be for ever continue because it will hurry the present generation to the grave and prevent the production of another the revenue must cease with the consumption and the consumption must be at a end when the consumer be destroy but this my lord can not speedily happen nor have we minister any dread of misery which be only to fall in distant time upon another generation it be sufficient for they if they expedient can supply those exigency which they counsel have bring upon the publick if they pay they court to the crown with success at whatever disadvantage to the people and continue in power till they have enlarged they fortune and then without punishment retire to enjoy they but i hope my lord that we shall act upon very different principle that we shall examine the most distant consequence of we resolution and consider ourselves not as the agent of the crown to levy tax but as the guardian of the people to promote the publick happiness that we shall always remember that happiness can be produce only by virtue and that since this bill can tend only to the increase of debauchery we shall without the formality of a commitment unanimously reject it with indignation and abhorrence lord carteret speak to the following effect : -- my lord the bill now before we have be examine with the utmost acuteness and oppose with all the art of eloquence and argumentation nor have any topick be forget that could speciously be employ against it it have be represent by some as contrary to policy and by other as opposite to religion its consequence have be display with all the confidence of prediction and the motive upon which it have be form declare to be such as i hope every man abhor who project or defend it it have be assert that this bill owe its existence only to the necessity of raise tax for the support of unnecessary troops to be employ in useless and dangerous expedition and that those who defend it have no regard to the happiness or virtue of the people nor any other design than to raise supplies and gratify the ministry in pursuance of this scheme of argument the consequence of this bill have be very artfully deduce and very copiously explain and it have be assert that by pass it we shall show ourselves the patron of vice the defender of debauchery and the promoter of drunkenness it have be declare that in consequence of this law by which the use of distilled liquor be intend to be restrain the retailer of they will be multiply and multiply without end till the corruption which be already too extensive be become general and the nation be transform into a herd of drunkard with regard to the use to which the money which shall arise from this tax be to be apply though it have be more than once mention in this debate i shall pass it over as without any connexion with the question before we to confound different topick may be useful to those whose design be to impose upon the inattention or weakness of they opponent as they may be enable by it to alter sometimes the state of the controversy and to hide they fallacy in perplexity and confusion but always to be avoid by those who endeavor to discover and to establish truth who dispute not to confound but to convince and who intend not to disturb the publick deliberation but assist they i shall therefore my lord only endeavor to show that the consequence of which some lord express and i believe with sincerity such dreadful apprehension be not in reality to be fear from this bill that it will probably promote the purpose for which it be declare to be calculate and that it will by no means produce that havock in the human species which seem to be suspect or diffuse that corruption through the people which have be confidently foretell the present state of this vice my lord have be fully explain as well by those who oppose the bill as by those who defend it the use of distilled liquor be now prohibit by a penal law but the execution of this law as of all other of the same kind necessarily suppose a regular information of the breach of it to be lay before the magistrate the people consider this law however just or necessary as a act of the most tyrannical cruelty which ought to be oppose with the utmost steadiness and vigor as a insupportable hardship from which they ought at any rate to set themselves free they have determine therefore not to be govern by this law and have consequently endeavor to hinder its execution and so vigorous have be they effort that they have at last prevail at first they only oppose it by they perseverance and obstinacy they resolve to persist in the practice of retailing liquor without regard to the penalty which they might incur by it and therefore as one be put to prison he place be immediately supply by another and so frequent be the information and so fruitless the penalty that the chief magistrate of the metropolis lament publickly in the other house the unpleasing necessity to which he be subject by that law of fine and imprison without end and without hope of procure the reformation that be intend thus they proceed for some time and appear to hope that the magistrate would after a while connive at a practice which they should find no degree of severity sufficient to suppress that they would sink under the fatigue of punish to no purpose that they would by degree relax they vigilance and leave the people in quiet possession of that felicity which they appear to rate at so high a price at length my lord instead of weary the magistrate they grow weary themselves and determine no longer to bear persecution for they enjoyment but to resist that law which they could not evade and to which they would not submit they therefore determine to mark out all those who by they information promote its execution as publick enemy as wretch who for the sake of a reward carry on a trade of perjury and persecution and who harass they innocent neighbor only for carry on a lawful employment for supply the want of the poor relieve the weariness of the labourer administer solace to the dejected and cordial to the sick the word be therefore give that no informer should be spare and when a offender be summon by the civil officer crowd watch at the door of the magistrate to rescue the prisoner and to discover and seize the witness upon whose testimony he be convict and unfortunate be the wretch who with the imputation of this crime upon he fall into they hand it be well remember by every man who at that time be conversant in this city with what outcry of vengeance a informer be pursue in the publick street and in the open day with what exclamation of triumph he be seize and with what rage of cruelty he be torment one instance of they fury i very particularly remember : as a man be pass along the street the alarm be give that he be a informer against the retailer of spirituous liquor the populace be immediately gather as in a time of common danger and unite in the pursuit as of a beast of prey which it be criminal not to destroy the man discover either by consciousness or intelligence he danger and flee for he life with the utmost precipitation but no housekeeper durst afford he shelter the cry increase upon he on all hand and the populace roll on after he with a torrent not to be resist and he be upon the point of be overtake and like some other destroy when one of the greatest person in the nation hear the tumult and inquire the reason open he door to the distressed fugitive and sheltered he from a cruel death soon afterwards there be a stop put to all information no man dare afterwards for the sake of a reward expose himself to the fury of the people and the use of these destructive liquor be no longer obstruct how much the practice of this kind of debauchery prevail after this short restraint and how much the consumption of these destructive liquor have increase the noble lord who speak last have very accurately inform we nor can any argument be offer for the present bill more strong than that which he computation have already furnish for if it appear my lord and it can not be doubt after such authentick testimony that seven million of gallon of spirit be every year consume in this kingdom and that of these far the greatest quantity be waste in the most flagitious and destructive debauchery it be surely at length necessary to consider by what means this consumption which can not be stop may be lessen and this vice obstruct which can not be reform by open a sufficient number of licensed shop the number of unlicensed retailer will be necessarily lessen and by raise the price of the liquor the quantity which the poor drink must with equal certainty be diminish and as it can not be imagine that the number of those who will pay annually for licens can be equal to that of the petty trader who now dispose of spirit in cellar and in the street it be reasonable to believe that since there will be fewer seller less will be sell some lord have indeed declare they suspicion that the number of licensed shop will be such as will endanger the health of the people and the peace of the commonwealth and one have so far indulge he imagination as to declare that he expect fifteen hundred shop to be set open for the sale of spirit in a short time after the publication of this law if it be answer that no spirit can be sell but by those who keep a house of publick entertainment by a license from the justice of the peace the opponent of the bill have a reply ready that the justice will take all opportunity to promote the increase of the revenue and will always grant a license when it be demand without regard to the mischief that may arise from the increase of the retreat of idleness and receptacle of vice and that therefore to allow justice to grant licens for the retail of any commodity upon which a tax be lay be to permit the sale of it without limit but my lord this argument will vanish when it be consider that those justice to whom the law commit the superintendency of publick-house be superintend themselves by man who derive they authority from a higher power and whose censure be more formidable than judicial penalty the conduct of the justice my lord as of every other person lie open to the observation of the reverend clergy by whose counsel it be to be regulate and by whose admonition it ought to be reform admonition which can not be suppose to be without force from man to whom the great province of preach virtue and truth be commit and whose profession be so much reverence that reputation and infamy be generally in they power should the justice my lord abuse they authority either for the increase of the revenue or any other purpose what could they expect but to be mark out on the next day of publick worship for reproach and derision what could they hope but that they crime should be display in the most odious view to they neighbor they child and they dependant and that all those from whom nature or interest teach they to desire friendship reverence or esteem will be teach to consider they as the slave of power and the agent of villany as the propagator of debauchery and the enemy of mankind there be therefore my lord reason to hope that the bill may be useful because it will be hinder from be detrimental and as there be a absolute necessity of do something and no better method can at present be propose i think this ought not to be reject we have find by experience that the publick be not to be reform at once and that the progress from corruption to reformation must be gradual and as this bill enforce some degree of amendment it be at least more eligible than the present law which be wholly without effect because no man will dare to put it in execution every man must be convince by he own experience of the difficulty with-which long habit be surmount i myself suffer some indulgence which yet i can not prevail upon myself to forbear this indulgence be the use of too much snuff to which it be well know that many person of rank be not less addict and therefore i do not wonder that the law be ineffectual which be to encounter with the habit and appetite of the whole mass of the common people for this reason my lord i can not approve what have be recommend in this debate any new law that may put the enjoyment of this liquor yet farther from they by facilitate prosecution or enforce penalty as i be convince that the natural force of the people be superior to the law and that they natural force will be exert for the defense of they darling spirit and the whole nation be shake with universal sedition it have be object by the noble lord that the tax now propose be such as never be raise in any government because though luxury may confessedly be tax vice ought to be constantly suppress and this in he lordship 's opinion be a tax upon vice he lordship 's distinction between luxury and vice between the use of thing unlawful and the excess of thing lawful be undoubtedly just but by no means applicable on this occasion nor indeed have the noble lord with all he art be able to apply it for he be oblige to change the term in he argument and instead of call this tax a tax upon strong liquor to stigmatize it with the odious appellation of a tax upon drunkenness to call any thing what it really be not and then to censure it be very easy too easy my lord to be do with success to confute the argument it be only necessary to observe that this tax be not a tax upon drunkenness but a tax lay upon strong liquor for the prevention of drunkenness and by consequence such as fall within the compass of he own definition that it be not a tax upon luxury can not be infer from the indigence of those whom it be intend to reform for luxury be my lord _ ad modum possidenti _ of different kind in proportion to different condition of life and one man may very decently enjoy those delicacy or pleasure to which it would be foolish and criminal in another to aspire whoever spend upon superfluity what he must want for the necessity of life be luxurious and excess therefore of distilled spirit may be term with the utmost propriety the luxury of the poor this my lord appear to be the opinion of the noble lord who speak so copiously on this question at the beginning of the debate of this opinion be the reverend prelate when he observe that _ necessity itself be become luxurious _ and of this opinion must every man be who advise such a duty to be lay upon these liquor as may at once debar the poor from the use of they for such a proposal evidently suppose they unnecessary and all enjoyment of thing not necessary be a degree of luxury to tax this luxury which be perhaps the most pernicious of all other be now propose but it be propose to tax it only to suppress it to suppress it by such slow degree as may be bear by the people and i hope a law so salutary will not be oppose only because it may afford the government a present supply the duke of newcastle then rise up and speak to the following effect : -- my lord i be of opinion that this debate would have be much shorter have not the noble lord who have speak in it suffer themselves to be lead away either by they own zeal or the zeal of they opponent from the true state of the question to which i shall take the liberty of recall they attention that this important controversy may have at length a end the point the only point that be in my opinion now to be consider be this : the people of this nation have for some time practice a most pernicious and hateful kind of debauchery against which several law have be already make which experience have show to be so far without effect that the disorder have every year increase among they -lrb- while the duke be speak the bishop of orford say without intention to be overhear yes that be the true state of the case upon which the duke stop and ask whether he lordship have any objection to make who answer that he have no design of interrupt he and he therefore proceed -rrb- a new law therefore be propose less severe indeed than the former but which it be hope will be for that reason more efficacious this law have pass through the other house be now in the common course of we procedure to be consider by we in a committee we be now my lord therefore to resolve whether a bill for the reformation of this flagrant vice deserve any farther deliberation whether we shall join with the other house in they endeavor to restore the ancient sobriety and virtue of the british people or by a open disapprobation of they attempt discourage they from prosecute they design and debar they from use the opportunity that succeed year may afford and the new light which experience may supply for improve this essay however imperfect to a salutary and unexceptionable law the prelate whose laudable zeal for the promotion of virtue have prompt they to distinguish themselves on this occasion by a uncommon warmth of opposition ought as they appear fully sensible of the calamity which intemperance bring upon mankind to consider likewise the consequence of refuse to examine in a committee a bill professedly draw up to restrain intemperance they ought to remember that by reject this bill without a particular examination of the several clause which it contain and without those particular objection which such examination necessarily produce we shall discover a contempt of the wisdom or virtue of the other house which may incline they in they turn to obstruct the measure of the government or at least to neglect that evil however great for the redress of which they have no reason to expect we concurrence those whose particular province it be to inspect the life of the people to recal they from vice and strengthen they in virtue should certainly reflect on this occasion that the safest method ought to be choose and therefore that this bill ought to be promote because not to affirm too much it be possible that it may produce some degree of reformation and the worst that can be fear be that like the present law it will be ineffectual for the corruption and licentiousness of the people be already such that nothing can increase they the bishop of sarum then speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord i be so far from be convince by the argument of the noble duke that the bill now before we ought to be commit without farther opposition that in my opinion nothing can be more unworthy of the honor of this house or more unsuitable to the character which those who sit on this bench ought to desire than to agree to any vote which may have the most distant appearance of approbation that a bill draw up for the reformation of manners for the restraint of a predominant and destructive vice for the promotion of virtue and the enforcement of religion ought at least to be calmly and particularly consider that the laudable endeavor of the common ought not to be discourage by a precipitate and contemptuous rejection of the measure which they have form for the attainment of a purpose so important be indeed a specious and plausible method of persuasion but my lord it can affect only those who come to deliberate upon this bill without have read it a very slight and cursory perusal of the bill my lord will dissipate all the mist which eloquence can raise it will show that the law now propose can neither be useful nor ineffectual but that it must operate very powerfully though in a manner by no means agreeable to its title to prevent the excessive use of any thing by allow it to be sell without restraint be a expedient which the wisdom of no former age ever discover it be indeed a fallacy too gross to be admit even by the most inconsiderate negligence or the most contemptuous stupidity nor be i at all incline to believe that the common will impute the rejection of this bill to we disregard of virtue or think that we have defeat any endeavor for the suppression of wickedness it have be affirm that though by the bill the sale be permit it be permit only because it can not be hinder and that the price be raise so high that though the lawful vender may be multiply the number of the purchaser must be diminish but even this argument like all other that have yet be advance be confute by the bill itself from which the tax now propose appear to be such as when subdivide by the small measure in which retailer sell these liquor will scarcely be perceive and which though it may enrich the government will not impoverish the people except by destroy they health and enervate they limb the tax my lord even suppose it pay without any method of evasion be so low that in a quarter of a pint the quantity which the lower people usually demand at once it do not amount to any denomination of money and so small a addition will be easily overbalance by the sale of a larger quantity than formerly for it can not be doubt but the practice which prevail in opposition to the law will grow yet more predominant by its encouragement and that therefore the advantage of a large and quick sale will lessen the price more than so slight a tax can possibly increase it the noble duke have endeavor to reduce we to difficulty by urge that since the corruption of the people can not be greater we ought willingly to agree to any law of which the title declare that it be intend to produce a reformation because the worst that can be fear be that it may be without effect but my lord such be the enormous absurdity of this bill that no plea can be offer for it with the least appearance of reason and the greatest ability when they be exert in its defense be able only to show by fruitless effort that it can not be vindicate if the state of the nation be really such as have be suppose if the most detestable and odious vice have overspread the kingdom to its utmost limit if the people be universally abandon to drunkenness sloth and villany what can be more absurd than to trifle with doubtful experiment and to make law which must be suspect of inefficacy in the disease of the state as in those of the body the force of the remedy ought to be proportion to the strength and danger of the disease and surely no political malady can be more formidable than the prevalence of wickedness nor can any time require more firmness vigilance and activity in the legislative power that the law therefore may be without effect be in the present state of corruption if it have be truly represent a sufficient reason for reject it without allow it to be commit because there be now no time for indulgence or for delay a nation universally corrupt must be speedily reform or speedily ruin those habit which have be confess to be already too powerful for the law now in be may in a short time be absolutely irresistible and that licentiousness which intimidate the officer of justice may in another year insult the legislature but my lord i be yet willing to hope that the noble duke 's account of the wickedness of the people be rather a rhetorical exaggeration utter in the ardor of dispute than a strict assertion of fact and be of opinion that though vice have indeed of late spread its contagion with great rapidity there be yet great number uninfected and can not believe that we condition be such as that nothing can make it more miserable in many part of the country my lord these liquor have not yet be much use nor be it likely that those who have never sell they when the law allow they will begin a unnecessary trade when it will expose they to penalty but a new law in favor of spirit will produce a general inclination and a kind of emulation will incite every one to take a license for the retail of this new liquor and so every part of the kingdom will be equally debauched and no place will be without a vender of statutable poison the luxury of the vulgar for luxury in my opinion it may very properly be call will still increase and vice and disease will increase with it there be at least one part of the nation yet untaint a part which deserve the utmost care of the legislature and which must be endanger by a law like this before we the child my lord to whom the affair of the present generation must be transfer and by whom the nation must be continue be surely no ignoble part of the publick they be yet innocent and it be we province to take care that they may in time be virtuous we ought therefore to remove from before they those example that may infect and those temptation that may corrupt they we ought to reform they parent lest they should imitate they and to destroy those provocative to vice by which the present generation have be intoxicate lest they should with equal force operate upon the next there be therefore no occasion my lord for any farther deliberation upon this bill which if the nation be yet in any part untainted will infect it and if it be universally corrupt will have no tendency to amend it and which we ought for these reason to reject that we abhorrence of vice may be publickly know and that no part of the calamity which wickedness must produce may be imputed to we lord delaware then speak to the following effect : -- my lord as i be entirely of opinion that a more accurate examination of this bill will evince its usefulness and propriety to many of the lord who be now most ardent in oppose it i can not but think it necessary to consider it in a committee it be to be remembered my lord that this bill be intend for two purpose of very great importance to the publick it be design that the liberty of mankind shall be secure by the same provision by which the vice of we own people be to be reclaim and supplies for carry on the war shall be raise by a reformation of the manners of the people this my lord be surely a great and generous design this be a complication of publick benefit worthy the most exalted virtue and the most refined policy and though a bill in which view so distant be to be reconcile should appear not to be absolutely perfect it must yet be allow to deserve regard nor ought we to reject without very cautious deliberation any probable method of reform the nation or any easy way of raise supplies the encroachment of usurpation without and the prevalence of vice within be a conjunction of circumstance very dangerous and to remove both by the same means be a undertaking that surely can not deserve either censure or contempt : if it succeed it may demand the loudest acclamation and if it fail must be at least approve the use my lord of spirituous liquor though in the excess now so frequently to be observe undoubtedly detrimental to multitude be not in a proper degree either criminal or unwholesome and therefore ought not to be prohibit by a tax so heavy as have be propose by a noble lord who if he pursue he reasoning must propose to tax in the same proportion every other liquor that can administer to vice it be however certain that too much be waste in riot and debauchery and that therefore some addition to the price of this liquor ought to be make that though the use of it may be continue the excess may be restrain what will be the effect of this bill and whether either of these benefit be to be expect from it can be know only by a impartial examination and therefore it ought to be discuss with that accuracy which be peculiar to a committee lord lonsdale here get up again and speak to this purpose : -- my lord that a bill which shall restrain the excess of drinking distilled liquor without hinder they moderate use will deserve the applause of every lover of he country i can not deny but that any such bill can be contrived may very justly be doubt for in proportion to they price they will always be use and nothing can hinder excess but a high tax such as i have already propose the bill now before we my lord will indeed by no means obstruct the moderate use because it will give a unbounded license to the most luxurious excess if therefore nothing more be intend in the committee than to consider how far this bill will promote the reformation of the people it be surely not necessary to engage in any farther inquiry it have appear already to those who do not obstinately shut they eye that there be in it no provision for the prevention of that abuse of spirit which universally prevail it have appear that the cheapness of licens will not hinder the present retailer from carry on a illegal trade that information will not now be more safe or more frequent than before and that the duty if not in part evade may yet be probably abate from the present profit of the sale it have appear my lord that no effect can be produce by this bill but the promotion of debauchery the increase of drunkenness the subversion of order and the decay of industry the misery of disease and the rage of want but that this bill will not produce at least for some time a large addition to the publick revenue have not yet be prove and while it be allow that it will raise money i do not wonder to hear it steadily defend because nothing more be expect from it but as i have not yet converse enough with statesman to persuade myself that the government ought to be support by means contrary to the end for which government be institute i be still convince that this bill ought to be reject with contempt because it will lessen the wealth of the nation without any equivalent advantage and will at once impoverish the people and corrupt they lord islay then speak to this effect : -- my lord i can not but be of opinion that this debate have be carry on with a vehemence by no means necessary and that the question have be perplex by a mistaken zeal that the effect of this bill have be exaggerated perhaps on both side and that the opinion which have be form with relation to it be not really so opposite as they appear those who oppose the bill think the duty upon spirit not so high as to hinder that debauchery which so much prevail among we and those that vindicate it declare that more violent restraint will not be bear both party have reason and the vindicator of the bill have likewise experience on they side but my lord though severe restraint suddenly oppose to the habit and inclination of the people operate in they full force may be break through by restless struggle and obstinate resistance yet a diminution of those gratification will be bear which can not wholly be take away and the same law introduce by proper degree will be patiently obey this therefore may be very properly consider as the first tax necessary to be lay which though it may produce no great effect in itself may at least make way for a second that shall be more sensibly feel till at length these fatal spirit shall be raise to a price at which few will be able and none willing to purchase one pleasure of drunkenness but it be not impossible that even this tax with the other provision in the bill may produce the reformation which be unanimously desire and as violence should never be use till gentle method have be try this bill ought in my opinion to be pass and therefore to be refer to a committee without farther debate for it will be think both by we ally and we enemy that a great part of this assembly be very indifferent about the success of the war if we delay the supplies by dispute in what manner they shall be raise -lrb- the question be then put whether the bill shall be commit it be carry in the affirmative and the lord delaware and hervey be appoint teller the number be contents 59 proxy 23 -- 82 not contents 38 proxy 16 -- 54 it be remark on this occasion that there be ten prelate in the house they all divide against the question upon which the earl of chesterfield see they come towards he say he doubt if he have not mistake the side not have have the honor of they company for many year two day after the same bill be consider by the house of lord in a committee to which all of they be summon and occasion another very important and curious debate -rrb- February 23 1742-3 the title of the bill on spirituous liquor be read be postpone : then the preamble be read import that whereas great difficulty and inconveniency have attend the put the act 9 geo ii in execution and the same have not be find effectual to answer the purpose intend the common be desirous to raise the necessary supplies in the easiest manner do grant the rate on spirituous liquor hereafter mention and repeal the present rate lord hervey speak to the effect follow : -- my lord notwithstanding the specious argument which be use to influence the house to permit this bill to escape the censure it deserve and be admit to a farther examination in a committee i be still confident that nothing can justly be offer in its defense and be not afraid to declare my opinion that it be not approve even by those who vindicate it of whom i can not but believe from long experience of they judgment and they knowledge that they consider it only as a _ easy manner _ of raise money as a expedient rather necessary than eligible and such as only the exigency of the government could have prevail upon they to propose for nothing be more evident than that it can not answer the purpose of the former bill this however harsh it may appear and however inconsistent with that delicacy with which the debate of this August assembly have generally be carry on must surely be pardon on this occasion if for no other reason at least for this that it be not easy to forbear it it be impossible wholly to suppress it in the mind and to forbear to speak what can not but be think be no part of the duty of a publick counsellor the conduct of those whose station subject they to the resentment of the ministry or who may be reasonably imagine to expect favor from they have throughout all we deliberation on this bill be such as evidently discover they only care to be the imposition of a new tax and the establishment of a new fund they do not seem to urge seriously any other argument than the necessity of raise money or to oppose the objection that have be offer for any other reason than because they have a tendency to obstruct the supplies no other argument can indeed be urge in vindication of a bill which every principle of policy or justice must incite we to condemn a bill by which the sense of morality and religion will be extinguish and the restraint of law make ineffectual by which the labourer and manufacturer will be at once debilitate and corrupt and by which the road will be fill with thief and the street with beggar it appear my lord from the papers on the table that seven million of gallon be every year distil and experience show we that the quality of the liquor be such that a quarter of a pint be sufficient to intoxicate the brain upon this computation my lord it be reasonable to believe that a twentieth part of the labor hand of this nation be detain from they proper occupation by this kind of drunkenness and consequently that a twentieth part of the trade be every year lose or perhaps a twentieth part of we people every year hurry to the grave or disabled from contribute to the publick good these my lord be no doubtful fact or conjectural calculation they be confirm by the most incontestable evidence and establish by all the demonstration of arithmetick and therefore you lordship be in no danger of error from either ignorance or uncertainty but must determine if you approve this bill in opposition to all the power of conviction and must set aside testimony and reason at the same time these fact my lord be so plain that the warmest advocate for the bill have tacitly acknowledge they by propose that if it be find ineffectual it shall be amend in the next session what effect this proposal may have upon other i know not but for my part i shall never think it allowable to sport with the prosperity of the publick or to try experiment by which if they fail the life of thousand must be destroy such a scheme my lord very ill become those to whom they ancestor have transmit the illustrious character of guardian of the people for surely such cruelty be never practice by the utmost wantonness of tyranny or the most savage rage of invasion no man ever before conceive the design of scatter poison for a certain period of time among the people only to try what havock it would make what will be the effect of unrestrained and licensed debauchery may be know without the guilt of so dreadful a experiment only by observe the present conduct of the people even while they be hinder from the full enjoyment of they pleasure by the terror of a penal law whoever shall be so far touch with the interest of the publick as to extend he inquiry to the lowest class of the people will find some diseased and other vitiate he will find some imprison by they creditor and other starve they child and if he trace all these calamity and crime to they original cause will find they all to proceed from the love of distilled liquor i know my lord that in answer to all these expostulation and a thousand more it will be urge by the minister and they friend that there be no other method to be find of raise the supplies and that the demand of the government must be satisfy at whatever rate and by whatever mean though i be very far from approve this assertion i do not wonder at its prevalence among those who be enrich by every tax and whose only claim to the preferment which they enjoy arise from they readiness to concur in every scheme for increase the burden of the publick and therefore shall never expect they approbation of any proposal by which a new tax may be retard yet i can not but declare that in my opinion we ought to suspend we proceedings that the common may discover what danger they negligence precipitation or blind compliance have bring upon the nation and that the people may by so signal a proof of we disapprobation be alarm against any attempt of the same kind under any future administration this my lord will be consider not only by posterity but by all the wise and honest man of the present time as a proof of we regard for virtue and we attention to the publick welfare this conduct will be secretly approve even by those who may think themselves oblige to oppose it in publick and as it will be moderate and decent may probably preserve the nation without irritate the other house i therefore move my lord that instead of proceed in the superfluous form of a committee we should resume the house and endeavor to obtain farther information after a short silence lord cholmondeley speak to this effect : -- my lord the observation which though sufficiently explain and enforce in the late debate the noble lord have be please to repeat on this occasion be in themselves indeed sufficiently pertinent and have be urge by he lordship with uncommon spirit and elegance but he ought to have reflect that general declamation be improper in a committee where the particular clause of the bill be to be separately consider i propose therefore that instead of waste that time of which the exigency of the publick now require a uncommon frugality in useless rhetorick and untimely vehemence we should proceed to examine in order the distinct paragraph of this bill by which it may more easily appear whether it ought to be reject or approve it can not indeed be propose that any of the clause shall be amend in this committee for the claim of the common and the obstinacy with which they have always adhere to they on whatever they be found be well know i be old enough to remember the animosity which have arise between the two house from attempt to adjust this part of they pretension animosity which at this time may be not only dangerous to ourselves but fatal to a great part of mankind and which it ought therefore to be we utmost care not to excite lord aylesford : -- my lord though the consideration of the distinct paragraph of the bill be as the noble lord have very justly observe the proper business of the committee yet since as he have likewise observe the present state of we affair require unusual expedition i think we may very properly spare ourselves the trouble of consider paragraph which we can not amend and which be in themselves so clear and so obvious that they may be understand in they full extent upon a cursory perusal but my lord though i think it not proper to follow we usual method of consider the paragraph distinctly which can only drive the bill forward towards the third reading as it have already be force into the committee yet i think it not necessary to irritate the other house alarm we ally or encourage we enemy by reject that bill by which it be intend that the supplies shall be raise there be a easy and moderate method by which the same end may be attain without any disturbance of the publick any impediment of the scheme of the government or any just offence to the common instead of pass or reject this bill of which the first be absolutely criminal and the second perhaps improper let we only delay it by which we shall give the common time to reflect upon it to reexamine it and discover what they perhaps have not hitherto suspect its destructive tendency nor can it be doubt but the observation which will arise from the necessity of inquire into the reason of we conduct will soon induce they to form another bill not liable to the same objection i therefore second the noble lord 's motion to resume the house lord islay : -- my lord if we consider the pretension of the common and the stubbornness with which they have hitherto adhere to they we shall easily find the impropriety of the noble lord 's motion and foresee the inefficacy of the method which he so warmly recommend the alarm which he suppose we to give the common by postpone the bill before we the observation which they will make upon we conduct the new information which they will receive and the new bill which they will send be merely imaginary they will not consider themselves as concern in the delay or expedition of we procedure but will suppose we to act upon we own reason which it be not necessary for they to examine and will by no means send another bill for supplies till they be inform that this be reject thus my lord we shall only retard the supplies without alter or be able to alter the method of raise they and at last pass that bill without examination which we now neglect to examine lest we should pass it or perhaps irritate the common by the novelty of we conduct which if they should resolve to consider it they will probably consider only to censure lord aylespord : -- my lord i be no stranger to the claim of the common to the sole and independent right of form money bill nor to the heat with which that claim have be assert or the firmness with which it have always be maintain in late senate nor be i ignorant that by contest this claim we have sometimes excite dispute which nothing but a prorogation of the senate could appease i know my lord and allow that by act in any unusual manner with regard to bill of this kind we may excite the resentment of the common and that some interruption of the publick business may for want of candor and moderation possibly ensue but my lord i can not think the possibility of a ill consequence a argument sufficient to show the unreasonableness of my proposal for the inconveniency that may arise from postpone the bill be only possible but the calamity that we shall bring upon we country by pass it be certain but we be likewise to consider my lord that these event of which it can only be say that they may happen may also not happen when i reflect that the house of common be a assembly of reasonable being that it be fill by the representative of the british people by man who will share the calamity of the publick and whose interest it be equally with ours to prevent the destruction of we commerce the decay of we manufacture the corruption of the present age and the ruin of posterity i can not but hope that they will apply themselves to a candid review of the bill which they have send and without heat jealousy or dispute explain it as they may do by another which will be no deviation from the rule which they have establish for themselves and by which they may secure the happiness of they country without recede from they own pretension the duke of bedford : -- my lord the proposal make by the noble lord appear to I so prudent and equitable so moderate and so seasonable and in my opinion suggest so easy a method of reconcile the pretension of the common with the necessity of amend the bill that i can not but think it worthy of the unanimous approbation of you lordship i be very far from conceive the common to be a assembly of man deaf to reason or imagine they so void of all regard for the happiness of the publick as that they will sacrifice it to a obstinate adherence to claim which they can not but know to be in themselves disputable and of which they must at least allow that they be only so far just as they contribute to the great end of government the general good but lest they should by any perverse and unseasonable obstinacy attend more to the preservation of they own power than to the promotion of the happiness of they constituent a method be now propose by which the error of this bill may be correct without any concession of either house the common may easily be inform of the danger which be justly dread from this bill and may therefore prepare another by which a tax of the same kind may be lay without a general license of drunkenness or if a method of lay a duty upon these liquor which may at once hinder they excessive use and increase the revenue of the government can not be discover they may raise the supplies for the year by some other scheme lord carteret : -- my lord as the expedient propose by these noble lord however it may be recommend as be at once moderate and efficacious have in reality no other tendency than to procure a absolute rejection of this bill it be proper to consider the consequence which may be reasonably expect from the measure which they have hitherto propose in order to the effectual restraint of the common people from the use of these pernicious liquor they assert the necessity of impose a very large duty to be pay by the distiller which might indeed produce in some degree the effect which they expect from it but would produce it by give rise to innumerable fraud and inconveniency the immediate consequence of a heavy duty would be the ruin of we distillery which be now a very extensive and profitable trade in which great multitude be employ who must instantly upon the cessation of it sink into poverty we still my lord not only supply we native with liquor which they use formerly to purchase from foreign country and therefore increase or at least preserve the wealth of we country but they likewise furnish large quantity for exportation to guernsey jersey and other place but no sooner will the duty propose to be lay upon this liquor take place than all this trade will be at a end and those who now follow it will be reduce to support themselves by other employment and those country in which we spirit be now drink will be soon supply from other nation with liquor at once cheaper and more pleasant it may be propose as a expedient for the preservation of we foreign trade that the duty shall be repay upon exportation but the event of this provision my lord will be that great quantity will be send to sea for the sake of obtain a repayment of the duty which instead of be sell to foreigner will be privately land again upon we own coast thus my lord will the duty be collect and afterwards repay and the government will suffer the odium of impose a severe tax and incur the expense of employ a great number of officer without any advantage to the publick spirit will in many part of the kingdom be very little dearer than at present and drunkenness and debauchery will still prevail that these art and a thousand other will be practice by the people to obtain this infatuating liquor can not be doubt it can not be imagine that they will forbear fraud who have have recourse to violence or that those will not endeavor to elude the government who have already defy it every rigorous law will be either secretly evade or openly violate every severe restraint will be shake off either by artifice or vice nor can this vice however dangerous or prevalent be correct but by slow degree by straiten the rein of government imperceptibly and by superad a second slight restraint after the nation have be for some time habituate to the first that the government proceeds by these easy and gentle method of reformation ought not to be imputed to negligence but necessity for so far have the government be from any connivance at this vice that a armed force be necessary to support the law which be make to restrain it and secure the chief person of the state from the insult of the populace whom they have only provoke by deny they this pernicious liquor since therefore my lord all opposition to this predominant inclination have appear without effect since the government evidently want power to conquer the unite and incessant struggle for the liberty of drunkenness what remain but that this vice should produce some advantage to the publick in return for the innumerable evil which arise from it and that the government should snatch the first opportunity of tax that vice which can not be reform this duty arise indeed from a concurrence of different cause of just design in the government and of bad inclination in the people the tax be just and well mean but it can be make sufficient to support the expense to which it be appropriate only by the resolution of the populace to continue in some degree they usual luxury i be far my lord from think this method of raise money eligible for its own sake or justifiable by any other plea than that of necessity if it be possible at once to extinguish the thirst of spirit no man who have any regard for virtue or for happiness would propose to augment the revenue by a tax upon they but my lord rigor have be already try and find to be vain it have be find equally fruitless to forbid the people to use spirit as to forbid a man in a dropsy to drink the force of appetite long indulge and by indulgence make superior to the control of reason be not to be overcome at once it can not be subdue by a single effort but may be weaken new habit of a more innocent kind may in time be superinduce and one desire may counterbalance another we must endeavor my lord by just degree to withdraw they affection from this pernicious enjoyment by make the attainment of it every year somewhat more difficult : but we must not quicken they wish and exasperate they resentment by deprive they at once of they whole felicity by this method my lord i doubt not but we shall obtain what we have hitherto endeavor with so little success and i believe that though in open defiance of a severe law spirit be now sell in every street of this city a gentle restraint will in a short time divert the mind of the people to other entertainment and the vice of drinking spirit will be forget among we lord hervey then rise up again and speak to the effect follow : -- my lord though i have always consider this bill as at once wicked and absurd i imagine till now that the projector of it would have be able to have argue at least speciously though not solidly in defense of it nor do i imagine it to have be wholly indefensible till i discover how little the extensive knowledge the long experience and the penetrate foresight of the noble lord who speak last enable he to produce in vindication of it he lordship 's argument be reducible to this single assertion that the drinking distil liquor can not be prevent and from thence he draw this inference that since it be a point of wisdom to turn misfortune to advantage we ought to contrive method by which the debauchery of the people may enrich the government though we should suppose the assertion true in any sense below that of absolute physical impossibility the inference be by no means just since it be the duty of governor to struggle against vice and promote virtue with incessant assiduity notwithstanding the difficulty that may for a time hinder the wisest and most rigorous measure from success that governor who desist from he endeavor of reformation because they have be once baffle in reality abandon he station and desert he charge nor deserve any other character than that of laziness negligence or cowardice the preservation of virtue where it subsist and the recovery of it where it be lose be the only valuable purpose of government law which do not promote these end be useless and those that obviate they be pernicious the government that take advantage of wicked inclination by accident predominant in the people and for any temporary convenience instead of lead they back to virtue plunge they deeper into vice be no longer a sacred institution because it be no longer a benefit to society it be from that time a system of wickedness in which bad end be promote by bad means and one crime operate in subordination to another but my lord it be not necessary to show the unreasonableness of the inference because the assertion from which it be deduce can not be prove that the excessive use of distilled liquor can not be prevent be a very daring paradox not only contrary to the experience of all past time but of the present for the law which be now to be repeal do in a great degree produce the effect desire from it till the execution of it be suspend not by the inability of the magistrate or obstinacy of the people but by the artifice of minister who promote the sale of spirit secretly for the same reason which incite we present more daring politician to establish the use of they by a law the defect of this law for that it be defective can not be deny be in the manner of levy the duty for have half the duty that be demand from the unlicensed retailer be require from the distiller there have be no need of information nor have we be stun with the dismal account of the rage and cruelty of the people or the violent death of those who endeavor to grow rich by commence prosecution the duty have be regularly pay the liquor have be make too dear for common use and the name of spirit have be in a short time forget amongst we from this defect my lord arise all the difficulty and inconveniency that have impede the execution of the law and prevent the effect that be expect from it and by one amendment they might be all remove but instead of endeavor to improve the efficacy of the remedy which be before propose for this universal malady we be now tell that it be too forcible to take effect and that it only fail by the vigor of its operation we be inform that the work of reformation ought not to be despatch with too much expedition that mankind can not possibly be make virtuous at once and that they must be draw off from they habit by just degree without the violence of a sudden change what degree the noble lord propose to recommend or what advantage he expect from allow the people a longer time to confirm they habit i be not able to discover he appear to I rather to propose a experiment than a law and rather to intend the improvement of policy than the safety of the people this experiment be indeed of a very daring kind in which not only the money but the life of the people be hazard : they money have indeed in all age be subject to the caprice of statesman but they life ought to be exempt from such dangerous practice because when once lose they can never be recover by this bill however it be contrived to lay poison in the way of the people poison which we know will be eagerly devour by a fourth part of the nation and will prove fatal to a great number of those that taste it nor of this project be any defense make but that since the people love to swallow poison it may be of advantage to the government to sell it it might not be improper my lord to publish to the people by a formal proclamation the benevolent intention of they governor and inform they that licensed murderer be to be appoint at whose shop they may infallibly be destroy without any danger of legal censure provide they take care to use the poison prescribe by the government and increase by they death the publick revenue that money only be desire from this bill be not only obvious from the first perusal of it but confess even by those who defend it but not one have continue to assert that it will produce a reformation of manners or recommend it otherwise than as a experiment for this reason my lord i still think my motion for postpone the bill very reasonable nor do i make any scruple to confess that i propose by postpone only a more gentle and inoffensive method of drop it that some other way of raise the supplies may be attempt or that the duty may be raise to three shilling a gallon the lowest tax that can be lay with a design of reformation this method my lord or any other by which another bill may be procure should be pursue for whatever scheme the common may substitute the nation can suffer nothing by the change they can not raise money in any other manner but with less injury to the publick since the greatest calamity which wrong measure can possibly produce be the propagation of wickedness and the establishment of debauchery lord bath then speak in substance as follow : -- my lord that this bill be with great propriety call a experiment i be ready to allow but do not think the justness of that expression any forcible argument against it because i know not any law that can be propose for the same end without equally deserving the same appellation all the scheme of government my lord have be perfect by slow degree and the defect of every regulation supply by the wisdom of successive generation no man have yet be find whose discernment however penetrate have enable he to discover all the consequence of a new law nor to perceive all the fallacy that it include or all the inconveniency that it may produce the first essay of a new regulation be therefore only a experiment make in some degree at random and to be rectify by subsequent observation in make which the most prudent conduct be only to take care that it may produce no ill consequence of great importance before there may be a opportunity of review it this maxim my lord be in my opinion strictly regard in the present attempt which in itself be a affair of very great perplexity the health and virtue of the people be to be regard on one part and the continuance of a very gainful and extensive manufacture on the other a manufacture by which only or chiefly the produce of we own nation be employ and on which therefore the value of land must very much depend manufacture of this kind my lord ought never to be violently or suddenly suppress if they be pernicious to the nation in general they be at least useful to a very great part and to some who have no other employment necessary and in the design of put a stop to any detrimental trade care be always to be take that the inconvenience exceed not the benefit and time be allow for those that be engage in it to withdraw to some other business and for the commodity that be consume by it to be introduce at some other market or direct to some other use these caution be in this bill very judiciously observe the trade which all allow to administer supplies to debauchery and fuel to disease will by the provision in this bill sink away by degree and the health and virtue of the people will be preserve or restore without murmur or commotion we must consider likewise my lord the necessity of raise supplies and the success with which they have hitherto be raise upon the scheme which be now under you consideration in examine the necessity of procure supplies i shall not expatiate upon the present danger of the liberty of all this part of the world upon the distress of the house of austrium the necessity of preserve the balance of power or the apparent design of the ancient and incessant disturber of mankind topick which have be on former occasion sufficiently explain it be now only necessary to observe that the state of we affair require expedition and that a happy peace can only be expect from a successful war and that war can only be make successful by vigor and despatch if by liberal grant of money and ready concurrence in all necessary measure we enable he majesty to raise a powerful army there be no reason to doubt that a single campaign may procure peace that it may establish the liberty of europe and raise we ally who be so lately distressed to they former greatness these supplies my lord which be so evidently necessary may by the method now propose be easily speedily and cheaply raise upon the security which this act will afford large sum be already offer to the government at the low interest of three for a hundred by those who if the condition of the loan be change will perhaps demand four in a few day or raise money by a combination to the rate of five or six for a hundred of which i would not remark how much it will embarrass the publick measure or how much it will encourage we enemy to a obstinate resistance such my lord be the inconveniency to be fear from reject this bill or from postpone it by which be plainly intend only a more gentle and tender manner of reject it by hint to the common you disapprobation of it and the necessity of send up another which you can not do without hazard the peace of the nation and the fate of the war the common who be not oblige to inquire what reception they bill find here may perhaps not immediately prepare another but suffer time to elapse till necessity shall oblige we to comply with those measure which we can not approve they may likewise by a kind of senatorial craft elude all we precaution and make the rejection of the bill ineffectual as be once do when a bill for a tax upon leather be reject : the common determine not to be direct in the method of raise money send up the same bill with only a small alteration of the title to lay a duty upon tan hide which the lord be for want of time oblige to pass but my lord should the other house discover in this single instance any uncommon degree of flexibility and complaisance should they patiently endure the rejection of the bill admit the validity of the reason upon which you lordship have proceed and willingly engage in draw up a new scheme for raise supplies even upon this supposition which be more favourable than can reasonably be form the business of the year will be very much perplexed and the new bill hurry into a law without sufficient caution or deliberation the session be now my lord so far advance that many of the common have retire into the country whose advice and assistance may be necessary in the projection of a new money bill so that the new bill must be form in a short time and by a thin house and indeed the multiplicity of consideration necessary to another bill of this kind be such that i can not think it prudent to advise or undertake it the committee on way and mean must strike out another scheme for a considerable impost which in the present state of the nation be in itself no easy task this scheme must be so adjust as to be consistent with all the other tax which will require long consultation and accurate inquiry it must then struggle perhaps through a obstinate and artful opposition before it can pass through the form of the other house and when it come before you lordship may be again oppose with no less zeal than the bill before we and perhaps likewise with equal reason all these danger and difficulty will be avoid by try for a single year the experiment which be now propose and which if that should fail may be better adjust in the time of leisure which the beginning of the next session will undoubtedly afford before which time i be afraid no amendment can possibly be make it have be propose indeed by the noble lord that three shilling should be lay upon every gallon of distilled liquor which would undoubtedly lessen the consumption but would at the same time destroy the trade a trade from which large profit may be in time gain since we distiller have now acquire such skill that the most delicate palate can not distinguish they liquor from those which foreigner import if the duty be raise to the height propose it must be allow to be repay for all that shall be export otherwise foreign nation will deprive we of this part of we trade and it have be already show that by mock exportation the duty may be frequently evade thus my lord there will be difficulty on either hand if a duty so high be pay the manufacturer will be ruin if it be evade the consumption will be lessen one inconvenience will easily be discover to be the necessary consequence of any considerable advance of the price we may be certain that a act of the senate will not moderate the passion or alter the appetite of the people and that they will not be less desirous of they usual gratification because they be deny they the poor may indeed yield to necessity unless they find themselves able to resist the law or to evade it but those who can afford to please they taste or exalt they spirit at a greater expense will still riot as before but with this difference that they excess will produce no advantage to the publick if a additional duty of three shilling be lay upon every gallon of distilled liquor the product of we own distillery will be dearer than those liquor which be import from foreign part and therefore it can not but be expect that the money which now circulate amongst we will in a short time be clandestinely carry into other country such my lord will be the effect of those tax which be so strongly recommend and therefore they ought not to be impose till all other method of proceed have be find ineffectual it be possible indeed that the regulation specify in this bill may not produce any beneficial effect and that the present practice of debauchery may still continue among the people but it be likewise possible that this tax may by increase the price augment the revenue at the same time that it lessen the consumption this proposal have by some lord be treat as a paradox but they certainly suspect it of falsehood only for want of patience to form the calculation necessary in such disquisition the tax of the last year amount to one hundred and seventy thousand pound this tax be now double so that the same quantity will produce three hundred and forty thousand but if one third less should be consume the present tax will amount to no more than two hundred and twenty thousand pound and when fifty thousand licens be add the revenue will gain a hundred thousand pound though one third part of the consumption should be hinder but my lord suppose no part of the consumption hinder i can not think that bill should be reject which in a time of danger like the present shall add to the publick revenue a annual income of more than two hundred thousand pound without lessen any manufacture without burden any useful or virtuous part of the nation and without give the least occasion to any murmur among the people it be to be remembered my lord that whatever corruption shall prevail amongst we it can not be imputed to this bill which do not make but find the nation vitiate and only turn they vice to publick advantage so that if it produce any diminution of the sale of spirit it be indisputably to be applaud as promote virtue if the sale of spirit still continue the same it will deserve some degree of commendation as it will at least not contribute to the increase of vice and as it will augment the revenue without injure the people for how my lord can we be censure for only suffer the nation to continue in its former state lord talbot then speak in substance as follow : -- my lord if we consider the tendency of the argument use by the noble lord the only argument on which he appear to lay any stress it will prove if it prove any thing what can not be admit by you lordship without bidding farewell to independency and acknowledge that you be only the substitute of a higher power it appear by the tenor of he reasoning that he consider this house as only oblige in question relate to supplies to ratify the determination of the other to submit implicitly to they dictate and receive they sovereign command without daring either to refuse compliance or delay it if we conjoin the reasoning of the noble lord who speak last with that of one who speak before in favor of the bill we shall be able to discover the full extent of we power on these occasion the first be please to inform we that though we be at liberty to examine the paragraph of this bill we have no right at least no power to amend they because in money bill the common leave we no other choice than that of pass or reject they this my lord might have be think a sufficient contraction of those privilege which you ancestor transmit to you and the common need to have desire no farther concession from this assembly since this be a publick confession of a subordinate state and admit either that part of we ancient rights have be give up or that we be at present too much depressed to dare to assert they we might however still comfort ourselves with the peaceful and uncontested possession of the alternative we might still believe that what we could not approve we might reject without irritate the formidable common but now my lord a new doctrine have be vent among we we be tell not only that we must not amend a money bill but that it will be to no purpose to reject it for that the other house will send it again without alter any thing but the title and force it upon we when there be no time for any other expedient if this my lord should be do i know not how the bill might at its second appearance be receive by other lord for my part i should vote immediately for reject it without any alleviate or mollify expedient i should reject it my lord even on the last day of the session without any regard to the pretended necessity of raise supplies and without suffer myself to be terrify into compliance by the danger of the house of austrium for though i think the balance of power on the continent necessary to be preserve at the hazard of a fleet or a army i can not think it of equal importance to we with the equipoise of we own government nor can i conceive it my duty to enslave myself to secure the freedom of another the danger therefore of disgust the common at this or any other juncture shall never influence I to a tame resignation of the privilege of we own house nor shall i willingly allow any force to argument which be intend only to operate upon we fear and therefore unless there shall appear some better plea in favor of this bill i shall think it my duty to oppose it the other plea be the difficulty or in the style of the noble lord who speak last the impossibility of raise supplies by any other method that it be not easy to raise supplies by any new tax in a nation where almost all the necessaries of life be load with impost must be readily allow but that it be impossible the folly of the people which be at least equal to they poverty will not suffer I to grant one other expedient at least have be already discover by the wonderful sagacity of we new minister a expedient which they can not indeed claim the honor of invent but which appear so conformable to the rest of they conduct and so agreeable to they principle that i doubt not but they will very often practice it if the continuance of they power be long enough to admit of a full display of they ability amidst they tenderness for we manufacture and they regard for commerce they have establish a lottery for eight hundred thousand pound by which they not only take advantage of a inclination too predominant a inclination to grow rich rather by a lucky hazard than successful industry but give up the people a prey to stockjobber usurer and broker of ticket who will plunder they without mercy by the encouragement of those by whom it might be hope that they would be protect from plunderer all lottery my lord be game which be not more honest or more useful for be legal and the objection which have be make to all other game and which have never yet be answer will be find equally valid when apply to they they engross that attention which might be employ in improve or extend we manufacture they swallow that money which might circulate in useful trade they give the idle and the diligent a equal prospect of riches and by confer unexpected wealth upon those who never deserve it and know not how to use it they promote extravagance and luxury insolence and dissoluteness but these consequence my lord and a thousand other equally important equally formidable may be object without effect against any scheme by which money will be raise money the only end at which we minister have aim for almost half a century money by which only they have preserve the favor of the court and the obedience of the senate money which have supply the place of wisdom at one time and of courage at another to gain money my lord they have injure trade by establish a lottery and they be now about to sacrifice the health and virtue of the people to the preservation of a trade by which money may be furnish to the government this my lord be they only design however they may act or whatever they may profess if they endeavor to protect either the trade or life of people it be only because they expect a continuance of tax from they and when more desperate measure be necessary for the same purpose they ruin they trade by one project and destroy they life by another lord lonsdale next speak to this effect : -- my lord it be not without the utmost grief and indignation that i find this house consider by some who have speak in vindication of this bill as oblige to comply with any proposal send up by the common for raise money however destructive to the publick or however contrary to the dictate of we conscience or conviction of we reason what be this my lord but once more to vote ourselves useless what but to be the first that shall destroy the constitution of the government and give up that liberty which we ancestor establish that this be really the design of any of the noble lord who have speak in vindication of the bill and have assert the necessity of pass it without any attempt to amend it i be very far from affirm but certainly my lord this and this only be the consequence of they position with whatever intention they may have advance they for how my lord can we call ourselves independent if we be to receive the command of the other house or with what propriety can we assume the title of legislator if we be to pass a bill like this without examination the bill now before we my lord be of the utmost importance to the happiness of that nation whose welfare we have hitherto be imagine to superintend in this bill be involve not only the trade and riches but the life and moral of the british people nor can we suffer it to pass unexamined without betray the nation to wickedness and destruction should we on this occasion suffer ourselves to be degrade from legislator to messenger from the common to the throne should we be content only to transmit the law which we ought to amend and resign ourselves up implicitly to the wisdom of those whom we have formerly consider as we inferior i know not for what purpose we sit here it would be my counsel that we should no longer attempt to preserve the appearance of power when we have lose the substance or submit to share the drudgery of government without partaking of the authority the time of such desperation be indeed not yet arrive but every act of servile compliance will bring it nearer and therefore my lord for the sake of ourselves as well as of the people i join the noble lord 's motion for resume the house that farther information may be obtain both by ourselves by the common and by the nation the duke of newcastle then rise and speak to the effect follow : -- my lord i believe no lord in this assembly be more zealous for the advantage of the publick than myself or more desirous to preserve the life or amend the moral of the people but i can not think that this character can justly imply any dislike of the bill now before we if i should admit what the noble lord have assert that the life and moral of the people be affect by this bill i can not yet see that he inference be just or that we compliance with the motion be therefore necessary that under the present regulation the misery of the nation be every day increase that corruption spread every day wider and debauchery make greater havock be confess on all side and therefore i can discover no reason for continue the law in they present state nor can think that we ought to decline any experiment by which that disorder which can not be increase may possibly be lessen it be confess by the noble lord who declare they approbation of the motion for postpone the consideration of this bill that they intend nothing less than a gentle and tacit manner of drop it by show the common that though to avoid offence they do not absolutely reject it yet they can not approve it and will not pass it and that therefore the necessity of raise supplies require that another bill should be form not liable to the same objection the consequence of this procedure my lord can only be that either the common will form another bill for raise money or that they will send up this again with a new title and such slight alteration as not the happiness of the nation but the form of the senate demand if in return for we endeavor to reform a bill of which they think themselves the only constitutional judge they should send it again with only another title what my lord shall we procure by the delay but a new occasion of murmur and discontent a new confirmation of the power of the common and a establishment of senatorial chicanery at once pernicious to the publick and ignominious to ourselves that the common in send back a bill that have be reject in this house with only a change in the title act contrary to the end of senatorial consultation though consistently with they external form can not be deny : but as each house be without any dependence on the other such deviation from the principle of we constitution however injurious to we authority or however detrimental to the nation can not be punish nor otherwise prevent than by caution and prudence if therefore the common as they have formerly do should return the bill without alteration we shall only have impaired we own authority and shake the foundation of we government by a fruitless opposition nor shall we gain any advantage though they should comply with we expectation and employ the little time that remain in contrive a new tax for corruption must then proceed without opposition the people must grow every day more vitious and debauchery will in a short time grow too general to be suppress with regard to the bill before we the only question that be necessary or proper be whether it will promote or hinder the consumption of distilled liquor for as to the effect of those liquor those that vindicate and that oppose this bill be of the same opinion and all will readily allow that if the law now propose shall be find to increase the consumption which it be intend to diminish it ought immediately to be repeal as destructive to the people and contrary to the end for which it be design but if the additional duty shall produce any degree of restraint if they shall hinder the consumption even of a very small part i think it must be allow that the provision be just and useful since it have already appear that this vice be too deeply root to be tear up at once and that therefore it be to be prune away by imperceptible diminution whether the provision now offer in the bill might not admit of improvement whether some other more efficacious expedient might not be discover and whether the duty might not be raise yet higher with more advantage to the publick may undoubtedly admit of long dispute and deep inquiry but for these inquiry and dispute my lord there be at present no time : the affair of the continent require we immediate interposition the general oppressor of the western world be now endeavor to extend they dominion and exalt they power beyond the possibility of future opposition and we ally who be straggle against they can no longer continue they effort without assistance at a time like this my lord it be not proper to delay the supplies by needless controversy or indeed by any dispute which may without great inconvenience be delay to a time of tranquillity a time when all we inquiry may be prosecute at leisure when every argument may be consider in its full extent and when the improvement of we law ought indeed to be we principal care at present it appear to I that every method of raise money without manifest injury to the moral of the people deserve we approbation and therefore that we ought to pass this bill though it should not much hinder the consumption of spirituous liquor if it shall barely appear that it will not increase it it be at least proper that at this press exigence those that oppose the bill by which supplies be to be raise should by offer other expedient show that they opposition proceed not from any private malevolence to the ministry or any prepossession against the publick measure but from a steady adherence to just principle and a impartial regard for the publick good for it may be suspect that he who only busy himself in pull down without any attempt to repair the breach that he have make with more fit or durable material have no real design of strengthen the fortification it have be propose indeed by one of the noble lord that a tax of three shilling a gallon should be lay upon all distil spirit and collect by the law of excise at the still-head which would doubtless secure a great part of the people from the temptation to which they be at present expose but would at the same time produce another effect not equally to be desire i have be inform my lord upon mention this proposal in conversation that such duty will raise the price of the liquor distil among we above that of foreign country and that therefore not only all we foreign trade of this kind would be immediately destroy but that many of those who now drink we own spirit only because they be cheaper will then purchase those of foreign country which be generally allow to be more pleasant that this be really the state of the affair i do not affirm for i now relate only what i have hear from other but surely the imposition of so heavy a duty require a long consideration nor can it be improper to mention any objection the discussion of which may contribute to we information but any other regulation than those now offer will require so many inquiry and so long consultation that the senate will expect to be dismiss from they attendance before any resolution be form and when once the supplies be provide we shall find ourselves oblige to leave the law relate to spirituous liquor in its present state then my lord will the enemy of the government imagine that they have a new opportunity of gratify they malignity by censure we as wholly negligent of the publick happiness and charge we with look without concern upon the debauchery the disease and the poverty of the people without any compassion of they want or care of they reformation that to continue the present law any longer will be only to amuse ourselves with ineffectual provision be universally allow nor be there any difference of opinion with regard to the present state of the vice which we be now endeavor to hinder the last law be well intend but be dictate by anger and ratify by zeal and therefore be too violent to be execute and instead of reform exasperate the nation no sooner therefore do the magistrate discover the inflexible resolution of the people they furious persecution of informer and they declare hatred of all those who concur in deprive they of this dangerous pleasure than they be induce by regard to they own safety to relax that severity which be enjoin and be contented to purchase safety by gratify or at least by not oppose those passion of the multitude which they could not hope to control the practice of drinking spirit continue and the consumption be every year greater than the former this my lord be the present state of the nation a state sufficiently deplorable and which all the law of humanity and justice command we to alter this be the universal declaration we all agree that the people grow every day more corrupt and that this corruption ought to be stop but by what mean be yet undecided violent method and extremity of rigor have be already try and totally defeat it be therefore propose to try more easy and gentle regulation that shall produce by slow degree the reformation which can not be effect by open force these new regulation appear to many lord not sufficiently coercive and be imagine still less likely to reform a vice so inveterate and so firmly establish these opinion i can not flatter myself with the hope of reconcile but must yet observe that the consumption of these liquor as of all other commodity can only be lessen by proper duty and that every additional imposition have a tendency to lessen they and since so far as it extend it can produce no ill effect deserve the approbation of those who sincerely desire to suppress this odious vice that have so much prevail and be so widely diffuse it be indeed possible that the duty now propose may be find not sufficient but for this defect there be a easy remedy the duty if it be find by the experience of a single year to be too small may in the next be easily augmented and swell by annual increase even to the height which be now propose if no remedy more easy can be find it may be object that this fund will be mortgage for the payment of the sum employ in the service of the war and that therefore the state of the duty can not afterwards be alter without injustice to the publick creditor and a manifest violation of the faith of the senate but my lord though in the hurry of provide for a press and important war the common could not find any other method so easy of raise money it can not be doubt but that when they consider the state of the nation at leisure they will easily redeem this tax if it shall appear inconvenient and substitute some other less injurious to the happiness of the publick it be not impossible for they to have do this in the beginning of this session nor can it be suppose that man so long verse in publick affair could not easily have propose many other impost but it may be imagine that they choose this out of many without suspect that it would be oppose and believe that they be at once raise supplies and protect the virtue of the people nor indeed my lord do it yet appear that they have be mistake for though the argument of the noble lord who oppose the bill be acute and plausible yet since they agree that the consumption of these liquor be at last to be hinder by raise they price it be reasonable to conceive that every augmentation of the price must produce a proportionate diminution of the consumption and that therefore this duty will contribute in some degree to the reformation of the people it seem at least in the highest degree probable that it can not increase the evil which it be intend to remedy and that therefore we may reasonably concur in it as it will furnish the government with supplies without any inconvenience to those that pay they the bishop of oxford next speak to this effect : -- my lord this subject have already be so acutely consider and so copiously discuss that i rise up in despair of propose any thing new of explain any argument more clearly or urge it more forcibly of start any other subject of consideration or point out any circumstance yet untouched in those that have be propose yet my lord though i can not hope to add any thing to the knowledge which you lordship have already obtain of the subject in debate i think it my duty to add one voice to the truth and to declare that in the balance of my understand the argument against the bill very much outweigh those that have be offer in its favor it be always presume by those who vindicate it that every augmentation of the price will necessarily produce a proportionate decrease of the consumption this my lord be the chief if not the only argument that have be advance except that which be draw from the necessity of raise supplies and the danger of disgust the other house but this argument my lord be evidently fallacious and therefore the bill if it pass must pass without a single reason except immediate convenience let we examine my lord this potent argument which have be successively urge by all who have endeavor to vindicate the bill and echo from one to another with all the confidence of irrefragability let we consider on what supposition it be found and we shall soon find how easily it will be dissipate it be suppose by this argument that every drinker of these liquor spend as much as he can possibly procure and that therefore the least additional price must place part of he pleasure beyond he reach this my lord can not be generally true it be perhaps generally if not universally false it can not be doubt but that many of those who corrupt they mind and body with these pernicious draught be above the necessity of constrain they appetite to escape so small a expense as that which be now to be impose upon they and even of those whose poverty can sink no lower who be in reality exhaust by every day 's debauch it be at least as likely that they will insist upon more pay for they work or that they will steal with more rapacity as that they will suffer themselves to be debar from the pleasure of drunkenness it be not certain that this duty will make these liquor dearer to those who drink they since the distiller will more willingly deduct from he present profit the small tax that be now propose than suffer the trade to sink and even if that tax should be as be usual levy upon the retailer it have be already observe that in the quantity necessary to drunkenness it will not be perceptible but my lord though this argument appear thus weak upon the first and slightest consideration the chief fallacy be still behind those who have already initiate themselves in debauchery deserve not the chief consideration of this assembly they be for the greatest part hopeless and abandon and can only be withhold by force from comply with those desire to which they be habitually enslave they may indeed be sometimes punish and at other time restrained but can not often be reform those my lord who be yet uncorrupted ought first to engage we care virtue be easily preserved but difficultly regain but for those what regard have hitherto be show what effect can be expect from this bill but that of expose they to temptation by place unlawful pleasure in they view pleasure which however unworthy of human nature be seldom forsake after they have once be taste in the consideration of the present question it be to be remember that multitude be already corrupt and the contagion grow more dangerous in proportion as greater number be infect to stop the progress of this pestilence my lord ought to be the govern passion of we mind to this point ought all we aim to be direct and for this end ought all we project to be calculate but how my lord be this purpose promote by a law which give a license a unlimited and cheap license for the sale of that liquor to which even those who support the bill impute the present corruption of the people this surely be no rational scheme of reformation nor can it be imagine that a favorite and inveterate vice be to be extirpate by such gentle method let we consider my lord more nearly the effect of this new-invented regulation and we shall see how we may expect from they the recovery of publick virtue a law be now to be repeal by which the use of distilled liquor be prohibit but which have not be for some time put in execution or not with vigor sufficient to surmount the difficulty and inconveniency by which its operation be obstruct the law be however yet in force and whoever sell spirit must now sell they at the hazard of prosecution and penalty and with a implicit confidence in the kindness and fidelity of the purchaser it can not be suppose my lord but that a law like this must have some effect it can not be doubt that some be honest and other timorous and that among the wretch who be most to be suspect of this kind of debauchery there be some in whom it be not safe to confide they therefore must sometimes be hinder from destroy they reason by other restraint than want of money and when they be trust with the secret of a illegal trade must pay a dearer rate for the danger that be incur but when this law be repeal and every street and alley have a shop license to distribute this delicious poison what can we expect the most sanguine advocate for the bill can not surely hope that any of those who now drink spirit will refrain from they only because they be sell without danger and though what can not be prove or even hope should be admit that some must content themselves with a smaller quantity on account of the advanced price yet while they take all opportunity of debauchery while they spend in this destructive liquor all that either honest labor or daring theft will supply they must always be example of intemperance such example as from the experience of late year we have reason to believe will find many imitator and therefore will promote at once the consumption of spirit and the corruption of the people there be always to be find in wickedness a detestable ambition of gain proselyte : every man who have suffer himself to be corrupt be desirous to hide himself from infamy in crowd as vitious as himself or desire companion in wickedness from the same natural inclination to society which prompt almost every man to avoid singularity on other occasion whatever be the reason it may be every day observe that the great pleasure of the vitious be to vitiate other nor be it possible to squander a hour in the assembly of debauchee of any rank without observe with what importunity innocence be attack and how many art of sophistry and ridicule be use to weaken the influence of virtue and suppress the struggle of conscience the fatal art by which virtue be most commonly overborne be the frequent repetition of temptation which though often reject will at some unhappy moment generally prevail and therefore ought to be remove but which this bill be intend to place always in sight to what purpose will it be my lord to deprive nine hardened profligate of a tenth part of the liquor which they now drink which be the utmost that this duty will effect if they have a opportunity of corrupt one by they solicitation and example the difference between nine and ten act of debauchery be of very small importance to mankind or even to the person who be thus restrain since they forbearance of the utmost excess be only the effect of they poverty not of they virtue how far be such restraint from be equivalent to the corruption of one mind yet pure and undebauched to the seduction of one heart from virtue and a new addition to the interest and prevalence of wickedness if it be necessary that the supplies should be raise for the government by the use of this pernicious liquor it be desirable that it should be confine to few and that it should rather be swallow in large quantity by hopeless drunkard than offer everywhere to the taste of innocence and youth in licensed house of wickedness the consumption will for a time be the same in both case but with this important difference that wickedness would only be continue not promote and as the poison would rid the land by degree of the present race of profligate it might be hope that we posterity would be uninfected but under the present scheme of regulation my lord vice will be propagate under the countenance of the legislature and that kind of wickedness by which the nation be so infatuate that it have increase yearly in opposition to a penal law will now not only be suffer but encourage and enjoy not impunity only but protection thus if we pass the bill we shall not even be able to boast the petty merit of leave the nation in its present state we shall take away the present restraint of vice without substitute any in they place we shall perhaps deprive a few hardened drunkard of a small part of the liquor which they now swallow but shall open accord to the expectation of the noble lord fifty thousand house of licensed debauchery for the ruin of million yet untainted to leave the nation in its present state which be allow on all hand to be a state of corruption seem to be the utmost ambition of one of the noble lord who have plead with the greatest warmth for this bill for he conclude with a air of triumph by ask how we can be censure for only suffer the nation to continue in its former state we may be in my opinion my lord censure as traitor to we trust and enemy to we country if we permit any vice to prevail when it be in we power to suppress it we may be curse with justice by posterity as the abettor of that debauchery by which poverty and disease shall be entail upon they contemn in the present as the flatterer of those appetite which we ought to regulate and insult by that populace whom we dare not oppose have none of we predecessor endeavor the reformation of the people have they contented themselves always to leave the nation as they find it there have be long ago a end of all the order and security of society for the natural depravity of human nature have always a tendency from less to greater evil and the same cause which have make we thus wicked will if not obviate make we worse since the noble lord think it not necessary to attempt the reformation of the people he might have spare the elaborate calculation by which he have prove that a large sum wilt be gain by the government though one third part of the consumption be prevent for it be of very little importance to discuss the consequence of a event which will never happen he should first have prove that a third part of the consumption will in reality be prevent and then he might very properly have console the ministry by show how much they would gain from the residue that this bill as it now stand will produce a large revenue to the government but no reformation in the people be assert by those that oppose and undoubtedly believe by those that defend it but as this be not the purpose which i be most desirous of promote i can not but think it my duty to agree to the proposal of the noble lord that by postpone the consideration of the bill more exact information may be obtain by we and the common may be alarm at the danger into which the nation have be bring by they precipitation lord bath then rise again and speak to the following effect : -- my lord as the noble lord who have just speak appear to have misapprehend some of my assertion i think it necessary to rise again that i may explain with sufficient clearness what perhaps i before express obscurely amidst the number of different consideration that crowd my imagination with regard to the diminution that might be expect from this law i do not absolutely assert at least i do not intend to assert that a third part would be take off but only advance that supposition as the basis of a calculation by which i might prove what many lord appear to doubt that the consumption might possibly be diminish and yet the revenue increase upon this supposition which must be allow to be reasonable both the purpose of the bill will be answer and the publick supplies will be raise by the suppression of vice the diminution of the consumption may be greater or less than i have suppose if it be greater the revenue will be indeed less augmented but the purpose which in the opinion of the noble lord who oppose the bill be more to be regard will be better promote and all they argument against it will be at least defeat nor will the ministry i hope regret the failure of a tax which be deficient only by the sobriety of the nation if the diminution be less than i have suppose yet if there be any diminution it can not be say that the bill have be wholly without effect or that the ministry have not proceed either with more judgment or better fortune than they predecessor or that they have not at least take advantage of the error that have be commit it must be own that they have either reform the nation or at least point out the way by which the reformation that have be so long desire may be effect that this tax will in some degree hinder drunkenness it be reasonable to expect because it can only be hinder by tax the liquor which be use in excess but there yet remain concern the weight of the tax that ought to be lay upon they doubt which nothing but experience can i believe remove by experience my lord we have be already teach that tax may be so heavy as to be without effect that restraint may be so violent as to produce impatience and therefore it be proper in the next essay to proceed by slow degree and gentle method and produce that effect imperceptibly which we find ourselves unable to accomplish at once i can not therefore think that the duty of three shilling a gallon can be impose without defeat we own design and compelling the people to find out some method of elude the law like that which be practice after the act by which in the second year of he present majesty five shilling be impose upon every gallon of compound water after which it be well know that the distiller sell a simple spirit under the contemptuous title of _ senatorial brandy _ and the law be universally evade be soon after repeal as useless such my lord or worse will be the consequence of the tax which the noble lord have propose for if it can not be evade spirit will be bring from nation that have be wiser than to burden they own commodity with such insupportable impost and the empire will soon be impoverish by the exportation of its money lord hervey answer in substance as follow : -- my lord i be very far from think the argument of the noble lord such as can influence man desirous to promote the real and durable happiness of they country for he be solicitous only about the prosperity of the british manufacture and the preservation of the british trade but have show very little regard to british virtue that part of he argument be therefore not necessary to be answer if the suggestion upon which it be found be true since it will be sufficient to compare the advantage of the two scheme and with regard to he insinuation that senatorial brandy may be revive by a high duty i believe first that no such evasion can be contrived and in the next place be confident that it may be defeat by burden the new-invented liquor whatever it be if it be equally pernicious with a equal tax the path of we duty my lord be plain and easy and only represent difficult by those who be incline to deviate from it lord bathurst speak next to the effect follow : -- my lord whatever measure may be practice by the people for elude the purpose of the bill now before we with whatever industry they may invent new kind of senatorial brandy or by whatever artifice they may escape the diligence of the officer employ to collect a duty levy upon they vice and they pleasure there be at least no danger that they will purchase from the continent those liquor which we be endeavor to withhold from they or that this bill will impoverish we country by promote a trade contrary to its interest what would be the consequence of the duty of three shilling a gallon propose by the noble lord it be easy to judge what my lord can be expect from it but that it will either oblige or encourage the vender of spirit to procure from other place what they can no longer buy for reasonable price at home and that those drunkard who can not or will not suddenly change they custom will purchase from abroad the pleasure which we withhold from they and the wealth of the nation be daily diminish but the virtue little increase thus my lord shall we at once destroy we own manufacture and promote that of we neighbor thus shall we enrich other government by distressing we own and instead of increase sobriety only encourage a more expensive and pernicious kind of debauchery in the bill now under we consideration a middle way be propose by which reformation may be introduce by those gradation which have always be find necessary when inveterate vice be to be encounter in this bill every necessary consideration appear to have be regard the health of the people will be preserve and they virtue recover without destroy they trade or starve they manufacturer the efficacy of this bill seem indeed to be allow by some of the lord who oppose it since they chief objection have arise from they doubt whether it can be execute if a law be useless in itself it be of no importance whether it be execute or not and therefore i think it may safely be infer that they who be solicitous how it may be enforce be convince of its usefulness if this my lord be the chief objection now remain a little consideration will easily remove it for it be well know that the only obstruction of the former law be the danger of information but this law my lord be so contrived that it will promote the execution of itself for by set licens at so low a price they number will be multiply and every man who have take a license will think himself justified in inform against he that shall retail spirit without a legal right if therefore there should be as a noble lord have very reasonably suppose fifty thousand licensed vender of these liquor there will likewise be fifty thousand informer against unlawful trader and as the liquor may then always be have under sanction of the law the populace will not interest themselves in that process which can have no tendency to obstruct they pleasure thus my lord shall we by agree to this bill make a law that will be at once useful to the government and beneficial to the people which will be at once powerful in its effect and easy in its execution and therefore instead of attend any more to the wild and impracticable scheme of heavy tax rigorous punishment sudden reformation and violent restraint i hope we shall unanimously approve this method from which so much may be hope while nothing be hazard lord carteret then rise up and speak in substance as follow : -- my lord though the noble lord who have be please to incite we to a unanimous concurrence with himself and he associate of the ministry in pass this excellent and wonder-working bill this bill which be to lessen the consumption of spirit without lessen the quantity which be distil which be to restrain drunkard from drinking by set they favorite liquor always before they eye to conquer habit by continue they and correct vice by indulge it accord to the lowest reckoning for at least another year yet my lord such be my obstinacy or such my ignorance that i can not yet comply with he proposal nor can prevail with myself either to concur with measure so apparently opposite to the interest of the publick or to hear they vindicate without declare how little i approve they during the course of this long debate i have endeavor to recapitulate and digest the argument which have be advance and have consider they both separate and conjoin but find myself at the same distance from conviction as when i enter the house nor do i imagine that they can much affect any man who do not voluntarily assist they by strong prejudice in vindication of this bill my lord we have be tell that the present law be ineffectual that we manufacture be not to be destroy or not this year that the security offer by the present bill have induce great number to subscribe to the new fund that it have be approve by the common and that if it be find ineffectual it may be amend another session all these argument my lord i shall endeavor to examine because i be always desirous of gratify those great man to whom the administration of affair be intrust and have always very cautiously avoid the odium of disaffection which they will undoubtedly throw in imitation of they predecessor upon all those whose wayward conscience shall oblige they to hinder the execution of they scheme with a very strong desire therefore though with no great hope of find they in the right i venture to begin my inquiry and engage in the examination of they first assertion that the present law against the abuse of strong liquor be without effect i hope my lord it portend well to my inquiry that the first position which i have to examine be true nor can i forbear to congratulate you lordship upon have hear from the new ministry one assertion not to be contradict it be evident my lord from daily observation and demonstrable from the papers upon the table that every year since the enaction of the last law that vice have increase which it be intend to repress and that no time have be so favourable to the retailer of spirit as that which have pass since they be prohibit it may therefore be expect my lord that have agree with the minister in they fundamental proposition i shall concur with they in the consequence which they draw from it and have allow that the present law be ineffectual should admit that another be necessary but my lord in order to discover whether this consequence be necessary it must first be inquire why the present law be of no force for my lord it will be find upon reflection that there be certain degree of corruption that may hinder the effect of the best law the magistrate may be vitious and forbear to enforce that law by which themselves be condemn they may be indolent and inclined rather to connive at wickedness by which they be not injure themselves than to repress it by a laborious exertion of they authority or they may be timorous and instead of awe the vitious may be awed by they in any of these case my lord the law be not to be condemn for its inefficacy since it only fail by the defect of those who be to direct its operation the best and most important law will contribute very little to the security or happiness of a people if no judge of integrity and spirit can be find amongst they even the most beneficial and useful bill that minister can possibly imagine a bill for lay on we estate a tax of the fifth part of they yearly value would be wholly without effect if collector could not be obtain i be therefore my lord yet doubtful whether the inefficacy of the law now subsist necessarily oblige we to provide another for those that declare it to be useless own at the same time that no man endeavor to enforce it so that perhaps its only defect may be that it will not execute itself nor though i should allow that the law be at present impede by difficulty which can not be break through but by man of more spirit and dignity than the minister may be incline to trust with commission of the peace yet it can only be collect that another law be necessary not that the law now propose will be of any advantage great use have be make of the inefficacy of the present law to decry the proposal make by the noble lord for lay a high duty upon these pernicious liquor high duty have already as we be inform be try without advantage high duty be at this hour impose upon those spirit which be retail yet we see they every day sell in the street without the payment of the tax required and therefore it will be folly to make a second essay of means which have be find by the experience of many year unsuccessful it have be grant on all side in this debate nor be it ever deny on any other occasion that the consumption of any commodity be most easily to be hinder by raise its price and its price be to be raise by the imposition of a duty this my lord which be i suppose the opinion of every man of whatever degree of experience or understanding appear likewise to have be think by the author of the present law and therefore they imagine that they have effectually provide against the increase of drunkenness by lay upon that liquor which should be retail in small quantity a duty which none of the inferior class of drunkard would be able to pay thus my lord they conceive that they have reform the common people without infringe the pleasure of other and applaud the happy contrivance by which spirit be to be make dear only to the poor while every man who could afford to purchase two gallon be at liberty to riot at he ease and over a full flow bumper look down with contempt upon he former companion now ruthlessly condemn to disconsolate sobriety or oblige to regale themselves with liquor which do no speedy execution upon they care but hold they for many tedious hour in a languish possession of they sens and they limb but my lord this intention be frustrated and the project ingenious as it be fall to the ground for though they have lay a tax they unhappily forget that this tax would make no addition to the price unless it be pay and that it would not be pay unless some be empower to collect it here my lord be the difficulty those who make the law be incline to lay a tax from which themselves should be exempt and therefore would not charge the liquor as it issue from the still and when once it be disperse in the hand of petty dealer it be no longer to be find without the assistance of informer and informer could not carry on the business of persecution without the consent of the people it be not necessary to dwell any longer upon the law of which the repeal be propose since it appear already that it fail only from a partiality not easily defend and from the omission of what be now propose the collection of the duty as the liquor be distil if this method be follow there will be no longer any need of information or of any rigorous or new measure the same officer that collect a smaller duty may levy a greater nor can they be easily deceive with regard to the quantity that be make the deceit at least that can be use be in use already they be frequently detect and suppress nor will a larger duty enable the distiller to elude the vigilance of the officer with more success against this proposal therefore the inefficacy of the present law can be no objection but it be urge that such duty would destroy the trade of distil and a noble lord have be please to express great tenderness for a manufacture so beneficial and extensive i can not but sometimes wonder my lord at the amazing variety of intellect which every day furnish some opportunity or other of observe and which can not but be remark on this occasion when one produce against a proposal the very argument which another offer in its favor that a large duty levy at the still would destroy or very much impair the trade of distil be certainly suppose by those who defend it for they propose it only for that end and what better method can they propose when they be call to deliberate upon a bill for the prevention of the excessive use of distilled liquor the noble lord have be pleased kindly to inform we that the trade of distil be very extensive that it employ great number and that they have arrive at exquisite skill and therefore -- note well the consequence -- the trade of distil be not to be discourage once more my lord allow I to wonder at the different conception of different understanding it appear to I that since the spirit which the distiller produce be allow to enfeeble the limb and vitiate the blood to pervert the heart and obscure the intellect that the number of distiller should be no argument in they favor for i never hear that a law against theft be repeal or delay because thief be numerous it appear to I my lord that if so formidable a body be confederate against the virtue or the life of they fellow-citizen it be time to put a end to the havock and to interpose while it be yet in we power to stop the destruction as little my lord be i affect with the merit of the wonderful skill which the distiller be say to have attain : it be in my opinion no faculty of great use to mankind to prepare palatable poison nor shall i ever contribute my interest for the reprieve of a murderer because he have by long practice obtain great dexterity in he trade if they liquor be so delicious that the people be tempt to they own destruction let we at length my lord secure they from these fatal draught by burst the vial that contain they let we crush at once these artist in slaughter who have reconcile they countryman to sickness and to ruin and spread over the pitfal of debauchery such bait as can not be resist the noble lord have indeed admit that this bill may not be find sufficiently coercive but give we hope that it may be improve and enforce another year and persuade we to endeavor the reformation of drunkenness by degree and above all to beware at present of hurt the _ manufacture _ i be very far my lord from think that there be this year any peculiar reason for tolerate murder nor can i conceive why the manufacture should be hold sacred now if it be to be destroy hereafter we be indeed desire to try how far this law will operate that we may be more able to proceed with due regard to this valuable manufacture with regard to the operation of the law it appear to I that it will only enrich the government without reform the people and i believe there be not many of a different opinion : if any diminution of the sale of spirit be expect from it it be to be consider that this diminution will or will not be such as be desire for the reformation of the people if it be sufficient the manufacture be at a end and all the reason against a higher duty be of equal force against this but if it be not sufficient we have at least omit part of we duty and have neglect the health and virtue of the people i can not my lord yet discover why a reprieve be desire for this manufacture why the present year be not equally propitious to the reformation of mankind as any will be that may succeed it it be true we be at war with two nation and perhaps with more but war may be better prosecute without money than without man and we but little consult the military glory of we country if we raise supplies for pay we army by the destruction of those army that we be contrive to pay we have hear the necessity of reform the nation by degree urge as a argument for impose first a lighter duty and afterwards a heavier this complaisance for wickedness my lord be not so defensible as that it should be batter by argument in form and therefore i shall only relate a reply make by webb the note walker upon a parallel occasion this man who must be remember by many of you lordship be remarkable for vigor both of mind and body and live wholly upon water for he drink and chiefly upon vegetable for he other sustenance : he be one day recommend he regimen to one of he friend who love wine and who perhaps might somewhat contribute to the prosperity of this _ spirituous manufacture _ and urge he with great earnestness to quit a course of luxury by which he health and he intellect would equally be destroy the gentleman appear convinced and tell he that he would conform to he counsel and think he could not change he course of life at once but would leave off strong liquor by degree by degree say the other with indignation if you should unhappily fall into the fire would you caution you servant not to pull you out but by degree this answer my lord be applicable in the present case the nation be sink into the lowest state of corruption the people be not only vitious but insolent beyond example they not only break the law but defy they and yet some of you lordship be for reform they by degree i be not easily persuade my lord that we minister really intend to supply the defect that may hereafter be discover in this bill it will doubtless produce money perhaps much more than they appear to expect from it i doubt not but the licensed retailer will be more than fifty thousand and the quantity retail must increase with the number of retailer as the bill will therefore answer all the end intend by it i do not expect to see it alter for i have never observe minister desirous of amend they own error unless they be such as produce a deficiency in the revenue besides my lord it be not certain that when this fund be mortgage to the publick creditor they can prevail upon the common to change the security they may continue the bill in force for the reason whatever they be for which they have pass it and the good intention of we minister however sincere may be defeat and drunkenness legal drunkenness establish in the nation this my lord be very reasonable and therefore we ought to exert ourselves for the safety of the nation while the power be yet in we own hand and without regard to the opinion or proceedings of the other house show that we be yet the chief guardian of the people and the most vigilant adversary of wickedness the ready compliance of the common with the measure propose in this bill have be mention here with a view i suppose of influence we but surely by those who have forget we independence or resign they own it be not only the right but the duty of either house to deliberate without regard to the determination of the other for how would the nation receive any benefit from the distinct power that compose the legislature unless they determination be without influence upon each other if either the example or authority of the common can divert we from follow we own conviction we be no longer part of the legislature we have give up we honor and we privilege and what then be we concurrence but slavery or we suffrage but a echo the only argument therefore that now remain be the expediency of gratify those by whose ready subscription the exigency which the counsel of we new statesman have bring upon we and of continue the security by which they have be encourage to such liberal contribution publick credit my lord be indeed of very great importance but publick credit can never be long support without publick virtue nor indeed if the government could mortgage the moral and health of the people would it be just or rational to confirm the bargain if the ministry can raise money only by the destruction of they fellow-subject they ought to abandon those scheme for which the money be necessary : for what calamity can be equal to unbounded wickedness but my lord there be no necessity for a choice which may cost we or we minister so much regret for the same subscription may be procure by a offer of the same advantage to a fund of any other kind and the sink fund will easily supply any deficiency that might be suspect in another scheme to confess the truth i should feel very little pain from a account that the nation be for some time determine to be less liberal of they contribution and that money be withhold till it be know in what expedition it be to be employ to what prince subsidy be to be pay and what advantage be to be purchase by it for we country i should rejoice my lord to hear that the lottery by which the deficiency of this duty be to be supply be not fill and that the people be grow at last wise enough to discern the fraud and to prefer honest commerce by which all may be gainer to a game by which the greatest number must certainly lose and in which no man can reasonably expect that he shall be the happy favorite of fortune on whom a prize shall be confer the lottery my lord which former minister have propose have always be censure by those that see they nature and they tendency they have be consider as legal cheat by which the ignorant and the rash be defraud and the subtle and avaricious often enriched they have be allow to divert the people from trade and to alienate they from useful industry a man who be uneasy in he circumstance and idle in he disposition collect the remains of he fortune and buy ticket in a lottery retire from business indulge himself in laziness and wait in some obscure place the event of he adventure another instead of employ he stock in a shop or warehouse rent a garret in a private street and make it he business by false intelligence and chimerical alarm to raise and sink the price of ticket alternately and take advantage of the lie which he have himself invent such my lord be the traffick that be produce by this scheme of raise money nor be these inconveniency unknown to the present minister in the time of they predecessor whom they never fail to pursue with the loudest clamor whenever the exigency of the government reduce they to a lottery if i my lord might presume to recommend to we minister the most probable method of raise a large sum for the payment of the troops of the electorate i should instead of the tax and lottery now propose advise they to establish a certain number of licensed wheelbarrow on which the laudable trade of thimble and button might be carry on for the support of the war and shoeboy might contribute to the defense of the house of austrium by raffle for apple have now my lord examine with the utmost candor all the reason which have be offer in defense of the bill i can not conceal the result of my inquiry the argument have have so little effect upon my understanding that as every man judge of other by himself i can not believe that they have any influence even upon those that offer they and therefore i be convince that this bill must be the result of consideration which have be hitherto conceal and be intend to promote design which be never to be discover by the author before they execution with regard to these motive and design however artfully conceal every lord in this assembly be yet at liberty to offer he conjecture and therefore i shall venture to lay before you what have arise in my mind without pretend to have discover absolute certainty what such accomplished politician have endeavor to conceal when i consider my lord the tendency of this bill i find it calculate only for the propagation of disease the suppression of industry and the destruction of mankind i find it the most fatal engine that ever be point at a people a engine by which those who be not kill will be disabled and those who preserve they limb will be deprive of they sens this bill therefore appear to be design only to thin the rank of mankind and to disburden the world of the multitude that inhabit it and be perhaps the strongest proof of political sagacity that we new minister have yet exhibit they well know my lord that they be universally detest and that wherever a briton be destroy they be free from a enemy they have therefore open the floodgate of gin upon the nation that when it be less numerous it may be more easily govern other minister my lord who have not attain to so great a knowledge in the art of make war upon they country when they find they enemy clamorous and bold use to awe they with prosecution and penalty or destroy they like burglar with prison and gibbet but every age my lord produce some improvement and every nation however degenerate give birth at some happy period of time to man of great and enterprising genius it be we fortune to be witness of a new discovery in politick we may congratulate ourselves upon be contemporary with those man who have show that hangman and halter be unnecessary in a state and that minister may escape the reproach of destroy they enemy by incite they to destroy themselves this new method may indeed have upon different constitution a different operation it may destroy the life of some and the sens of other but either of these effect will answer the purpose of the ministry to whom it be indifferent provide the nation become insensible whether pestilence or lunacy prevail among they either mad or dead the greatest part of the people must quickly be or there be no hope of the continuance of the present ministry for this purpose my lord what could have be invent more efficacious than a establishment of a certain number of shop at which poison may be vend poison so prepared as to please the palate while it waste the strength and to kill only by intoxication from the first instant that any of the enemy of the ministry shall grow clamorous and turbulent a crafty hireling may lead he to the ministerial slaughterhouse and ply he with they wonder-working liquor till he be no longer able to speak or think and my lord no man can be more agreeable to we minister than he that can neither speak nor think except those who speak without think but my lord the minister ought to reflect that though all the people of the present age be they enemy yet they have make no trial of the temper and inclination of posterity we successor may be of opinion very different from ours they may perhaps approve of war on the continent while we plantation be insult and we trade obstruct they may think the support of the house of austrium of more importance to we than we own defense and may perhaps so far differ from they father as to imagine the treasure of britain very properly employ in support the troops and increase the splendor of a foreign electorate since therefore it will not be deny by we minister that the affection and gratitude of posterity may atone for the obstinacy blindness and malice of the present age since those measure which be now universally censure may at some distant time be praise with equal unanimity why my lord should they extend they vengeance to the succeed generation why should they endeavor to torture they limb with pain and load they life with the guilt of they parent why should they hinder that trade to which they must owe all the comfort which plenty afford why should they endeavor to intercept they existence or suffer they to exist only to be wretched if i may once more declare my sentiment my lord i believe the minister do not so much wish to debilitate the body as the understanding of posterity nor so ardently desire a race of cripple as of fool for cripple my lord can make no figure at a review nor strut in a red coat with a tolerable grace but fool be know by long experience to be the principal support of a army since they be the only person who be willing to pay it whatever my lord be the true reason for which this bill be so warmly promote i think they ought at least to be deliberately examine and therefore can not think it consistent with we regard for the nation to suffer it to be precipitate into a law the year my lord be not so far advance as that supplies may not be raise by some other method if this should be reject nor do i think that we ought to consent to this even though we refusal should hinder the supplies since we have no right for the sake of any advantage however certain or great to violate all the law of heaven and earth to doom thousand to destruction and to fill the exchequer with the price of the life of we fellow-subject let we therefore my lord not suffer ourselves to be drive forward with such haste as may hinder we from observe whither we be go let we not be persuade to precipitate we counsel by those who know that all delay will be detrimental to they design because delay may produce new information and they be conscious that the bill will be less approve the more it be understand but every reason which they can offer against the motion be in my opinion a reason for it and therefore i shall readily agree to postpone the clause and no less readily to reject the bill if at last reason and evidence be vain if neither justice nor compassion can prevail but the nation must be destroy for the support of the government let we at least my lord confine we assertion in the preamble to truth let we not affirm that drunkenness be establish by the advice or consent of the lord spiritual since i be confident not one of they will so far contradict he own doctrine as to vote for a bill which give a sanction to one vice and minister opportunity and temptation to all other and which if it be not speedily repeal will overflow the whole nation with a deluge of wickedness lord islay next speak to the effect follow : -- my lord i have attend for a long time to the noble lord not without some degree of uneasiness as i think the manner in which he have treat the question neither consistent with the dignity of this assembly nor with those rule which ought to be ever venerable the great rule of reason and humanity yet be now arrive at a time of life in which the passion grow calm and patience easily prevail over any sudden disgust or perturbation i forbore to disconcert he though i have know interruption produce by much slighter provocation it be my lord in my opinion a just maxim that we deliberation can receive very little assistance from merriment and ridicule and that truth be seldom discover by those who be chiefly solicitous to start a jest to convince the understanding and to tickle the fancy be purpose very different and must be promote by different means nor be he always to imagine himself superior in the dispute who be applaud with the loudest laugh to laugh my lord and to endeavor to communicate the same mirth to other when great affair be to be consider be certainly to neglect the end for which we be assemble and the reason for which the privilege of debate be originally grant we for doubtless my lord we honor and we power be not confer upon we that we might be merry with the better grace or that we might meet at certain time to divert ourselves with turn the great affair of the nation to ridicule but my lord still less defensible be this practice when we be contrive the relief of misery or the reformation of vice when calamity be prey upon thousand and the happiness not only of the present age but of posterity must depend upon we resolution he that can divert himself with the sight of misery have surely very little claim to the great praise of humanity and tenderness nor can he be justly exempt from the censure of increase evil who waste in laughter and jocularity that time in which he might relieve they the bill now before we have be represent by those that oppose it as big with destruction and dangerous both to the life and to the virtue of the people we have be tell that it will at once fill the land with sickness and with villany and that it will be at the same time fatal to we trade and to we power yet those who be willing to be think fearful of all these evil and ardently desirous of avert they from they country can not without laughter mention the bill which they oppose or enumerate the consequence which they dread from it in any other language than that of irony and burlesque surely my lord such conduct give reason for question either they humanity or they sincerity for if they really fear such dreadful calamity how can they be at leisure for mirth and gaiety i how can they sport over the grave of million and indulge they vain ridicule when the ruin of they country be approach but without inquiry whether they who oppose the bill will grant they opposition hypocritical or they patriotism languid i shall lay my opinion of this new regulation before you lordship with equal freedom though with less luxuriance of imagination and less gaiety of language of this bill notwithstanding the acuteness with which it have be examine and the acrimony with which it have be censure i be not afraid to affirm that it be neither wicked nor absurd that all its part be consistent and that the effect to be expect from it be sobriety and health i can not find upon the closest examination either that it will defeat its own end or that the end propose by it be different from that which be profess the charge of encouraging vice and tolerate drunkenness with which the defender of this bill have be so liberally asperse may be in my opinion more justly retort upon those that oppose it who though they plead for the continuance of a law rigorous indeed and well intended own that it have by the experience of several year be find ineffectual what my lord can a drunkard or a profligate be suppose to wish but that the law may still remain in its present state that he may still be pursue in a track by which he know how to escape and oppose by restraint which he be able to break what can he desire but that the book of statute should lie useless and that no law should be make against he but such as can not be put in execution the defect of the present law be indeed very numerous nor ought it to be continue even though no other be to be substitute it seem to suppose the use of distilled liquor absolutely unlawful and therefore impose upon licens a duty so enormous that only three be take in the whole kingdom and the people be therefore oblige to obtain by illegal method what they could not persuade themselves wholly to forbear the method of detect offender be likewise such as give opportunity for villany to triumph over innocence and for perjury to grow rich with the plunder of the poor even charity itself might be punish by it and he that give a glass of spirit to a man faint under poverty or sickness or fatigue might be punish as a retailer of spirit without a license these defect which be not see when the law be make soon excite a dislike no man enforce the execution of it because every man know that on some occasion he might himself break it and they who suffer for the violation of it be often pity by those whose office oblige they to punish they thus the law after have be execute a few month with rigor be lay aside as impracticable and appear now to be tacitly repeal for it be apparently a empty form without effect if therefore the use of spirit be so destructive as be generally allow it be surely necessary that the legislature should at last repair the defect of the former law and the nation should not be vitiate and ruin without some endeavor for its preservation and in my opinion to lay a double duty upon these liquor be very rational and prudent a increase of the price must lessen the consumption to what degree the consumption will be diminish by this new duty i be not able to foretel but undoubtedly some diminution will be produce and the least diminution will afford we this comfort that the evil do not increase upon we and that this law be therefore better than that which we have repeal for this reason my lord i approve the present bill without inquire whether it be perfect it be sufficient for I in the present exigence that the nation will gain something by the change and the people will be draw nearer to sobriety temperance and industry thus my lord without pay any regard to the determination of the other house i think the bill sufficiently defensible by reason and policy nor can i conceal my opinion that those who oppose it be the real enemy of they country -lrb- the question whether the house should be now resume be then put and determine in the negative by 56 against 85 the other clause be then read and agree to the course of they proceedings then require that a day should be appoint for the third reading and lord sandwich therefore rise and speak to the following effect : -rrb- my lord as the importance of the bill now before we justly demand the maturest consideration it be not without unusual concern that i observe the absence of many lord for whose wisdom and experience i have the highest veneration and whom i esteem equally for they penetration and they integrity i should hope that all those who feel in they heart the love of they country and be conscious of ability to promote its happiness would assemble on this great occasion and that the collective wisdom of this house would be exert when the life and fortune and what be yet more worthy of regard the virtue of the people be involve in the question as there can be no avocation which can possibly withhold a wise man from counsel of such moment to he country to himself and to he posterity as there be no interest equivalent to the general happiness i can not suppose that either business or pleasure detain those who have not attend at the examination of this bill and therefore imagine that they be absent only because they have not be sufficiently inform of the importance of the question that be this day to be discuss it be therefore my lord necessary in my opinion that on the day of the third reading they be again summon to attend that the law which be allow to be only a experiment of which the event be absolutely uncertain may be examine with the utmost care that all its consequence may be know so far as human wisdom be able to discover and that we may at least be exempt from the imputation of be negligent of the welfare of we country and of be desirous of avoid information or inquiry lest they should retard we measure or contradict we assertion but since it be reasonable to believe my lord that many of those who might assist we in this difficult inquiry be now in the country it be necessary that we summons may have the effect which be desire to defer the reading for some time for to what purpose will it be to require they presence at a time at which we know it be impossible for they to comply with we order to direct what can not be do be surely in its own nature absurd and contemptible and on this occasion will expose not only we understanding but we honesty to doubt for it will be imagine that we be only endeavor to make false show of caution and accuracy and that we in reality desire to determine without the concurrence of those whose presence we publickly require i therefore move that the third reading of this bill may be delay five day and that immediate summons be issue for all lord to attend lord carteret speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord if it be the intention of the noble lord to debate once more the usefulness or expedience of this bill if they have any new argument to produce or be desirous of another opportunity to repeat those which have be already hear i hope they will not long withhold either from themselves or they opponent that satisfaction you lordship be so well acquaint with the state of the publick and know so well the danger of the liberty of the continent the power of the enemy whom we be to oppose the dreadful consequence of a unsuccessful opposition and the necessity of vigor and expedition to procure success that it can not be necessary to urge the impropriety of delay the bill from which the supplies be to be expect the convenience of defer this bill however plausibly represent by the noble lord who make the motion be overbalance by the necessity of consider it to-morrow necessity be a argument which 110 acuteness can overthrow and against which eloquence will be employ to little purpose i therefore my lord oppose the motion not that it be unreasonable in itself but because it can not be admit i recommend despatch on this occasion not because it be barely right but because it be absolutely necessary lord hervey then rise up and speak to the following effect : -- my lord it be always the last resource of minister to call those measure necessary which they can not show to be just and when they have try all the art of fallacy and illusion and find they all baffle to stand at bay because they can fly no longer look they opponent boldly in the face and stun they with the formidable sound of necessity but it be generally the fortune of minister to discover necessity much sooner than they whose eye be not sharpen by employment they frequently call that necessity on which no other man would bestow the title of expediency and that be seldom necessary to be do which other do not think necessary to be avoid at present my lord i see nothing necessary but what be equally necessary at all time that we do we duty to we country and discharge we trust without suffer ourselves to be terrify with imaginary danger or allure by imaginary benefit the war which be say to produce the necessity of this bill be in my opinion not necessary in itself : and if you lordship differ from I in that sentiment it must yet be allow that there be time sufficient to provide supplies by new method but my lord if the motion in which i concur be overrule on a pretence of necessity it will show a eager desire to hasten a bill which if refer to any twelve man not of either house of the senate they examination would terminate in this that they bring it in guilty of _ wilful murder _ lord cholmondeley speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord as there be no doubt but particular measure may be sometimes necessary i discover no reason that ought to hinder the mention of that necessity for surely where it can be assert with truth it be the most powerful of all argument and can not be wisely or honestly neglect in the present case my lord i can discover no impropriety in mention it for i suppose that noble lord do not intend to restrain it to the most rigorous sense he do not mean that there be the same necessity of read this bill to-morrow for the success of the war as of extinguish a fire for the preservation of a town but that the reason for despatch absolutely overbalance all the plea that could be offer for delay this necessity my lord i be not ashamed to assert after he nor can i think it consistent with common prudence in the present situation of we affair to defer the third reading beyond to-morrow for the supplies which this bill must produce be to be employ in attempt of the utmost importance and which can not fail without the ruin of a great part of mankind and a irreparable injury to this nation i can not therefore but confess my surprise at the vehemence with which this bill be oppose vehemence so turbulent and fierce that some lord have be transport beyond that decency which it be we duty and we interest to preserve in we deliberation nor have restrain themselves from expression which upon reflection i believe they will not think defensible from among which i can not but particularize the horrid and opprobrious term of murder the reverend prelate who have speak against the bill may be easily believe to be as zealous for virtue as those who have indulge themselves in this violence of language yet they have never charge those who defend the measure now propose with the guilt of murder but have decently deliver they own opinion without reproach those who differ from they for my part my lord as i can not think the motion for farther delay seasonable or proper or necessary to the discovery of truth or consistent with the welfare of the nation it be my resolution to vote against it the duke of bedford speak next in substance as follow : -- my lord the ardor with which the noble lord appear to resent the indignity offer to the bill show only that he himself approve it but not that it deserve the approbation of the house i think it of use notwithstanding the plausible plea of decency or politeness that every thing should in this house be call by its right name that we may not dispute for one thing and vote for another and since the bill will certainly destroy multitude if it promote the sale of distilled spirit and it have be prove that it will promote it i know not by what appellation to denominate its effect if that be deny I which have be already use -lrb- the speaker then put the question in form be it you lordship ' pleasure that the third reading of the bill be put off for five day it be resolve in the negative by 52 to 29 it be then order that the bill should be read the third time on the day follow and that the lord should be summon to attend on the next day the house accord to the order meet and another debate ensue which be begin by lord hervey who speak in substance as follow : -rrb- my lord the tendency of the bill which we be now to approve or reject be so apparently destructive to the end of government so apparently dangerous to publick happiness and so contrary to the institution of the most celebrated lawgiver and the policy of the most flourishing nation that i still continue to think it my duty to struggle against it almost every legislator of the world my lord from whatever original he derive he authority have exert it in the prohibition of such food as tend to injure the health and destroy the vigor of the people for whom he design he institution the great instructor of the jew who deliver he law by divine authority prohibit the use of swine 's flesh for no other cause so far as human reason be able to discover than that it corrupt the blood and produce loathsome disease and malady which descend to posterity and therefore in prohibit after this example the use of liquor which produce the same effect we shall follow the authority of the great governor of the universe the author of another religion a religion found indeed on superstition and credulity but which prevail over a very great part of the earth have lay he follower under restraint still more severe he have forbid they to dispel they care or exalt they pleasure with wine have banish from they banquet that useful opponent of troublesome reflection and doom all those who receive he law not to sobriety only but to abstinence the authority of this man my lord can not indeed be urge as unexceptionable and decisive but the reception of he imposture show at least that he be not unacquainted with human nature and that he know how to adapt he forgery to the nation among which he vent they nor can it be deny but the prohibition of wine be find generally useful since it obtain so ready a compliance all nation in the world my lord in every age of which there remain any historical account have agree in the necessity of lay restraint upon appetite and set bound to the wantonness of luxury every legislature have claim and practice the right of withhold those pleasure which the people have appear inclined to use to excess and prefer the safety of multitude whom liberty would destroy to the convenience of those who would have enjoy it within the limit of reason and of virtue the welfare of the publick my lord have always be allow the supreme law and when any governor sacrifice the general good either to private view or temporary convenience they deviate at once from integrity and policy they betray they trust and neglect they interest the prohibition of those commodity which be instrumental to vice be not only dictate by policy but nature nor do it indeed require much sagacity when the evil be know to find the proper remedy for even the indian who have not yet reduce the art of government to a science nor learn to make long harangue upon the different interest of foreign power the necessity of raise supplies or the importance and extent of manufacture have yet be able to discover that distilled spirit be pernicious to society and that the use of they can only be hinder by prohibit the sale for this reason my lord they have petition that none of this delicious poison should be import from britain they have desire we to confine this fountain of wickedness and misery to stream in we own country without pour upon they those inundation of debauchery by which we be ourselves overflow when we may be send with justice to learn from the rude and ignorant indian the first element of civil wisdom we have surely not much right to boast of we foresight and knowledge we must surely confess that we have hitherto value ourselves upon we art with very little reason since we have not learn how to preserve either wealth or virtue either peace or commerce the maxim of we politician my lord differ widely from those of the indian savage as they be the effect of longer consideration and reasoning form upon more extensive view what indian my lord would have contrived to hinder he countryman from drunkenness by place that liquor in they house which tempt they to excess or would have discover that prohibition only be the cause of boundless excess that to subdue the appetite nothing be necessary but to solicit it and that what be always offer would never be receive the indian in the simplicity of man unacquainted with european and british refinement imagine that to put a end to the use of any thing it be only necessary to take it away and conceive that they could not promote sobriety more effectually than by allow the people nothing with which they could be drunk but if we politician should send missionary to teach they the art of government they would quickly be show that if they would accomplish they design they must appoint every tenth man among they to distribute spirit to the nine and to drink they himself in what quantity they shall desire and that then the peace of they country will be no longer disturb by the quarrel of debauchery it be indeed not without amazement that i hear this bill seriously defend as a scheme for suppress drunkenness and find some lord who admit that fifty thousand house will be open for the publick sale of spirit assert that a less quantity of spirit will be sell the foundation of this opinion be in itself very uncertain for nothing more be urge but that all who sell under the sanction of a license will be ready to inform against those by whom no license have be purchase and that therefore fifty thousand licensed retailer may hurt a greater number who now sell spirit in opposition to the law all this my lord be very far from certainty for it can not be prove that there be now so great a number of retailer as this act may produce : it be likely that security will encourage many to engage in this trade who be at present deter from it by danger it be possible that those who purchase licens may nevertheless forbear to prosecute those that sell spirit without the protection of the law they may forbear my lord from the common principle of humanity because they think those poor trader deserve rather pity than punishment they may forbear from a principle that operate more frequently and too often more strongly a regard to they own interest they may themselves offend the law by some other part of they conduct and may be unwilling to provoke a inspection into they own action by betray officiously the fault of they neighbor or they may be influence by immediate terror and expect to be hunt to death by the rage of the populace all these consideration may be urge against the only supposition that have be make with any show of reason in favor of the bill and of these various circumstance some one or other will almost always be find every man will have either fear or pity because almost every good man be incline to compassion and every wicked man be in danger from the law and i do not see any reason for imagine that the people will tolerate informer more willingly now than in the late year but suppose it should be grant though it can not be certain and have not yet be show to be probable that the clandestine trade will be interrupted i be not able to follow these ministerial reasoner immediately to the consequence which they draw from this concession and which must be draw from it if it be of any use in the decision of the question nor can see that the consumption of spirituous liquor will be make less let we examine my lord the premise and the consequence together without suffer we attention to be lead astray by useless digression spirit will be now sell only with license therefore less will be sell than when it be sell only by stealth surely my lord such argument will not much influence this assembly why my lord should less be buy now than formerly it be not deny that there will be in every place a licensed shop where drunkard may riot in security and what can be more invite to wretch who place in drunkenness they utmost felicity i if you should favourably suppose no more to be sell yet why should those who now buy any suppose quantity buy less when the restraint be take away if it be urge that the present law do in reality impose no restraint the intended act will make no alteration there be no real prohibition now there will be no nominal prohibition hereafter and therefore the law will only produce what its advocate expect from it a yearly addition to the revenue of the government but my lord let we at last inquire to what it be to be imputed that the present law swell the statute book to no purpose and why this pernicious trade be carry on with confidence and security in opposition to the law it will not surely be confess that the government have want authority to execute its own law that the legislature have be awed by the populace by the dregs of the populace the drunkard and the beggar yet when the provision make for the execution of a law so salutary so just and so necessary be find defective why be not other substitute of greater efficacy why when one informer be tear in piece be there not new security propose to protect those who should by the same offence displease the people afterwards the law my lord have fail of a great part of its effect but it have fail by cowardice on one part and negligence on another and though the duty as it be lay be in itself somewhat invidious it would however have be enforce could the revenue have gain as much by the punishment as be gain by the toleration of debauchery it have however some effect it may be imagine that no man can be trust where he be not know and that some man be know too well to be trust and therefore many must be occasionally hinder from drinking spirit while the law remain in its present state who when house be set open by license will never want a opportunity of comply with they appetite but may at any time enter confidently and call for poison and mingle with numerous assembly meet only to provoke each other to intemperance by a kind of brutal emulation and obstreperous merriment this bill therefore my lord be as it have be term only a experiment a experiment my lord of a very daring kind which none would hazard but empirical politician it be a experiment to discover how far the vice of the populace may be make useful to the government what tax may be raise upon poison and how much the court may be enrich by the destruction of the subject the tendency of this bill be so evident that those who appear as its advocate have rather endeavor to defeat they opponent by charge they proposal with absurdity than by extenuate the ill consequence of they own scheme they principal charge be that those who oppose the bill recommend a total prohibition of all spirit this assertion give they a opportunity of abandon they own cause to expatiate upon the innocent use of spirit of they efficacy in medicine and they convenience in domestick business and to advance a multitude of position which they know will not be deny but which may be at once make useless to they by assure they that no man desire to destroy the distillery for the pleasure of destroy it or intend any thing more than some provision which may hinder distilled spirit from be drunk by common people upon common occasion have thus obviate the only answer that have hitherto be make to the strong argument which have be offer against the bill i must declare that i have hear nothing else that deserve a answer or that can possibly make any impression in favor of the bill a bill my lord teem with sedition and idleness disease and robbery a bill that will enfeeble the body corrupt the mind and turn the city of this populous kingdom into prison for villain or hospital for cripple and which i think it therefore we duty to reject lord lonsdale next speak to the effect follow : -- my lord the bill on which we be now finally to determine be of such a tendency that it can not be make a law without a open and avowed disregard of all the rule which it have be hitherto think the general interest of human nature to preserve inviolable it be opposite at once to the precept of the wise and the practice of the good to the original principle of virtue and the established maxim of policy i shall however only consider it with relation to policy because the other consideration will naturally coincide for policy be only the connexion of prudence with goodness and direct only what virtue each particular occurrence require to be immediately practice the first principle of policy my lord teach we that the power and greatness of a state arise from the number of its people uninhabited dominion be a empty show and serve only to encumber the nation to which they belong they be a kind of pompous ornament which must be throw away in time of danger and equally unfit for resistance and retreat in the present war my lord if the number of we people be equal to that of the two nation against which we be engage the narrowness of we dominion would give we a resistless superiority as we have fewer post to defend we might send more force to attack we enemy who must be weak in every part because they must be disperse to a very great extent the torrent of war as a flood of water be only violent while it be confine but lose its force as it be more diffuse in consequence of this maxim my lord it be propose that because we be at war against two mighty power we shall endeavor to destroy by spirit at home those who can not fall by the sword of the enemy and that we endeavor to hinder the production of another generation for it be well know my lord and have in this debate be universally allow that the present practice of drinking spirit will not only destroy the present race but debilitate the next this surely my lord be a time at which we ought very studiously to watch over the preservation of those life which we be not compel to expose and endeavor to retrieve the loss of war by encourage industry temperance and sobriety another principle of government which the wisdom of we progenitor establish be to suppress vice with the utmost diligence for as vice must always produce misery to those whom it infect and danger to those who be consider as its enemy it be contrary to the end of government and the government which encourage vice be necessarily labor for its own destruction for the good will not support it because they be not benefit by it and the wicked will betray it because they be wicked how little then my lord do we sagacious politician understand they own interest by promote drunkenness and luxury of which the natural train of consequence be idleness necessity wickedness desperation sedition and anarchy how little do they understand what it be that give stability to the fabrick of we constitution if they imagine it can long stand when it be not support by virtue in consequence of these maxim another may be advance that all trade which tend to impair either the health or virtue of the people should be interdict for since the strength of the community consist in the number and happiness of the people no trade deserve to be cultivate which do not contribute to the one or the other for the end of trade as of all other human attempt be the attainment of happiness if any trade that conduce not to the happiness of the community by increase either the number or the virtue of the people be industriously cultivate the legislature ought to suppress it if any manufacture that administer temptation to wickedness be flourish and extensive it have already be too long indulge and the government can atone for its remissness only by rigorous inhibition severe prosecution and vigilant inquiry that the trade of distil my lord have advance so fast among we that we manufacturer of poison be arrive at the utmost degree of skill in they profession and that the draught which they prepare be greedily swallow by those who rarely look beyond the present moment or inquire what price must be pay for the present gratification that the people have be so long accustom to daily stupefaction that they be become mutinous if they be restrain from it and that the law which be intend to suppress they luxury can not without tumult and bloodshed be put in execution be in my opinion very affect consideration but they can surely be of no use for the defense of this bill the more extensive the trade of distil the more must swallow the poison which it afford the more palatable the liquor be make the more dangerous be the temptation and the more corrupt the people be become the more urgent be the necessity of extirpate those that have corrupt they i be not my lord less convinced of the importance of trade than those lord who have speak in the most pathetick language for the continuance of the manufacture but my regard for trade naturally determine I to vote against a bill by which idleness the pest of commerce must be encourage and those hand by which we trade be to be carry on must be first enfeebled and soon afterwards destroy nor be this kind of debauchery my lord less destructive to the interest of those whose riches consist in land than of those who be engage in commerce for it undoubtedly hinder the consumption of almost every thing that land can produce of that corn which should be make into bread and brew into more wholesome drink of that flesh which be feed for the market and even of that wool which should be work into cloth it have be often mention ludicrously but with too much truth that strong liquor be to the meaner people meat drink and clothes that they depend upon they alone for sustenance and warmth and that they desire to forget they want in drunkenness rather than supply they if we therefore examine this question with regard to trade we shall find that the money which be spend in drunkenness for the advantage only of one distiller would support if otherwise expend a great number of labourer husbandman and trader since one man employ at the still may supply with the means of debauchery such number as could not be furnish with innocent victuals and warm clothes but by the industry of many hand and the concurrence of many trade number my lord be necessary to success in commerce as in war if the manufacturer be few labor will be dear and the value of the commodity must always be proportion to the price of labor these my lord be the argument by which i have hitherto be incite to oppose this bill which i have not find that any of its defender can elude or repel for they content themselves with a cowardly concession to the multitude allow they to proceed in wickedness confess they have find themselves unable to oppose they sovereign pleasure or to withhold they from pursue they own inclination and therefore have sagaciously contrived a scheme by which they hope to gain some advantage from the vice which they can not reform but who my lord can without horror and indignation hear those who be entrust with the care of the publick contrive to take advantage of the ruin of they country let other my lord vote as they conscience will direct they i shall likewise follow the dictate of my heart and shall avoid any concurrence with a scheme which though it may for a time benefit the government must destroy the strength and virtue of the people and at once impair we trade and depopulate we country lord carteret then rise up and speak in substance as follow : -- my lord the warmth with which this debate have be hitherto carry on and with which the progress of this bill have be oppose be in my opinion to be imputed to strong prejudice form when the question be first propose by which the noble lord have be incite to warm declamation and violent invective who have once heat they mind with suspicion have not be able to consider the proposition before they with calmness and impartiality but have pursue they first notion and have employ they eloquence in display the absurdity of position never advance and the mischief of consequence which will never be produce it be first to be consider my lord that this bill be intend not to promote but to hinder the consumption of spirituous liquor it be therefore by no means necessary to expatiate upon that which be presuppose in the bill the pernicious quality of spirit the detestable nature of drunkenness the wickedness or misery which be produce by it almost all that have be urge by the noble lord who have speak with the greatest warmth against the bill may reasonably be conceive to have be advance for it by those who project it of whom it may be justly imagine that they be fully convinced how much spirit be abuse by the common people and how much that abuse contribute to the wickedness which at present prevail amongst we since they think it necessary to prevent they by a new law but my lord when they see that the abuse of distilled liquor be in a very high degree detrimental to the publick they see likewise that the trade of distil be of great use that it employ great number of we people and consume a great part of the produce of we land and that therefore it could not be suppress without injure the publick by reduce many family to sudden poverty and by deprive the farmer of a market for a great part of they corn in the plain of the western part of this island the grain that be chiefly cultivate be barley and that barley be chiefly consume by the distiller nor if they should be at once suppress could the husbandman readily sell the produce of he labor and he grounds or the landlord receive rent for he estate since it would then produce nothing or what be in effect the same nothing that could be sell it be indeed possible my lord that the dutch might buy it but then it must be consider that we must pay they money for the favor since we allow a premium upon exportation and that we shall buy it back again in spirit and consequently pay they for manufacture we own product for it be not to be imagine that any law will immediately reclaim the disposition or reform the appetite of the people they be well know to have drink spirit before they be make in we country and to indulge themselves at present in many kind of luxury which be yet load with a very high tax it be not therefore probable that upon the imposition of a high duty they will immediately desist from drinking spirit they will indeed as now drink those which can be most easily procure and if by a high tax suddenly impose foreign spirit be make cheaper than we own foreign spirit will only be use we distillery will be destroy and we people will yet not be reform that heavy tax will not deter the people from any favorite enjoyment have be already show by the unsuccessfulness of the last attempt to restrain they from the use of spirit and may be every day discover from the use of tobacco which be universally take by the common people though a very high duty be lay upon it and though a king think it so pernicious that he employ he pen against it the common therefore prudently forbear to use violent measure which might disgust the people but which they have no reason to believe sufficient to reform they and think it more expedient to proceed by more gentle method which might operate by imperceptible degree and which might be make more forcible and compulsive if they should be find ineffectual another evil will by this method likewise be avoid which be the certain consequence of high duty this tax will produce no clandestine fraud nor rebellious defiance of the legislature the distiller will not be tempt to evade this impost by perjury too often practice where the profit of they be great nor smuggler to assemble in numerous troops with arm in they hand and carry import liquor through the country by force in opposition to the officer of the custom and the law of the nation that this likewise be practice upon other occasion to escape heavy tax all the weekly papers inform we nor be there many month in which some of the king 's officer be not maim or murder do of they duty all these evil my lord and a thousand other will be avoid by a easy tax in favor of which i can not but wonder that it should be necessary to plead so long since every nation which have any pretension to civility or a regular government will agree that heavy impost be not to be wantonly inflict and that severity be never to be practice till lenity have fail it therefore appear to I my lord that justice reason and experience unite in favor of this bill and that nothing be to be fear from it but that it will not be sufficiently coercive nor restrain the abuse of spirit so much as be hope by those that have stand up in its vindication that it can encourage drunkenness or increase the consumption of distilled liquor be surely impossible for they be now drunk without restraint and therefore no restraint will be take away : and since they price must be increase by a double duty it may reasonably be conceive that those who now spend all that they can gain by they labor in drunkenness must be content with less than before because they will have no more to spend and what have hitherto enable they to riot in debauchery will no longer be sufficient for the same purpose the same excess will require more money and more money can not be have i do not affirm my lord that the success of this bill be demonstrably certain nor can i deny that many argument have be allege against it which can not easily be confute all that i can venture to assert be that in my opinion the reason _ for _ the bill preponderate not that those _ against _ it be without weight of this at least we be certain that the bill can produce no ill consequence and that if the experience of the ensue year shall show it to be ineffectual it may be amend in the next session by new provision which we shall be then more able to adjust for the benefit of the publick all law especially those which regard complicated and intricate affair have be perfect by degree experience have discover those deficiency which sagacity could not foresee and the progress of human wisdom have be always slow to charge any scheme with imperfection be only to allege that it be the production of man of being finite in they capacity and liable to error nor do i see what can be recommend to such being more than what the government be now endeavor to practice that nothing should be do precipitately and that experience should always be trust rather than conjecture lord lonsdale next speak to the effect follow : -- my lord the argument of the noble lord have by no means influence I to alter my opinion nor do i now rise up to pronounce a recantation of any of my former assertion but to explain one of they which the noble lord have be please to controvert he observe in opposition to my argument that the distillery contribute to the consumption of the produce of we grounds and by consequence to the advantage of those who possess they but i my lord be incline to believe that it produce a contrary effect and that it hinder the consumption even of that grain which be employ in it we may reasonably suppose my lord that they who now drink distilled liquor would if they be debar from they endeavor to obtain from ale and beer the same renovation of they vigor and relaxation of they care and that therefore more ale would be brew as there would be more purchaser : if therefore the same quantity of malt which be sufficient when distil to produce intoxication would when brew into ale have the same effect the consumption would still be the same whether ale or spirit be in use but it be certain that the fourth part of the malt which be necessary to furnish ale for a debauch will when exalt in the still be sufficient to satisfy the most greedy drunkard and it be therefore evident that he who drink ale consume more barley by three part in four than he who indulge the use of spirit suppose they both equally criminal in the excess of they enjoyment the noble lord have take occasion to mention tobacco as a instance of the obstinacy with which the people persevere in a practice to which they be addict of the obstinacy of the people my lord i be sufficiently convinced but hope that it will never be able to overpower the legislature who ought to enforce they law and invigorate they effort in proportion to the atrociousness of the corruption which they be endeavor to extirpate : nor do i think so meanly of government as to believe it unable to repress drunkenness or luxury or in danger of be subvert in a contest about spirit or tobacco tobacco indeed have not properly be produce as a instance for i never hear that however it may be disapprove by particular man of whatever rank or ability it be prohibit by law nor should i think any such prohibition necessary or reasonable for tobacco my lord be not poison like distilled spirit nor be the use of it so much injurious to health as offensive to delicacy the poisonous and destructive quality of these liquor be confess by the noble lord a confession with which i find it very difficult to reconcile he solicitude for the distillery for when it be once grant that spirit corrupt the mind weaken the limb impair virtue and shorten life any argument in favor of those who manufacture they come too late since no advantage can be equivalent to the loss of honesty and life when the noble lord have urge that the distillery employ great number of hand and therefore ought to be encourage may it not upon he own concession be reply that those number be employ in murder and that they trade ought like that of other murderer to be stop when he urge that much of we grain be consume in the still may we not answer and answer irresistibly that it be consume by be turn into poison instead of bread and can a stronger argument be imagine for the suppression of this detestable business than that it employ multitude and that it be gainful and extensive nor can i discover my lord how the care of preserve the distillery be consistent with the end which the preamble in this bill declare to be propose or which the advocate for it appear to desire if the consumption of distilled spirit be to be hinder how be the distillery to remain uninjured if the trade of distil be not to be impaired what shall hinder the consumption of spirit so far as this bill operate the distiller must be impoverish by it and if they may properly and justly suffer a small diminution of they profit for a small advantage to the publick why will not a greater benefit be equivalent to a greater diminution nothing my lord be more apparent than that the real design of this bill however its defender may endeavor to conceal it in the mist of sophistry be to lay only such a tax as may increase the revenue and that they have no desire of suppress that vice which may be make useful to they private purpose nor feel any regret to fill the exchequer by the slaughter of the people lord aylesford then rise up and speak to the follow purpose : -- my lord the noble lord who speak last in defense of this new scheme appear to have imbibe very strong prejudice in favor of the distillery from which he find it practicable to draw large sum for the
