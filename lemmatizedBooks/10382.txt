than merely formal notice of the service of the deceased officer of a great but scarcely sufficiently recognize scientific department of the magnificent indian empire of she majesty the queen-empress the surveyor-general deeply regret to announce the death of mr ww mcnair surveyor 3rd grade from fever contract at quetta while attach to the baluchistan survey party he be grant leave to proceed to mussooree where he die on 13th August mr mcnair join the department on the 1st September 1867 and be post to the rajputana topographical party the first twelve year of he service be pass on topographical duty with this party under major g strahan re and in the mysore party under major g strahan and hr thuillier re from the very first he show special aptitude as a plane-tabler and be soon recognize in the department as a accomplished surveyor in the autumn of 1879 he be select to accompany the khyber column of the afghan field force and be present with that force during the severe fighting that occur before kabul in the winter of 1879-80 and the subsequent defense of sharpur whilst in afghanistan he map a very large portion of hitherto unknown country include the lughman valley and approach to kafiristan and the logar and wardak valley to the south of kabul he explore the adrak-badrak pass with a native escort and make himself acquaint with the route from kabul to jalalabad _ via _ lughman which be explore by no other european officer at the close of the war he be attach to the kohat survey under major holdich re and be specially employ in the risky work of map the

of triangle from the indus at dehra grhazus khan to quetta which occupy he to the close of he career he ability as a observer he readiness of resource under unusual difficulty and he power of attach the frontier people to he personally have be just as conspicuous throughout this duty as be he energy and success as a geographical topographer apart from he departmental career he have win a lasting name as a explorer by he adventurous journey to kafiristan in 1883 when on leave it may be fairly claim for he that he be the first european officer who set foot in that impracticable country and he be still the best authority on many of the route lead to it he service to geographical science be recognize by the royal geographical society who award he the murchison grant and there can be little doubt that a distinguished career be still before he when he be suddenly cut off in the prime of he life to those who know what a indian department mean such language of eulogy no less truthful than graceful from so respect a functionary as the surveyor-general of indium who know mr mcnair personally will carry a weight far beyond the official recognition of that deceased officer 's worth to he department the comparative neglect of a great scientific department of state such as the indian survey department undoubtedly be as a mere ornamental section of the huge and complicated machinery of that gigantic empire call indium be but too often repeat by a department and its official head in regard the merit of the living and the dead who sacrifice they life to its achievement but in this one instance at least it can not be say that the head of a department fall beneath he opportunity for do himself and he subordinate due honor it be not always from official neglect or human pride and indifference that this want of sympathy for human labor and human devotion arise but rather from the infinite preoccupation and monotonous overwork of the faculty of all public servant of any position of importance in that vast continent of swarm bee intent on they day 's labor and nothing else it be a good token for the future that man shall feel they labor be appreciate although a desire for official recognition may be no incentive to the devotion itself it be certain that william mcnair always value the appreciation of he official superior and that nothing could have give he greater pleasure or more comfort in he review of he own brief labor than to have know he would be thus remember by the head of he own department to nature that regard the daily association of a arduous career as give a sanctification all they own the testimony of colleague -- and most of all of the responsible mouthpiece of those colleague -- be specially and naturally dear within this period of twenty-two year ' faithful service to the state occur the remarkable exploit the account of which as read in a paper before the royal geographical society of london on the 10th December 1883 i transcribe into this memoir direct from the proceedings of that society publish in the number for January 1884 in the follow word give the substance of what be say by the president of the society who introduce the lecturer and the several speaker who raise a discussion on the subject of the paper after it have be read proceedings of the royal geographical society -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ a visit to kafiristan _ by ww mcnair -lrb- read at the evening meeting December 10th 1883 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- in order to let the reader see how perfect be the disguise of mcnair during he kafiristan expedition i have prefix to this memoir a portrait of mcnair take a year or two before he death and to the paper read before the royal geographical society the group attire as on they journey with mcnair in the center and he mahommedan friend around he in introduce mr mcnair to the meeting the president -lrb- lord aberdare -rrb- say that the paper he be about to read be a account of a visit he have recently make to kafiristan mr mcnair have reside in indium for a long time previous to he adventurous journey and whilst in the service of the topographical department in the north-west of indium have be employ in survey beyond the frontier of afghanistan he attention be thus direct to the interesting country which the paper would describe kafiristan be a country of very peculiar interest the name kafiristan or the country of infidel be a nick-name give by the surround mahommedan and be not that by which it be call by the native it have long be a reproach to english geographer that the only account of kafiristan have be obtain through oriental themselves whose statement have never be test by the actual visit of european to the country the consequence be that a sort of mystery surround kafiristan -- so much so that colonel yule when discuss a interesting paper by colonel tanner on a visit he make to the border of the kafir country three year ago say that when kafiristan be visit and explore the royal geographical society might close the door because there would be no more new work to be do the veil have at last be draw aside it might be ask why the country have be so long hold inaccessible the explanation be that the inhabitant be always at war with they mahommedan neighbor by whom they be surround on all side and who have be extremely jealous of they communication with european traveller mr mcnair have penetrate kafiristan in disguise he -lrb- the president -rrb- have have a opportunity of see the paper and he find that mr mcnair have not dwell upon the historical geography of kafiristan and therefore he would say a few word on that subject as long ago as 1809 kafiristan attract the attention of one of the ablest public servant that england ever send out to india -- mountstuart elphinstone -- who be anxious to add to he history of kabul something about the people of kafiristan and know that it be inaccessible to european he employ a indian a man of learning and intelligence to travel there and obtain all the information he could it be curious to notice how faithful the report of he emissary be the people of the country be describe in the follow word : the kafir be celebrate for they beauty and they european complexion they worship idol drink wine in silver cup or vase use chair and table and speak a language unknown to they neighbor they religion seem to have be a sort of debased deism : they believe in a god at the same time they worship a great number of idol which they say represent the great man that have pass from among they and he describe a scene at which he have be present when a goat or a cow be sacrifice and the follow prayer pithy and comprehensive although not remarkable for charity be offer up : ward off fever from we increase we store kill the mussulman after death admit we to paradise kill the mussulman be a religious duty which the kafir perform with the greatest fidelity and diligence in fact no young man be allow to marry until he have kill a mussulman they attach the same importance to the killing of a mussulman as the red indian do to take the scalp of a enemy they number do not appear to exceed 250000 they inhabit three valley and small as they number be they be constantly at war with each other and seize upon the member of kindred tribe in order to sell they as slave the woman be remarkable for they beauty and sir henry rawlinson once say at one of they meeting that the most beautiful oriental woman he ever see be a kafir and that she have besides other charm a great mass of golden hair which let loose and shake cover she completely from head to foot like a veil in order to show what be the state of we knowledge of the country down to 1879 he would read part of a paper by mr markham on the upper basin of the kabul river this unknown portion of the southern watershed of the hindu kush be inhabit by a indomitable race of unconquered hill-men call by they muslim neighbor the siah-posh -lrb- black-clothed -rrb- kafir they country consist of the long valley extend from the hindu kush to the kunar river with many secluded glen descend to they and intervene hill afford pasturage for they sheep and cattle the peak in kafiristan reach to height of from 11000 to 16000 foot the valley yield crop of wheat and barley and the emperor baber mention the strong and heady wine make by the kafir which he get when he extend he dominion to chigar-seraus in 1514 the kafir be describe as strong athletic man with a language of they own the feature and complexion of european and fond of dance hunting and drinking they also play at leap-frog shake hand as englishman and can not sit cross-legged on the ground when a deputation of kafir come to sir william macnaghten at jalalabad the afghan exclaim : ` here be you relation come ' from the day of alexander the great the siah-posh kafir have never be conquer and they have never embrace islam they successfully resist the attack of mahmud of ghaznus and the campaign which timur undertake against they in 1398 be equally unsuccessful but the muslim ruler of kabul continue to make inroad into the siah-posh country down to the time of baber and afterwards we only knowledge of this interesting people be from the report of mahommedan and from a account of two native missionary who penetrate into kafiristan in 1865 elphinstone obtain much information respect the kafir from one mullah najib in 1809 and lumsden from a kafir slave name feramory who be a general in the afghan service in 1857 further particulars will be find in the writings of burne wood masson raverty griffith and mohun lal in recent year major biddulph enter from kashmir through gilgit and make he way to chitral and colonel tanner advance from jalalabad a short distance into kafiristan among a portion of the people who have be convert to mahommedanism but who still retain many of the peculiarity of the kafir race dr leitner have also take great pain to obtain information about this ancient and unconquered people but mr mcnair be the first european who have ever penetrate into kafiristan mr mcnair then read as follow : -- in the September number of this society 's proceedings p 553 under the head a expedition to chitral allusion be make to my be accompany by a native explorer know in the profession as the saiad it be to this gentleman that i be indebted for the partial success that attend we undertaking i say partial advisedly inasmuch as the original program we have mark out of penetrate into the heart of kafiristan fall through for reason that will appear as i proceed with the narrative the saiad whose name i need not mention have be make over to I more than a year ago by major holdich to instruct this lead to a mutual friendship and on he explain to I that he have a plan of get into the kafir country which be by accompany meah hosein shah and sahib gul -lrb- who yearly go to chitral either through dir or via the kunar valley -rrb- as far as birkot and then follow up the arnawaus stream cross the hill to the westward and return to jalalabad either by the alingar or alishang river i suggest accompany he in the guise of a hakim or tabib _ ie _ native doctor he be to be accompany by meah gul a kafir convert the two meah of course have to be consult and after some difficulty i succeed in get they consent have convince they that the undertaking be entirely at my own risk and that in the event of my detection they would be free from all responsibility i next send in my papers for a year 's furlough with permission to spend the first half in indium this be grant and my leave commence from march 27th by April 9th i be at nowshera and by three o'clock on the follow morning with head shave a weak solution of caustic and walnut juice apply to hand and face and wear the dress peculiar to the meah or kaka khels and in company with hosein shah i sally out as mir mahome or hakim sahib it may not be out of place if i here mention that the kaka khel section of pathan to which the two meah belong be not only very influential but be respect throughout both afghanistan and badakshan the kafir also pay they a certain amount of respect and will not knowingly attack they owe to a epidemic of cholera which once break out amongst they immediately after they have return from murder a party of kaka khels and which they superstitiously attribute to they influence they number in all a few short of 3500 this include menial and follower though really consider spiritual adviser they be virtually trader and i do not think i be far wrong in say that they have the monopoly of the trade from kabul eastward to the border of kashmir territory if you say that you be a meahgan or kaka khel word signify one and the same thing you have not only access where other be question and a sort of blackmail levy on they but you be treat hospitably and you daily want supply free of cost -- as be often the case with we of course the meaghan have to make some return it be do in this wise : a fair last from five to seven day be yearly hold at ziarat a village five mile south-west of nowshera the resting-place of the saint kaha sahib it be resort to by thousand from across we north and east frontier and all comer be house and feed by the meah collectively offering it be true be make to the shrine but i be tell the amount collect be utilise solely for the keep up of the shrine what follow be take from my diary which i stealthily manage to keep up during my journey it be not till April 13th that we be fairly across the british frontier the interval of four day be spend in get together all necessaries the rendezvous be for the 13th at ganderus and true to appointment all be present we party then consist of forty include muleteer and fifteen baggage animal in the shape of provision we have nothing but sugar and tea the contents of we load -lrb- i should say goods only that we get very little in return -rrb- be cloth of english manufacture musical box binoculars time-piece a spare revolver or two with a few round of ammunition salt glass bead shell needle country-made looking-glass shoe and lungi as well as several phial and galipot of medicine in addition to these i have secrete a prismatic and magnetic compass a boiling point and aneroid thermometer and a plane-table which i have construct for the occasion the last-mentioned instrument answer famously the purpose for which it be intend and be in use from the begin to almost the end of my journey it answer in case of a surprise to pass off for a tabib book of prescription all that be necessary be to slip off the paper that be in use inside one of the fold and expose to the gaze of the inquisitive individual merely a book or rather the outer case of one in which i have write several recipe in urdu the instrument be either carry by the saiad or myself in a _ gooda ie _ untanned skin of goat or sheep invariably use by traveller in this region the malakand pass -lrb- elevation 3575 foot -rrb- be well wooded with brushwood and stunt oak grass and a goodly supply of water from spring be procurable all through the year the ascent be easy and practicable for heavy baggage the descent into the swat valley be not nearly so easy beast of burden as well as foot passenger have to pick out they way but a company of bengal or madras sappers would in a few hour clear all difficulty sufficiently well to allow a mule battery to keep up with infantry when once in the plain this state of thing change where previously one have to avoid loose rock and boulder we have now to search for a dry spot on which to alight both bank of the river be irrigate the soil be very rich and well adapt for rice cultivation the valley have the reputation of be very unhealthy owing i have no doubt to the effluvium arise from the damp soil a swatie be easily recognize by the sallow appearance he present -- a striking contrast to he nearest neighbor the swat river be about 50 foot wide from three to four deep and flush with its bank we cross over in _ jala _ -lrb- _ ie _ inflate skin -rrb- opposite the large village of chakdara the load be take off and we animal ford the stream with little or no difficulty almost due north of we cross and distant eight mile lay the village of kotigram the valley know as the unch plain be somewhat open narrowing as we near the village midway about uncha we pass several tope or buddhist remain these tope be very numerous at least twenty be visible at one time and some of great size and in a very good state of preservation -- more than one quite as large as the famous tope of mani kiyala a little further up the valley towards the katgolum pass to the left of we route there be numerous excavate cave in the side of the hill in one of which the traveller could take shelter during a pass shower the assent to the laram kotal be easy and though the south face of this range be somewhat denuded of both fir and pine yet the soil be sufficiently rich to allow of cultivation on its slope on this pass whilst take some plane-table observation i be within a ace of be detect from a unexpected quarter four man arm with matchlock show themselves much quicker than it take I to record it the rule or sight vane be run up my long and open sleeve and i begin to pretend to be look about for stray root the intruder be throw off the scent and after a while assist the saiad in look for odd root for the suppose native doctor the descent from the pass which register 7310 foot to killa rabat -lrb- 3900 foot -rrb- in the panjkhora valley be for the first half of the distance by a long and densely wooded spur within a easy slope but on near the foot we find it very stony we party be meet at the entrance by the khan and later on we be invite to dinner by he long before this i have get quite use to eat with my finger but on this occasion i must admit i find it unpleasant diving the finger into a richly make curry float in grease and have at the next mouthful to partake of honey and omelet the banquet last for a hour or more and i be begin to feel uncomfortable sit on the ground in the one position so peculiar to eastern nation when the hookah come to my rescue and allow of a change in position we ford the panjkhora a little above the fort and by 5 pm reach shahzadgaus we find the chief busy with a durbar he be hold under a large chinar tree and discuss the plan of attack on kunater fort we introduction be somewhat formal except in the case of hosein shah who be very cordially receive and publicly thank for have respond to the chief 's request to bring a doctor from indium for he rahmatullah khan chief of dir be a eusafzaus ruler of a population exceed 600000 in appearance he be anything but prepossessing -- small of stature and very dark in complexion for a pathan with not a tooth in he head and the skin on he face loose and wrinkled he present the appearance of a aged man though really not more than fifty-five i be at shahzadgaus seven day and during that time succeed in bring round the chief who be suffer from a ordinary cold and cough i can not say my stay be a pleasant one for from early morn till dusk we hut be surround by patient and inasmuch as the chief have recover it be consider a sufficient guarantee that no matter what the ailment or disease might be if only the tabib would prescribe all would come right man with withered arm and leg other totally blind be expect to be cure and no amount of persuasion would convince those who have bring such unfortunate that the case be a hopeless one it be here that i get as a fee the antique seal which i have bring for exhibition to the meeting the man who bring it have find it across the panjkhora opposite shahzadgaus whilst throw up some earthwork it be then encase in a copper vessel general cunningham to whom i show the seal at simlum about three month ago write as follow : -- i be sorry to say that i can not make out anything about you seal at first i think that the man standing before a burning lamp might be a fire-worshipper in which case the seal would be persian i _ incline _ however to think that it may be a egyptian seal i believe that each symbol be one of the common form on egyptian monument this can be determine by one verse in egyptian hieroglyphic since my arrival here i have submit the seal to sir henry rawlinson the fact of its have be dig up in the panjkhora valley add great interest to the relic on the 24th we leave for kumbar whilst here it get abroad that my friend hosein shah be accompany by two european in disguise the originator of this report be no other than rahat shah meah a native in the confidence of we indian government and enjoy the benefit of a _ jagir _ or grant of land in the district of nowshera give he for loyal service but a swear enemy of my two friend he have send letter to asmar chitral swat and bijor urge on the people to track out the kafir who be in company with the meagan and destroy they as they could have go with no other purpose than to spy out the land shao baba take up the matter and not until the dir chief have write contradict the statement and certify that he have ask my companion to bring from indium a hakim be suspicion allay unfortunately in a country like afghanistan where fanaticism be so rampant once let it be even surmise that outsider and these the detest kafir be about the bare contradiction do not suffice and the original idea only lie dormant as we future progress show two march take we from kumbar -lrb- elevation 4420 foot -rrb- to dir -lrb- 5650 foot -rrb- cross _ en route _ the barawal range height of the pass be 8340 foot by a very fair road which can be ride up here we party be join by the dir chief who have settle he dispute be proceed to he capital the fort of dir be of stone but in decay it have a ancient aspect but this apply still more to the village of ariankot which occupy the flat top of a low spur detach from the fort by a small stream the spur fall in perpendicular cliff of some 20 foot in height and in these be trace of numerous cave similar to those already speak of and some of which be still use as dwelling by the baltus people who come to take service as porter between dir and chitral the population of the fort and valley exceed 6000 soul four more day be waste by we party at dir procure carrier as the lowaraus pass -lrb- call loharus by some -rrb- be not sufficiently clear of snow to admit of we baggage animal cross it and from all account bring in would not be so for another month this decide we on procure the service of balti who have come from daroshp and chitral and who prefer they wages be pay in cloth or salt to sum of money i should here add that my companion have in the meanwhile receive letter from the neighborhood of asmar advise they not to pay a visit to arnawai just then as the rumor concern we be not very favourable so rather than remain where we be i suggest visit chitral the idea be adopt the load be make over to the man we have engage and the follow morning we bid adieu to rahmatullah khan and start for mirga elevation 8400 foot though the distance from mirga to ashreth be not more than ten mile yet it take we almost as many hour to accomplish it from mirga to the lowaraus kotal -lrb- elevation 10450 foot -rrb- the route lay over snow it be quite true what have formerly be relate of the number of cairn on this pass mark the burial of mahommedan traveller who have be kill by the kafir banditti who cross the kunar river and attack traveller on the road traveller as they pass throw stone upon those cairn a method universal among the pathan in such case but many body be still visible in various stage of decay and imperfectly cover there be no habitation for about six mile on either side of the pass and it be only when information reach a village that they send out to cover the remains of the true believer the only village between the pass and the kunar river be ashreth the people of this village pay tribute to dir as well as chitral and this tribute be render in the form of escort to traveller ascend the pass but the people themselves be shia and recently convert kafir and be know to be in league with the kafir banditti give notice to the latter of the approach of traveller rather than render effective aid against they fortunately the ascent be easy and gradual the descent be steeper and in part very try we have to cross and recross the frozen stream several time owe to the side of the hill rise almost perpendicularly from its base to add to we difficulty we have to pick we way over deep snow -lrb- even in may -rrb- not only over branch but tolerably large size trunk of tree that have be uproot i be tell that during the winter month a regular hurricane blow up this valley carry everything before it the pass -lrb- kotal -rrb- form the northern boundary of dir territory ashreth to chitral -lrb- 5151 foot -rrb- be do by we in three march it be at the head of the shushaus valley that the village of madalash lie the inhabitant of which be allude to by major biddulph in he tribe of the hindu kush as be a clan speak amongst themselves the persian tongue they keep entirely to themselves and enjoy certain privilege deny to they surround neighbor and from what i learn be credit as have come over a couple of hundred year ago from across the hindu kush _ via _ the dura pass between daroshp and chitral the passage by the river contract to a narrow gorge over which a wall be build more than two century ago to resist a attempt invasion by the troops of jehangir up to this point the mogul force be say to have bring they elephant but find it here impracticable to pass they turn back : this force come over the lowaraus pass the ascent from jalalabad be impracticable because the river run in various place between asmar and chigar seraus in almost impassable gorge it be late in the evening when we arrive at chitral but as the badshah be not feel very well beyond the usual salutation exchange with hosein shah and sahib gul all introduction be defer till the follow morning the follow morning before present ourselves to aman ul mulk we send he the follow present viz a waziri horse two revolver a pair of binoculars several piece of chintz and linen twenty pound of tea sugar salt and several pair of shoe of peshawar manufacture as well as trinket for he zenana after the preliminary and formal inquiry as to we health the mehter sahib or badshah allude to the rumor regard I and wind up by say that as he be a friend to the british and he country at they disposal i be at liberty to go about and do as i pleased provide none of my follower accompany I fortunately we indian government think differently and judge he character more correctly this be not exactly what we have expect but rather than be thwart in the one object i have come for a consent be give to he proposal but before we have fairly get back to we quarter a message be send we say that the pass into kafiristan be not open just then we reply be that in that case we should return immediately to indium he then send for sahib gul and eventually it be decide that i should defer my visit to the kafir till some of they lead man should arrive and _ ad interim _ i might pay a visit to the dura pass no european have hitherto be along this route and think some information might be collect and note on the geography of the route take i agree though affect disgust and start on the 13th of may for shalus andarthus be we next halt place the fort command the entrance into the arkarus valley at the head of the valley be the three pass agzam khartiza and nuksan over the hindu kush lead into badakshan and a little below the ozur valley which take its rise from the tirach mir mountain whose elevation be deduce trigonometrically by colonel tanner to be 25426 foot present a magnificent view the dorsal ridge of the hindu kush have here a mean elevation of some 16000 foot and this great mountain of tirach mir stand on a southward spur from the main range from which it tower up thus 9000 foot above the latter the head of the dura pass which lead to zebak and ishkashim be a little over 14000 foot the ascent be very gradual and quite feasible for laden animal but owe to the people of munjan and the kafir in the bogosta valley trader prefer the route _ via _ the nuksan pass which as its name denote be much more difficult neither pass be open for more than three month in the year in this valley between daroshp and gobor i notice several detach oval pond evidently artificial which i be tell be construct for catch wild goose and duck during they annual flight to india just before the winter set in _ ie _ about the middle of October the plan adopt though rude be unique in its way and be this : -- by the aid of narrow dig trench water from the run stream be let into the pond and turn off when full the pond be surround by a stone wall high enough to allow a man when crouch to be unobserved over and across one-half or less of this pond a rough trellis-work of thin willow branch be put up : the bird on alighting be gradually drive under this canopy and a sudden rush be make by those on the watch hundred in this manner be daily catch during the season the flesh be eat and from the down on they breast coarse overcoat and glove be make know as _ margaloon _ this method of trapping be borrow from the kafir a short distance beyond the village of daroshp be some mineral spring that be visit by invalid from badakshan have satisfy myself on my return from the kotal by a visit up the bogosta valley that the descent into the arnawaus be not practicable for some week to come i return to chitral on the 22nd of may some kafir have come in and amongst they one who have just a year ago take in to kamdesh a pathan christian evangelist who have unfortunately give out that he be send by the indian government and that he master would if he give a favourable report of they come to term with the kafir so as to secure they in future against mahommedan inroad my visit occur inopportunely with regard to this statement of the evangelist and although i state that he utterance be false the kafir would have it that i have come on behalf of the government and that the chief of chitral have persuade I into give he the arm and sum of money i have bring for they this kafir next want I to pledge myself to aid they sect against asmar and on my refusing leave my quarter in a pet but return after a couple of hour say that i might accompany he as doctor and attend a aged relative of he kafirstan embrace a area of 5000 square mile bound on the north by the hindu kush mountain on the south by the kunar range for its western limit it have the alishang with its tributary the alingar its eastern boundary be not nearly so well define but take roughly may be express as the kunar river from its junction with the kabul to where the former receive the water of the kalashgum at the village of ain thence follow up this last tributary to its source a line draw from that point to the dura pass be well within the mark i may also include a small section occupy a tract north-west of the above-named pass and subject to munjan there be three main tribe viz ramgal vaigal and bashgal correspond with the three principal valley in they tract of country the last-named occupy the arnawaus darra and be divide into five clan kamdesh keshtoz mungal werani and ludhechi the keshtoz mungal and werani pay a nominal tribute in kind to the ruler of chitral but not so the other two clan the vaigal tribe be reckon the most powerful this probably be due to they occupy the largest valley each of the three principal tribe have a dialect different from the other two but have several word in common and as a rule have very little to do with those inhabit the other valley the entire population be estimate at over 200000 soul they country be picturesque densely wood and wild in the extreme the man of fine appearance with sharp aryan feature and keen penetrate eye blue eye be not common but do occur but brown eye and light hair even to a golden hue in combination be not at all uncommon the general complexion vary to two extreme that of extreme fairness -- pink rather than blonde and the other of bronze quite as dark as the ordinary panjabus the cast of feature seem common to both these complexion but the fairer man if ask will indicate the dark man as have come from the south and that they themselves have come from the north and east they be as be always the case with hill tribe short of stature daring to a fault but lazy leave all the agricultural work to they womenkind and spend they day when not at war principally in hunting they be passionately fond of dancing in which both sex join scarcely let a evening pass without indulge in it around a blasing fire the dancing which i on several occasion witness be invariably begin by a single female performer appear on the scene and after go through a few graceful movement a shrill whistle -lrb- cause by insert two finger into the month -rrb- give by one of the man be the signal for a change several performer then come forward advance and retire on either side of a huge bonfire at one end of which be the musician -- they instrument a large drum two kettle-drum and a couple of flute to this music more particularly to the beating of the drum good time be keep the whistle sound again when immediately the performer set to partner if i may use the expression after a while they disengage and begin circle round the fire singly -- man and woman alternately the tamasha end by again set to partner each couple hold a stick between they they foot firmly plant on the ground and close together spin round at a great pace first from right to leave and then from leave to right none object to my take part in this performance but for the indulgence i have to pay as forfeit several string of bead and shell a few looking-glass and some needle which i present to those of the fairer sex only the house be generally build on the slope of the hill the lower story be of stone from 12 to 15 foot high but be not use for cattle even which be keep apart in stone byre timber be store in these lower story as also the ordure of cattle which be use as fuel especially for smoke they cheese this cheese be make daily and be of the nature of cream cheese and when fresh be not bad on the roof of this lower story leave a space all round to walk rise the actual habitation which be of wood entirely and contain only one or two room these be neat enough but very dark the door and door-frame be roughly carve with figure and scroll there be little furniture but all use low wooden chair or wicker stool to sit upon the food either bread which be ordinarily of very thick cake but when guest be entertain of very thin broad cake like indian chapatty or meat boil in a large iron cauldron be serve in large deep circular wooden vessel hollow from a trunk or thick branch of a tree without any table though table be see occasionally on which drinking vessel be set the bread cake be serve to guest with slice of cheese between two such cake imbed in hot butter they bed be very rude fixture consist of pole one end of which rest in the wall and the other on two leg : it be remarkable that they call they _ kat _ the object of the lower story seem chiefly to raise the house above the snow in winter it be ascend by a ladder outside which can be draw up sometimes there be a third story which be of course like the second of timber but be also surround by a platform the roof of flat stone lay on beam and cover with mud the temple be square chamber of timber with doorway carve and color inside there be set several stone apparently boulder from the river bed but no image be see except those connect with funeral rite which be temporarily set up in the temple the use of these temple seem to be chiefly in connection with funeral rite the coffin be carry there and sacrifice perform before the body be carry off to the place of eventual deposit the man shave the whole of the head except a circular patch on the crown where the hair be allow to grow seldom if ever cut it -- never wear a cover almost all the man i see wear the indian manufactured cotton clothes similar to the afghan and on they foot have strip of hide tie with string of hide the dress of the woman be merely a single garment not unlike a very loose dress or morning gown gather up at the waist the hair which as a rule be very long be worn plait and cover over with a broad cap with lappet and just over the crown stick up two tuft -lrb- some have one only -rrb- which from a distance appear like horn a sample of this head-dress as well as of three or four other article of interest i have bring for exhibition to the meeting it be purely due to no blood-feud exist among themselves that they have succeed in hold they own against the mahommedan by whom they be hem in on all side they have nothing in common with they and in fact be incessantly engage in petty warfare with the mahommedan they be exceedingly well disposed towards the british : i may venture further and state that they would not hesitate to place they service should occasion require at we disposal and step might be take to secure this slavery exist to a certain extent amongst they this nefarious trade however would fall through if slave do not command so ready a sale at jalalabad kunar asmar and chitral polygamy be the exception and not the rule for infidelity on the part of a wife mild corporal punishment be inflict and a fine of half-a-dozen or more head of cattle impose accord to the wealth of the male offender the dead be not bury but put into coffin and deposit either in a unfrequented spot on a hill-side or carry to a sort of cemetery and there leave the coffin be in neither case inter i visit one of these cemetery and see over a hundred coffin in different stage of decay rest against the head of some of these i notice carve wooden figure of both sex and be tell that this be a honor confer only on person of rank and note as regard they religion one supreme being -lrb- imbra -rrb- be universally acknowledged priest preside at they temple in which stone be set up but to neither priest nor idol be undue reverence pay unforeseen occurrence be attribute to evil spirit in whose existence they firmly believe give no credit to a spirit for good i have notice that several mention the kafir as be great wine-bibber the beverage bring to I on several occasion nothing more nor less than the pure grape-juice neither fermented nor distilled but in its simple form during the season the fruit which grow in great abundance be gather the juice press out and put into jar either of wood or earthenware and placed underground for future use i obtain some which i put into a bottle for the purpose of bring away but after it have be expose to the air a short time it turn into a sort of vinegar to the kafir chief who take I in i offer some whisky and pour about half a wine-glass into a small peshawar cup but before i have time to add water to it the chief have swallow the pure spirit i shall never forget the expression depict on he countenance after a while all he could give utterance to be we have nothing so strong they arm consist merely of bow and arrow and dagger a few matchlock of kabul manufacture have find they way into the country but no attempt have be make to imitate they at a distance of about 50 yard with they bow and arrow they seldom fail to hit a object smaller than a man the string of the bow be make of gut they wealth be reckon by the number of head of cattle -lrb- goat sheep and cow -rrb- they possess there be eighteen chief in all selection be make for deed of bravery some allowance also be make for hereditary descent wheat be they staple food and with the juice of the grape they make a kind of bread which be eat toast and be not then unlike a christmas plum-pudding to resume the narrative : once again unaccompanied by my two friend i leave chitral on the morning of may 23rd and strike off from urguch spend the first night at balankaru in the rumbur valley the people be the kalash section of the kafir inferior in appearance manner and disposition to they neighbor situate westwards they pay a small tribute in kind to chitral and be allow to retain they own manners and custom to daras karu in the bamburath vale famed for its pear i next proceed here also be kalash kafir and some bashgalus settler the valley be very narrow and the cultivation restricted principally to terraced field on the hill-slopes kakar be the next march beyond it no trace of habitation after a short stay we proceed up the valley till dusk and spend the first part of the night under some rock all beyond be snow interminable snow start at midnight for the head of the pass -lrb- the difference in elevation between we night 's encampment and the crest be 7000 foot -rrb- it take we a hour to do every thousand perpendicular foot the view on the kotal as the sun be rise be a sight never to be forget near and around we the hill clothe in white with different tinge of red showing and cloud rise in fantastic shape and disclose to view the blue and purple of the distant and lower range i be very fortunate in have a clear morning as it enable I to bring my plane-table into great use as the descent be very tedious owe to the upper crust of the snow have melt under the ray of the morning sun we decide on adopt a sort of tobogging system by sit ourselves on the snow raise the foot at the same time give the body a recline position a jerk and then we be off follow in each other 's wake bring ourselves up every now and again by embed we foot in the snow by this mean we get down almost to the base of the hill in a very short time and on arrive at the ludhe village be well receive go out be abandon but whilst thus inactive so far as go about go my time be spend in examine closely into they manners and custom when a urgent message be bring from the aman ul mulk desire I to return immediately owe to some unfavourable news that be abroad think of my two friend whom i have leave at chitral be involve in some difficulty i hurry back only to learn that the chief have send for I on the paltry excuse of have hear that the chief of asmar and the kafir have begin they annual quarrel so once again be another opportunity of penetrate further frustrated during my absence on this trip that arch-fiend rahat shah have arrive at chitral from indium as he have quite the ear of the ruler all further chance of we get on in the may of explore be at a end and so we decide on return to india _ via _ kashmir in return for the present we have give aman ul mulk when we first arrive at chitral he give we other and immediately throw every obstacle in he power to prevent we get away and it be only on refuse to accept he present that we be supply with carrier start on the 5th of June on the fourth day we arrive at drasan -lrb- 6637 foot -rrb- the fort of drasan command the entrance to the turikho and tirach valley whose water meet a few mile north-west of the fort both these valley be very fertile in the latter one and just before its junction with the former be several yellow arsenic mine but the working of these be not encourage by the present ruler gold also i be tell be to be find in the stream about chitral this statement prove correct as i be able to work up some with the aid of mercury and on have the ore test by a goldsmith 's firm in indium it be pronounce by they to be 21 carat but this wash be seldom permit the reason assign by the chief be that if once it be know that chitral produce gold he country would be lose to he mastuj -lrb- elevation 7289 foot -rrb- be on the main or chitral stream and command the entrance to the laspur valley which lead more directly to gilgit _ via _ gupi and gakuch and be the route traverse by major biddulph on reach gazan we leave the main route and follow up the smaller one along a stream take its rise at the tuus pass -lrb- 14812 foot -rrb- the ascent to it be easy but the descent exceedingly difficult a nasty piece of glacier have to be traverse over which we be unfortunate enough to lose two horse and have several of we follower severely frost-bitten about the foot two march further and gilgit be reach and from there in eleven double march we arrive at srinagar where my disguise be throw off to dwell on these last stage of we journey would be merely repeat what have be so ably handle by such authority as draw tanner and biddulph in conclusion i would here record that whatever success have attend this undertaking be due in a great measure to my faithful companion and ally hosein shah sahib gul and the saiad the follow discussion ensue on the reading of the above paper : -- colonel yule say he have for thirty or forty year look with intense interest at the dark spot of kafiristan on the map of asia and have therefore listen with great pleasure to mr mcnair 's modest account of one of the most adventurous journey that have ever be describe before the society twenty or twenty-four year ago we have nothing but the vaguest knowledge of kafiristan but the country have be gradually open out by general walker and colonel montgomery 's pundit in disguise foreign geographer have sometimes cast it in the tooth of englishman that they discovery beyond the frontier of indium have be make vicariously but in this case it be a englishman who have perform the journey he believe he be right in say that no englishman before mr mcnair have ever visit the swat valley it be now inhabit by a most inhospitable race who have become afghanised but rumor have often be hear about the buddhist there eighteen or twenty century ago it be one of the most sacred spot of buddhism fill with buddhist monastery and temple but as far as he know no european except mr mcnair have ever see those remain if further exploration be carry out there probably most interesting discovery would result pass on to the panjkhora river and to dir there be very little doubt that those valley be the scene of some of alexander 's exploit on he way to india many scholar suppose that dir be one of the fortress which alexander take and incidentally the place be mention by marco polo as the route of a mongol horde from badakshan into kashmir he believe that the earliest distinct notice of the kafir be the account of the country be invade by timor on he march to indium when he arrive at andarab he receive complaint by the mussulman villager of the manner in which they be harass by the infidel and a description be give of how the great ameer himself be slide down snow slope in a sort of toboggin of wickerwork he capture some of the kafir fort but could not penetrate into the country after that very little mention be make of they in history till major rennell refer to they in he great memoir on the map of hindostan and mountstuart elphinstone who the afghan use to say could see on the other side of a hill he always seem able to collect item of knowledge which further research prove to be correct he -lrb- colonel yule -rrb- rejoice that have live to see kafiristan partially reveal by a englishman and not by a russian dr leitner say it be well that traveller however naturally accurate in they observation should submit they result to the criticism of learn society for after all it be in such centre that information from various quarter could be best collect sift and compare the task of a pioneer be proverbially ungrateful but he be sufficiently reward if he collect fact for the examination of scholar and if some of these fact stand that test on the other hand it be essential that as a rule no one should be send out on a geographical anthropological or ethnographical mission who be not something of a linguist or who be not accompany by a linguist and who have not give proof of sympathy with alien race hayward fall a victim as much to he temper as to the greed and treachery of mir walus whom he have insult a arabic proverb say that the traveller even when he see be blind and if in addition to this artificial blindness he be practically both deaf and dumb owe to he ignorance of the language of the people among whom he move it be almost certain that he will make many mistake if not insure failure now few result be apt to be more delusive than a mere collection of word or even of short sentence the instance of a dead policeman as a non-aryan equivalent for the abstract term death which the inquirer want of the rejoinder of what do you want for the repeat outstretching of the middle finger a special term for which be seek and numerous other mistake be often perfectly avoidable and it be therefore desirable that the traveller arm with a inexhaustible patience should not content himself with a collection of word but also add the sentence in which they occur and if possible also collect fable song and legend the process in deal with a race whose language one do not know at all be more difficult but even in initial stage the procedure of point to object that be require will not only generally give they native equivalent but will also elicit the order or imperative for these object be bring whilst the use of these imperative by the traveller will often elicit the indicative or future in the assent or dissent of those to whom the imperative be address or else a ejaculatory affirmative or negative the early training in at least two language will also enable the inquirer to discriminate between the substance of a fact or think if he might use such a term and the sound that represent it for if he have only study he own language early in life he will never be able to emancipate himself completely from the confusion which be naturally engender between the idea and he special manner of express it adaptation again even more than translation be what be require and in order that the adaptation should be practice successfully geographical inquiry can not be altogether dissociate from philology nor can philology be dissociate as it so often be from ethnography history and anthropology which throw either a full light or at least a side-light or half-light on linguistic problem as have be point out by dr abel the gesture too of a race be of importance in elicit correct information for it be obvious that where on rugged mountain side ascent or descent can only be practice by the aid of the hand as well as of the foot the term for up and down may be significant of surround topography just as to reverse the argument where many meet only to fight the put of the finger of both hand together will mean collision instead of its be the more usual sign for multitude or the limit of computation which a savage race may have reach finally in this age of subdivision of labor on a basis of general knowledge the present practice of explorer work separately without the co-operation of colleague in the same or kindred branch and sometimes even without a knowledge of the material that already exist should be discourage the first step to be take be the compilation of traveller ' handbook dialogue and vocabulary for the various district of the so-called neutral zone so as to give to these traveller the key of information and to the sympathy of the people and we government of indium especially might with advantage steadily collect both old and new information not at the time _ when _ but long _ before _ a emergency arise so that it may be deal with by a wealth of knowledge when it do arise have this view obtain when the poor relative of the european be see by sale macnaghten wood and other thousand of kafir man and woman would not have be carry into slavery by the afghan hundred of kafir village would not have be destroy and the area of kafir tradition would not have be both corrupted and narrow by the broaden of the belt of nimcha or convert kafir which so increase the difficulty of a exhaustive inquiry into at least the _ past _ of a interesting race above all should we have have a faithful ally in we operation against kabul for even as it be the tardy knowledge of that war by the kafir suffice to bring thousand into the field ready to be let loose on they hereditary foe whilst it put a stop at any rate temporarily to the internecine feud which as much as muslim encroachment reduce the number of kafir he hope that the visit of mr mcnair and of the native christian missionary recently in kafiristan might be another step towards the future union and civilisation of a race that whether in part descend from the colony plant by alexander the great or not should no longer be treat as poor relative by they european brethren for whom the interposition of friendly and vigorous tribe of mountaineer along with the dard with whom they have so much in common between the british and russian possession in asia can not fail to be a advantage in the interest of peace as to the various route to and through kafiristan he would add nothing to-night to what have be so ably state but as regard the language he could not forbear mention that there be at least five distinct dialect speak by the tribe which differ as much as italian do from french if not from german although base on aryan root common to they all they religious belief and custom also show great divergency as well as similarity the member of various kafir and kindred tribe of whom he submit a few photograph to the meeting and whose measurement have be take have supply a amount of information which may be lay before the society in due course along with he hope a very full account of a neighbouring race that be anthropologically and linguistically perhaps even more interesting than the kafir who be mainly dards he mean the people of hunza -lrb- hun-land -rrb- who language be if not a prehistoric remnant at any rate like no other that have hitherto be discover in which the pronoun form a inseparable part of numerous substantive and verb and in which guttural be still in a state of transition to vowel this people practice a code of religion and of quaint immoral fortunately confine to themselves but which be not without some bearing on the question of the mahdus now give we some trouble in africa as some kafir call themselves kureishis wnich favor a shium notion in opposition to they sunni persecutor he might incidentally observe that the expectation of a mahdus be a singular importation of a shium notion not entirely without we aid into the orthodox sunnus mahommedan world which have so long be content with the _ de jure _ khalifa the sultan belong to the category of imperfect khalifa as a chief and representative who be admittedly a defender of the faith only so long as he have power to enforce he decree and be accept by the general _ consensus _ of the faithful the very essence of sunni-ism the al-sunnat wa jamaat this view be in bold contradiction to the _ hereditary _ principle represent by the mahdus of the imam 's descent from the kureish tribe of arabium which cause the very separation of the shia sect from the sunni which be the very essence of shium belief and which have among other fiction lead to the assumption of the name of kureishus by some of the kafir sir henry rawlingson be glad of the opportunity of express he high appreciation of the value of mr mcnair 's exploration he journey be not a mere holiday trip or a every-day reconnaissance survey on the contrary it be a serious undertaking and open up what he -lrb- sir henry -rrb- for twenty year have maintain to be the great natural highroad from indium to central asia the route to the north of the kabul river and along the chitral valley be by far the most direct and the easiest line of communication between the punjab and the upper valley of the oxus and although native explorer have as colonel yule have observe already traverse the route and bring back a good-deal of general information concern it mr mcnair be the first european who have ever cross the hindu kush upon this line or have gain such a acquaintance with the different range as would enable geographer to map the country scientifically and delineate its physical feature the seal which mr mcnair have exhibit to the meeting be of babylonian workmanship and although relic of the same class be of no great rarity in persium and mesopotamium it be a curious circumstance to find one in such a remote locality as the swat valley and could only be explain by suppose it to have belong to one of alexander 's soldier who bring it from babylon eldr pottinger have find a similar relic at oba on he journey through the mountain from herat to kabul the tradition in the country have always be that the kafir whom mr mcnair visit be descend from alexander 's soldier but there be not in reality the slightest foundation for such a belief neither in language nor religion nor manners and custom be there the least analogy between the kafir and greek the various dialect speak by the tribe of the hindu kush include the kafir tongue be all of the perso-indian branch of the aryan family and show that the mountain must have be colonise during the successive migration of the aryan tribe from central asia to the southward it might perhaps be possible some day to affiliate the various tribe when the vocabulary have all be collect and compare by a good philological scholar but at present there be much uncertainty on the subject colonel yule have express he pride and satisfaction at mr mcnair 's success and have congratulate the society on the great feat of explore kafiristan for the first time have be accomplish by a english rather than by a russian geographer he -lrb- sir henry -rrb- would furnish a further source of gratulation by remark on the fact that on the very day when mr mcnair have relate to the meeting the incident of he most remarkable journey intelligence have be receive from the indian frontier of another surprising geographical feat have be achieve by a british officer who be already well know to the society and who be in fact the chief of the department to which mr mcnair belong he allude to the successful ascent of the great mountain of takht-i-suliman overlook the indus valley by major holdich of the indian survey department this mountain from its inaccessible position beyond we frontier and in the midst of lawless afghan tribe have long be the despair of geographer but major holdich with a small survey party have at length succeed in ascend it and be say to have triangulate from its summit over a area of 50000 square mile the survey department might well be proud of hold in its rank two such adventurous and accomplished explorer as major holdich and mr mcnair the president say that mr mcnair agree with sir henry rawlinson that the route he have describe would undoubtedly be the best into central asia but the account of the journey do not inspire he -lrb- the president -rrb- with any confidence as to immediate result in the future mr mcnair have to disguise himself as a mahommedan who be acceptable to the kafir and it do not appear that he have in any way facilitate the entrance into the country of any one who could not conceal he nationality the report famish by native explorer send from indium have however be fully establish by mr mcnair and it would therefore appear that the best way of solve the problem be to send educate native into kafiristan he be sure the meeting would heartily join in give a vote of thanks to mr mcnair for he interesting paper it will be notice by those who read the paper closely flow remarkably absent from it be all allusion to personal experience such as fatigue weariness physical discomfort sense of disappointment or other of the necessary incident of so toilsome a effort and long sacrifice as be the character of the man so be he paper simple direct without any of the exaggeration of peculiar feature in the exploration or rhetorical artifice of description to enhance the effect of the discovery of the traveller and with a entire suppression of himself for all that appear in the paper he might have be engage in the most enjoyable pursuit free from all personal risk or daily discomfort i desire to testify rather to what i know of the man himself during a close friendship of over eighteen year in youth he be very ardent and affectionate but as he advance in year the hardship of he life and the long period of solitude he pass through seem to mellow the natural demonstrativeness of he nature and he appear to I to have suffer that chasten which all man derive as they bless portion from communion with nature in she loving and silent mood the very ruggedness of mountain solitude speak to the heart of man with a solemnity no tongue can reach a subtle writer in the london _ spectator _ of the 14th September last in the course of a article on cloud have attempt to describe the idealise lesson of she work to the spirit of man as the tranquil rhythm of this fair nature the hurry throb of the human interest it measure there be the eternal poem of human life in this wise a subdue sweetness in william mcnair 's nature remain which be a transfiguration of he ardent buoyant somewhat impulsive early manhood on the cricket-field he be in he heartiest element man would make a scratch team at the sound of he voice just to be lead by he as captain no mean field or batsman he excel in bowl he resource in take wicket be only equal by the good temper with which adversary walk away from the field with they bat after that terrible mcnair have do for they score or they hope of one i have see he demoralise a whole team by the way in which he would take wicket after wicket within a hour by the artful way in which he adapt the style of he bowling to the character of the man who fence he at the wicket boy be simply enamoured of he for by that instinct which never fail the young he win they heartfelt devotion by he quick discernment of the weakness and proclivity of all the young with whom he ever come in contact i have see my youngest son -- a lad of eleven -- after year of separation from he when the boy meet he in london in 1884 nestle on he knee quite spontaneously to listen to some of he kafiristan exploit not touch on in he paper he beam manly laugh of amusement and tender compassion over the boy 's simplicity when ask by my ingenuous lad why he do not kill a lot of those fellow during those day of danger i fancy i see while i write indeed this keen participation in the nature and delight of the young be the secret of he success during the kafiristan exploration it be the touchstone of he sympathy with the various barbaric tribe with whom he have to come in contact and whose nature he do not require to learn for he have already sound all that be human in its touching variety love and sympathy for man as man could alone give this knowledge and furnish this magic key to heart in wild unknown no human system of mental training could ever do it in this connection i smile somewhat at dr leitner 's profound german dialectic in the discussion on the paper read by mcnair over the preliminary preparation in language and term require by a explorer to do he work effectively where man be equip by that instinctive faculty of accommodate himself to the man of all nation with they physical attribute and surroundings i think he may dispense in a large measure with the science of language as a open sesame nature have she own method this be more in the nature of a memoir purely personal in its detail give the characteristic of the man who perform a exploit deem by the royal geographical society worthy of the murchison grant i may be pardon for add a few private particulars of the event lead to the death of one so young and whose career be so full of promise at its earthly close during the summer of the year 1888 mcnair meet with a very serious horse accident one indeed that might with complete natural sequence have terminate he life on the spot the vicious horse of a friend he be ride to tame the brute -lrb- for he be a skilful horseman as well as good at sport -rrb- rear and fall over on he by the display of personal alacrity he manage to avoid vital injury but sufficient of the animal 's body come on he own to render it necessary that he should be carry home in a jhampan or sedan chair use in the mountain sanitarium of indium for the conveyance of lady a friend 's house in the neighborhood of the spot where the accident occur be of great use in restore he somewhat from the effect of the accident the kind friend who help he to undertake the journey to he house about a mile distant -lrb- carry in this way on man 's shoulder -rrb- do mr mcnair one of those service for which indium be renown as a land of friendly help the injury sustain internally nevertheless keep the patient in bed for a month and the nursing of a mother and sister bring he round sufficiently to enable he to do he work as usual to all appearance during the ensue winter he have very hard work which involve much exposure and he suffer exceedingly from the effect of that accident immediately after he feel indisposition of any kind he complain of a return of the pain due to the accident and there can be but little doubt that the inward injury then sustain have leave they mark though nominally heal 1888-9 be a severe winter in the mountain region of we frontier and a letter i have from mcnair in April 1889 -lrb- the last letter i ever receive from he -rrb- give some description of the vicissitude of temperature he have to undergo i give the letter in he own word in the appendix as a facsimile of he handwriting to show how precise a hand he write and as a memento of himself which some of he many friend might wish to cherish for i believe that in many respects handwriting bear marked characteristic of the quality of the individual here i will only extract the follow description of the trial my friend have to undergo in the matter of temperature in camp away from quetta and all means of procure supplies on the spot he write under date the 2nd of April 1889 : for the past fortnight i have have a rough time of it with rain wind and haze since yesterday there have be a change for the better so now i hope to push along with my observation just at present i be in a low valley and consequently the heat be somewhat try but in another fortnight i expect i shall be complain of it be a _ little bit _ too cold at a elevation of 10000 and odd i have little or no news to give as it be now some time since i see a pale face but somehow or another solitude have its charm for I the writer of that letter soon after apply for three month ' leave have experience broken health for some time previously in constant return of fever but owe to the delay that occur in get post letter despatch from the frontier away from post station and the circumlocution which be a feature in all great department of state mcnair do not get he leave sanction till sometime in July 1889 and he be not able to start from quetta for he mountain home in mussooree a distance of several day ' try journey until the early day of August the fond heart of a mother and sister that await he there have no knowledge of the dangerous character of the fever from which he have be suffer for nearly a fortnight before he start from quetta within a very few day after he arrival at mussooree the doctor hold a consultation over he case as the fever could not be subdue by any treatment try and then the truth that it be typhoid have to be acknowledge all that medical skill and affectionate nursing of devoted relative friend and a qualify nurse could do towards save the patient be do and hope be entertain of recovery till almost the last but three day before the fatal end hemorrhage of the intestine set in and then the medical attendant despaired mcnair himself speak soon after he arrival at mussooree of the hour of separation have come and ask for he brother george the suddenness of the end give all he friend a painful shock for many have not even hear that he be dangerously ill and as to the relative silent consternation for the moment be the only word that can adequately describe they desolation and sorrow a fervently attach younger brother george a popular member of the well-known firm of messr morgan and company the solicitor for the east indian railway company hurry up from calcutta on a telegram to join he family at mussooree but when he leave he do not know of he brother 's death it be only when he reach the foot of the mountain at a place call rajpore within two hour ' ride of mussooree where he inquire of the hotel manager if any recent news have be receive of he brother 's condition that he get news not only of he brother 's death but of he burial the railway journey from calcutta to mussooree be a long one of about a thousand mile but indian railway travel even at express speed do not exceed twenty-five mile a hour the sympathy experience by the sorrowing family from near and distant friend be beyond mere conventional word of condolence i have it from the member of the family themselves that they be comfort in a very real and essential manner by the tender and extremely touching devotion of they friend the depth of whose regard be then for the first time in many case discover rise above and beyond this general sympathy two proof come with a binding and endure force that mark they out for special mention they typify the two extreme of human life and the complexity of human relation on the one hand there be the perfect knowledge of every detail of daily life and sacrifice and the loyalty and enthusiasm that make such a life possible which _ share _ a life to the full means on the other there be the tender reverence breed of look up to something that seem better and higher than the common lot of man the two extreme i refer to be center in the man who have most scientific knowledge of william mcnair 's worth and the closest sympathy with he life namely colonel holdich of the royal engineer under whom mcnair serve and for whom i know mcnair have the highest admiration and the warmest personal regard and native subordinate mcnair have under he who love as only asiatic can love european whom they revere a intrepid explorer himself _ vide _ the announcement make regard colonel holdich by sir henry rawlinson at the close of the discussion on the paper read by mcnair colonel holdich have add year by year to he many signal scientific service render to the indian government and recently he have add to he many accomplishment the rarer merit among man of that love of worth in other which culminate in human brotherhood he word of appropriate oriental metaphor in write to the family that he sense of personal loss in the man with whom he have for year in the wildest solitude and the most prolonged hardship eat bread and salt together make it difficult for he to say all he feel be emphasise by the human grief he could not repress at the funeral where owe to the suddenness with which everything have happen he be indeed the chief mourner -- in touching emotion that bear witness to the depth and susceptibility of the man 's noble nature the other testimony which kindle great comfort in the desolate household come from the scene of mcnair 's latest exploit far away at and near quetta when he native companion and friend hear of he death the grief feel be so profound that it seem irreparable to the man who mourn they beloved friend as the leader who be also they constant companion and always cheerful with they under every adversity the oriental may be unappreciated by the saxon till the latter know the sentimental side of every asiatic character but then the floodgate of human sympathy be open and the very counterpart of characteristic and quality exhibit by saxon and asiatic conduce and contribute to a closer and more romantic union between they it be on the principle which bagehot so profoundly illustrate when he say that no age be just to the age immediately precede it because of they similarity and proximity the appreciation of colonel holdich for he value coadjutor and the executant of many of he plan be base on the contrary principle acutely observe on by george henry lewe when he remark that surprise like appreciation can only have for foundation of any worth a background of close observation and exact perception i state the simple truth when i record that the testimony receive in this way from the two extreme of highest knowledge and most diverse social and national condition remain the most grateful and enduring memorial of a life 's work to those who must ever cherish the memory of what this memoir be preclude from touch on namely the more sacred domestic endearment of the life-long devotion to family tie of a son and a brother this much i may be permit to reveal without any intrusion on the hallowed reserve of the family circle a more united or more tenderly-knit family of strong religious feeling i have never know i have the privilege twenty-one year ago of know a younger brother of the deceased name john who in less than three year attain to a honor position in the finance department of the indian government he be preternaturally grave and philanthrophic and die at the age of a youth in england -lrb- i think he be not 23 year old -rrb- of small-pox contract at lahore in the punjab where he be station at the time he have for some time although but a lad in year spend he leisure hour in attend the hospital and read to sick soldier where it be believe he contract the disease of the living conventional usage forbid all mention but i have deem it right to reproduce as appendix to this skeleton and imperfect memoir the notice that appear in the principal indian papers of william mcnair 's death as also the obituary notice take from the proceedings of the royal geographical society for October and November 1889 the extract reprint from the _ pioneer _ editorial give the most complete and faithful description of mr mcnair 's achievement during a too brief day of usefulness portion of that editorial need a pass word so far as the subject of this memoir be concern with regard to the disapproval of the indian government of mcnair 's venture in enter kafiristan without the permission of he government i never hear a word from he lip by way of complaint although no doubt the paper accurately describe the fact nor do i ever hear a syllable from the brave unselfish man of disappointment at the way in which he worldly prospects be never advance in the slightest by the nobly adventurous work he have do by nature he be too bent on do the work in hand to theorise about anything by character he be too loftily absorb in loyalty and reverence for the law of obedience as a root-principle of he life to deplore any want of appreciation of he worth on the part of the government which he have so loyally serve it be true as the pioneer point out that on the russian side such a man would have have honor and distinction shower upon he he would have be drag out of he retirement and make to feel he be the favorite of the monarch for the risk to life he have undertake in spontaneous devotion to the state not only be such warmth and enthusiasm not the english method but the indian government be a huge machine which go grind on in its mechanical way and be besides a bureaucracy which have a good deal of pride in regard any new departure as a dangerous token of disrespect to its old and consecrated tradition of simple obedience to write order and codify instruction the highest originality be smother in a secretariat as its fitting cabinet mcnair know these attribute of the indian government and never trouble he head about preferment or official promotion it be say he be on the eve of it and the state be believe to somewhat deplore the loss of a opportunity for reward a servant it prize doubtless in its own dull routine sort of way but he be now beyond earthly reward or distinction and neither the praise nor the blame of man can touch he in life he be very sensitive to kindness or coldness but he be of too masculine a fiber to allow the natural sweetness and contentment of he disposition to be alloyed or mar by any such influence from without he love he work for its own sake it become he sole occupation and serious aim in life he deplore the weather in he very last letter to I most characteristically because it interfere with he observation which with the change he hope for and partly realize he would _ push _ along the epithet describe the simple practical side of he character he later love of solitude be the natural outcome of that closer contact with nature which make to he a living daily reality the command thou shalt have no other god but I he last hour be minister to faithfully by a chaplain of the english church in mussooree the religious life of the family resign itself speedily to that sovereign will of heaven which mean to all who have taste of its majesty and glory and have see glimpse of the wisdom and foresight that put man 's desire to shame the submission of heart and mind in all they integrity nay more as one from that inner circle very beautifully put it in a letter to the writer of this memoir it be ` infinite love ' alone that permit he return to we to die surround by we love and in a lovely mountain region where for many year he spend he annual summer and autumn recess work out the result of the observation make during the rough winter 's campaign he lie bury near the home of he loved one there the eternal star give a more brilliant light to the pure air surround he last rest place and the solemn pine and fir point heavenwards with they venerable age and sigh they constant

explorer a man singularly frank and genial he be 33 year of age when he undertake the venture that win for he the medal and fellowship of the royal geographical society which be confer in 1884 in that year he have the satisfaction of lecture before british audience on the result of he travels and as it be the first time he have visit the land of he father the pleasure of see the old country under circumstance so honorable to himself be doubly keen the story of he adventure may be briefly tell every one know that the government of indium issue strict injunction against allow any european to cross the afghan frontier nevertheless that restless spirit sir charle mcgregor quartermaster-general be naturally anxious to know something of the debateable land that lie north of the kabul river and south of the hindoo koosh and which tradition allege to have be colonise by the soldier of the great alexander himself we have no doubt that mcgregor prompt the enterprise though mcnair never distinctly say that he have be urge by so high a officer to break the order of he official superior the affair be arrange in this way mcnair take furlough and cease for the moment to be a servant of government he disappear across the frontier and be not hear of again till he safe return be assure of course he have confederate one in particular a tribal chief whose friendship he have secure in the afghan campaign of 1878-79 he disguise be however pretty complete walnut juice be we believe the material that convert a florid complexion into the tan so natural to afghan mountaineer he have the wisdom to confine he word to a language he understand as well as english viz urdu and pose as a _ hukeem _ from indium impel by a spirit of benevolence to visit unknown land for the sake of care the ailment of he fellew creature have he attempt to talk pushtoo he foreign intonation would have be detect while he knowledge of that tongue enable he to detect the drift of any conversation that be carry on in he presence once we believe he be in imminent danger a proposal have be set on foot to put a end to the wanderings of the _ hukeem _ as a english spy a rapid change of quarter avert the danger and he afterwards fall in with the people he come to see viz the kafir who whether descend from alexander 's greek or not receive he kindly we believe the _ hukeem _ be aid in he research by a big book suppose to contain medical receipt but which be in reality a box of survey instrument its outside cover with cabalistic sign bear a family resemblance to a plane-table the _ hukeem _ be much give to solitary meditation and generally seek mountain peak for that purpose on such occasion the plane-table afford he invaluable assistance but we have say almost enough of poor mcnair 's adventure on he return he be order to simlum and officially reprimand by the viceroy lord ripon for disobedience of order he be console however by be tell by the same nobleman at a private interview that he pluck be admire while he fast friend sir charle mcgregor receive he with open arm such be the bright opening of a career that be so soon to be cut short at mussooree by typhoid fever mcnair be a favorite with both sex by the man he be adore on the cricket-field where he bowling be most effective while the girl who always possess second sight in the way of detect a good fellow when they see he love he _ en masse _ it may be some consolation to the widow mother now rob of she darling boy to know that there be heavy heart in other home besides she own -- the purest tribute that can be lay on the grave of one who be a good son as well as a gallant explorer we note that the fever of which he die be contract at quetta _ extract from _ the pioneer _ August 20th _ 1889 the late mr mcnair -- the life of some man be so intimately connect with certain phase in the general development of knowledge that they biography afford short but useful page in the history of progress which may well be read in connection with more stir national record thus it be with the life of a man who quietly pass from the subordinate branch of the survey department into the land of shadow on the 13th of this month at mussoorie at the commencement of the year of grace 1879 a little over ten year ago we be grope we way across the borderland which separate indium from turkistan in unhappy ignorance of all but two or three partially illustrated line of advance which might land we either at kabul or kandahar consider the vital importance that it always have be to india that at least a creditable knowledge of the country separate she from russium should exist the geographical mist which envelop the highland of afghanistan and the desert of baluchistan in 1879 be certainly remarkable it be true that the war of 1839-43 have bring to the front one or two notable geographer amongst whom north broadfoot and durand be conspicuous but it have also develop a host of inferior artist whose hazy outline and indefinite sketch tend most seriously to obscure the really trustworthy work of better man more a good deal be know about kandahar and kabul than of we present frontier opposite dera ismail or of the pass lead from bannu across the border only a few mile distant indeed so far as that frontier be concern from peshawar to sind no military knowledge of it exist whatever it be with the gradual evolution of light over these dark place that mcnair 's name be so closely associate for many year previous to the afghan war he have be make himself thoroughly acquaint with modern survey instrument of precision which be to the scientific weapon of we forefather of fifty year ago what the gatle and henry-martini be to the old brown bess he be one of the first to grasp the true principle of use the plane-table when rapid action be necessary and right well he turn he knowledge to account it be the advance on kabul in 1879 that first introduce he to the notice of military authority and in the course of that year 's campaign he have add more to we map information than all the geographer of the old afghan war put together some of he exploit be remarkable as for instance when he explore the adrak badrak pass lead from the lughman valley to jugdalak with no military escort whatever trust only to the tender mercy of a aboriginal guard he thus make himself acquaint with every detail of the direct road from kabul _ via _ the kabul river to jalalabad and with he we practical acquaintance with that important route have pass away no sooner have he leave afghanistan than he be attach to the frontier party then work in the kohat district there he be major holdich 's right-hand man if there be a specially hard frontier nut to be crack mcnair 's power of assimilate himself to pathan manners and of win the confidence of all class of native which have already carry he through many a perilous undertaking be most fully utilise for the purpose of crack it from kohat to dera ismail he be incessantly engage in quiet little unobtrusive excursion -lrb- with full political sanction _ bien entendu _ -rrb- which result in a very complete map of the border a map which it will be hard to supersede there be one particularly awkward corner of we frontier -- awkward from a military as well as geographical point of view -- which thrust itself forward over the general line into british territory and which can never fail to attract the attention of the frontier traveller this be the rocky fastness of kafir koh from red salt hill south of bahadur khel the three-headed peak of kafir koh be see stand up like a monument in the southern distance : nor be it less a conspicuous feature when view to the north from the bannu road at the back of it to the west be the direct road connect the upper meranzaus valley with the bannu district of which the existence be know but not the nature when mcnair take it in hand up the sheer face of that square-cut peak compose chiefly of shift sand and pebble which overtop the rest mcnair do he best to climb he do not succeed for the reason that no living thing without wing have probably ever succeed in surmount it although there be a legend to the effect that a specially active wazirus robber do once contrive to reach the top -- and there remain to starve but the english explorer at least get far up enough to obtain the clear view he require and he come back richer in wisdom to the extent of many square mile of most remarkable map he name soon become well know on the border especially amongst the waziri and so much do they appreciate he own appreciation of themselves that there be a story current that one well-known mahsud chieftain stop a punjab cavalry detachment near the border line and demand a passport order from mcnair perhaps he best achievement about this part of he career be the mapping of all the approach to and the general feature of the lower tochus valley in 1883 he conceive the bold scheme of take leave and explore kaffiristan in disguise trust to the good fellowship of certain pathan friend amongst whom two member of the kakur khel be chief it be a bold scheme for many reason the physical difficulty of the project be many the impossibility of keep up a continuous disguise be well know to he and last but not least what would government say for fear of involve other in any venture of he own he resolve to cut himself adrift from he department for the time be and take he chance in order to appreciate properly the spirit of enterprise which animated the man critic of he action should put themselves in he place he be well aware that the information which he could obtain would be of the highest value further he know that probably there be not another man in indium who could obtain it as successfully as himself and he judge that some slight exception might be make in he favor if he take on himself the responsibility of accept a most favourable opportunity of do most valuable work at the expense of infringe certain rule about cross the border these rule be to say the least vague and indefinite and have never be officially promulgate reward or recognition of service he rightly never expect it must fairly be concede that the condition under which such a spirit of enterprise be show make that spirit especially honorable -- for the government of indium have never be in a position to encourage any such venture on the contrary the possible gain in information have always be hold to be more than counterbalance by the chance of complication lord lytton ever ready to bewail the decadence of a soldierly spirit of enterprise amongst we officer be yet never quite able to see he way to make such enterprise possible to a man who value he commission lord ripon under whose rule indeed more geographical work be complete than under any previous viceroy be apt to regard the line of frontier peak and pass much as a careful gardener regard a row of beehive -- as subject of tender treatment and watchful care : whilst lord dufferin have lately with one wide sweep remove the great incentment to all exploration enterprise by make the result thereof strictly confidential these be cloudy condition under which to grow a true spirit of enterprise and where it here and there crop up and flourish in spite of circumstance it be surely all the more to be commend the story of mcnair 's journey to kaffiristan need not be tell here it be not make strictly confidential in those day and it will be find in the chronicle of the royal geographical society for this performance he obtain the murchison grant of the society and on the strength of it he may be say to have take he place amongst the first geographer of the day he frontier work do not end here for the last two year he be engage on the most try work of carry a first class triangulation series from the indus at dera ghazus khan across the intervene mountain mass to quetta thence to be extend to the khojak a work which involve continuous strain of mountain climbing of residence with insufficient cover in intensely cold and high elevated spot and the unending worry of keep up the necessary supplies both of food and water for he party no doubt it try he constitution severely and a hot weather at quetta be unfortunately not calculate to restore a impaired constitution although very ill he determine to leave quetta when he leave become due and he make he way with difficulty to mussoorie to die amongst he own people mcnair belong to a department which be not great in distinction and decoration and be connect with no celestial brotherhood indeed it have no dealings with star but such as be of god 's own making -- and he belong to what by grace of official courtesy be call the subordinate branch out of it he never rise though have he live on the russian side of the border he career might well have bring he high military rank and decoration in string across he uniform they say that decoration be cheap there yet it should be remember that zeal industry enterprise and patriotism be cheap too if they be to be win by they perhaps we manage better the good old copybook maxim virtue be its own reward must be mcnair 's epitaph whilst we can not help feeling that indium could have better spare many a bigger man _ extract from _ the statesman _ August 27th _ 1889 by the death of mr mcnair of the survey department a most valuable officer have be lose to the government of indium and a contributor to we geographical knowledge of afghanistan it be difficult to estimate the value of he service as they have never be bring prominently into notice like those of other who have live in the sunshine of official favor we believe that as in many similar case the public record of he work be nothing to what he really do in the service of geography without any official publicity or recognition of the fact whatever from what we know of he life 's work we can gather information that be amply sufficient to entitle mr mcnair to be place in the front rank of geographer in respect as a contemporary remark of that borderland which separate indium from turkestan it be say of mr mcnair that in the course of the afghan campaign in 1879 he add more to the sum of we knowledge of afghanistan than all the geographer of the old afghan war put together while some of he exploit in surmount what appear to be absolutely insuperable difficulty make he take rank with the great geographer of he day he work in the kohat district be especially valuable although it never we believe receive the official recognition it deserve thanks to he excursion and observation we have as the _ pioneer _ justly observe a complete map of the border a map which it will be hard to supersede he journey to kaffirstan result in some valuable contribution to we knowledge of that region but the condition of government service unfortunately prevent he receive the reward which he would have secure as a matter of course have he be the servant of a power more quick and more liberal in its recognition of merit as the _ pioneer _ happily remark mr mcnair belong to a department which be not great in distinction and decoration and be connect with no celestial brotherhood indeed it have no dealings with star but such as be of god 's own making -- and he belong to what by grace of official courtesy be call the ` subordinate ' branch out of it he never rise though have he live on the russian side of the border he career might well have bring he high military rank and decoration in string across he uniform by he death indium lose a valuable public servant and that loss we venture to say will be more deeply feel should complication arise on the frontier when the knowledge experience and ability of man like mr mcnair will be the primary condition of success in any operation in that quarter we do not know whether we should regret of any man that he do hot receive the full meed of the success achieve by he in he life career amongst he fellow certain it be that it be but defer to the general audit of every man 's claim for the hard and thorough work he have do to the generation from which he have pass away but to which and to its successor he have leave a example for they to emulate and if they can -- surpass _ extract from _ the time _ 10th September _ 1889 the indian mail bring

we be sorry to have to record the death of this distinguished member of the indian survey who have die at mussooree of typhoid fever he have be twenty-two year in the survey department and have do good service particularly during the afghan war of 1878-79 when he work lay along the valley of the kabul river and during the last two year in which he have be extend a series of triangle from the british frontier at dera ghazus khan by the direct route across the suliman mountain to quetta and the khojak amran but he most conspicuous piece of work be he journey -lrb- in the disguise of a native doctor -rrb- into kafiristan in 1883 a achievement which gain for he the murchison grant of the royal geographical society and which stand quite alone as unless russian explorer have recently succeed in enter the country there be no record of any other european ever have do so major biddulph have visit chitral but mr mcnair have not only reach that town by way of the swat river and dir but cross the mountain to the west which divide the valley of the kashkar or chitral river from that of the arnawaus he report that he be kindly receive by the villager of the lut-dih district who belong to the bashgal tribe of kafir the valley be important for along it there run a direct and comparatively easy route from badakshan to jelalabad no doubt he would have explore the country more fully but owe to the conduct of a native who maliciously spread about the report of he be a british spy mr mcnair be force to abandon further attempt he ascend however to the dora pass over the hindu kush

holdich re send we from indium the follow additional detail regard the career of mr mcnair briefly notice in we last issue : -- amongst the many practical geographer who have pass away during the year 1889 be mr w mcnair of the indian survey department he career be very closely connect with a new phase of military exploration carry out on the frontier of indium which have gradually supersede the older form of reconnaissance and be render possible by late improvement in the smaller class of instrument and a wider knowledge of the use of the plane-table for about ten year previous to the afghan war of 1879 mcnair be attach to the topographical branch of the indian survey and he have always show a special aptitude for that class of work which consist in acquire a comprehensive grasp of a wide field of geographical detail in the shortest possible space of time when war break out afghanistan no longer afford a field for such simple geographical exploration as have already be accomplish during the campaign of 1839-43 a completer military survey of all important district be require which would furnish detailed information of route and pass which be far remove from the beaten track of previous army at the same time the condition under which such a survey be to be make be exactly the same as those under which the rough reconnaissance of the former campaign be obtain the surveyor be under the same urgent restriction both as to time and as to the limit of he own movement off the direct line of march mcnair with one or two other be select for this topographical duty with the afghan field force and right good use he make of he opportunity he be present during the fighting which take place before kabul in the winter of 1879-80 and be shut up with the garrison of sherpur during the fortnight 's siege he energy and determination carry he through the campaign with more than credit -- he be able to illustrate modern method of field topography in a manner which throw new light on what be then but a tentative and undeveloped system he be one of the first to prove the full value of the plane-table in such work as this for it must be remember that he be work in a country peculiarly favourable to the application of a system of graphic triangulation and very different to the densely forest-clad mountain of the eastern frontier into which the plane-table have be carry before with advance brigade at the close of the war which bring no recognition of he exceptional service he be appoint to the kohat survey party which be primarily raise for the mapping of the kohat district but which afford occasional opportunity for extend topography across the border when this party be first raise we frontier map be of the most elementary character there be many a wide blank in the topography of the lower borderland and geographical darkness shroud nearly the whole line of frontier mountain the hostility of the border people have always be such that it be a matter of considerable risk to approach they but the temper of the tribe be then rapidly change with the time and mcnair rapidly succeed in establish himself on a friendly footing with frontier robber chief whose assistance be invaluable in arrange short excursion across the line by means of which he be able to complete a fairly accurate map of most of the border country no work that ever he accomplish have be of more value to the government of indium than this unobtrusive frontier map it be whilst he be thus occupy between peshawur and dera ismail khan that he make the acquaintance of certain influential man of the kaken khel who offer to see he safely through the dangerous district outlying kaffirstan and give he the opportunity of be the first european to set he foot in that land of romance the snow-capped summit of some of the more southerly peak of kaffirstan have be see and fix by mcnair during the progress of the afghan campaign and it have ever be a dream with he to reach those mighty spur and tear those peak to account by use they as the basis of a topographical map of the country he do reach they as the record of the rg sufficiently show and he may fairly claim to be the first englishman to lift even a corner of the veil of mystery which have ever shroud that inaccessible country so far as its topographical conformation be concern this excursion win for he the murchison grant of the society and establish he position as a lead practical geographer for the last few year of he life he have be almost incessantly occupy in the rough work of frontier survey which he knowledge of frontier people and power of win they confidence and help especially fit he to undertake at the time of he death he be employ in the baluchistan survey party in the completion of a triangulation series which should carry the great indian system to the kojak range and furnish a scientific and highly accurate base for future extension into afghanistan this be a duty which severely tax even he vigorous constitution it involve incessant labor in examine lofty mountain peak in order to select suitable site for station and subsequently day and night of anxious watch during the progress of the observation whilst food and water -lrb- when snow be not lie on the ground -rrb- be scarce and mist and cloud hang round the mountain no doubt it try he hard and when typhoid attack he at quetta he seem unable to make a good fight for he life he be able however to reach mussoorie where he die on the 13th August leave a gap in the department which he serve so well which it will be
