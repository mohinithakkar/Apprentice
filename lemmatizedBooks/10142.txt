whatever mr apollonie lightly shrug she shoulder but say no more but mother what can the talk come from then when there be no foundation for it as you say ask kurt who could not let the matter rest there be no real foundation for the talk the mother reply and no one of all those who talk have ever see the apparition with he own eye it be always other people who tell and those have be tell again by other that something uncanny have be see at the castle the talk first start from a misfortune which happen year ago and later on the matter come up and people think a similar misfortune have take place again although this be a absolutely false report all the old story be bring up again and the talk become livelier than ever but people who know better should be very emphatic in suppress it what

a smile the child might have hear you mention spain yourself so that it rouse she imagination she probably hear in school about the country and she wish to go there only show that she be extremely attentive to think out how she might get there some time be a very innocent pleasure which you can indulge i agree with you that child should be bring up in a strict and orderly way because they might

middle of a heap of clothes she head thrust far into a wardrobe apparently she be still pull out more thing you certainly be do something wonderful say lippo glance with he big eye at the clothes on the floor i be do the right thing say mäzli now in the most decide tone kurt have say that we must send the poor people some clothes so we must take they all out and lay together everything we do not need any more mama will be glad when she have no more to do about it and they can be send away to-morrow now get you thing too and we 'll put they all in a heap the matter however seem still rather doubtful to lippo standing thoughtfully before all the little skirt and jacket he feel that this would not be quite after he mother 's wish when we want to do something with we clothes we always have to ask mother he begin again but mäzli do not answer and only pull out a bunch of woolen stocking and a heavy winter cloak spread everything on the floor no i will not do it say lippo again after scrutinize the unusual performance you do not want to do it because you be afraid it will be too much work mäzli assert with a face quite red with zeal i 'll help you when i be do here i will not do it anyhow lippo repeat resolutely i will not because we be not allow to mäzli find no time to persuade he further as she begin to hunt for she heavy winter shoe which be still in the wardrobe but before she have bring they forth to the light the door open and the mother be look full of horror at the devastation but child what a horrible disorder she cry out and on Sunday morning too what have make you do it what be this wild dry-goods shop on the floor now you see mäzli say lippo not without show great satisfaction at have so clearly prove that he have be in the right mäzli try with all she might to prove to she mother that she intention have solely be to save she the work necessary to get the thing together but the mother now explain decidedly to the little girl that she never need to undertake such action in the future as she could not possibly judge which clothes she still need and which could be give away mäzli be also tell that such help on she part only result in double work for she mother besides i can see mäzli the mother conclude that you great zeal seem to come from a wish to get rid of all the thing you do not like to wear yourself all you woolen thing which you always say scratch you skin so you do not mind if other child have they mäzli they might like they better than to be cold be mäzli 's opinion oh mother mr knippel be come up the road toward we house i be sure she be come to see we say lippo who have go to the window and i have not even take my thing off on account of you disorder here say the mother a little frightened mäzli go and greet mr knippel and take she into the front room tell she that i have just come from church and that i shall come directly mäzli run joyfully away the errand seem to please she she receive the guest with excellent manners and lead she into the front room to the sofa for mäzli know exactly the way she mother always do then she give she mother 's message very well very well and what do you want to do on this beautiful Sunday the lady ask take a walk mäzli answer rapidly be they still lock up she then casually ask who who whom do you mean and the lady look somewhat disapprovingly at the little girl edwin and eugen mäzli answer fearlessly i should like to know where you get such idea the lady say with grow irritation i should like to know why the boy should be lock up because they be so mean to loneli all the time mäzli declare the mother enter now to she friendly greet she only receive a very cold reply i only wonder mr rector the guest begin immediately in a irritated manner what meanness that little poison-toad of a lonelus have spread and invent about my boy but i wonder still more that some people should believe such thing mr maxa be very much astonished that she visitor should have already hear what have take place the night before as she know that she son would not speak of it of they own free will as long as you know about it already i shall tell you what happen she say you have apparently be misinform it have nothing to do whatever with a meanness on lonelus 's part mäzli please join the other child and stay there till i come the mother interrupted herself turn to the little girl whose eye have be expectantly glue on the visitor 's face in the hope of hearing if the two boy be still lock up mäzli walk away slowly still hope that she would hear the news before she reach the door but mäzli be doom to be disappoint as no word be speak then mr maxa related the incident of the evening before as it occur that be nothing at all say the district attorney 's wife in answer those be only childish joke all child hold out they foot sometimes to trip each other such thing should not be reckon as fault big enough to scold child for i do not agree with you say mr maxa such kind of joke be very much akin to roughness and from small cruelty larger one soon result lonelus have really suffer harm from this action and i think that joke cease under such circumstance as i say it be not worth the trouble of lose so many word about i feel decidedly that too much fuss be make about the grandmother and the child apollonie do not seem to get it out of she head that she name be castle-apollonie and she carry she head so high that the child will soon learn it from she but i have come to talk with you about something much more important the visitor now give she listener some information that seem to be far from please to mr maxa because the face of the latter become more and more worried all the time mr knippel and she husband have come to the conclusion that the time have come when they son should be send to the neighboring town in order to enter the lowest class of the high school the rector 's teaching have be sufficient till now but they feel that the boy have outgrow he and belong to a more advanced school so they have decide to find a good board place for the three boy together as bruno would naturally join they in order that they could remain together since the three would in later year have great authority in the little community it would be splendid if they be educate alike and could agree thoroughly in everything my husband mean to go to town in the near future and look for a suitable house where they can board the speaker conclude i be sure that you will be grateful if the question be solve for bruno as you would otherwise be oblige to settle it yourself frau maxa 's heart be very heavy at this news she already see the consequence and picture the terrible scene that would result if the three boy be oblige to live closely together the thought of send bruno away from home already trouble I greatly she say finally i do not see the necessity for it we rector who have offer to teach they out of pure kindness mean to keep the boy under he care till a year from next spring they be able to learn plenty still from he however if you have resolve to send you son away i shall be oblige to do the same as the rector could not continue the lesson for bruno alone mr maxa decline the offer of she visitor to look up a dwelling-place for bruno as she have to talk the matter over first with she brother he be always she counsellor in these thing because he be the child 's guardian the district attorney 's wife do not seem gratify with this information as she be anxious to have the matter settle then and there she remark rather sarcastically that a mother should be able to decide such matter alone the boy be sensible enough to behave properly without be constantly watch she add i can certainly say that mine be and where two hold to the right path a third be sure to follow my eldest be never one to follow blindly mr maxa say with animation i should not wish it either in this case i shall keep he at home as long as it be possible for I and after that i shall send he away under god 's protection just as you say the other lady utter rise and take leave we can talk the question of board over again another time she remark as she be go away when the time come my husband 's preparation for the future will be welcome i be sure when the mother after escort she guest come back to the child 's room mäzli immediately call out do she say if the two be still lock up what be you invent mäzli say the mother you probably do not know yourself what it mean oh yes i know mäzli assure she i ask she if the boy be still lock up because kurt say that kurt laugh out loud : oh you naughty child to talk so wild because i say that those two ought to be lock up mäzli run over and immediately ask they mother that question mr maxa now understand clearly where she visitor have hear about she boy 's behavior of yesterday mäzli she say admonishingly have you forget that you be not to ask question of grown-up people who come to see I but why should not i ask what the locked-up child be do mäzli declare feign great pity in she voice now the foxy little thing want to incline mother to be comfort by pretend to pity they kurt declare suddenly a terrific shout of joy sound from all voice at once as they all call : uncle phipp uncle phipp in a moment they have disappear through the door kurt jump out through the window which be not dangerous for he and be the shortest way to the street the mother also run outside to greet uncle phipp who be she only brother he live on he estate in sil valley which

from both side uncle philip laugh : i be glad you be so just to I mrs apollonie even when you scold the falcon properly for tramp down you plant you know that it be not in maliciousness he do it but in self-defence i be afraid it be time to go now and with these word he heartily shake he old acquaintance by the hand the two little one who have never leave he side be ready immediately to strike out once more they soon reach the hill and the castle which be bath in the soft evening light lay openly before they a hushed silence reign about the gray building and the old pine tree under the tower whose branch lay trail on the ground for year no human hand have touch they where the bloom garden have be wild bush and weed cover the ground the mother and uncle settle down on a tree-trunk look in silence towards the castle while the child be hunting for strawberry on the sunny incline how terribly desert and lonely it all look uncle philip say after a while let we go back when the sun

exclaimed you know that we hear age ago that he be a entirely broken man and that he lay deadly sick in malaga mr tillman who go to spain must certainly know about it restless baron bruno have probably find he last resting-place long ago why should you look for he here i only think that in that case a new owner of the place would have turn up by now be he sister 's opinion two young member of the family the child of salo and eleanor be still alive i wonder where these child be they would be the sole owner after they uncle 's death they have long ago be disinherit the brother exclaim i do not know where they be but i have a idea on that subject i shall tell you about it to-night when we be alone here you be so absent-minded you throw worried look in all direction as if you be afraid that this perfectly solid meadow be a dangerous pond into which you little brood might fall and lose they life the child have scatter in all direction bruno have go far to one side and be deeply immerse in a little book he have take with he mea have discover the most beautiful forget-me-not she have ever see in all she life which grow in large mass beside the gurgling mountain stream beside

study the castle as if something special be to be discover there mäzli have discover some strawberry have pull lippo along with she she want he to pick those she have find while she hunt for more in the meantime the mother be very busy keep a eye on they all kurt might become too daring in he climb feat mäzli might run away too far and lippo might put he strawberry into he trousers-pocket as he have do once already and cause great harm to he little Sunday suit you fuss and worry too much about the child uncle philip say just let the child simply grow say to they once in a while ` if you do not behave you 'll be lock up ' yes that certainly sound simple say he sister it be a pity you have no brood of you own to bring up philip as lively as mine and each child entirely different from the other so that one have to be urge to a thing that another have to be keep from i get the care without look for they a new great worry have come to I to-day which even you will not be able to just push aside mr maxa tell she brother now about the morning 's interview with the wife of the district attorney she tell he of the problem she have with bruno 's further education because the lesson he have be have from the rector would end in the fall and of she firm intention of keep he from live together with he two present comrade the three have never yet come together without bring as a result some mean deed on one side and a explosion of rage on the other do not you think philip that it will be a great care for I to think that the three be live under one roof do not you think so yourself mr maxa conclude oh maxa that be a old story there have be boy at all time who fight together and then make peace again philip that do not console I the sister answer that have never be bruno 's way at all he never fight that way but it be hard to tell what he might do in a fit of anger at some injustice or meanness and that be what frighten I so he godfather of the same name have probably pass that on to he nobody more than you maxa have always try to wash he clean and excuse he for all he deed of anger in you indestructible admiration uncle philip get no further as all the child now come run toward they the two little one both try hard to put the biggest strawberry they have find into the mouth of they mother and uncle mea could not hold she magnificent bunch of forget-me-not near enough

uncle rise from they seat and the whole group start down the mountainside the two little one be gaily trot beside the uncle burst into wild shout now and then for he make such leap that they fly high into the air sometimes he hold they so firmly however that they always reach the ground safely at the entrance to the house kurt have a brilliant idea oh mother he call out excitedly over the prospect tonight we must have the story of the wallerstätten family it will fit so well because we be able to see the castle today with all its gable embrasure and battlements but the mother answer : i be sorry to say we can not uncle be here today and as he have to leave early tomorrow morning i have to talk to he tonight you have to go to bed early otherwise you will be too tired to get up tomorrow after you long walk oh what a shame what a shame kurt lament he be still hope that he would find out something in the story about the ghost of wildenstein despite the fact that one could not really believe in he sit on the tree that afternoon he have be lose in speculation as to where the ghost might have appear when the mother go to mäzli 's bed that night to say prayer with she she find she still very much excite as usual by the happening of the day she always find it difficult to quiet the little girl but to-day she seem fill by very vivid impression now that everything be still they seem to come back to she mäzli sit straight up in she bed with shine eye as soon as she mother appear why be the knippel-soup allow to spoil apollonie 's Sunday peace she cry out where have you hear that mäzli the mother say quite frightened she already see the moment before she when mäzli would tell the district attorney 's wife that new appellation you must never use that expression any more mäzli you see nobody would be able to know what you mean kurt invent it apparently when apollonie speak about have so much to swallow he should not have say it do you understand mäzli that you must not say it any more yes but why be anyone allow to spoil apollonie 's Sunday peace mäzli persevere apollonie be she special friend whom she want to keep from harm no one should do it mäzli the mother reply it be wrong to spoil anybody 's Sunday peace and no one should do it but we good god should quickly call down ` do not do it do not do it ' then they would know that they be not allow be mäzli 's opinion he do it mäzli he do it every time anybody do wrong say the mother for the evil-doer always hear such a voice that call out to he : ` do not do it do not do it ' but sometimes he do it in spite of the voice even young child like you mäzli hear the voice when they feel like do wrong and they do wrong just the same i only wonder why god do not punish they right away he ought to do that mäzli eagerly reply but he do say the mother as soon as anybody have do wrong he feel a great weight on he heart so that he keep on think ' i wish i have not do it ' then we good god be good and merciful to he and do not punish he further he give he plenty of time to come to he and tell he how sorry he be to have do wrong god give he the chance to beg he pardon but if he do not do that he be sure to be punish so that he will do more and more evil and become more terribly unhappy all the time i 'll look out too now if i can hear the voice be mäzli 's resolution the chief thing be to follow the voice mäzli say the mother but we must be quiet now say you prayer darling then you will soon go to sleep mäzli say she little prayer very devoutly as there be nothing more to trouble she she lay

word to a little fellow who have the right on he side and need to have the other side show to he too he be terribly pedantic besides and say that one can not sing a morning song in the evening and when he begin to wail in he helplessness it make I miserable how should one always just be able to say the right word he sister smile do you admit now philip that bring up child be not a very simple matter there be a truth in what you say on the other hand it do not look very terrible either the brother say with a glance at mäzli who be quietly and peacefully sit at the table eat she bread and

but very strange i can tell you though because i do not believe it myself max tell that he father say there be something wrong about the coach and that he go far out of its way the coachman look as if he only have half a head and he coat-collar be roll up terribly high in order to hide what be below he be wildly beat the horse so that they fairly fly up the castle-hill while spark of fire be fly from they hoof how can you tell such rubbish kurt how should there be something unnatural in such a sight the mother scold he i be sure you think that the wildenstein ghost be wander about again you can see every day that horse ' hoof give out spark when they strike stone and to see a coachman with a roll up collar in windy weather be not a unusual sight either in spite of all i say to you kurt you seem to do nothing but occupy yourself with this matter can not you let the foolish people talk without repeat it all the time kurt be very glad when mea enter at that moment for he have really disobey he mother 's repeat instruction in the matter but he comfort himself with the thought that he be only act accord to she idea if he be finally able to prove to the people that the whole thing be a pure invention and could get rid of the whole thing for good why be you eye all swollen he accost he sister mea explode now half angry and half complain she still have to fight against she tear oh mother if you only know how difficult it be to stay friend with elvira whenever i do anything to offend she she sulk and will not have anything to do with I for day when i want to tell she something and run towards she speak a little hurriedly she be hurt then she always say i spoil the flower on she hat because i shake they and then she turn she back on I and will not even speak to I indeed i have see that long ago kurt break in and i begin a song about she yesterday it ought to be sing to she i 'll recite it to you : a song about a well know young lady i know a maiden fair of face who mostly turn she back all noise she think a great disgrace but trick she do not lack no kurt you must not go on with that song mea cry with indignation mea be right when she do not want you to celebrate she friend in that way kurt say the mother and if she ask you to you must leave off but i be she brother and i do not wish to see my sister be tyranize over and treat badly by a friend i certainly would not call she a real friend kurt eagerly exclaim i should be only too glad if my song make she so angry that she would break the friendship entirely there would be nothing to mourn over mea however fight passionately for she friend and never give way till kurt have promise not to go on with he ditty but she mother want to know now what have give mea such red eye so she tell they that she have follow lonelus in order to comfort she for she be still cry lonelus have tell she then about be catch at chatter elvira who be lonelus 's neighbor have ask she if she would be allow to go to sil on dedication day next Sunday and lonelus have answer no then elvira want to know why not to which lonelus have promise to give she a answer after school as they be not allow to talk in school that moment the teacher have question they and lonelus have promptly accuse herself do not you think mother that elvira should have admit that she ask lonelus a question then lonelus would not have have to sit on the shame-bench alone he might have give they both a different punishment mea say quite work up oho now she send lonelus to the shame-bench besides and lonelus be a friend of mine kurt throw in now she 'll get more verse after all elvira should certainly have do so the mother affirm yes and listen what happen afterwards mea continue with more ardor than before i run from lonelus to elvira but i be still able to hear poor lonelus 's sob for she be awfully afraid to go home she know that she have to tell she grandmother about it and she be sure that that would bring she a terrible punishment when i meet elvira i tell she that it be unfair of she not to accuse herself and to let loneli bear the punishment alone that make she fearfully angry she say that i be a pleasant friend indeed if i wish this punishment and shame upon she she should not have say that mother should she i tell she that the matter be easy enough for she as it be all settle for she but not for lonelus i ask to tell the teacher how it all happen so that he could say something in school and let the child know what answer lonelus have give she then he would see that she be innocent but elvira only grow angrier still and tell I that she would look for another friend if i choose to preach to she she say that she do not want to have anything to do with I from now on and turn about run away so much the better kurt cry out now you will not have to run humbly after elvira any more as if you be always in the wrong the way you usually do to win she precious favor why should not mea meet she friend kindly again if she want to kurt say the mother elvira know well enough who have be offend this time and have break off the friendship she will be only too glad when mea meet she half-way kurt be begin another protest but it be not hear lippo and mäzli arrive at that moment loudly announce the important news that kathy be go to serve the soup in a moment and that the table be not even set the mother have put off preparation for dinner on purpose during the foregoing conversation she have repeatedly glance towards the little garden gate to see if bruno be not come but he could not be see yet so she begin to set the table with mea while lippo too assist she the little boy know exactly where everything belong he put it there in the most orderly fashion and when mea put a fork or spoon down quickly a little crookedly he straightway put they perfectly straight the way they belong kurt laugh out loud oh lippo you must become a inn-keeper then all you table will look as if they have be measure out with a compass leave lippo alone say the mother i wish you would all do you little task as carefully as he do dinner be over and the mother be look out towards the road in greater anxiety but bruno have not come now he come with a big whip kurt shout suddenly something must have happen for one do not usually need a whip in school the younger boy open the door full of expectation bruno could not help notice he mother 's frightened expression despite the rage he be in which plainly show in he face he exclaim as he enter i 'll tell you right away what happen mother so that you will not think it be still worse i have only whip they both as they deserve that be all but bruno that be bad enough you seem to get more savage all the time the mother lament how could you do such a thing i 'll explain it right away and then you will have to admit that it be the only thing to do bruno assure she the two tell I last Saturday that they have a scheme for to-day in which i be to join they have discover that the lovely plum in the rector 's garden be ripe and they mean to steal they when the rector be through with he lesson at twelve o'clock he always go to the front room and then nobody know what be go on in the garden they plan be to use this time to-day in order to shake the tree and fill they pocket full of plum i be to help they i tell they what a disgrace it be for they to ask I and i say that i would find means to prevent it so they noisily call I a traitor and tell I that accuse they be worse than steal plum i say that it be not my intention to tell on they but i would come and use my whip as soon as they touch the tree so they laugh and sneer at I and say that they be neither afraid of I nor of my whip as soon as we lesson be do at twelve o'clock they run to the garden and get the whip i have hide in the hallway i run after they edwin be already half way up the tree and eugene be just begin to climb it first i only threaten and try in that way to force edwin down and keep eugene from go further but they keep on sneer at I till edwin have reach the first branch and be shake it so hard that the lovely plum come spatter to the ground i get so furious at that that i begin to beat first the boy higher up and then the lower one first edwin tumble down on top of eugene and then they both run away moan while i keep on strike they they leave the plum on the ground and i follow they it be terrible bruno that such scene have to come up between you all the time the mother lament you be always the one who get wild and lose control it be hard to excuse that even if you intention be good bruno i wish i could keep you boy apart it be a good thing he become furious at they to-day mother kurt remark you see it show that even two can not get the better of he if he have not be so mad the two would have be stronger and we poor rector would have lose he plum it be hard to tell if this explanation comfort the mother she have go out with a sign to attend to bruno 's belated lunch the time be already near at hand when all the child have to get back to school when that same evening the little one be happily play and the big child be busy with they school work kurt steal up to he mother 's chair and ask she in a low voice shall we have the story to-day the mother nod as soon as the little one be in bed at this mäzli prick up she ear when all the work be do in the evening all the family usually play a game together kurt who be usually the first to pack up he papers be still scribble away after mea have lay hers away look over he shoulder into the note-book she exclaim he be write some verse again who be the subject of you song kurt i 'll read it to you then you can guess yourself say the boy the first verse be already write somewhere else now listen to the second she stare about with stately mien : o ho just look at I if i be not acknowledge queen i surely ought to be she friend agree with patient air and fasten up she shoe then queenie think : that be only fair she could not well refuse but if the friend should try to show the queen she fault look out she would break the friendship at a blow and straightway turn about mea have be oblige to laugh a little at first at the description of the humble behavior which do not seem to describe she very well finally however sad memory rise up in she do you know mother she cry out excitedly it be not the worst that she show I she back but that one can not ever agree with she every time i find anything pleasant and good she say the opposite and when i say that something be wrong and horrid she will not be of my opinion either it be so hard to keep she friendship because we always seem to quarrel when i have not the slightest desire to just let she go she be the same as she brother say bruno i never want they friendship again and i wish i might never have anything more to do with they it be better to give they thing the way you do to-day kurt remark i can understand mea say the mother as soon as we come here she try to get elvira 's friendship she long for friendship more than you do oh mother i have six or eight friend here that be not so bad kurt declare i could not say much for any of they bruno say quickly it must hurt mea the mother continue that elvira do not seem to be capable of friendship you only act right in tell she what you consider wrong mea if you show you attachment to she and try not to be hurt by little difference of opinion you friendship might gradually improve as lippo and mäzli feel that the time for the general game have come they come up to they mother to declare they wish soon everybody be merrily play it happen to-day as it do every day that the clock point much too soon to the time which mean the inexorable end of play this usually happen when everybody be most eager and everything else be forget for the moment as soon as the clock strike playing be discontinue the evening song be sing and then follow the disappearance of the two little one while the older child put away the toy the mother go to the piano to choose the song they be to sing mäzli have quickly run after she oh please mama can i choose the song to-day she ask eagerly certainly tell I which song you would like to sing best mäzli seize the song-book effectively but mäzli you can not even read say the mother how would the book help you tell I how the song begin or what line you know i 'll find it right away mäzli assert just let I hunt a little bit with this she begin to hunt with such zeal as if she be seek a long-lost treasure here here she cry out very soon while she hand the book proudly over to she mother the latter take the book and read : patience oh lord be need when sorrow grief and pain -- but mäzli why do you want to sing this song she mother ask kurt have step up to they and look over the mother 's shoulder into the book oh you sly little person so you choose the longest song you could find you think that lippo would see to it that we would sing every syllable before go to bed yes and you hate to go to bed much more than i do say mäzli a little revengefully it have fill she with wrath that she beautiful plan have be see through so quickly when you have to go you always sigh as loud as yesterday and cry : ` oh what a shame oh what a shame ' and you think it be fearful quite right cunning little mäzli kurt laugh come come child now we 'll sing instead of quarrel the mother admonish they we 'll sing ` the lovely moon be rise ' you know all the word of that from begin to end mäzli they all start and finish the whole song in peace when the mother come back later on from the bed of the two younger child the three elder one sit expectantly around the table for kurt have tell they of they mother 's promise to tell they the story of the family of wallerstätten that evening they have already place they mother 's knitting-basket on the table in preparation of what be to come because they know that she would not tell they a story without knit at the same time smilingly the mother approach everything be ready i see so i can begin right away yes and right from the start please from the place where the ghost first come in the mother look questioningly at kurt it seem to I kurt that you still hope to find out about this ghost whatever i may say to the contrary i shall tell you though how people first begin to talk about a ghost in wildenstein the origin of these rumor go back many many year there be a picture in the castle the mother begin to relate which i often look at as a child and which make a deep impression upon I it represent a pilgrim who wander restlessly about far country despite he snow-white hair which be blow about he head and despite he look old and weather-beaten it be suppose to be the picture of the ancestor of the family of wallerstätten the family name be think to have be different at that time this ancestor be say to have be a man extremely susceptible to violent outbreak in he passion he be suppose to have commit many evil deed on account of which he poor wife could not console herself pray for he she lay whole day on she knee in the chapel she die suddenly however and this shock the baron so mightily that he could not remain in the castle in order to find peace for he restless soul he become a repentant pilgrim so he take the emblem of a pilgrim into he coat of arm and call himself wallerstätten leave he estate and he son he nevermore return later on two of he descendant live in the castle both be well love and respect because they do a great deal to have the land cultivate for a long distance around and as a result all the farmer become rich but both have inherit the violent temper of they ancestor and the truth be that there always be member in the family with that fatal characteristic nobody know what happen between the brother but one morning one of they be find dead on the floor of the big fencing-hall all that the castle guard know about it be that he two master have settle a dispute with a duel the other brother have immediately disappear but be bring back dead to the castle a few day afterwards climb up a high mountain he have fall down a precipice and have be find dead these event throw all the neighborhood into great consternation that be when the rumor first spread that the restless spirit of the brother murderer be see wander about the castle all this happen many year before my father and you grandfather move into nollum as rector the rumor have somewhat fade then and all that we child hear about it be that my father be very positive in deny all such report that reach he ear you grandfather be the closest friend of the master of wallerstätten whom everybody call the baron i can only remember see he once for a moment but he make a unusual impression upon I i remember he very vividly as a very tall man go with rapid step through the courtyard and mount a horse which be try to rear he die before i be five year old and i have often hear my father say to my mother that it be a great misfortune for the two son to have lose they father i feel so sorry for they that i would often stop in the middle of play to ask she ` oh mother can nobody help they ' to comfort I she would tell I that god alone could help for a long time i prayed every night before go to sleep : ` dear god please help they in they trouble ' both be always very kind and friendly with I i be up at the castle a great deal because the baroness maximiliana of wallerstätten be my godmother my father instruct the two son and act as helper and adviser to the baroness in many thing he go up to she every morning hold I by one hand and philip by the other my brother have lesson together with the boy who be one year apart in age while philip be just between they bruno the elder -- i be name after he mother be not i bruno interrupt here salo be a year younger -- i be call after he mea say quickly you want a salo so much and as i be a girl you call I malomea do not you the mother nod and i be call after father kurt cry out in order to prove that he name also have a worthy origin i go up to the castle because my godmother wish it she would have love to have a little daughter herself therefore she occupy herself with I as if i belong to she she teach I to embroider and to do other fine handwork whenever she go with I into the garden and through the estate she teach I all about the tree and flower i be often allow to pick the violet that grow in great abundance beneath the hedge and in the grass at the border of the little wood oh what beautiful day those be soon they be to become more perfect still for we but i receive a impression in those day which remain in my heart for a long while like a menacing power often frightening I so that i be very unhappy once my father come down very silently from the castle when my mother ask he if anything have happen he reply and i still hear he word ` young bruno have inherit he ancestor 's dreadful passion he mother be naturally more worried about this than about anything else ' look at he kurt say dryly glance at bruno who be sit beside he mother for answer bruno 's eye flash threateningly at he brother oh please go on mother mea urge she be in no mood to have the tale interrupt by a fight between she brother it seem terrible to I the mother continue again that bruno my generous kind friend should have anything in he character to worry he mother often i cry quietly in a corner about it and wonder how such a thing could be i have to admit it myself however whenever the three boy have a disagreement or anybody do something to displease bruno he would get quite beside himself with rage act in a way which he must have be sorry for later on i have to repeat again though that he have at bottom a noble and generous nature and would never have willingly harm anyone or commit a cruel deed but one could see that he outbreak of passion might drive he to desperate deed salo he brother never become angry but he have a very unyielding nature just the same he be just as obstinate in he way as he brother and never give in philip be always on he side for the two be the best of friend bruno be much more reserved and taciturn than salo who be naturally very gay and could sing and laugh so that the hall would re-echo loudly with he merriment the baroness herself often laugh in that way too that be why bruno imagine that she love she younger son better than he and because he himself love he mother passionately he could not endure this think it be not true however she love he eldest boy passionately and everybody who be close to she could see it when i be ten year old and philip fifteen a unusually charming girl be add to we little circle i above everybody else be enchant with she we friend at the castle and even philip who certainly be not easily fill with enthusiasm be extremely enthusiastic about we new playmate she be a girl of eleven year old you see just a year older than i be she be far far above I though in knowledge ability and especially in she manners and whole behavior so that i be perfectly carry away by she charm she name be leonore she be relate to the baroness and have come down from the far north in fact from holstein where my godmother come from and all she connection live leonore the daughter of one of she relation have very early lose she father and mother as she mother have die soon after the baroness decide to adopt the child she know that leonore would otherwise be all alone in the world and she hope that a gentle sister would have a extremely beneficial influence on the two self-willed brother now a time begin for I which be more wonderful than anything i could ever have imagine leonore be to continue she study of course and take up new one for that purpose a very refined german lady come to the castle very soon after leonore 's arrival only year afterwards i realize what a splendid teacher she have be my godmother have arrange for I to share the study with leonore and therefore i be to live all day at the castle as she companion only return in the evening so we two girl spend all we time together and in bad weather i also remain there for the night leonore have a tremendous influence on I and i be glad to say a influence for my good for i be able to look up to she in everything whatever be common or low be absolutely foreign to she noble nature this close companionship with she be not only the greatest enjoyment of my young year but be the greatest of benefit for my whole life you certainly be lucky mother mea exclaim passionately yes and uncle philip be lucky too to have two such nice friend bruno add i realize that the mother answer you have no idea child how often i have wish that you too could have such friend please go on kurt beg impatiently where do they go mother do not anyone know what have become of they whenever we brother as we call they be free the mother continue they be we beloved playmate we value they stimulate company very much and be always happy when through some chance they be exempt from some of they numerous lesson they always ask we to join they in they game and we be very happy that they want we company baroness von wallerstätten have guess right since leonore have come into we midst the brother fight much more seldom and everybody who know bruno well could see that he try to suppress he outburst of rage in she presence once leonore have become pale with fright when she have be oblige to witness such a scene and bruno have not forget it four year have pass for we in cloudless sunshine when a great change take place the young baron leave the castle in order to attend a university in germany and philip also leave for a agricultural school so we only see the brother once a year during they brief holiday in the summer those day be great feast day then for all of we and we enjoy every single hour of they stay from early morning till late at night we always begin and end every day with music and frequently whole day be spend in the enjoyment of it both young wallerstättens be extremely musical and have splendid voice and leonore 's exquisite singing stir everybody deeply the baroness always say that leonore 's voice bring the tear to she eye no matter if she sing merry or serious song it affect I in that way too and one could never grow weary of hear she i have just finish my seventeenth and leonore she eighteenth year when a summer come which be to bring grave change we do not expect philip home for the holiday through the baroness ' help he be already fill the post of manager of a estate in the far north the young baron have also complete they study and be expect to come home and to consult with they mother about they plan for the future she fully expect they to travel before settle down and after that she hope sincerely that one of they would come to live at home with she this would mean that he would take the care of the estate on he shoulder with its trouble and responsibility soon after they arrival the son seem to have have a interview with they mother which clearly worry she for she go about silently refuse to answer any question bruno stride up and down the terrace with flaming eye whole hour at a time without say a word salo be the only sociable one left and sometimes he would come and sit down beside we but if we question he about they apparent feud he remain silent how different this be from we former gay day but this painful situation do not last long on the fifth or sixth day after they arrival the brother do not appear for breakfast the baroness immediately inquire in great anxiety if they have leave the castle but nobody seem to have notice they apollonie be the only one who have see they go upstairs together in the early morning so she be send up to look for they in the tower room when she find they empty she open the door of the old fencing-hall by some strange impulse here salo be crouch half fainting on the floor he tell she that it be nothing to worry about and that he have only lose consciousness for a moment she have to help he to get up however and he come downstairs support on she arm the baroness never say a word she stay in she son 's chamber till the physician who have be send for have go away again then return to we she sit down beside leonore and I and tell we that we ought to know what have happen apparently she be very calm but i have never see she face so pale she inform we that when she have speak to she son about they future plan she have discover that neither of they have ever speak about it to the other now they both declare to she that they full intention have be for year to come home after the completion of they study and to live in wildenstein with she and leonore bruno be quite beside himself when he find that salo have apparently no intention to yield to he in the matter so he challenge he brother to a duel in order to decide which of they be to remain at home salo have be wound and lose consciousness have fall to the ground bruno fear something worse have disappear the doctor have not find sale 's wound of a serious nature but as he have a delicate constitution great care have to be take when i leave the castle that day i feel that all the joy and happiness i have ever know on earth be shatter and this feeling stay with I a long while after soon after that sad event the baroness get ready for a journey to the south where she mean to go with salo and leonore salo have not recover as quickly as she have hope and leonore instead of get more robust in we vigorous mountain-air only become thinner and frailer only once bruno send he mother some news in extremely few word he let she know that he be go to spain and that she need not trouble more about he but the news of he brother 's survival reach he nevertheless now all those i have love so passionately have go away and i feel it very deeply there the castle stand sad and lifeless and its light window look down no more upon we from the height all its eye be close and be to remain so oh oh do they never come back cry out kurt with regret no never the mother reply at that time too apparently all the report which have long ago fade be revive as to a ghost who be suppose to wander about the castle there be many who assert they have see or hear he and till to-day the ghost of wildenstein be haunt people 's head look at he say bruno dryly point to the lower end of the table where kurt be sit finish please mother the latter quickly urge where do they all get to and where be the brother who disappear all i still have to tell you be short and sad say the mother leonore faithfully write to I after spend the first winter in the south it become apparent that the baroness 's health be shatter she refuse to return to the castle and send she instruction to apollonie who have marry the gardener of wildenstein and who now with she husband become caretaker of the castle three year afterwards the baroness die without ever have return a short time after that leonore become salo 's wife but they be not fate to remain together long

pretty orderly fashion they now form a procession which begin to move in the direction of apollonie 's little house here a halt be make kurt climb to the top of a heap of log which lay in the pathway stand upright while the other group themselves about he apollonie open the window a little but hide behind it for she be wonder what be go on loneli stand close behind she she have just come back breathlessly for she have hear that a procession be come towards she grandmother 's house mr apollonie kurt cry out with loud voice two whole class from school have come to you to tell you that it be

he make the unmistakable motion of mr trius with he tool of correction what on earth do you mean kurt cry out full of indignation mr apollonie do not need to steal they mr trius certainly could give she a few basket of apple for all the shirt she sew and mend for he oh i see that be different say lux now properly inform in the shortest time the huge basket be empty of its delicious apple and the whole band have disperse after many exclamation of thanks they all run home and kurt outrun they all it be important now to do he home-work as speedily as possible as the second expedition be to take place a little later when he reach the front door he notice that mr knippel be come up behind he run ahead quickly he fling open the living-room door and call in take mäzli out of the way or else something horrible will happen again after say this he run away bruno and mea who be busy in the room with they work do not find it necessary to follow kurt 's command if he find it so necessary why do not he do it himself they think remain seat mäzli have rise rapidly and look towards the door with large expectant eye wonder what be go to happen mr knippel now enter why do something horrible always happen when mr knippel come mäzli ask in a loud voice mea quickly get up go out of the door pull mäzli after she to explain she hasty retreat she say that she want to fetch she mother she simply have to take that horrible little mäzli out of the way who could know what she might say next she always bring forward she most awful idea when it be least suitable the mother who be on the way already enter just when mea be run out with mäzli bruno also slip quickly after they he have only wait for he mother 's appearance in order to fly you child be certainly very peculiar the district attorney 's wife begin i have to think so every time i see they what do all you admonition help i should like to know nature will have its way not one of my child have ever be so impertinent to say the least as you little daughter be already i be very sorry you should have to tell I that mr maxa reply be not it possible that the child should have unconsciously say a impertinence i hope you have never have a similar experience with my older child no i could not say that mr knippel answer but i should say that all of they have inherit the love of preach especially you daughter mea child can be unlike by disposition without its be necessary that one of they should constantly make sermon to the other my child be very often of different opinion but i could not say that they preach much to each other say mr maxa it be certainly mea 's habit to do so and that be why she be not able to keep peace with she friend i suppose you receive a letter from we rector tell you of the refusal to teach the boy any further this be say with a less severe intonation mr maxa confirm the statement so the change we have look forward to have really come the visitor continue and my husband agree with I that prompt action should be take he be go to the city to-morrow in fact he have leave already in order to visit he sister on the way he will look for a suitable attractive home in town that the three boy can move into next fall you do not mean to tell I mr knippel that you husband be order living-quarter for bruno too mr maxa say in consternation oh yes and this be why my husband have send I here to let you know how glad he be to do it for you the attorney 's wife say soothingly he be positively sure that you would be glad if he decide and order everything to suit himself and you but mr knippel i be not prepare for this i have not even speak to my brother about it you know very well that he be the child 's guardian mr maxa be quite unable to hide she excitement you can be reassure for we have think of that too the visitor say with a slightly superior smile my husband 's sister do not live very far from mr falcon in sil so he plan to visit you brother and talk the plan over with he this calm mr maxa a trifle for she brother know already how it stand between the three comrade and how little she want they to live together but she could not help wonder why these people be try to force the boy to live together i do not really understand why the boy should have to live together she say with animation they do not profess to feel much friendship for each other and never seek each other out you yourself mr knippel do not seem to get a very good impression from my child 's way i do not see why you wish you son to live with mine at all it be a matter of decorum the attorney 's wife reply and my husband agree with I what would people in town say if the son of the two best family here who have always study together should not live together everybody would think that something special have happen between the family both party will only gain in respect by join i do not believe that people in the city will be interested in what the three boy be do say mr maxa smile a little that same moment the door be fling wide open with a triumphant face as if she want to say just look whom i bring you here mäzli stand on the threshhold lead apollonie in the latter hastily retreat no no mäzli she say quite frightened you should have tell I that there be company mr knippel have rise to take she departure : it seem to I that other visitor be greet very joyfully by you child well i must say they have rather odd taste she say walk towards the door apollonie be a very old friend of ours all the child love she very much they may have inherit this attachment though mr maxa reply with a smile i only want to say one more word say the lady turn round before step outside the door the scene you son kurt enact to-day in front of apollonie 's cottage with he crowd of miscellaneous friend can only be call a vulgar noise but mr maxa do not yet know what kurt have do the visitor turn to go now as it seem not worth she while to waste word about it as soon as the field be clear mäzli rush out of a hiding-place pull apollonie with she the old woman be terribly apologetic about have go into the room when she have tell mäzli that she want to see she mother the little girl have take she there without any further ado she inform the rector 's widow that she have come to she with a quite incredible communication mr maxa find it necessary at this point to interrupt she friend she have notice that mäzli be all ear to what be come mäzli go and play with lippo till i come she say please tell I all about it afterwards apollonie be mäzli 's instruction before go to do as she be bid apollonie 's communication take a considerable time she have just leave when the family sit down to a belated supper kurt swallow he meal with sign of immoderate impatience as soon as possible he rush away after have give he promise not to come home late the friend that be to join he in this expedition have to be seek out first when he near the meeting place he feel a little disappointed in the twilight he could see that there be a smaller number assemble than he have hope for this certainly be not the crowd he have have together at noon when at least all the boy have promise to take part in he new enterprise they be afraid they be afraid all voice cry together kurt hear now while each scream louder than the other that many boy and girl have leave when the darkness be begin to fall among the few that be leave there be only four girl it do not matter say kurt there be enough people still whoever be afraid may leave we must start though because we have rather far to go we be not go up the well-known path because mr trius watch for apple-hunter there till midnight i think that suit we exactly for he must not hear we we be go up to the wood at the back of the castle first we 'll sing we challenge then come the pause to give the ghost enough time then again and after that for the third and last time if there really be a ghost he will have appear by then you can understand that he will not let himself be tease by we so when he have not come we can tell everybody what we do then they 'll see that it be only a superstition and that there be no wander ghost in wildenstein forward now the little crowd set out full of spirit and eagerness for the adventure for kurt have clearly show they that there could be no ghost to go up there and sing loudly to a non-existent ghost be capital fun furthermore they look forward to boasting of they daring deed afterwards faster and faster they climb so that only half of the usual time be take in reach they destination it be dark at first but the moon suddenly come out from behind the cloud cheerfully light up the field have reach the rear of the castle hill they hurry up the incline and into the pinewood where the tree stand extremely close together this make it very dark despite the fact that the wood be small soon cloud cover the moon and the little band become stiller and stiller here and there one of the child sneak off and do not reappear three of the girl after mysteriously whisper together be go too and with they several more steal away for there be a strange rustling in the bush kurt with lux and he enterprising sister clevus be at the extreme front when it become very still kurt turn around come along where be you all he call back we be come several voice answer from some child immediately behind he it be max han and simus and then stoffus and rudus behind they but they be all kurt halt where be the whole troup ask kurt let we wait till they catch up we must all stay together up there but none follow all the answer kurt get to he question be the screaching of a owl oh they have go they be afraid say max they be there though when we come into the wood the coward clevi cry indignantly to be afraid of tree that certainly be funny well we be not afraid anyway otherwise we should not be here any more call to those who be go max call back come on now come kurt command there be eight of we leave to sing so we must all sing very loud on they go speedily till they could see the end of the wood one of the gray tower be peer between the tree they have at last reach they goal here we stop say kurt but we must not go outside the wood the wildenstein ghost might otherwise step up to we if he walk around the terrace here we go kurt begin and all the other vigorously join he : come out you ghost of wildenstein for we be not afraid we have come here in the bright moonshine to sing the song we have make come out come out and leave you den you 'll never scare the folk again everything be quiet roundabout only the night wind be sough in the old pine-tree between they there be a clear view of the terrace which the moon be now flood with light the space before the castle lay peaceful and desert we must sing again say kurt he do not hear we if he do not give we a answer this time we 'll tell he what we know then we 'll sing fearfully loud : hurrah we have a certain sign there be no ghost in wildenstein then we 'll start again clevus who be gifted with a far-carrying voice begin : come out you ghost of wildenstein and the boy with voice of thunder chime in : for we be not afraid just look who be come there who can it be say kurt stare at the terrace a incredibly tall figure which could not possibly be human be wander across the terrace with slow step it could not be a tree either for it slowly move over towards the wood do he really see straight or be it the moonlight which be throw a flit shadow that moment max who be very big turn about and flee the four other follow headlong leave only lux and clevus beside kurt the horrible figure come nearer and nearer and it could now be clearly discern full moonlight fall on the armor he be garb in and make it as well as the high helmet with wave plume glitter brightly a long mantle fall from he shoulder down to he high ride boot half hide he fearful figure could this be a human creature no impossible no living man could be as enormous as that with measure step the apparition walk silently towards the pine tree here the three singer stand horror-stricken not utter a sound lux like one craze suddenly rush headlong away between the tree and down the hill clevus once more look at the approach figure with wide-open eye before follow she brother she want to see exactly what the knight look like kurt be leave quite alone and still the fearful creature stalk nearer with a desperate leap he spring to one side and leave the wood abruptly hurry towards the meadow he run down the mountain leap over first one hedge and then a second then he fly on till he stand in the little garden at home where a peaceful light from the living-room seem to greet he breathe deeply he run in and he mother meet he at the door oh be it you kurt she say kindly but you be a little late after all be it so hard to leave the beautiful moonlight or be it such fun rush about but kurt you be entirely out of breath come sit down a moment with I after that you have to go to bed all the other have go already usually kurt would have adore be able to sit alone with he mother and have all she attention direct towards he this he could not enjoy now might not he mother ask he further detail about he walk so he say that he prefer to go to bed right away and he mother understand that he be glad to get to rest after run about so ceaselessly only when kurt lay safely and quietly in bed could he think over what have happen and how cowardly he have act after all he mother have clearly tell he that there be no ghost in wildenstein whom then have he see in armor and helmet and with a long mantle it could not have be mr trius because he be a short stout person whereas the apparition be a tree-high figure might it be a sentinel at the castle who be order to go about may be the old castle-baron have always wish a armed sentinel to keep watch if only he have not run away he could have let the sentinel walk up to he and then he could have tell he of he intention the sentinel could only have be please by he endeavor to get rid of such a old superstition if only he have not run away oh yes now that kurt be safely under cover and bruno 's breathing beside he speak of he big brother 's nearness it seem easy enough to act bravely if only he have do it the thing he could not explain to himself be how anybody could be so horribly tall that be hardly credible kurt feel at bottom quite sure that it be impossible for anybody to look like that if only i could have tell mother about it he sigh but he feel dreadfully ashamed she have absolutely forbid he troubling himself about this matter even with he intention to get rid of the talk he have act against she command well and what have he accomplish more than ever the whole village would say to-morrow that the ghost of wildenstein be wander about again furthermore he do not know how to gainsay it if it only have not be so huge when the mother step up to she child 's bedside later on as usual she stop a little while before kurt hearing he moan in he sleep she think he be ill kurt she say quietly do something hurt you he wake up oh mother he say seize she hand be it you i think the ghost of wildenstein be stretch out he enormous arm towards I you be dream do not think about such thing in daytime the mother say kindly have you forget you evening prayer after the excitement of the day yes i have so much to think about that i forget it kurt admit say it now then you will fall asleep more quietly say the mother but please kurt never forget that god hear we prayer and comfort and calm we only when we open we heart entirely to he you know kurt do not you that we must hide nothing from he kurt moan yes in a very low voice after give he a good-night kiss the mother withdraw chapter v oppressive air it seem as if for several day a heavy atmosphere be weigh down the limb of all mr maxa 's household so that its wonted cheerfulness be entirely absent even the mother go about more silently than usual for the worry about bruno 's future weigh heavily on she heart she have write to she brother to come to she as soon as possible so that they could talk the matter over and come to a unite decision he have answer she that urgent business be force he to a journey to south germany and that it would be time enough to settle the matter after he return bruno have hear about the situation be already work up by the mere possibility of he be oblige to live with the two boy secretly he be already make the wildest plan in order to escape such a intolerable situation why should not he simply disappear and go to spain like the young baron of wallerstätten probably the young gentleman have have some money to dispose of while he have none he might hire himself out as a sailor however and travel to china or australium he might study the inhabitant and peculiarity of these country and write famous book about they in that way he could make a good livelihood might he not join a band of wander singer he mother have already tell he how well he voice sound and that she want he to develop it later on with wrinkled brow bruno sit about whole evening not say one word but meditate on he scheme he find it extremely hard to tell which one of they be best and to think of means to carry it out mea 's forehead also be darken by heavy cloud but she be not as silent as she brother every few moment exclamation of pain or indignation escape she but have she not fare badly when they have move from sil to nolla elvira have immediately approach mea as if she want to become she friend mr knippel have send she a invitation in order to cement the bond of friendship and she have do the same with bruno who be to become she son ' close comrade it be quite true that bruno have declare from the beginning that he would not make friend with the two who be to share he study and every time they come together fight and quarrel be the result but mea have a heart which crave friendship she be overcome with happiness by the advance of the knippel family and immediately give herself to she new friend with absolute confidence and warm love soon many difference of opinion and of natural disposition show themselves in the two girl but mea in she overflow joy of have find a friend be little troubled by this at first she think that all these thing would come right by and by when they come closer to each other she hope that the desire harmony would come when they become better acquaint but the more the two girl get to know know each other the deeper they difference grow and every attempt at a clear understanding only end in a wider estrangement mr maxa have always try to fill she child with a contempt not only of all wrong but also of low and ugly action she have make a effort to keep she child from harmful influence and to implant in they a hate for these thing whenever mea find elvira of a different opinion in such matter she be assure that she be in the right by the mother 's opinion which coincide with she own so she feel as if elvira should be show the right way too whenever this happen elvira turn from she and tell she that she want to hear no sermon so the two have not yet become friend despite the fact that mea be still hope and wish for it and she brother kurt have prove himself in the right when he have doubt it from the beginning since the incident with lonelus when mea have tell she friend she opinion in perfectly good faith elvira have not speak to she any more and have remain angry but mea 's nature be not incline to sulk whenever she feel herself injured word of indignation pour out from she like fiery lava from a crater after that everything be settle she have be oblige to sit day after day on the same bench with the sulk girl and to come to school and leave again without say a word should this situation which have already become intolerable to she continue forever mea could only moan with this prospect in view she be glad that kurt be in a strangely depressed mood too and hardly ever speak he would otherwise have be sure to make several horrible song about she experience with the mope elvira kurt who be usually cheerful have be as terribly depress for the last few day as if he have be carry a heavy weight around with he all the time he have keep something from he mother and therefore the weight seem to get heavier and heavier it oppress kurt more than he could say that he have not immediately confess he fault but how could the mother have believe he when he tell she that he have see a figure which could not possibly be human he really feel like a traitor towards he mother all people in nollum believe anew that a ghost of wildenstein go about for the apparition have actually be see kurt know quite well that it be all he fault he hardly dare to look at he mother and he long for somebody to help he he be fill with the craving to be happy again only lippo and mäzli pursue they usual occupation and be untrouble by heavy thought as soon as mäzli notice that the usual cheerfulness have depart from the house she try to get into a different atmosphere at once she always know a place of refuge in such a case oh mama i have to go and see apollonie she would repeatedly say with firm conviction to she mother have the greatest confidence in apollonie 's guard hand and know besides that mäzli 's visit always be welcome the mother often let she youngest go there the little girl be well able to find she way to the cottage and always go without attempt any digression from the path in the evening loneli generally accompany she home mäzli would arrive carry a large bunch of flower the inevitable gift from apollonie present they to she mother she would shout : there they be again just look i have some for you again mother the mother then look full of delight at the bunch and say yes those be the same lovely mignonette that use to grow in the castle-garden apollonie have transplant they into she own but they be much finer in the castle nowhere could they equal have be find she conclude inhale the delicious fragrance of the flower mäzli promptly poke she little nose into the bouquet utter a exclamation of unspeakable delight lonelus 's eye be very merry again and be full of she usual gaiety since kurt have make he little speech and have rehabilitate lonelus 's honor before the school child the grandmother be as kind to she as of yore and never mention the shame-bench again lonelus 's heart be simply fill with gratefulness for what he have do and she often wish in turn for a opportunity to help he out of some trouble she have notice that kurt be no longer the merriest and most entertaining of the child and have give up be they leader in all gay undertaking what could be the matter loneli hate to see he that way and could not help ponder about this remarkable change be extremely observant she have notice that it be very hard to find out the truth about the night expedition to the castle all the boy ' answer consist in dark allusion to the fact that the ghost be wander about wildenstein more than ever as not one of they want to admit the hasty retreat before the ghost have even be properly inspect they only drop vague and terrifying word about the matter brave little clevus who usually relish tell of she dangerous adventure when they have turn out well be as silent as a mouse about it all whenever loneli ask she a straight question need a straight answer clevus run away and lonelus get none the report be sure to have some foundation and the most noticeable thing of all be that kurt 's change have come since that night that same day he have take the load off she heart and have be so gay and merry so loneli put two and two together and have make these observation be fill with sudden wrath as soon as school be end she rush to the astonished clevus : oh i know what you have do clevus kurt be you leader and you do not obey he you all run away because you be afraid oh you have spoil it all for he yes and what about he he be afraid himself clevi cry out excitedly for the reproach have sting she i could see with what terrify bound he fly down the mountain-side be he afraid too do you really mean but of what lonelus question further of what that be easily say : of what you ought to have see that huge creature come towards we from the castle since it have come out that they have be so frightened clevus now tell in detail about the horribly tall armored knight with the high boot and the long cloak hang down to he boot-top be the mantle blue lonelus who have be listen intensely interrupted it be night-time and you can imagine we do not see the color clearly clevus say indignantly but the color have nothing to do with it it be the length the horrible horrible length of that thing it look just too awful he have a high helmet on he head besides with a still higher bunch of black plume that nod in the most frightful way a gleam of joy sparkle in lonelus 's eye fly away like a arrow she seek out mr maxa 's house kurt be stand at the hawthorn hedge in front of the garden with he schoolbag still sling around he he have not rush in ahead of the other accord to he custom with puckered brow he be pull one leaf after another from the hedge then he fling they all away as if he want with each to rid himself of a disagreeable thought kurt lonelus call to he please wait a moment do not go in yet for i want to tell you something when lonelus stand beside kurt she be suddenly fill with embarrassment she know exactly what she have to say but it would sound as if she be try to examine kurt this keep she from begin tell

liking that he want to keep he entirely to himself while the uncle have talk with the younger child he have lead salo out to take he on a stroll in the beautiful sunset salo be perfectly satisfied too as he feel himself likewise draw towards bruno in this short time the two boy have grow as confide as if they have know each other for year and they be just then wander towards the castle hill absorb in lively conversation can you guess why i be take you up there bruno suddenly ask interrupt the talk because it be so lovely salo reply quickly he have stop walk and be look across the flowering meadow towards the castle over which rosy cloud be float on the bright evening sky no not for that reason say bruno but because it belong to a uncle of yours salo look at he full of astonishment but bruno what a idea he call out laugh that would not be so bad but it can not be true we only have one uncle who have be live in spain for a number of year and who expect to stay there the castle belong to just that uncle who live in spain bruno assert he remind salo of the fact that they mother have know each other while live in the castle and have grow to be such friend there salo admit this but be firmly persuade that the castle have long since be sell and that he uncle would never come back he have hear that from he great-aunt so bruno have to agree with he that the castle have probably be sell if the uncle do not think of return do you know salo say bruno while they continue they walk i should love to do what you uncle do i want to go away from here and disappear for a long time then i would not be oblige to be fetter to those two horrid boy i can not stand it and you now know yourself what they be like bruno have describe he two comrade to he new friend they mean attitude and they frequent and contemptible trick salo have repeatedly show he feeling by sudden exclamation and he say now with comforting sympathy i be sure it must make you feel like run away if you be oblige to spend all you day with two such boy but do not listen to they pay no attention to they and let they do and say what they please if they want to be mean let they be for they can not make you different oh if you could be with I that would be much easier bruno say i should know then that you feel with I and share my anger when i be compel to be alone with they and they do sneaky act to people who can not defend themselves i always get so mad that i have to beat they that always bring nasty talk and make my mother unhappy and then i feel worse than ever if only i could go far away and never have to meet they any more if you have a idea what it be like not to have any home at all you would not wish to leave yours without even know where to go say salo you would not think that anything be too hard to bear if you could go home and tell you mother all about it if you have that consolation it should make you able to stand a lot of trouble i should not mind live with those two during school term if i could go to a place during the holiday that be a real home for I and leonore every time i come to she she cry about have no home in the whole wide world i try to think out something so that we will

not have approve of she behavior but would have even make a horrible song about it but one could always rely on lonelus who be discreet mea standing at the window see loneli come towards the house and run down to meet she i have to tell you something terribly sad about elvira lonelus say quite downcast what be it what be it mea ask she do not ever want to renew she friendship with you and she have ask I to tell you that you may be sure that i should not tell you if i do not have to lonelus add because it make I so sad mea reflect a moment wonder what she have really do all she have be guilty of be accuse elvira of a act of injustice so all friendly feeling between they be to be withdraw for all time as she punishment elvira can sulk for the rest of eternity if she want to mea say now without the slightest trace of sadness lonelus be greatly surprised there be other people in this world besides she i should have love to tell elvira who be stay with we never have anybody be so nice and pleased we so i wish i could have tell she who be here now though we do not know she yet but elvira keep on turn she back on I you see lonelus the nicest boy about bruno 's age come to see we and he

description lonelus 's vivacious eye fairly gleam with sympathy what be she name she ask expectantly leonore mea answer oh lonelus immediately begin my grandmother also know a young lady call leonore she always say that that young lady be as lovely as a angel and that there could not be anybody in the world as wonderful as she i be rather glad if leonore be not like a angel for she might not be my friend then mea say quickly elvira even who certainly be not at all like a angel have to break she friendship with I every few week maybe she do that because she be so little like a angel lonelus suggest at this both child laugh often loneli find exactly the right word to say which would throw light on the matter kurt always enjoy these remark of hers at that moment shriek of joy sound from the house : mama be come mama be come lippo the watchman have post himself again on the stair as soon as he have return from school and he have find ample work there kurt have again forget the command and have to be chase away and even bruno have make a attempt to quietly steal up to he mother but all this have only bring horrified cry from the little boy they have both mean no wrong whatever all they have want be to quickly say a word to the mother through the open door nevertheless lippo have grow terribly work up about it a firm command have be give and they have try to break it so they all have be oblige to give way before he violent noise a strange gentleman have come too who be half-way up the stair with two leap but lippo have grab the tail of he coat and hold on to they with both hand shriek nobody be allow to go up you must not go up laughingly turn about the gentleman say just let I go little one i be allow because i be the doctor you uncle tell I where to go so i 'll easily find my way but i 'll make use of you some day for you be a splendid sentinel when the doctor on he return find he still on the same spot he call he a pillar of good order and tell he that he would send for he if he should ever need a reliable watchman soon after lippo utter sudden shout of joy for he see he mother come downstairs what a surprise it be to see she when they have think that she would be shut up for one or two day longer mama be come mama be come all have hear he exclamation and mea be the first to appear pull lonelus after she bruno come rush from one side and kurt from the other and mäzli shot like a arrow right into they midst the mother find herself solidly surround mama just think -- oh listen mama oh mama i want to tell you -- do you know mama this come from all side and all at once to-morrow child to-morrow say the mother we must be very happy that we can see each other so soon again i want to send one of you to apollonie but i be glad to see you here loneli mr maxa now tell lonelus the message she be to take to she grandmother the doctor have just be there and have find leonore much better already as she fever have go down he fear no serious illness leonore be to spend several more day in bed and therefore she be to have a nurse who could also take care of she at night-time for this nobody better than grandmother apollonie could be find and mr maxa would be so glad for she patient 's and she own sake if she could arrange to come to the house for several day and night she tell lonelus to tell she grandmother that the little girl be name leonore and that mr maxa be quite sure she would not be hard to take care of the mother would not allow herself to be detain any longer to all the question which storm in upon she she only have one answer : to-morrow child to-morrow then she disappear again into the sick room please tell I what she be like when you have see she i be so curious say lonelus take leave and mea promise to give the sympathetic lonelus a full report of everything next morning extremely early apollonie appear at mr maxa 's house as the door be not open yet she knock quietly and after a while kathy appear with heavy sleepy eye why should anybody rush about at this early hour she say a little angrily it do not suit she at all that apollonie should have find out what a short time she have be astir i begin my day at this hour say apollonie and there be no need for I to rush about i can leave that to those who get up late i have come to take mr rector 's place in the sick room she have not even call yet kathy fling out so much the better then i have at least not come too late i can find some work everywhere and with this apollonie enter the living room and begin to set it in order kathy do not hinder she and to show she gratitude attempt to start a little conversation but apollonie be not in the mood for that she be solely fill by the question who the sick leonore be that she be go to nurse could it be possible that moment a bell sound from upstairs and apollonie obey the call mr maxa open the door let she enter wide awake leonore be sit up in bed she thick curly hair be fall far down below she shoulder and she dark solemn eye be gaze with surprise at apollonie the latter look immovably at the little girl while tear be course down she cheek oh oh she say as soon as she be able to control she emotion one do not need to ask where we little leonore come from it seem to I as if old time have come back again yes she look exactly like that when she come to the castle only she be not quite so pale leonore mr maxa say mr apollonie have know both you father and mother very well so i think that you would like to have she for a nurse certainly leonore reply happily while she stretch out she hand in a friendly manner towards apollonie will not you tell I everything you know about they apollonie be only too glad to do that but in she agitation she have first to wipe she eye there be no end to the child 's enthusiasm when they find that they mother be to be they own again the unaccustomed separation have seem much longer and harder to bear than they have imagine but it be all over now she be back and would be theirs now for all time to come bruno suggest that they should divide up they mother 's time between they to-day this would make it possible for all to get she hearing separately in all this time a great deal of matter have accumulate which be cry to be hear if they be all to talk to she at once as have happen several time before no one would have any satisfaction as she might not even be able to understand they so it be settle that every child should have they mother alone for a hour and they be to take they turn accord to age so of course the first hour after school from eleven till twelve belong to I be bruno 's statement from one till two i shall have my turn mea cry out she be count on ask she mother so many question that they might easily take three hour she have no communication to make but she be terribly eager to hear all about leonore i 'll get the time between four and five o'clock say kurt this term suit he exactly as he have a secret hope of prolong it somewhat the two little one be to have the remain time before supper and kurt think that they could not have very much to tell whereas he be in need of a great deal of advice the mother have be quite certain that bruno in he interview with she would make a last desperate effort to escape have to live with the knippel boy what be she surprise when she find that this have be entirely push into the background by he lively sympathy in salo 's destiny bruno 's thought be constantly occupy by the thought that he new charming friend stand entirely alone in the world as salo have no one who could help he to find a home bruno hope that he mother would be able to give he some advice he feel sure that she would gladly do this for she love both child tenderly as she have formerly love they parent the boy have be absolutely right when he suppose that mr maxa would be glad to help they but she have to tell bruno frankly that there be no advice she be able to give she have no authority over the child and could therefore do nothing as everything depend on salo 's early completion of he study so that he could choose a occupation this would have to be settle by the gentleman of whom salo have speak he be probably a relation of they mother 's who have undertake the care of the child bruno be terribly cast down when he hear this when he mother do not give he help and counsel right away she usually give he some hope by say we shall see as she have not say this to-day he feel certain that nothing could be do but the mother 's unhappy face show to bruno that she disability do not come from a lack of sympathy and that it pained she very much that she could do nothing when bruno come out of the room he be very silent and sadder than he have ever be in he life mea on the contrary come skip out from she interview she mother have tell she that leonore be charming refine and modest besides be extremely grateful for every little favor but what thrill mea beyond everything be that leonore have repeatedly tell she mother how much she look forward to meet she because the two be of a age leonore 's only fear be that mea might find she rather tiresome all the girl in the board school have always accuse she of that for she be often terribly unhappy and she could not help it mea be more eager than ever now to meet leonore for she be already fill with a warm love for the sick child she could talk and think of practically nothing but leonore i certainly have to make a song about this violent new friendship kurt say in the evening when mea have urge more than once oh mother i hope you will not let leonore go as soon as she can come down and the doctor say she be well otherwise we shall barely be able to become acquaint mea flare like a rocket at she brother 's suggestion cry violently indeed you will not kurt mea mea the mother admonish she i propose to do all i can to keep leonore here as long as possible but -- but mea she might be put to flight with fear and never be see again if you attack you poor brother in such a way kurt quickly conclude the mother 's sentence mea have to laugh over this speech which little resemble she mother 's style of talk my dear kurt she say i be quite able to complete a sentence without you assistance i want to say that i should not be able to do very much because the lady will take leonore when it suit they best i have to admit however that there be some truth in kurt 's reply leonore have such a delicate refined nature that it might frighten she to see you carry away by such passion mea when the doctor come back again in two day he be surprise at the improve condition of he little patient if she be not so very young the doctor say to mr maxa while she accompany he out of the room i should say that she illness come largely from some hidden sorrow and inner suffering she have apparently be able to shake it off in the good care and affectionate treatment she be get here but i can scarcely believe this of a child when mr maxa ask he how soon leonore could leave the room and spend the day with she very active child he answer she can do it from to-morrow on nothing can possibly refresh she more than some lively playmate with this he take he leave go downstairs he meet apollonie who be just come up with a supper-tray laden with delicate dish for the sick child that be right say the doctor it give one a appetite only to look at it yes the poor child eat like a little bird say apollonie but mr rector say that there must be thing to choose from in order to tempt she how be she get along doctor do you think she 'll get well again be not she just like a little angel that be hard for I to say as i do not know any angel he say smile but she might be for all i know i be sure that she will get well with careful nursing and you be sure to see to that mr apollonie you seem to think that in be give care of the child you have draw the big prize in the lottery indeed i have i really have she cry after he no event have ever be look forward to with such great suspense in mr maxa 's house as the appearance of leonore as soon as all the child be home from school the next morning they mother fetch she down the three older one be stand expectantly together in a little group while the two smaller one have place themselves with wide-open eye near the door leonore enter greet one after the other in such a engaging confidential way that she make they feel as if they be old friend she love they mother so much and have be so closely draw to she that she be fond of the child before she have even see they this pleased they tremendously for they have expect leonore to be very different from themselves and have be rather afraid of she as soon as they see she they feel that they might each be special friend with they charming guest leonore find herself surround by they all in a corner of the sofa as she do not look at all strong yet the mother have lead she there leonore try to answer all the question listen to all the project and information which be shower upon she while she eye dance with merriment these unusual surroundings make leonore so happy that she face become quite rosy mea have be already complete in she mind a plan which if it succeed would make it possible for she to have leonore to herself sometimes since all she brother and sister like the visitor so much it be not easy to get she off alone if only she mother would sanction the plan that day mea have to set the table and when lunch time have come she quickly run to she mother to ask she if she might take apollonie 's place in leonore 's room and to she great delight she willingly consent mea tell she she would only be too glad to wait on leonore at night if she could but be with she leonore really need no more special care and in case of a emergency mea could easily run down to fetch she mother leonore will mean more to you than she will ever realize the mother conclude and i feel very gratified if you can do something for she too mrs maxa then inform apollonie of the new plan and she feel sure that the latter would be glad to get home again i do everything in my power for that angel she exclaim i should go to live in the desert if only i could procure a home for she after dinner she go to leonore to say good-bye and the child press she hand most warmly thank she for the good care she have receive i shall never forget how kind you have be apollonie she say heartily i shall come to see you as soon as i be allow to go i hope that we shall see each other very often oh yes i hope so please ask mr rector to let you come to I as often as possible say apollonie before leave leonore now tell the child that apollonie have very vividly describe to she the lovely home of she parent and the wonderful life in the castle she have say frankly that she would never desire such a fine home if only salo and she could call a little house they own so the good-hearted apollonie have suggest that they might live with she she could easily let they have the whole cottage with the exception of a tiny chamber she could wait on they and what more could they desire leonore have feel that this would be better than anything she have dream of as she could come over to mr maxa and she child as often as she please how happy salo would be if she write he about it yes you can mäzli declare she house be a lovely place to live in lonelus be there who do everything one want she to and apollonie always cook what one like best kurt make a little enigmatical remark to mäzli about she greed but before she could have it explain to she the mother turn to leonore i do not want you to be delude by this thought dear child she say for that might only bring you disappointment as soon as you be well you can walk to apollonie 's cottage and then you will see what a tiny place it be the great obstacle of salo 's study would not be put aside in that way either for he could not join you there for year oh i be think all the time how lovely it would be to live with apollonie it would be so wonderful -- i could live with she there and salo could come to we in the holiday till he be through with he study then we could both settle here in the neighborhood leonore have be count on this new scheme and she look up at mr maxa as if she long for she consent as mr maxa do not have the heart to shatter the child 's hope completely she decide to let the matter rest for the present as soon as they could visit apollonie leonore could judge for herself how impossible the plan be leonore 's eye be usually very sad but occasionally she would look quite merry and it be so that she appear that evening when the child be surround she on all side when each have to tell she so much and try to be nearest she she experience the feeling that she have come to a family to which she really belong each of the child have found a special relation with leonore bruno see himself as she protector and adviser and as she brother 's close friend he mean to keep a active watch over she mea whose thought have be completely absorb for day in she new friend bring she all the warmth of a heart which crave friendship passionately kurt have make it he duty to cheer up the rather melancholy child as much as be in he power lippo still fill a little with he post of sentinel always come close to she as if he still need to watch over she mäzli be of the firm opinion that she have to entertain the guest so she would relate fragment of funny thing she know pass from one to another in this way leonore get to hear of the knippel family the time pass so quickly that loud lament be hear when the mother announce that it be time for leonore to retire she do not want she strength to be overtax on she first day out of bed we shall have many more day after this when we can be together she add let we be glad of that there might not be so many for i feel quite well already leonore say with a sigh mr maxa smile we must thank god for that but you need to get strong and i hope that you may find the need recreation and change here then she accompany the two girl up to they room at the top of the house as mea be to be leonore 's sole nurse from now on mr maxa want to reassure herself that nothing be miss it be in mea 's nature to endow every new friend with marvellous quality she imagination be always as active as she heart which she give unreservedly on such occasion unfortunately mea suffer many disappointment in that way because on nearer acquaintance she friend very seldom come up to she expectation she always try hard to hold on to the original image even if it do not in the least coincide with what she friend prove to be in reality and this bring on numberless fight with kurt who with he usual shrewdness could not help reveal to she the real state of affair this always disillusion she finally for it be hard to deny he proof whenever another girl wake a passionate love in she she be bind to expect something unusual from she a week have pass since leonore have spend she first day as convalescent among the family as mea have the privilege of be in the closest most intimate contact with she new friend in the late evening hour she be in a state of perfect bliss every moment of the day that she be home she try to be at leonore 's side and in she walk to and from school there exist for she no other subject of conversation than leonore it be quite unusual that kurt have not produce a rhyme about she great devotion he have not once say : thing will be different after a while brother and sister this time be entirely of one opinion about she : it even seem as if kurt himself have catch a touch of the friendship fever as he use to call mea 's great devotion apparently bruno be of the same opinion too in all he free hour he use to sit in a corner of the room with he book pay no attention to anything else but since leonore have come he always join the merry group and generally have something to relate or to show for leonore 's entertainment this he do in a quiet gentler manner such that it seem as if he would hardly have behave otherwise lippo feel so comfortable in leonore 's presence that he always keep as close to she as possible even when he tell he experience at great length she never become impatient but encourage he to go on when he brother and sister make sarcastic remark about he from time to time he would confidentially say to she : just stay with we always leonore you be at home here now even if you have no home anywhere else this be utter in a spirit of utter conviction as the little boy have hear it from she own lip and be sure that this would be the best for they all leonore blush a deep scarlet at these word as if lippo have pronounce a thought she do not dare to foster in she own heart once he mother have notice this so she tell lippo one evening not to say this again as it be impossible to keep leonore it be much better not to speak of it as it only give she pain as this be a firm command lippo obey faithfully he keep on however show leonore that he love to be with she mäzli 's love for leonore show itself more than anything in a wish to lend she a help hand in many thing which the little girl feel she lovely friend stand in need of she have see quite plainly that leonore often become very sad when everyone else about she be laugh and she herself have be quite bright a moment before but mäzli know how she be go to help she mean to tell apollonie how to fit up she cottage for leonore and salo who she hope would spend he holiday there too she mean to superintend these preparation herself and to have it all fix as daintily as possible by this time mea 's new friend be adore by the whole family and they show it by do all in they power for she they have agree that she differ absolutely from mea 's former friend they could not analyze wherein lay the charm which pervade she whole personality the child have never know anybody who be so polite towards everyone include kathy who only speak affectionate tender word and always seem so grateful when other be kind to she this spirit be something new and extremely delightful they have to admit to themselves that they wish everybody would act in such a way as this would do away forever with the fight and altercation that have always arise between they and for which they be afterwards always sorry the only thing they would have be glad to change in leonore be she sudden fit of gloom which affect they all leonore try very hard to fight these depressing thought but they go so deep that she seldom succeed they mother console they by say that leonore would get stronger as soon as she could take walk with they in the wood and meadow and that feeling which now weigh on she would then seem lighter a few day later the child include leonore come back with rosy cheek and glowing eye from they first walk to the surround hill the fresh mountain breeze have exhilarate they so much that the feeling of well-being be laugh from they young face even leonore 's cheek that be usually so pale be faintly tinge with a rosy hue the mother step out of the garden into the road in order to welcome the child oh she cry out joyfully this first walk have be splendid leonore look like a fresh apple-blossom take she hand with great tenderness between she own she gaze at she very closely in order to rejoice over the rosy color on the child 's delicate face that moment a beggar-woman approach hold by each hand a little girl the child 's clothes be so ragged that they little body be scarcely cover look at mr maxa the beggar-woman say yes yes child can make one happy enough when one have a home you be a fortunate lady to have a good roof for you own it would be better for two such homeless one as these not to exist they be sure to remain homeless all they life and that be the saddest thing of all with that she stretch out she hand for mr maxa be look at she intently leonore have quickly take off she shawl and jacket may i give it to they she ask mrs maxa in a low voice the beggar-woman have already notice the girl 's gesture and stretch out she hand in she direction i be glad young lady that you have pity for these homeless one even if you do not know what that mean god bless you leonore look imploringly into mr maxa 's face the latter nod as it be too late now to explain to leonore what action would have be better she make up she mind to do it afterwards for similar occasion with many word the poor woman thank she for the gift she be very anxious to kiss the young lady 's hand for the two garment but leonore have immediately run away mea follow and find leonore who have be so merry on the walk sit in she sofa-corner cry bitterly with she head between she hand what be the matter leonore why do you cry so terribly mea ask quite frightened she could not answer at once the mother and the other child have come in too and now they all surround the sob girl in great amazement and sympathy that be the way i be she say at last sob aloud i be homeless like they anyone who be homeless have to remain so always and it be terrible that be what the woman say and i believe she how should one find a home if one can not look for one leonore have never before break out into such passionate grief mr maxa look at she very sorrowfully she be a real wallerstätten at the bottom of she heart she say to herself that will mean more struggle for she than i think at a sign from she the child plainly understand that she ask they to go into the garden for a little while sit down beside leonore she take she hand between she own and wait till the violent outbreak have cease then she say tenderly : oh leonore do not you remember what you tell I once when you be ill and i be sit on you bed you tell I that you find a song among you mother 's music which always comfort you when you seem to lose courage and confidence in god you say that it always make you feel that he be not forget you and you brother and that he be look after you in whatever way be best for you even if you can not recognize it now have you forget this can you tell I you favorite verse in it oh yes i can say leonore it be the verse : god who disposest all thing well i want but what thou givest I oh how can we thine act foretell when thou art far more wise than we yes i always feel better when i think of that leonore add after a time in a totally changed voice it make I happy because i know that god can do for we what salo and i can not do for ourselves but when everything stay the same for so long and there be no prospect of any change it be so hard to keep this faith if we can not do anything for ourselves it seem as if everything would have to be that way the woman say that if anybody be homeless once he have to remain that way for the rest of he life no no leonore mr maxa answer you must not take a chance word seriously the poor woman only say it because she see no immediate help for she child it be not true at all of course you can not look ahead into you future but you can ask god to give you full confidence in he then you can leave it all to he and the sense of he protection will make you calmer it will also keep you from make uncertain plan which might only bring fresh disappointment leonore have attentively follow every word mr maxa have utter look thoughtfully in front of she for a moment she say aunt maxa -- this be the mode of address she have long ago be grant -- do not you want I to think of apollonie 's cottage either shall we have a disappointment if i hope that we can find a home there yes my dear child it be entirely out of the question for you and you brother to live there i should not tell you this if i be not absolutely certain and you can imagine that i should not shatter such a hope if i do not have to it hurt mr maxa very much to say this but she find it necessary she know that apollonie in she measureless love and admiration would never be able to refuse a single one of leonore 's wish even if it mean the impossible i shall not think about it any more then say leonore embrace mr maxa with utter confidence and i shall be glad now that i can still remain with you later that evening when the child be all together and leonore have conquer she grief for that day a letter come for they mother from hanover she have inform the lady of leonore 's complete recovery and have add that the doctor think it necessary for the child to enjoy the strengthen mountain air for a while longer she herself have no other wish than to keep leonore in she house as long as possible the lady ' answer be full of warm thanks for she great help in they embarrassing situation they be very glad to accept she great kindness for two more week after which one of they would come to fetch leonore home mr maxa glance with a heavy heart at the child to whom she have grow as devote as to she own she feel dreadfully sad at the thought of let she go away so soon the worst of it be that she know the lady ' abode have never really mean a home for poor leonore it only double she grief to know how hard it would be for the child to leave she but as she have no right over she she could do nothing the only thing she could plan be to ask the lady to let she have leonore sometimes during the summer holiday she decide not to dampen the child 's good spirit that evening with the discourage news in the letter chapter viii mäzli pay visit whenever mäzli find the time heavy on she hand she would suddenly remember people who might want to see she she have be extremely occupy all these day entertaining leonore as during school hour she have be the older girl 's sole companion she brother and sister be now home for a holiday and constantly surround leonore finding herself without she usual employment mäzli run after she mother on the morning of the holiday and keep on say i must go to see apollonie i be sure lonelus be sad that i have not be to see she so long until she mother finally give she permission to go that afternoon on she way to apollonie mäzli have be strike by a idea which occupy she very much she arrive at the cottage of she old friend and sit down beside lonelus who be not in the least sad but look about she with the merriest eye i must go see the castle-steward to-day she say quickly i promise it but i forget about it no no mäzli apollonie say evasively we have lot of other thing to do we have to see if the plum be get ripe on the tree in the corner of the garden and after that you must see the chicken just think mäzli they have little chick and you will have to see they i be sure you will not ever want to leave they oh yes when i have see they i must go to the castle-steward because i promise to mäzli reply i be sure he have forget all about it and do not remember you any more apollonie say try to ward mäzli off from she design do you mama know that you mean to go to the castle no because i only thought of it on my way here mäzli assure she old friend but one must always keep a promise kurt tell I that mr trius will not even let you in apollonie protest certainly he have to i know the castle-steward well and he be not in the least afraid of mr trius i have notice that say mäzli firmly hold to she resolution apollonie realize that word would do no good and resolve to entertain mäzli so well with the little chicken and other thing that it would finally be too late for she to go to the castle mäzli inspect the tiny chicken and the ripening plum with great enjoyment but as this have barely take any time at all she soon say resolutely i have to go now because it be late if you would like to stay home lonelus can come with I i be sure we can easily find the way what be you dream of mäzli apollonie cry out how do you think mr trius would receive you if you ask he to let you in i should like to know you 'll find out something you will not like i be afraid no no this can not be if you insist on go i have better go along apollonie go indoors to get ready for the walk as she always put on better clothes whenever she mount to the castle despite the fact that she might not see anyone lonelus be extremely eager to have a chance to find out who be the castle-steward whom mäzli have promise to visit she have try to persuade she grandmother to let she go with mäzli in which case she mother would not need to change she clothes but the latter would not even hear of it remark you can sit on the bench under the pear tree with you knitting in the meantime and you can sing a song we be sure to be back again in a little while soon they start off apollonie firmly hold mäzli 's hand mr trius appear at the door before they even have time to ring it seem as if the man really have he eye on everything throw a furious glance at mäzli he open the door before apollonie have say a word but he have take great care to leave a crack which would only allow a little person like mäzli to slip through without stick fast in the opening mäzli wriggle through and start to run away the next moment the door be close again do you think i intend to squeeze myself through too you do not need to bolt it mr trius apollonie say much offend it be not necessary to cut off the child from I like that so that i do not even know where she be go i be take care of she remember will not you please let I in for i want to watch she that be all forbid say mr trius why do you let the child in i be order to what you be order to by the master cry out apollonie oh mr trius how could he let the child go in and walk about the garden while he old servant be keep out she ought to be in there look after thing i be sure you have never tell he how i have come to you come again and again and have beg you to admit I i want to put thing into they old order and you do not want I to you do not even know apparently which bed he have and if he pillow be properly cover you say so yourself i be sure that the good old baroness would have no peace in she grave if she know all this and this be all you fault i can clearly see that i can tell you one thing though if you refuse to give my message to the master as i have beg and beg you to so often i 'll find another way i 'll write a letter will not help what will not help how can you know that you will

impatiently but this be only oil pour on the flame yes no one know what he do and what he do not do apollonie lament louder than ever the poor master be sick and all he servant do be to stumble about the place not ask after he need and let everything go to rack and ruin not a cabbage-head or a pea-plant be to be see not one strawberry or raspberry no golden apricot on the wall or a single little dainty peach the disorder everywhere be frightful when i think how wonderfully it use to be manage by the baroness apollonie keep on wipe she eye because present condition worry she dreadfully you can not understand it mäzli she continue when she have calm down a trifle you see child i should be glad to give a finger of my right hand if i could go up there one day a week in order to arrange thing

the castle-steward have say to she and what she have say to he and what have happen afterwards but no one listen because they be so deeply absorb with they own disturbing thought they be not in the least interested in what mäzli have to say about the steward as they all think that the steward be mr trius that evening the unheard-of happen mäzli actually beg to go to bed before the evening song have be sing because the depressing atmosphere in the house be so little to she taste that she even prefer to go to bed mea have be hope till now that she mother would find some means to keep leonore

one of she own who have also grow so lovingly attach to she the pressure lay on they all very heavily bruno never say a word kurt standing in a corner with a note-book be busily scribble down he melancholy thought but he do not show he verse to anyone as the tragic feeling in they might have draw remark from bruno which he might not have be able to endure lippo faithfully follow leonore wherever she go and from time to time repeat he consoling word but he say they in such a wail voice that they sound extremely doleful mäzli alone still gaze about she with merry eye and be dance with joy when she see that it be a bright sunny day you can take a little walk with leonore mäzli the mother say immediately after lunch as soon as the other child have start off to school leonore will grow too pale if she do not get into the open air take she on a pretty walk mäzli you might go to apollonie mäzli most willingly get she little hat and the child set out when they have pass half-way across the garden mäzli suddenly stand still oh i forget something she say i have to go back again please wait for I i will not be long mäzli disappear but come back very shortly with a large

the master of the castle whom she know long year ago would love to visit she but he be unable ask she if he may hope that she will come up to he at the castle instead mäzli give she hand now to say good-bye and when she notice that the pillow have slip down again she say apollonie would just love to set thing in order for you but mr trius will not let she in she would be willing to give a finger from she right hand if she be allow to do everything mr trius do not do come now mäzli say leonore for she have the feeling that this peculiar revelation might be follow by other as unintelligible but the castle-steward smile as if he have comprehend mäzli 's word mr maxa be stand in front of she house surround by she child anxiously look for the two miss one nobody could understand where leonore and mäzli might have stay so long suddenly they catch a glimpse of two blue ribbon flutter from leonore 's hat quickly the child rush to meet they where do you come from where do you stay so long where have you be all this time sound from all side in the castle be the answer the excitement only grow at this how could you get there who open the door what do you do at the castle the question be pour out at such a rate that no answer could possibly have be hear i go to see the castle-steward before i have be to see he quite often say mäzli loudly for she be desirous of be hear leonore have go ahead with the mother 's arm link in hers for she be very anxious to deliver she message kurt be too much interested in mäzli 's expedition to the castle to be frighten off by the first unintelligible account he have to find out how it have come about and what have happen but the two do not get very far in they dialogue as soon as mäzli begin to talk first about mr trius and then about the steward kurt always say quickly but this be all one and the same person do not make two out of they mäzli all the world know that mr trius be the steward of castle wildenstein he be one person and not two then mäzli answer mr trius be one and the castle-steward be another they be two people and not one after they have repeat this about three time bruno say oh kurt leave she alone mäzli think that there be two when she call he first mr trius and then mr castle-steward that be too much for mäzli and shout vigorously they be two people they be two people she run away leonore have relate in the meantime how mäzli have propose to visit the sick castle-steward and how she have at first be reluctant to go till mäzli have make she feel that she be wrong she relate everything that have happen and all the question he have ask she just think aunt maxa leonore go on the gentleman know we uncle in spain he say that he have be there too and he know that we uncle be old and ill and be live all by himself i want so much to find out where he be and ask he to tell I but he think it would not help as we could not possibly go to he so i say that we might write and just think aunt maxa at last he say he would ask you advice then leonore give she message he do not say that the castle-steward as he call himself to mäzli send the message but tell I that it be from the master of the castle whom you know a long time ago leonore conclude oh just think aunt maxa we might find we uncle after all oh please help we for i want so much to write to he mr maxa have listen with ever-growing agitation and she be so deeply affect that she could not say a word she could not express the thought which thrill she so because she do not know the baron 's intention mea 's loud complaint at this moment conveniently hide she mother 's silence oh leonore she cry out if you go to spain we sha not see each other again for the rest of we life then you will never never come back here any more do you really think so leonore ask much downcast she feel that it would be hard for she to choose in such a case and she suddenly do not know if she really want to go to spain it be not very easy to make a trip to spain child say the mother and i be sure that it be not necessary to get excite about it when kurt after the belated supper that night renew he examination about the single or the double steward of castle wildenstein they mother announce that bedtime have not only come for the little one but for all soon after the whole lively party be sleep soundly and only the mother be still sit in she room sink in deep meditation she have not be able to think over the baron 's word till now and she wonder what hope she might build upon they he might only want to talk over leonore 's situation because he have realize how little she feel at home in hanover but all this thinking lead to nothing and she know that we good lord in heaven who open door which seem most tightly bar have let it happen for a purpose she be so grateful that she would be able to see the person who more than anyone else hold leonore 's destiny in he hand full of confidence in god she hope that the hand which have open a impassable road would also lead a embittered heart back to himself and by renew in he the love of he fellowman bring about much happiness and joy chapter ix in the castle the next afternoon after plan a pleasant walk for leonore and mäzli mr maxa start on she way to the castle as soon as she near the grate iron door it open wide and hold he hat in he hand mr trius stand deeply bowing in the opening may i see the baron ask mrs maxa after another reverence mr trius lead the visitor up the hill and when he have duly announce she invite she with a third bow to step forward it be quite evident that mr trius have be definitely order to change he usual mode of behavior mr maxa now approach the chair near the pine tree have you really come mr maxa say the sick man put out he hand do no bitter feeling against the evil-doer keep you back mr maxa press the proffer hand and reply i could wish for no greater joy baron than to have you door open for I i have wonder oftener than you could think if this would ever happen for i want a opportunity to serve you i know no bitter feeling and never have know they everybody who have love this castle and its inmate have know they suffer grief and pain i return to this old cave here to die say the baron you can see plainly that i be a broken man i only wish to forget the past in this solitude and i think it right for I to die forget then you little girl come in here one day -- i have not be able to discover how oh please forgive she say mr maxa it be a riddle to I too how she succeed in enter this garden i know nothing about it till yesterday evening when the child come home from the castle i be terribly afraid that mäzli have annoy you she have not do so at all for she be she mother 's true child say the baron she be so anxious to help I and to bring I what i lack because she love leonore so much she want I to know she too but i can not understand leonore she beg and beg to be allow to see she uncle as she wish to live with he and love he like a father she even long to seek he out in a foreign country what shall i do please give I you advice mr maxa there be only one thing to do baron the lady reply with a overflow heart god himself have do

you you will soon realize what a treasure she be and through she the good old time will come back to this castle you will grow young again yourself as soon as you two be here together the baron reply : we dear maxa always see thing in a ideal light how could a delicate child like leonore fit into a wilderness like this castle everything here be desert and forlorn just think of the old watchman here and I what miserable housemate we should be will not you receive the child in you house for she clearly long to have a home i know that she will find one there and apparently have find it already she can learn by and by who she uncle be and then she can come to visit he sometimes amaze at this sudden change mr maxa be silent for a while how she would have rejoice at this prospect a few day ago i love leonore like my own child and want nothing better than to keep she with I she say finally but i think differently now the child belong to you and the castle of they father must become they home you must let leonore surround you with she delightful and soothing personality which be sure to make you happy when you come to know she you will soon realize of what i should have rob you there be no necessity at all for the castle to remain forlorn and empty despite the loss of we dear love one the life here can again become as pleasant as in former time you mother always hope that this would happen at she eldest son 's return as she have desire that he home should remain unchanged even after she death leonore can have she quarter in you mother 's room i wonder if you would like to see the room you know so well mr maxa the baron say slowly mrs maxa gladly assent to this may i go everywhere she ask i know my way so well certainly wherever you wish the baron reply enter the large hall mr maxa be fill with deep emotion here she have spend the most beautiful day of she childhood in delicious game with the unforgettable leonore and the two young baron everything be as it have be then the large stone table in the middle the stone bench on the wall and the niche with the old knight of wallerstätten stand there as of yore when she go into the dining-hall everything look bare and empty the portrait of ancestor have be take from the wall and the glint pewter plate and goblet be go from the large oaken sideboard mr maxa shake she head go up the stair she decide first of all to go to the baron 's room for she wonder what care he be receive rigid with consternation she stop under the doorway what a room it be not the tiniest picture be on the wall and not a single small rug lay on the uneven board nothing but a empty bedstead a old wicker chair and a table which have plainly be drag there from the servant ' quarter comprise the furniture mr maxa look again to make sure that it be really the baron 's room there be no doubt of it it be the balcony room in the tower where do the baron sleep as the sight prove more than she could bear she quickly seek the late baroness ' chamber here too everything be empty and the red plush-covered chair and the sofa in the corner over which all the picture of the child use to hang be go only a empty bedstead stand in the corner mr maxa go next to leonore 's room which use to be extremely pretty lovely picture use to hang on the wall chair cover in light blue silk be stand about a half-rounded bed be place in a corner and she remember the dearest little desk on which two flower vase always fill with fresh rose use to stand mr maxa do not even go in this time it be too horribly forlorn the only thing which still speak of old time be the wallpaper with the tiny red and blue flower she quickly go out throw a single glance at the large ball-room she liken it to a dreary desert not a curtain not a chair or painting could be see where could all the valuable damask-covered furniture have go to be it possible that the castle have be rob and no one know of it it be probable however that mr trius do not know about anything and it be plain that the baron himself have not trouble about these thing mr maxa hurriedly go back to he to what a dreary home you have come back my poor friend she cry out and i know that you mother never wish you to find it like this how unhappy you must have feel when you enter these wall after so many year you can not help feeling miserable here and it be all quite incomprehensible to I not to I the baron quietly reply i somehow feel it have to be that way do i value my home before it be a just retribution to I to find the place so empty and forlorn i only return to die here and i can await death in daytime on my chair out here and at night time in my nest i need nothing further but death have not come as quickly as i think it would why be you try to bring I back to life again this be what i decidedly mean to do so we shall banish the subject of death from now on as i confidently believe that we lord in heaven have other plan for you mr maxa say decisively i can see for myself that it be better for leonore to stay with we and i be ever so happy for you permission may i write the lady in hanover that you do not want leonore to be fetch away for the present the baron heartily give this permission i have to trouble you for one thing baron can you remember apollonie who be for many year you most faithful servant the baron smilingly answer of course i remember she how could i possibly forget apollonie who be always ready to help we in everything you little daughter have already give I news of she she be the only one who might know what happen to the furniture mr maxa continue i be go to see she right away and i wish you would admit she when she come in case the place have really be rob you must let I get what you require nobody be look after you and you stand sorely in need of good care i be quite sure that you mother would like I to look after you do you not think so i do the baron reply smilingly and i feel that i ought to be obedient after these word mr maxa take she leave and rapidly walk down the mountain she unexpectedly enter apollonie 's garden while the latter be work there and immediately describe to she the terrible state of thing at the castle she have always believe that the baron would find it home-like and furnished and now everything be go and he have not even a bed to sleep in but be oblige to spend both day and night in he chair apollonie have be wring she hand all the time and break out at last bitterly how could i have foresee that oh what a turk what a savage what a old heathen that miserable trius be she sob full of rage and grief i understand now why he never answer my question i have ask he many a time if he have take out the right bed and be use the thing belong to it which be mark with a blue crown in the corner he only use to grin at I and never say a word he never even look for they and calmly let my poor sick baron suffer nothing be miss not even the tiniest picture or trifle and he have to come back to a terrible waste all my sleepless night be not in vain but i have not the slightest idea that it could be as bad as that the worst of it be that it be my fault yes it really be all my fault mr maxa and apollonie go on to tell how this have come about baron bruno have only hear the news of he brother 's marriage and he mother 's death when he return the first time year ago he leave again immediately and she be quite sure that he do not intend to return for a long while as no one have live at the castle for so long she have decide to put all the beautiful thing safely away in order to keep they from ruin and possible thief so she have store they in the attic wrap in sheet and have lock the place up apollonie have never doubt that she would be call to the castle as soon as the baron
