rogation day and litany note a breviary hymn note b particular examen note c bibliography part i general question the divine office chapter i idea of the breviary _ etymology _ -- the word breviary come from a old latin word _ breviarium _ a abridgment a compendium the name be give to the divine office because it be a abridgment or abstract make from holy scripture the writings of the father the life of the saint the word have various meaning assign to it by early christian writer but the title breviary as it be employ to-day -- that be a book contain the entire canonical office -- appear to date from the eleventh century probably it be first use in this sense to denote the abridgment make by pope saint gregory vii -lrb- 1013-1085 -rrb- about the year 1080 _ definition _ -- the breviary may be define as the collection of vocal prayer establish by the church which must be recite daily by person depute for that purpose _ explanation of the definition _ -- prayer this word include not only the prayer properly so call but also the whole matter of the divine office vocal the church order the vocal recitation the pronunciation of each word establish by the church to distinguish the official prayer of obligation from those which the faithful may choose accord to they taste which must be recite for the recitation be strictly obligatory daily the church have fix these prayer for every day of the year and even for certain hour of the day by person depute for that purpose therefore person in holy order recite these prayer not in they own name but as representative of the universal church _ different name for the breviary _ -- this book which be with we commonly call the breviary have bear and still bear different name amongst both latin and greek amongst the latin the recitation of the breviary be call the office -lrb- _ officium _ -rrb- that be the duty the function the office because it be _ par excellence _ the duty function and office of person consecrate to god this be the oldest and most universal name for the breviary and its recitation it be call too the divine office -lrb- _ officium divinum _ -rrb- because it have god for its principal object and be recite by person consecrate to god it be call the ecclesiastical office -lrb- _ officium ecclesiasticum _ -rrb- because it be institute by the church other name be _ opus dei agenda pensum servituti hora hora canonicae _ which book be employ in olden time in recite the office before the eleventh century the prayer of the divine office be not all contain in one book as they be now in the breviary which be a abridgment or compendium of several book the recitation of the office require the psaltery the lectionary the book of homily the legendary the antiphonarium the hymnal the book of collect the martyrology the rubric the psaltery contain the psalm the lectionary -lrb- thirteenth century -rrb- contain the lesson of the first and second nocturn the book of homily the homily of the father the legendary -lrb- before the thirteenth century -rrb- the life of the saint read on they feast day the hymnal contain hymn the book of collect prayer collect and chapter the martyrology contain the name with brief life of the martyr the rubric the rule to be follow in the recitation of the office to-day we have trace of this ancient custom in we different choir book the psalter the gradual the antiphonarium there be not standard edition of these old book and great diversity of use and text be in existence _ division of the divine office _ -- how be the daily office divide the office be divide into the night office and the day office the night office be so call because it be originally recite at night it embrace three nocturn and laud the day office embrace prime terce sext none vespers and compline _ part or hour of the office _ -- how many part or hour go to make up the office rome count seven and seven only and this be the number commonly count by liturgist and theologian they reckon matins and laud as one hour the old writer on liturgy ask the question : why have the church reckon seven hour only they reply be summarise well by newman : in subsequent time the hour of prayer be gradually develop from the three or -lrb- with midnight -rrb- the four season above enumerate to seven viz : -- by the addition of prime -lrb- the first hour -rrb- vespers -lrb- the evening -rrb- and compline -lrb- bedtime -rrb- accord to the word of the psalm -- ` seven time a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgment ' other pious and instructive reason exist or have since be perceive for this number it be a memorial of the seven day of creation it be a honor do to the seven petition give we by we lord in he prayer it be a mode of plead for the influence of that spirit who be reveal to we as sevenfold on the other hand it be a preservative against those seven evil spirit which be apt to return to the exorcised soul more wicked than he who have be drive out of it and it be a fit remedy of those successive fall which scripture say happen to the ` just man ' daily -lrb- _ tract for the time _ no 75 on the roman breviary -rrb- matutina ligat christum quus crimina purgat prima replet sputi causam dat tertium mortis sexta crucus nectit latus ejus nona bipertit vespera deponit tumulo completa reponit haec sunt septeni propter quae psallimus horas at matins bind at prime reviled condemn to death at tierce nail to the cross at sext at none he bless side they pierce they take he down at vesper-tide in grave at compline lay who thenceforth bid he church observe the sevenfold hour alway -lrb- _ gloss cap i de missa _ -rrb- thus this old author connect the seven hour with the scene of the passion another author find in the hour a reminder and a warning that we should devote every stage of we life to god for the seven canonical hour he write bear a striking resemblance to the seven age of man _ matins _ the night office typify the pre-natal stage of life _ laud _ the office of dawn seem to resemble the beginning of childhood _ prime _ recall to he youth _ terce _ recite when the sun be high in the heaven shed brilliant light symbolise early manhood with its strength and glory _ sext _ typify mature age _ none _ recite when the sun be decline suggest man in he middle age _ vespers _ remind all of decrepit age glide gently down to the grave _ compline _ night prayer say before sleep should remind we of the great night death chapter ii short history of divine praise in general and of the breviary in particular from all eternity the godhead be praise with ineffable praise by the trinity -- the three divine person the angel from the first moment of the creation sing god 's praise _ sanctus sanctus sanctus dominus deus sabaoth plena est omnis terra glorium ejus _ -lrb- isaia vi 3 -rrb- cardinal bona write that adam and eve bless and praise god they creator for god create the first human being and create in they the knowledge of the spirit of god that they might praise the name which he have sanctify and glory in he wondrous act -lrb- ecclesiasticus xvii 6-8 -rrb- every page of the old testament tell how the choose race worship god we read of the sacrifice of cain abel enoch noe of the familiar intercourse which the great patriarch abraham isaac jacob have with god record too be the solemn song and prayer of mose thank god for he guidance in the freedom from the slavery of egypt -lrb- exodus xv -rrb- david under god 's inspiration compose those noble song of praise the psalm and organise choir for they render he sing evening and morning and at noon i will speak and declare and he shall hear my voice -lrb- psalm 54 v 18 -rrb- i rise at midnight to give praise to thee -lrb- psalm 118 v 162 -rrb- seven time a day i have give praise to thee -lrb- psalm 118 v 164 -rrb- the prophet daniel a captive in babylon pray thrice daily he face turn to jerusalem the israelite captive in babylon with nehemia rise up and read in the book of the law of the lord they god four time in the day and four time they confess and adore the lord they god -lrb- ii esdras ix 3 -rrb- hence the jewish day make up as it be with sacrifice libation oblation purification and public and private prayer be a day of prayer in these public meeting they sing god 's praise sing of he glory and of he mercy sometimes they speak with loving familiarity sometimes they pray on bend knee sometimes they stand and plead with outstretched hand pour out the prayer inspire by god himself in the new law we savior be the model of prayer the true adorer of he father he alone can worthily adore and praise because he alone have the necessary perfection night and day he set example to he follower he warn they to watch and pray he teach they how to pray he give they a form of prayer he pray in life and at death he apostle train in the practice of the synagogue be perfect by the example and the exhortation of christ this teaching and example be show in effect when the assemble apostle be at the third hour of the day pray -lrb- act ii 15 -rrb- when about the sixth hour peter go to pray -lrb- act x 9 -rrb- in the act of apostle we see how peter and john go at the ninth hour to the temple to pray st paul in prison sing god 's praise at midnight and he insist on he convert singing in they assembly psalm and hymn -lrb- ephe v 19 col iii 16 i cor xiv 26 -rrb- what form do the public prayer which we may call the divine office take in the time of the apostle it be impossible to say but it be certain 10 that there be public prayer 20 that they be offer up daily in certain determine place and at fixed hour 30 that these public prayer consist principally of the psalm hymn canticle extract from sacred scripture the lord 's prayer and probably the creed 40 that these public prayer vary in duration accord to the will of the bishop or master who preside the weekly commemoration of christ 's resurrection the yearly recurrence of the memory of the great fact of christ 's life the daily sanctification of the hour of the day each lead the christian to draw upon the hour of the psalter and when gradually fix hour for daily prayer pass beyond the home circle and with group of ascetic enter the public church it be from the psalter that the song of praise be draw and from the psalm be add a series of canticle take from the book of the old and the new testament and thus long age before any stereotyped arrangement of the psalm exist assign particular psalm to particular day or hour the psalm be feed the piety of the faithful and teaching man to pray -lrb- _ the new psalter _ -- burton and myer -rrb- in this matter of public prayer it be hard for we to realize the bookless condition of the early christian and they difficulty it be twenty-five year after the ascension before the first book of the new testament be write and many year must have elapse before they wide diffusion hence in they bookless and guideless condition the early christian be advise to use the psalm in they new devotional life -lrb- ephe v 19 col iii 16 st jame v 13 -rrb- the first clear evidence of a division of the psalter for use in the western church be find in the work of st benedict -lrb- 480-543 -rrb- he have spend he youth near rome and keep he eye on the roman usage he assign the psalm to the various canonical hour and to different day of the week the antiphon he draw from exist source and of course the canonical hour be already in existence in he arrangement the whole psalter be read weekly and the whole bible with suitable patristic selection be read every year he also arrange the Sunday festal and ferial office for the recitation of the office of a saint 's day st benedict arrange that the matins shall have the same form as a Sunday office -- _ ie _ three nocturn twelve lesson and responsory but the psalm antiphon and lesson be proper to each saint this arrangement interrupt the weekly recitation of the whole psalter and cause great difficulty in later time for when the feast increase in number the ferial psalter fall almost into complete disuse st benedict 's arrangement of the psalm and he other liturgical regulation spread rapidly but the roman secular office never adopt he arrangement of the psalm nor he inclusion of hymn until about the year 1145 in some detail each office show its independent history it be a matter of dispute among liturgist whether prime and compline be add to the roman secular office through the influence of the benedictine -lrb- baudot _ the roman breviary _ pp 19-26 -rrb- the period follow the death of st benedict in 543 be a period of which little be know we repeat with dom baumer -lrb- vol i pp 299-300 -rrb- that the fifth century at rome as elsewhere be a period of great liturgical activity while the seventh and eighth century be view from this point of view a period of decline -lrb- baudot _ op cit _ p 53 -rrb- the labor of st benedict probably be continue and perfect by st gregory the great -lrb- 590-604 -rrb- he labor be sum up by dom baumer -lrb- _ histoire du breviare _ vol i pp 289 301-303 -rrb- : it be he who collect together the prayer and liturgical usage of he predecessor and assign to each its proper place and thus the liturgy owe its present form to he the liturgical chant also bear he name because through he means it reach its highest state of development the canonical hour and the formulary of the mass now in use be also carefully arrange by he the whole history of the western liturgy support we in maintain that these book receive from the great pope or from one of he contemporary a form which never afterwards undergo any radical or essential alteration the roman office spread quickly through europe the enthusiasm of gregory become root in the monastery where the monk learn and teach with knowledge and with zeal he liturgical reform two important reform of monastic practice be interesting as show further progress in the evolution of the roman breviary st benedict of aniane -lrb- 751-821 -rrb- the friend and adviser of loui the pious become a reformer of benedictine rule and practice he rule aim at a rigid uniformity even in detail and the council of aix-la-chapelle -lrb- 817 -rrb- help he to establish he reform as a result of the saint 's exertion the penitential psalm and office of the dead be make part of the daily monastic office the abbey of cluny found in 910 supply a further reform tend to guard the office from further accretion do hildebrand pope gregory vii -lrb- 1073-1086 -rrb- labor for liturgical reform liturgical writer give very different reply monsignor battifol -lrb- _ history of the roman breviary _ english edition p 158 -rrb- maintain that gregory make no reform and that the roman office such as we have see it to be in the time of charlemagne hold its ground at rome itself in the custom of the basilica without any sensible modification throughout the tenth and eleventh century and even down to the close of the twelfth dom gueranger hold that gregory abridge the order of prayer and simplify the liturgy for the use of the roman curia it would be difficult at the present time to ascertain accurately the complete form of the office before this revision but since then it have remain almost identical with what it be at the end of the eleventh century dom baumer agree with he benedictine brother that gregory work for liturgical reform probably pope gregory vii know the decadence which be manifest in liturgical exercise in rome during the tenth and eleventh century decide to revise the old roman office which although it have decay in rome flourish in germany france and other country hence in he lenten synod 1074 he promulgate the rule he have already draw up for the regular canon of rome order they to return to the old roman rite thus he may be count as a reformer but not as a innovater nor a abridger but he reform fall on evil day the great struggle between church and state about lay investiture have a baneful influence on liturgy even in rome itself the time seem to call for a modernized -lrb- ie a shorten -rrb- office the moderniser respect the psalter the curtailment be in the lectionary the modernize spirit show itself in the arrangement and bulk of the office book the psalter antiphonary responsorial bible and book of homily be gradually codify even then a very large volume be the result after a time the chant which absorb much space be remove from the volume but the result volume noticeably smaller be not yet small enough in time only the opening word of the antiphon responsory and versicle be print and to the volume thus turn out be give the name _ breviary _ the curial breviary be draw up in this way to make it suitable for person engage in outdoor pursuit and journey it gradually displace the choir office in rome and rome 's example be universally follow this curial breviary be adopt by the franciscan in they active life they change the text of the psalter only _ psalterium romanum _ to the more approved text the _ psalterium gallicanum _ the improve curial breviary be impose on the church of rome by the franciscan pope nichola iii -lrb- 1277-1280 -rrb- and henceforth it be call the roman breviary thus we see that the book use daily by priest get its name in the thirteenth century although the divine office be almost from apostolic time but liturgy be a progressive study a progressive practice capable and worthy of perfect and the friar strive for the greater perfection and beauty of the new breviary they add variety to the unity already achieve and yet do not reach liturgical perfection nor liturgical beauty they load the breviary by introduce saint ' day with nine lesson thus avoid office of three lesson and by keep octave day and day within the octave as feast of nine lesson they almost entirely destroy the weekly recitation of the psalter and a large portion of the breviary cease to be use at all the franciscan book become very popular owe to its handy form indeed its use be almost universal in the western church but the multiplication of saint ' office universal and local no fixed standard to guide the recital and the war of liturgist make chaos and turmoil liturgical reform become a urgent need everyone recite the canonical hour long for a great and drastic change the humanist cardinal bembo -lrb- 1470-1549 -rrb- ferrerus bessarion and pope leo x -lrb- 1513-1521 -rrb- consider the big fault of the breviary to lie in its barbarous latinity they wish the lesson to be write in ciceronian style and the hymn to be model on the ode of horace ferrerus 's attempt at reform the breviary deal with the hymn some of which he re-write in very noble language but he be so steep in pagan mythology that he even introduce heathen expression and allusion he work be a failure the traditional school represent by raoul of tongre burchard caraffa and john de arze love the past with so great a love that they refuse to countenance any notable reform a third school the moderate school be represent by cardinal pole contarinus sadolet and quignonez a spanish cardinal who have be general of the franciscan the work of reform of the breviary be undertake by cardinal quignonez -lrb- 1482-1540 -rrb- he be a man of great personal piety and possess a love for liturgy and a accurate knowledge of its history its essential and its acquire defect after seven year ' labor at the matter and form of the breviary he work quignonez 's breviary -lrb- _ brevarium romanum a francisco cardinalus quignonio _ -rrb- appear in 1535 it be for private use only and be not intend as a choir manual yet so popular be he work that in 1536 six edition have appear and in thirty-three year -lrb- until its suppression by st pius v -rrb- it go through no less than a hundred edition its immense success show how much the need of breviary change and reform be feel by the clergy the book too have a important influence on shape the breviary produce by pius v -lrb- 1566-1572 -rrb- quignonez 's book be reproduce with the variation of the four earliest edition by the cambridge university press in 1888 it be a interesting study in itself and in comparison with later breviary but it be feel by scholar that quignonez 's reform be too drastic tradition be ignore the labor for brevity simplicity and uniformity lead to the removal from this breviary of antiphon response little chapter and versicle and to the reduction of lesson at matins to three and the number of psalm in each hour be usually only three he work have as a set principle the grand old liturgical idea of the weekly recitation of the whole psalter the quick and almost universal demand for quignonez 's breviary indicate the need of a reform and the outline of such a reform the pope who commission quignonez to take up breviary reform request the theatine to take up similar work the council of trent -lrb- 1545-1563 -rrb- take up the work of reform but the council rise before the work have make headway and the matter of reform be finally effect by st pius v -lrb- 1566-1572 -rrb- by he constitution _ quod a nobi _ -lrb- 1568 -rrb- the reform breviary of 1568 be in outline the breviary in we hand to-day the great idea in the reform be to restore the weekly recitation of the whole psalter theoretically the breviary make such provision but practically the great number of saint ' office introduce into the breviary make the weekly recitation of the psalter a impossibility the clergy be constantly read only a few psalm out of the 150 in the psalter the rubric too be in a confused state change be make in the calendar by suppression of feast by restore to simple feast the ferial office psalm and by reduce the number of double and semi-double feast but in the body of the breviary the change be few and slight the life of some saint draw from quignonez 's work be use st gregory 's canon of scripture lesson be adopt and the antiphon verse response collect and prayer be take from the old roman liturgy the antiphon and response be give in the older translation of st jerome owe to they suitability for musical setting and the text of the psalm be the _ psalterium gallicanum _ which have be in use in the roman curial breviary but the pian reform be soon to be follow by a reform of the breviary text in accordance with the sixtine vulgate the clementine vulgate and the vatican text clement viii -lrb- 1592-1605 -rrb- publish he edition of the revise breviary in 1602 and thirty year afterwards urban viii -lrb- 1623-1644 -rrb- issue a new and further revise edition which be substantially the breviary we read to-day he cause careful correction of error which have creep in through careless printing he print the psalm and canticle with the vulgate punctuation and he revise the lesson and make addition he establish uniformity in text of missal and breviary but the greatest change make in this new edition be in the breviary hymn which be correct on classical line by urban himself aid by four learn jesuit -lrb- see note hymn p 259 -rrb- the result -lrb- of they labor -rrb- have always give rise to very different judgment and for the most part unfavourable it seem to be exceedingly rash to regard as barbarous the hymn of man like prudentius sedulius sidonius apollinari venantius st ambrose st paulinus of aquileium and rabanus maurus and to desire to remodel they after the pattern of horace 's ode it be only fair to give they the credit that out of respect for the wish of urban viii they treat these composition with extreme reserve and while they make some expression clearer they maintain the primitive unction in a large number of passage -lrb- baudot the roman breviary part iii chap ii -rrb- the commission appoint by clement viii in he work of revision and reform include baronius bellarmine and gavantus the commission of urban viii include amongst other famous man the famous irish friar minor luke wadding -lrb- 1588-1657 -rrb- the need of revision rearrangement and reform of the breviary be in the mind of every pope and nearly every one of they take some step to perfect the historic book in the eighteenth century benedict xiv -lrb- 1740-1758 -rrb- contemplated breviary reform in some detail particularly in improve the composition of some legend and of replace some homily of the father he entrust this work to father danzetta sj but when the learn jesuit 's labor be present to the pope so grave and so contrary be the reason there put forth that the pope think it well to abandon the thought of reform father danzetta 's note be marvel of research and learn they be to be see in ruskovany 's _ coelibatus et breviarium _ vol v they show to the ignorant and the sceptical the danger and difficulty which all breviary reformer have to contend with pope pius vi -lrb- 1775-1799 -rrb- return to the project of breviary reform dom gueranger tell we that the plan of reform be draw up and present to the congregation of rite but the actual reform be not enter on pope pius ix -lrb- 1846-1878 -rrb- at the request of monsignor sibor archbishop of pari appoint a commission to revise the breviary but they report cause the work to be abandon petition for reform be send to the vatican council but very little result leo xiii -lrb- 1878-1903 -rrb- enrich the calendar by add the name of many saint he add votive office correct the breviary lesson for the feast of a number of pope and in 1902 he appoint a commission to deal with the hagiography of the breviary and with its liturgy but he death in the following year end the work of the commission the unsatisfactory condition of the rule for the recitation of the divine office be apparent to everyone scholar fear to face breviary reform the difficulty be so innumerable and so immense however with wonderful courage and prudence pope pius x -lrb- 1903-1914 -rrb- tackle the work he resolve not to adopt a series of minor change in the breviary but to appoint a active commission of reform whose first work should be a rearrangement of the psalter which must bring back the recitation of the divine office to its early ideal -- the weekly recitation of the whole psalter the problem which face pope pius x in 1906 be the very same problem which face he predecessor st pius v -lrb- 1566-1572 -rrb- more than three hundred year ago st pius try to solve the problem by a reform of the calendar but the solution produce no permanent effect pius x and he commission go to the root of the difficulty and by a redistribution of the psalm have make the ferial and the festive office almost equal in length and have so arrange matter that the frequent recitation of every psalm and the possible and probable recitation of every psalm once every week be now a accomplished fact and the old and much-sought-after ideal -- the weekly recitation of the whole psalter -- be of world-wide practice on the publication of the new psalter pope pius announce that a commission would undertake a complete revision of the breviary a matter of great importance and one which must demand long year of care and study to accomplish a member of the committee which re-arrange the psalter monsignor piacenza tell we that such revision must embrace : -- 1 a reform of the calendar and the draft of rule for the admission of feast into the calendar of the universal church 2 the critical revision and correction of the historic and patristic text 3 the removal of spurious patristic text 4 the remodelling of the rubric 5 the institution of a new form of common office for confessor and for virgin to facilitate the lessen of the number of feast of saint without diminish the honor due to they -lrb- burton and myer _ op cit _ p 144 -rrb- we may sum up then all that have be say in this long section by state that from apostolic time there be public prayer thrice daily the jewish convert have the psalm commit to memory need not nor could they have in those bookless day a psalter script in the third century morning evening and night office be mention compline be in existence in the time of st benedict from the seventh century onward ecclesiastical writer papal decree and conciliar decree recognize the eight part of the office which we have see take shape during the sixth century and regard they recitation by priest and monk as enjoin by positive law during this period or at least at its commencement laud and vesper alone have a clearly define structure and follow a definite arrangement as far as we can see st gregory arrange the little hour for Sunday only and they arrangement for week day be leave to the care of the bishop and metropolitan or even of abbot this be also the case in many instance with regard to matins for the number of psalm to be recite thereat be not definitely fix as regard the little hour -- prime terce sext none and compline -- the freedom of the competent ecclesiastical authority be as yet unconfined by canonical restriction chrodegang -lrb- 766 -rrb- be first to follow the usage of the benedictine of the roman basilica in

up to we own time for we traditional liturgy be represent by the roman breviary of urban viii a book which constitute for we a vulgate of the roman office the thing which render this vulgate of 1632 precious to we be that thanks to the wisdom of paul iv pius v and clement viii the difference between it and the breviary of the roman curia of the thirteenth century be mere difference of detail : the substantial identity of the two be beyond dispute the breviary of urban viii be the lineal descendant of the breviary of innocent iii and the latter in its turn be the legitimate descendant of the roman canonical office as it be celebrate in the basilica of st peter at the end of the eighth century such as it have gradually come to be in the course of the seventh and eighth century a genuinely roman combination of various element some of they roman and some not but of which some at all event go back to the very beginning of the catholic religion -lrb- battifol _ op cit _ p 353 -rrb- chapter

and praise of the saint who dwell on this matter of the breviary would fill a volume every priest have meet with many such eulogy in he reading newman 's word be very striking there be he write so much of excellence and beauty in the service of the breviary that be it skilfully set before the protestant by romanistic controversialist as the book of devotions receive by they communion it would undoubtedly raise a prejudice in they favor if he be ignorant of the case and but ordinarily candid and unprejudiced in a word it will be attempt to wrest a weapon out of we adversary ' hand who have

breviary as a liturgical book we find that the divine office have four general division correspond to the division of we lord 's life first from advent to septuagesima second from septuagesima to easter third from easter to pentecost fourth from pentecost to advent these division correspond also to the division of the year winter spring summer and autumn the end and object of the office be to

day the little office of the bless virgin the office of the dead the penitential and the gradual psalm 11 but he recommend they recitation on certain fixed day and grant a indulgence for the practice 12 where the custom of recite the little office in choir exist it should be retain 13 the appointment of the time for the adoption of the breviary be obligatory 14 prohibition under pain of excommunication be make against those who print distribute or receive copy of this breviary without lawful authority 15 the authentic publication and obligation of the bull the second document in the _ par prima _ of the roman breviary be the bull _ divino afflatu _ issue by pope pius x on 1st November 1911 it tell we : -- 1 that the psalm be compose under divine inspiration and that it be well know that from the beginning of the church they be use not only to foster the piety of the faithful who offer the sacrifice of praise to god that be to say the fruit of lip confess to he name -lrb- heb xiii 15 -rrb- but -- that retain the custom of the old law -- they hold a conspicuous place in both the liturgy and divine office of the new law he quote st basil who call psalmody the voice of the infant church and urban viii who call psalmody the daughter of hymnody which be chant before the throne of god in heaven two quotation from st athanasius and st augustine in praise of psalmody be add 2 in the psalm there be a certain wonderful power which arouse in soul a zeal for all virtue two quotation from st augustine be add one say that as it be write that all scripture both of the old and the new testament be divinely inspire and useful for we instruction nevertheless the book of the psalm be as it be a very paradise contain in itself the fruit of all the other book and express they in hymn and moreover it join its own hymn to they and merge they in the general song of praise two further quotation from st augustine in similar strain follow for who will be ask the saint unmoved by those frequent passage in the psalm in which be proclaim the immensity the omnipotence the infallible justice the goodness the clemency of god or who be not move by the prayer and thanksgiving for benefit receive by the humble and trustful petition by the cry of soul sorrow for sin find in the psalm whom will the psalmist not fill with admiration when he recount the gift of the divine loving kindness towards the people of israel and all mankind and when he set forth the truth of heavenly wisdom who finally will not be inflamed with love by the carefully foreshadow figure of christ we redeemer whose voice st augustine hear in the psalm either singing or sighing or rejoicing in hope or mourning in present sorrow 3 in former age it be decree by pope and council and by monastic law that the whole psaltery should be recite weekly pope st pius v pope clement viii and pope urban viii in they revision of the breviary order this weekly recitation and even at the present time such would be the recitation of the psalter have not the condition of thing change 4 this arise from the multiplication of saint ' office -lrb- _ officium de sanctis _ -rrb- which after the canonization of saint gradually grow to such a huge number that very often the dominical and ferial office remain unread and hence not a few psalm be neglect which yet be as the rest as st ambrose say the benediction of the people the praise of god the praise offering of the multitude the acclamation of all the expression of the community the voice of the church the resounding confession of faith the truly official devotion the joy of liberty the shout of gladness the re-echoing of joy many complaint from prudent and pious man reach the pope about the omission of psalm which take away from those bind to recite the office not only help well suit for god 's praise and for the expression of they inmost soul but also diminish that desirable variety in prayer which be so appreciate and which so well accord with and aid we worthy attentive and devout praise of god for st basil say that in smooth uniformity the soul often grow weary and while present be yet away but when in psalmody and chant be change and vary in every hour the fervor be renew and its attention be restore 5 this matter of the reform of the order of the psalter be bring before the holy see by many bishop and chiefly in the vatican council where the demand for the old custom of recite the whole psalter weekly be renew with the provision that any new arrangement should not impose a greater onus on the clergy now labor more arduously in the vineyard of the sacred ministry on account of the diminution of toiler these request and wish be repeat to pope pius x and he take up the matter cautiously so that the honor due to the cult of the saint should not be diminish nor the onus on the clergy increase by the weekly recitation of the full psalter beg the help of god the pontiff form a commission of learn and industrious man who with judgment and care carry out he wish the result of they labor be submit to the sacred congregation of rite and after careful consideration by the member of the congregation the matter be submit to the pope who sanction the new arrangement that be as regard the order and the division of the psalm antiphon versicle and hymn with the rubric and rule pertain to the same and the pope order a authentic edition of these new arrangement to be prepare and issue from the vatican press 6 the arrangement of the psalter have a intimate connection with the divine office and the liturgy and by these new decree regard the office and the psalm a first step in the improvement of the breviary and the missal have be take these matter will be deal with by a commission of learn man which be soon to be form amongst other thing that this first step establish be that the recitation of the scripture lesson with the proper response accord to the rubric should receive due honor and more frequent recitation and that in the liturgy the most ancient mass of the sunday throughout the year especially those of lend should be restore to they place 7 the use of the old order of psalm find in the roman breviary be abolish and interdict from 1st January 1913 and the use of the new psalter for all clergy secular and regular who use the roman breviary as revise by pius v clement viii urban viii and leo xiii and those who continue to use the old order do not satisfy they obligation 8 ecclesiastical superior be to introduce the new order of the psalter and chapter be permit to use it if the majority of the member agree to its introduction 9 establishment and declaration of the validity and efficacy of the bull notwithstanding all previous apostolic constitution and ruling

openly _ and _ plainly _ at variance with the rubric of the missal and breviary however it may be well to revise and to recall the student day ' lesson on the church 's calendar the study be not a easy one and in labor to be brief probably i may be obscure and incomplete _ annus menses habet duodecim _ say the breviary the year have twelve month fifty-two week plus one day or 365 day and almost six hour but these six hour make up a day every four year and this fourth year be call bisextile in make calculation the six hour be take as six complete hour and not six hour want some minute and the aggregate miscalculation continue until the minute add yearly amount to ten day and change the date of the spring equinox pope gregory xiii -lrb- 1572-1585 -rrb- seek to remedy the error he re-establish the spring equinox to the place fix by the council of nice -lrb- 787 -rrb- the year have fall ten day in arrear from the holding of the council until the year of the gregorian correction 1582 he again fix it to the day arrange by the council the 14th of the paschal moon and he arrange that such a time-derangement should not occur again he omit ten full day in October 1582 so that the fourth day of the month be follow immediately by the fifteenth he determine that the secular year must begin on 1st January that three leap year should be omit in every four century eg 1700 1800 1900 2100 and he arrangement have be observe throughout nearly the whole world _ quarter tense _ fall on the wednesday friday and saturday after the third Sunday of advent after the first Sunday of lend after pentecost Sunday and after the feast of the exaltation of the cross _ the nineteen year ' course of the golden number _ this course or cycle be invent by a athenian astronomer about 433 bc it be not exact but be hail with delight by the greek who adorn they temple with the key number do in gold figure hence the name the cycle of course be the revolution of nineteen year from 1 to 19 when this revolution or course of year be run there be a new beginning in mark no 1 eg in the year 1577 the nineteenth number the golden number be 1 the following year it be 2 and so on until in 1597 the golden number again be 2 a table give in the breviary show how the golden number may be find and a short rule for the finding of it in any year be give to the number of the year -lrb- eg 1833 -rrb- add 1 then divide the sum thus result by 19 and the remainder be the golden number if there be no remainder the golden number be 19 epact and new moon the epact -lrb- greek -lrb- greek : epakto -rrb- from -lrb- greek : eapgo -rrb- i add -rrb- be nothing more than the number of day by which the common solar year of 365 day exceed the common lunar year of 354 day so that the epact of the first year be 11 because the common solar year exceed the common lunar year by 11 day and these add to the 11 day of the first produce 22 as the epact at the end of the second year the new moon fall 22 day sooner than in the first year the epact of the third year be three because if 11 be add to the 22 the result be 33 and from this 33 we subtract 30 day which make up a lunar embolism and the remainder give we 3 the epact for the year and so on in the breviary there be a table -lrb- _ alium tabellum epactarum _ -rrb- correspond to the golden number from the year 1901 to the year 2000 inclusive to take away all doubt in the use of this table a new table of epact a example may be quote in the year 1901 the epact be x which be place under the golden number 2 and new moon appear on the 21st January 19th February and 21st march again in 1911 the epact be not mark by a number but by a asterisk -lrb- see table in breviary -rrb- which be place under the golden number 12 and in the calendar for the whole year will indicate the new moon on January 1st January 31st -lrb- for in February there be no new moon indicate in the table the sign -lrb- \* -rrb- be not find -rrb- on march 1st march 31st and on April 29th in the year 1916 the golden number be 17 and the epact be 25 -lrb- write not in roman numeral but in ordinary figure -rrb- the new moon occur on 6th January 4th February 6th march 4th April etc for when the epact be 25 corresponding with golden number greater than the number 11 in the calendar we must take in computation the epact 25 -lrb- write in modern figure -rrb- but where the epact correspond with number less than the number 11 in the _ tabellum the epact _ xxv in roman numeral must be take in calendar counting this change take place with epact 25 only so that the computation of the lunar year may more closely respond to the solar year it be for this cause too that in six place in the calendar two epact xxv and xxiv be give the new breviary contain a _ tabellum _ of dominical letter up to the year 2000 ad it need no comment _ indiction _ indiction be a cycle of fifteen year the first of which date from the third year of the christian era it be usual to indicate the number of the year in a cycle and no mention be make of the cycle already complete thus the _ indictio sexta _ mean the sixth year of a cycle and not the sixth cycle or period of fifteen year hence to know the year of indiction be useless for determine the date in old document of state indiction be institute by constantine in 313 for fiscal purpose in papal and imperial document the name of pope or emperor be generally give and the regnal year note _ movable feast _ in virtue of the decree of the council of nice in 325 easter on which all other movable feast depend must be celebrate on the Sunday which follow immediately the fourteenth day of the moon of the first month -lrb- in the hebrew year -rrb- we march easter then be the first Sunday after the paschal full moon -lrb- ie the full moon which happen upon or next after march 21st -rrb- if full moon happen on a Sunday easter Sunday be the Sunday after the full moon the matter of the arrangement of easter be for long a subject of very bitter contention in the irish and in the english church the irish clinging tenaciously to the calendar of st patrick carry it everywhere in they missionary labor so that the controversy be not confine to ireland and england it be long and bitter until at last the irish church agree to follow the reform -lrb- see healy _ ireland 's school and scholar _ p 592 moran _ irish saint in great britain _ the conference at whitby in 664 pp 255-261 -rrb- calendar study be interesting and many valuable contribution on this matter have be give to we by father thurston sj and other english and irish scholar general rubric of the breviary the next document in the breviary part i have the title rubrica generate breviarius the general rubric of the breviary they be call _ general _ as they apply to every part of the breviary and be to be distinguish from the rubric deal with the proper -lrb- _ proprium _ -rrb- of the breviary the proper of time or of the saint the word rubric be originally apply to the red mark line use by carpenter on wood later it refer to the title use by jurisconsult in announce law which be write in red color the word appear in church literature to refer to sign and direction as early at least as the fourteenth century -lrb- _ cath encyclopedia _ -- word rubric -rrb- the general rubric be divide into thirty-seven title attention will be give to each of these title some of which must be modify by recent legislation the order follow may not be the order follow in the general rubric as give in the breviary as matter treat in the general rubric find in the breviary be treat under other heading here however a look at the table of contents or at the index show the page treat of these title title i the double office consequently the civilised people already in remote antiquity have find a call to the worship of god in the change season and time and so have introduce sacred season sacred time and place be common to all religion in general the change of time bring with they corresponding change in nature make a religious impression upon mankind in turn man sanctify certain time and dedicate they to god and these day thus consecrate to god become festival the entire number of ecclesiastical holyday and season be codify for we in the different church calendar they contents fall into two essentially different division each possess a entirely different origin and history the first division consist of festival of we lord distribute over the year regulate and co-ordinate in accordance with certain law the second division consist of commemoration of saint in no wise connect with festival of we lord or with one another occupy to some extent a intermediate position between these two chief division come the festival of we bless lady which have this in common with the festival of the saint that they fall on fixed day but on the other hand they be to a certain extent connect with each other and with some feast of we lord this be carry out in such a way that they be distribute throughout the church year and be include in each of the festal season -lrb- kellner _ heortology _ part i -rrb- from apostolic time the feast of easter the ascension and pentecost be celebrate in the second century feast of the apostle be celebrate and the cult of the martyr be of speedy and widespread development but it be not probably till the fourth century that the feast of saint who be not martyr be celebrated _ origin of the different grade of feast _ to-day we find church festival arrange in three grade double semi-double and simple and it be very difficult to determine clearly and accurately the origin and the nature of the arrangement but from the work of scholar who have study this matter the follow may be consider as a fair and accurate sum up : -- in the first age of the church the apostle and martyr only be commemorate in public prayer and above all in the mass perhaps by a special prayer then in time follow the reading of a panegyric in they honor and later still hymn and history of martyrdom be add to the public recitation of the office still later there be add the feast of the saint with a office resemble we simple office matins be entirely ferial but have either a biography of the saint or a long extract from the father add the other hour be as in a Sunday office save that these feast have no vesper matter in still later time the church add to the list of name on she saint roll the name of saint who be honor neither as apostle nor as martyr for these special mass office and feast be establish st martin of tour be the first confessor so honor in the western church for the more important feast a office of nine lesson be establish and this come to be know as a semi-double office and later such feast be call double hence before the thirteenth century we find celebration of simple feast of semi-double and of double and durandus who write in the thirteenth century tell we of the existence of double major and double minor the breviary of st pius v publish in 1568 give three class of double : double of the first class double of the second class and double per annum but in the revision by clement viii the double per annum be again divide into double major and double minor in the new pian breviary -lrb- 1913 -rrb- double be divide into primary double of the first class secondary double of the first class primary double of the second class secondary double of the second class primary double major secondary double major the list of feast under each of these six heading may be see in the breviary do double office differ specifically from each other no the form be the same in all double office what then be the difference between double of different class the difference be chiefly in the preference which be give to they in case of concurrence or occurrence of feast of greater or of lesser rite the word double -lrb- _ duplex _ -rrb- be derive some author hold from the ancient custom of recite two office or say two mass on the same day -- one for the current ferium and one for the feast -lrb- _ festa _ -rrb- other author say that the word be derive from the ancient practice of chant twice or in repetition the complete response and versicle and above all the recitation of the full antiphon before and after each psalm at matins laud and vespers be call duplication and this name it be say be give to the office -lrb- double duplex -rrb- in which the practice of duplication take place it be often ask why be there different grade of feast three reason be give by writer on liturgy first to mark the diversity of merit in god 's saint they sanctity and they different degree of service to he church second to mark they different degree of glory in heaven one be as the sun another the glory of the moon and another the glory of the star for star differ from star -lrb- 1 _ cor _ -rrb- third for some special national or local reason -- eg patron of a country the rule lay down in the general rubric in the new breviary for double and semi-double be leave unchanged almost by the regulation lay down by the commission and by the _ variatione _ they number be reduce so that there now stand in the new breviary only seventy-five double sixty-three semi-double and thirty-six movable feast a reason for the new arrangement of double feast in the pian breviary be the general one that the pope wish above all thing the weekly recitation of the psalter and to bring about this weekly recitation and the restoration of the Sunday office a mere rearrangement of the psalm be quite insufficient and a rearrangement of the gradation of feast of concurrence and of occurrence be necessary title ii -- the office of a semi-double _ etymology nature and synonym _ the word semi-double -lrb- _ semi-duplex _ -rrb- be derive from the latin and some writer hold that the word indicate feast which be of lower rank and solemnity than double feast other hold that it mean simply feast hold a place between double feast and simple feast most writer on liturgy hold that on some day a double office -- one of the feast and one of the ferium -- be hold and that in order to shorten this double recitation there be say a composite office partly of the saint 's office and partly of the ferium and they say that from this practice arise the term semi-double or half-double synonym for the term semi-duplex be non-duplex office of nine lesson 1 the antiphon be not double in a semi-double office 2 the sunday of the year except easter Sunday low Sunday pentecost and trinity be say accord to the semi-double rite in the new breviary the psalm for matins be only nine in number instead of the eighteen of the older book 3 the versicle antiphon response prece and suffrage of saint which be recite in semi-double office be give below under they own title title iii -- the simple office _ etymology nature _ and _ synonym _ the word _ simple _ come from the latin _ simplex _ to indicate the least solemn form of office and it be the direct opposite in mean to the term double it be synonymous with the term so often find in liturgical work the office of three lesson this form of office be of great antiquity go back to the fifth century in the early age of the church and down to the fourteenth century the simple office consist of the ferial office with lesson antiphon and prayer but in the end of the fourteenth century simple come to be celebrate in the same manner as semi-double with nine lesson and they nocturn and in case of occurrence be transfer as a result the office of Sunday and the ferial office be practically crush out of the breviary the commission of reform apply a easy remedy by restore simple feast to they ancient place and status now they be not to be transfer but in case of occurrence with a feast of higher rite they be merely commemorate these feast have first vespers only at matins the nine psalm and three lesson be say as one nocturn the psalm in semi-double feast be from the psalter under the day of the week on which the feast be celebrated _ in quolibet alio festo duplici etiam major vel

feast which occur on the same day list give in _ the new psalter and its use _ p 108 show that thirteen grade of feast stand before the feast of semi-double rite and in the order of precedence as to vespers between feast which be in occurrence these feast stand in the eleventh place be precede by -lrb- 1 -rrb- double of the first class of the universal church -lrb- 2 -rrb- lesser double title iv -- Sunday we translate the latin _ die dominica _ by we word Sunday for in english the day of the week have retain the name give to they in pagan time in irish too deluain Monday moon 's day show pagan origin of name of week day the literal translation of the latin _ die dominica _ the lord 's day be not find in the name give to the first day of the week in any european tongue save portuguese where the day of the week hold the old catholic name _ domingo secunda feira terca feira _ etc it be say that the seven day of the week as they stand in numerical order be retain and confirm by pope silvester i -lrb- 314-336 -rrb- : _ sabbatus et dominici diei nomine retento reliquos hebdomadae die feriarum nomine distincto ut jam ante in ecclesium vocarus coeperunt appellarus voluit quo significaretur quotidie clerico abjecta caeterarum rerum cura uni deo prorsus vocare debere -lrb- brev rom _ in vi lect st silvester pope 31st dec -rrb- there be no evidence of the abrogation of the sabbath by christ or by he apostle but st paul declare that its observance be not bind on gentile convert accordingly in the very early day of christianity the sabbath fall more and more into the background yet not without leave some trace behind it -lrb- see art _ sonnabender _ in kraut 's _ realenzyklop _ -rrb- among christian the first day of the jewish week the _ prima sabbatus _ the present Sunday be hold in honor as the day of we lord 's resurrection and be call the lord 's day -lrb- apoc i 10 i cor xvi 2 -rrb- this name _ die dominica _ take the place of _ die soli _ formerly use in greece and in rome this day have many name in the work of christian writer st ignatius m call it _ regina omnium dierum _ st chrysostom _ die paci die lucis _ alcuin _ die sanctus ferium prima _ baronius tell we be another name for we Sunday the subject of the liturgical celebration of the lord 's day have be a great study and a problem to modern scholar it appear that in the first age of the church Sunday be a day of solemn reunion and of common prayer st justin in he second apology write that on the lord 's day town and country meet together at a appoint place for sacrifice for the hearing of the word of god for pious reading and for common prayer this common prayer consist largely in the recitation of the psalm hymn and prayer of what be call the Sunday office this office be nearly always the same in psalm in hymn and in every part so that Sunday after Sunday for many year there be very little change in the Sunday united-prayer part of the liturgy although the preach on the incident of the life of we lord -lrb- beckel _ messe und pascha _ p 91 -rrb- the blessing and the thanksgiving relieve the service from monotonous sameness a nocturn a round of psalm be say on Saturday night by the vigilant prepare for the Sunday service before the eighth century two other short nocturn be add this addition which be copy from the monastic practice build up the three nocturn form of office and become the model and form of the office for saint there be good reason for believe that originally the divine office form part of the mass the _ synaxi _ for which the early christian assemble by night consist of the ` breaking of bread ' precede by the singing of psalm and hymn litany and collect reading homily invocation and canticle this be the whole official liturgical prayer apart of course from private prayer -lrb- dom cabrol _ day hour of the church _ introduction p xvi -rrb- one of the chief object of pope pius x in he reform be the restoration of the liturgical importance of the Sunday office the office of the lord 's day and therefore in its own right superior to the saint ' feast by which it have be displace from its special office psalm and lesson and this could only be effect by a change in the rule of occurrence and in title iv -lrb- _ de festorum occurentia _ etc section 2 -rrb- we find the new rule for restore Sunday office to they proper liturgical rights in title iv sect 1 -lrb- see breviary additione and variatione -rrb- there be no change in the old rubric the eight sunday of the first class exclude every other feast and the sunday of the second class only give place to a double of the first class and then be commemorate at laud vespers and mass and have the ninth lesson in matins but section 2 -lrb- _ dominici minoribus _ -rrb- go to the root of the matter of the new change in the rule for Sunday 's liturgical office the ordinary sunday rank as semi-double and hence they mass and office be supersede by the mass and office of some occur feast the length of the Sunday office in the breviary until lately in use make many heart rejoice over the occur feast but the almost total omission of the ancient and beautiful Sunday mass be a misfortune and in a sense a unbecoming practice which break away from ancient liturgical rule and tradition the abbreviation of the Sunday office in the new breviary and the rule lay down in title iv sect 2 restore Sunday 's office and Sunday 's mass to they old and proper dignity the general rule lay down be that on sunday throughout the year the proper office of the Sunday shall always be say the exception be -lrb- 1 -rrb- feast of we lord and they octave -lrb- 2 -rrb- double of the first class -lrb- 3 -rrb- double of the second class on these day the office will be the office of the feast with commemoration in laud vespers and mass henceforth sunday be divide into : -lrb- 1 -rrb- sunday of the first class which exclude all feast -lrb- 2 -rrb- sunday of the second class which exclude all feast save double of the first class -lrb- 3 -rrb- the ordinary sunday which exclude all but double of the first or second class feast of we lord and they octave day the date of easter be the pivot of calendar construction before easter come the sunday of lend and quinquagesima sexagesima septuagesima sunday septuagesima can not fall earlier than the eighteenth day of January nor later than the twenty-second day of February hence in some year there be fewer sunday after the epiphany than in other owe to the date of easter and septuagesima the smaller the number of sunday after epiphany the greater be the number of sunday after pentecost if the number of sunday after pentecost be twenty-five the twenty-fourth Sunday will have the office of the sixth Sunday after epiphany if there be twenty-six sunday after pentecost the twenty-fourth Sunday will have the office of the fifth after epiphany and the twenty-fifth will have that of the fifth Sunday the twenty-sixth will be the sixth Sunday 's office it should be remember that the Sunday call the twenty-fourth after pentecost be _ always _ celebrated immediately before the first Sunday of advent even though it should not be even the twenty-third Sunday after pentecost title v -- ferial office _ etymology and different signification _ of the word _ ferium _ the word be derive probably from the latin _ feriarus _ -lrb- to rest -rrb- among the roman the idea of a day of rest and a holy day be intimately unite and receive the name of _ ferium _ but it be amongst the hebrew that the day set apart for the worship of god receive the most distinctive character as day of rest -lrb- _ heortology _ p 2 -rrb- hence the early christian call the day of the week _ feriae _ why do the church adopt the word _ feriae _ she wish to mark the day of the week and not to name they by they pagan name -lrb- _ eg die lunae _ -rrb- nor by they jewish name -lrb- _ eg prima sabbati _ -rrb- which should be a sort of recognition of the dead and die synagogue hence she adopt the word _ ferium _ to denote the christian rest in the lord the christian peace and the abstinence from all sin and that each and every day should be consecrate to god the christian use of the word be find in origen -lrb- 185-254 -rrb- and be fully establish in the time of tertullian in the time of amalare -lrb- circa 830 -rrb- the ferial office have take a well-defined form matins have twelve psalm and six antiphon in laud of every _ feria _ be recite the psalm _ miserere deus deus meus deus misereatur nostri _ a canticle draw from a prophet and vary each day of the week -lrb- _ eg confitebor _ isaias xii for Monday 's laud _ ego dixi _ isaia xxxviii for Tuesday 's laud etc and the two psalm _ laudate _ -lrb- 148 150 -rrb- and the _ cantate _ psalm 149 -rrb- in the small hour the Sunday psalm without antiphon be recite vespers have daily fix psalm at each hour the _ kyrie eleison _ and ferial _ prayer _ be say on bended knee and the hour terminate -- as do the hour of holy week still -- with _ pater noster and miserere _ feria be divide into three class major feria privileged feria and non-privileged ash Wednesday and the three last day of holy week be the major feria which be privileged and exclude all feast -lrb- _ vide _ tit ii sec 2 -rrb- non-privileged feria be the feria of lend and advent quarter tense or ember day and rogation Monday they take precedence of simple feast only in the ferial office nine psalm be say and not twelve as in the old order of the breviary the psalm find arrange in the new breviary for three nocturn be to be say with nine antiphon up to the versicle of third nocturn -- the versicle of the first and second be omit -lrb- tit i sec 7 -rrb- hence the psalm be to be say straight through -lrb- _ sine interuptione _ -rrb- omit in the first two nocturn the versicle and response pater noster absolution and all pertain to the lesson this simplify thing and make the ferial office shorter than the office of feast title vi -- the office of vigil _ etymology nature and synonym _ the word _ vigil _ be from the latin _ vigilare to keep awake to watch _ because in old time the night before any great event religious or worldly be spend in watch thus the night prior to ordination to the priesthood the night prior to a great battle be spend in watch before the altar hence the word vigil come to mean the prayer say during the time of watch or wake preparatory to the great event it signify too the fast accompany the watch and lastly it come to mean the liturgical office of mass and breviary fix for the time of vigilance in the roman church it be sometimes call the nocturn or night office the greek call the vigil _ profesta _ the time before the feast the custom exist among the pagan almost universally before the time of christ the jews practice this ancient night prayer as the scripture in several place show _ in noctibus extollite manus vestra in sancta _ -lrb- psalm 133 -rrb- we savior sanctify this use by he example and the early christian be on account of these night assembly the object of fear and dread of admiration and of hatred organised vigil last till the thirteenth century in some country but owe to abuse and discord they become not a source of edification but the occasion and cause of grave scandal and be forbid gradually and universally the church now retain for the faithful one congregational vigil the vigil of christmas formerly it be customary to observe a fast on a day or night of a vigil but that custom be suppress sometimes or fall into disuse vigil fast be now few almost the only relic of the vigil now remain be the mass and office when be vigil hold in the early age they be hold only on Saturday night and on night precede great solemnity or the festival of the martyr the early convert if they have be pagan know few or no prayer formula and very little of the psalm be learn by they even in they christian practice but jew who become christian know psalm and hymn and prayer so that in the early christian vigil there be no attempt make at recite the divine office and the custom of such recitation be not introduce until about 220 ad and be not obligatory -lrb- duchesne _ christian worship _ chap viii -rrb- it be difficult to speak with certainty about the hour of begin or the hour of end these vigil service some think that the first nocturn be say about 9 pm laud be say before sunrise and hence be call _ laudes-matutinae _ but after the middle of the ninth century we gather from contemporary document that the office of vigil be as a whole regularly constitute and well know -lrb- baudot p64 -rrb- these vigil be hold in cenacle or upper room of house during the day of persecution these meeting be not infrequent and be hold secretly in crypt catacomb private house and at martyr ' tomb in time of peace they be hold everywhere in church monastery castle vigil be divide into two class major and minor major vigil be the vigil of christmas epiphany and pentecost and they be call privileged vigil and be celebrate as semi-double the vigil of christmas and pentecost be privileged vigil of the first class the vigil of epiphany be a privileged vigil of the second class all other be minor or non-privileged vigil title vii-octave _ etymology and nature _ the word octave be from the latin _ octavus _ -lrb- eighth -rrb- because in the early age of christianity the church celebrate the eighth day only after the celebration of the feast itself not until the twelfth century be the custom of a commemoration on each of the eight day introduce we have probably a example of this still in we breviary the feast of st agne be celebrate on 21st January and on 28th it be mention at vespers and laud only and the name in old roman service book be _ octavo s agnetis _ the origin of the octave be jewish we read in the old testament that god order that the feast of pasch and pentecost should be celebrate for eight day so too the feast of tabernacle last for eight day the first and eighth day be day of special celebration and devotion the christian church adopt the method of show great honor and glory to the principal festival of the christian year to the great saint the patron of country diocese etc but just as the calendar become overcrowded with saint ' office which exclude almost entirely the Sunday and ferial office so too the addition of octave create confusion and further tend to the exclusion of the old liturgical use of the psalter and the supplanting of the Sunday and ferial office hence in the _ motu proprio abhinc duo anno _ the octave of the calendar be divide into three great class privileged common and simple privileged octave be further divide into three _ order _ those of the first order be the octave of easter and pentecost the octave of epiphany and corpus christus belong to the second order and the octave of the nativity and ascension belong to the third the christmas octave admit feast of saint but the octave of epiphany easter and pentecost do not admit any feast -lrb- tit v sec 3 -rrb- a day within a octave have a right to first vespers and the antiphon and response should be from first vespers -lrb- scr June 1905 -rrb- but the feast of the day fall within octave have a right to first and second vespers the exception be when at second vespers of st thoma the office of the octave of the nativity to be observe on 30th December have to be commemorate again in octave like octave of epiphany when each day have its proper antiphon at the _ magnificat _ and again on and July in second vespers of visitation the office of st peter and paul be to be commemorate in octave the suffrage of saint and the athanasian creed be not say when feast of the universal church which be celebrate with a octave be perpetually transfer to the next day because of a perpetual impediment accord to the rubric the octave day be not therefore perpetually transfer but ought to be keep as in the universal church on its own day title viii -- office of the bless virgin for Saturday _ in omnibus sabbati per annum entra adventum et quadragesimam ac nisi quatuor tempora aut vigiliae ocurrant _ etc in all saturday throughout the year except on the saturday of advent lend ember day or occur vigil or unless a feast of nine lesson have to be say on the Saturday then it be lay down in the rubric that the office of the bless virgin should always be say with the rite of a simple office the rubric of the new psalter -lrb- title i sec 6 -rrb- direct _ in officio sanctae mariae in sabbato et in festis simplicibus sic officium persolvendum est ad matutinum invitatorium et hymnus dicuntur de eodem officio vel de iisdem festis psalmi cum suis antiphonis et versu de feria occurente i et ii lectis de feria cum responsoriis propriis vel de communi iii vero lectio de officio vel festo duabus lectionibus in unum juncti si quando duae pro festo habeatur ad reliquas autem horas omnia dicuntur prouti supra num 5 in festi duplicibus expositum est _ in the office of the bless virgin for saturday -lrb- decree scr 26th January 1916 -rrb- the antiphon and psalm at matins laud and small hour be to be say from the Saturday and from the _ capitulum _ onward all be to be take from the office of the bless virgin this office be not to be confound with the _ officium parvum beatae mariae _ the office _ de sabbato _ be obligatory throughout the church the _ officium parvum _ be only for choir use a addition to the office of the day Saturday dedicate to the bless virgin be of great antiquity as the mention of it in the work of st peter damien st bernard and pope benedict xiii show but as to the time of its origin or a history of its growth little seem to be know at first the cult consist in various and voluntary prayer and practice about the middle of the fourteenth century a office be compose for recital on saturday as dedicate to the mother of god the office in we breviary be compose by st pius v -lrb- 1566-1572 -rrb- title ix -- commemoration the rule lay down in the general rubric of the breviary for commemoration be never very simple and when we read the change bring about in _ de ratione divini officii recitandus juxta novum psalterus ordinem _ title ii iii iv v vi with ' the decree of the congregation -lrb- January 1912 -rrb- and subsequently -lrb- _ abhinc duo anno _ -rrb- everyone must fear to tread the maze with certainty and must often fall back gratefully on the labor of the compiler of the _ ordo _ which he follow or perhaps doubt may be dispel by _ the new psalter _ -lrb- burton and myer -rrb- publish in 1912 the chapter on the calendar in that book be worth study but need now addition and correction owe to the issue of more recent decree in the study of commemoration and translation of feast there be two word which have a special meaning and which be often use in calendar work deserve a special note they be occurrence and concurrence _ occurrence _ be the conjunction of two or more office which fall on the same day it may be accidental when two movable feast be concerned or when a movable feast fall on a day which have a fixed office or it may be perpetual when a fixed office fall on a day which already have a fixed office the church do not ask the recitation of a double or a triple office she by she fixed rule prefer one out of the two of the occur office transfer if possible the other or at least commemorate they by a antiphon versicle and prayer and sometimes by a ninth lesson at matins _ concurrence _ be the conjunction of two office which succeed one another so that a question arise as to which feast the vespers belong to whether to the feast of the day or to the feast of the follow day or whether the psalm should be of the feast and the remain part of the vespers should be as the _ ordo _ so often note -lrb- _ a cap de seq _ -rrb- from the _ capitulum _ the office be take from the follow feast the new rubric contain five title which make certain modification in the rule hitherto observe we thus obtain a ready make division of the subject : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- of the precedence of feast -lrb- title ii -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- of the accidental occurrence of feast and they translation -lrb- title iii -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- of the perpetual occurrence of feast and they transfer -lrb- title v -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- of the occurrence of feast -lrb- title v -rrb- -lrb- 5 -rrb- of the commemoration -lrb- title vi -rrb- -lrb- myer and burton _ op cit _ -rrb- the new rubric without the aid of any commentator give pretty clear notion of the law of precedence occurrence and commemoration for student in college these rule be expound in detail with addition change exception but for priest long past the student stage it be difficult to undo the fix liturgy lore of they student and early priest life and the need of such a book as _ the new psalter and its use _ be for those interested a necessity even since the publication of that book change have be make for example double major or minor and semi-double which be perpetually exclude on they own day be transfer to some fixed day this be give in _ the new psalter and its use _ but this have now be change in the case of feast of the universal church no translation be allow now but feast proper to a nation diocese order institute or particular church may still be transfer to a fixed day if perpetually impede on they own day another example of necessary change in that excellent book be in the last paragraph of page 136 -lrb- see decree scr June 1912 -rrb- the work of compiler and liturgist need constant revision to keep pace with new decision and decree in make commemoration the order of the commemoration as lay down in the _ ordo _ should be follow element of a commemoration be the antiphon of the _ benedictus _ or the _ magnificat _ with versicle and response these antiphon be consider most excellent precede as they do the gospel canticle -lrb- st luke i -rrb- the antiphon versicle and prayer of the commemoration at a hour should never be repetition of other say in the same hour thus if in the office of a confessor pontiff have the prayer _ da quaesumus _ another confessor pontiff 's feast commemorate in the same hour should not have the same prayer about the prayer or as it be call the collect the follow should be note : first the commemoration be omit if the prayer of the office which be be recite and the prayer of the feast to be commemorate have the same object thus a feast of the bless virgin fall within the octave of the assumption should not be commemorate second where a commemoration for a saint or saint of title similar to that of the saint whose office be be say be to be make the congregation of rite -lrb- 5th may 1736 -rrb- arrange that not even the versicle and response be repeat and that the follow order be observe : -- in vespers -- 1st com make by antiphon and versicle of laud 2nd com make by antiphon of second vesper and ver of ii nocturn 3rd com make by antiphon of i noct and ver of iii nocturn in laud -- 1st com make by antiphon and ver from first vesp 2nd com make by antiphon i noct and ver iii noct 3rd com make by antiphon ii vesp vers ii noct if it should happen in commemorate a day within a octave that the versicle from the common have already be take for the office then the rule be _ sumenda est in laudibus antiphona de secundis vesperis et pro secundis vesperis antiphona de laudibus in utroque taman casu cum v de primis vesperis _ -lrb- scr 18th dec 1779 -rrb- in the above given form of make commemoration it may be note that the second commemoration in laud be make up from the versicle and response of matins and not from second vespers so as to avoid repeat in laud what be say at vespers -lrb- cavalierus -rrb- as regard prayer in the office the reminder that the same formulum must not be repeat in the same hour may be supplement because prayer have all word identical save one single word be not consider in liturgy as different prayer -lrb- _ eg accendamur exemplis instruamur exempli _ feast of st philip and st jame feast of several martyr -rrb- so too prayer which have the same form of petition -lrb- eg the prayer on feast of st joseph and on feast of st mathew -rrb- be not consider as different and must not be repeat in the same hour but where the petition be different even though all the remainder of the prayer be similar in wording they may be repeat in the same hour but what be to be do in office where a commemoration prayer and the prayer of the office be from the common what must be do where the feast be the feast of a doctor and a commemoration of a doctor be to be make what be to be do when the office of the feast be of a virgin not a martyr and a commemoration of a virgin not a martyr be to be make in the first case the prayer from the office of a confessor or pontiff should be say add to it the title of doctor in the other case the prayer _ indulgentiam _ omit the word _ martyr _ be to be say the origin of these commemoration be that the pope in remove the solemn celebration of certain feast of apostle and martyr which be formerly of precept provide that they _ cultus _ should not be forget and that they commemoration in the office should remind priest and the faithful of those servant of god whom the church wish ever to honor i have say the order give for commemoration in the _ ordo _ should be follow but not to follow this order do not exceed a venial sin even the deliberate omission of a commemoration in laud or vespers be not a violation of a grave precept title x -- the translation of feast when several office fall on the same day only one office the one of highest rank or most important be say the other be transfer or commemorate the last section deal with commemoration and now we come to the difficult question of the translation of feast title x of the general rubric must be read in connection with the apostolic constitution _ divino afflatu _ -lrb- 1911 -rrb- and with the _ abhinc duo anno _ -lrb- 1913 -rrb- translation of a feast may mean the removal of a feast from a impede day to a day which be free thus a feast of higher rank may fall on a feast day of a saint whose feast be of lower rank the latter may then be transfer transference be either perpetual or accidental and temporary the former apply to feast which be always impede by the meeting with a feast of higher rite on they fixed day a feast which would fall on 6th January would suffer perpetual translation this translation bear different name in rubric decree and liturgical writings -- _ translatio ad diem fixam translatio ad diem assignatam mutatio etc _ accidental translation mean occasional transference a transfer in one year and not in another title ii section i of the _ divino afflatu _ give the character of preferential rank which be to be consider in occurrence concurrence or translation of feast _ ritus altior ratio primarius aut secundarius dignita personali solemnita externa _ although in the general rubric of the breviary the title _ de festorum praestantia _ be not find the four principle -lrb- 1 -rrb- gradation of rite -lrb- 2 -rrb- classification as a primary or secondary feast -lrb- 3 -rrb- personal dignity -lrb- 4 -rrb- external solemnity be mention in the sixth section of title x _ de translatione festorum _ and the degree of personal dignity be add in the second section of title xl _ de commemorationibus _ before 1897 precedence and hence transference be settle first by the rank of the rite -lrb- double major etc -rrb- then too between two feast of the same rite transference be settle by dignity and finally by solemnity but in 1897 the sacred congregation of rite indicate two further note to be observe in the weigh of claim for transference -lrb- 1 -rrb- the classification into primary and secondary feast -lrb- 2 -rrb- the distinction between fixed and movable feast this latter distinction -- between fix and movable feast -- have be suppress by the new legislation and some change make in the other i _ gradation of feast _ make a distinction between double semi-double and simple and distinguish the various kind of double the order of procedure will be -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- double of the first class -lrb- 2 -rrb- double of the second class -lrb- 3 -rrb- greater double -lrb- 4 -rrb- double -lrb- 5 -rrb- semi-double -lrb- 6 -rrb- simple but as the section show -lrb- tit ii sec i -rrb- this be subject to the privilege of certain sunday feria and octave day or even day within a octave and hence a ordinary Sunday though only a semi-double will take precedence of a double and a octave day though only a double take precedence of a greater double ii classification as a primary or a secondary feast table of classification be to be find in the prefatory part of the new breviary under the heading _ tre tabellae _ they give a revise list of feast with they rank and rite some feast be reduce from primary to secondary rank -lrb- eg feast of the dolor -rrb- and the table give a new division of primary and secondary double and semi-double iii thirdly the order of precedence among feast will be determine by the dignity of the person who be the special object of the office that be to be recite hence in the order set down in general rubric -lrb- title xi _ de concurrentia officii _ sec 2 -rrb- all feast of we lord other thing be equal take precedence of the feast of we lady and then in order come the festival of the angel of st john the baptist of st joseph of the apostle and other saint amongst the saint who be honor as martyr confessor or virgin there be no precedence as to personal dignity iv lastly there be the note of external solemnity which may give precedence to one or two feast which be equal in the above-mentioned matter -- ie in gradation i classification ii precedence iii but the main point be that only double of first and second class have the right as a rule of transference transference be now rather rare from these rule it will be see that in case of concurrence occurrence perpetual transfer or translation precedence between two feast will first be decide by gradation of rite a double of the first class be prefer to one of the second and so on if the feast be of equal rank recourse must be have to the second test the distinction between primary and secondary feast if both happen to be primary or both be secondary then precedence will be grant to the feast which have the greater personal dignity and if both feast should have the same dignity then the fact of external solemnity would confer precedence -lrb- _ the new psalter and its use _ p 79 -rrb- for practical help a look at the first of the _ duae tabellae _ be a guide to find out which office be to be say if more than one feast occur on the same day before discuss new office it may be well to remember that votive office of all kind include the votive office concede by the decree of July 1883 be abolish these office be drastic innovation introduce to get rid of the very long psalm arrangement of the ferial office the new distribution of the psalm get rid of the onus and votive office be no longer give in the breviary title xl -- concurrence _ concurrence _ be the conjunction of two office which succeed each other so that the question arise to which of the two be the vespers of the day to be assign the origin of this conjunction of feast be by some old writer trace to the mosaic law in which the festival begin in the evening and they quote from evening until evening you shall celebrate you sabbath -lrb- _ leviticus _ xxii 32 -rrb- the effect of concurrence may be that the whole vespers may belong to the feast of the day or may be say entirely from the feast of the follow day or it may be that the psalm and antiphon belong to the precede festival and the rest of the office be from the succeed feast the general rubric title xi must be read now in conjunction with title iv v and vi of the _ additione et variationes ad norman bullae divino afflatu _ the rule for concurrence be give in table iii of the _ tre tabellae _ insert in the new breviary -lrb- scr 23 January 1912 -rrb- these table supersede the table give in the old edition of the breviary the first of these two table show which office be to be say if more than one feast occur on the same day whether perpetually or accidentally the second table be a guide to concurrence -- _ ie _ whether the first vespers of the follow feast be to be say entirely without reference to the precede feast or if second vespers of the precede feast be to be say entire without reference to the follow or again first vespers of the follow with commemoration of the precede or second vespers of the precede with commemoration of the follow or vespers of the more noble feast with commemoration of the other -- any of these may be the liturgical order to follow and the _ tabellum _ make thing clear the table be to be use thus : -- open the breviary at the _ i tabella si occurrat eodem die _ first find the number mark in that square in which the two feast in question meet and then read the direction print in column on same page to left-hand side bear the same number for example : the question be about the occurrence of a Sunday of the first class and a double of the first class _ double of the first class _ stand first word of page and _ Sunday of first class _ will be find in column beneath the row of figure now the square in which straight line draw from _ double of first class _ and _ Sunday of first class _ meet bear the number 6 and reference to number 6 in column of direction find on same page give the rule _ officium de 2 translatio de i _ that be the office must be of the Sunday of first class and the double of the first class must be transfer accord to the rubric when in these brief directive note -lrb- 1-8 -rrb- mention be make of the first or the precede the reference be make to feast or office print in the upper part of the table eg double of first class reference to the second or following refer to feast print in the lower section of the table where _ o _ stand in a square in the _ tabellum _ it signify that there can be no occurrence or concurrence between feast whose line meet in that square these two table be very ingeniously arrange the list give in the breviary follow these table give the list of greater sunday and feria privileged vigil double of first and second class and greater double and tell whether feast be primary or secondary title xii -- the arrangement of the office accord to the rubric give above if any one wish from the rubric give in the breviary to arrange the office he can see in the calendar and in the table of movable feast which office he be to say on the follow day and when he have find out the feast he determine from the rule give the vespers and the other hour if the office be the office of a excepted feast the whole office be say from the feast as it be in the proper or common of saint but the psalm of laud and the hour be take from the Sunday psalm as they stand in the new psaltery at prime the psalm _ deus in nomine _ be say in place of _ confiteminus _ compline be say from the Sunday psalm if the office be the ordinary non-excepted office it be recite accord to the rule lay down in the new rubric tit i n 5 : -- _ ad matut invit hymnus

canonicus _ define a ecclesiastical benefice to be a juridical entity constitute or erect by competent ecclesiastical authority consist of a sacred office and the right of receive revenue from endowment attach to the office hence under this canon as previously three condition be require for a benefice first a sacred office second the right of receive revenue from endowment attach to that office third erection by ecclesiastical authority there never be any doubt in the many discussion on this subject that the work and care of a parish be a sacred office and that parish priest hold such a office but the second condition mention above receive different interpretation some hold that it imply a certain amount of ecclesiastical property set aside from the revenue of which the holder of the benefice would derive he income hence the revenue of parish priest in these kingdom arise from certain and voluntary offering of the faithful be not fix revenue do not fulfil the condition of endowment and parish must not be regard as benefice this opinion be no longer tenable canon 1410 say : -- the endowment of a benefice be constitute either by property the ownership of which pertain to the juridical entity itself or by certain and obligatory payment of any family or moral personality or by certain and voluntary offering of the faithful which appertain to the rector of the benefice or as they be call steal fee within the limit of diocesan taxation or legitimate custom or choral distribution exclusive of a third part of the same if all the revenue of the benefice consist of choral distribution this canon seem to make it clear that the second condition be fulfil in all the parish of these kingdom since to the sacred office be attach the right of receive revenue from the certain and voluntary offering of the faithful or from steal fee or from both the third condition erection by ecclesiastical authority be qualify by canon 1418 which prescribe that benefice should be erect by a legitimate document define the place of the benefice its endowment and the duty and rights of the person appoint this law have not a invalidate clause hence it be not now necessary nor ever be it necessary to have such a write document a valid appointment be and can be make without any write where these three condition be fulfil there be a benefice true real and canonical normally parish

omission of the recital of the divine office by a beneficed person be a grave sin against the virtue of religion and a grave sin against the virtue of justice for the church impose on the beneficiary the duty of the office recital on condition that he may not take the fruit of he benefice if he do not recite the office what sin be commit by the omission of a notable part of the daily office he who wilfully omit a notable part of the daily divine office commit a mortal sin a notable part of the divine office for any day be hold by some theologian to be the omission of one psalm in one of the small hour or a corresponding quantity of matter in lesson response etc they hold that such wilful omission be a grave sin other theologian hold -- and they opinion be the more common and the more probable one -- that although one psalm be a notable part of a small hour in relation to the whole office it be not a notable part and its omission be not a grave matter these theologian hold that the wilful omission of a entire small hour or equivalent matter -lrb- eg sext or the third nocturn of matins -rrb- be a omission of a notable part and can not be excuse from grave sin the omission of the entire office of a day the seven canonical hour be hold by some theologian to carry the guilt of seven mortal sin because there be a different precept for each hour and the omission of each hour violate a precept the salamenticens think this opinion probable the more common and the more correct opinion be that by such omission only one sin be commit and the theologian who hold this opinion say that the recitation of the canonical hour be impose under one precept only and hence there be only one obligation embrace the seven hour this be the opinion of st alphonsus -lrb- n 148 -rrb- who quote several author -lrb- include lessius sanchez and st antoninus -rrb- in support if a person in holy order omit several hour with a retractation or a moral interruption in he sinful intention he may commit several mortal sin because all the omission which in themselves be grave matter may become independent of each other by the interruption and renewal of the intention -lrb- st alphonsus n 148 -rrb- what must a person do who have a doubt that he have omit something in he recitation of the office be he bind to make assurance doubly sure by recite the part of which he doubt if the doubt be a positive doubt that be if he have good reason to believe that he have recite it he be not bind to anything further regard the part in question for instance if a priest remember have start the recitation of a lesson and in a short time find himself at the end of it and can not be sure if he have recite it the presumption be in favor of the priest and of the recitation because it be he custom to recite completely whatever part he commence he have thus moral certainty that he have satisfy the precept and it be not necessary to repeat it if the necessity for repetition be admit in such a case a fruitful source of scruple be open up on the other hand if the doubt be negative -- that be to say if a person have no reasonable motive for believe that he have recite the full office or the full hour he be bind to recite the part omit because in such a doubt the precept of recitation be as the theologian say in possession -lrb- st alphonsus n 150 -rrb- it be not allow to change anything nor to add anything to the daily office without permission the sacred congregation of rite -lrb- 10 June 1690 n 3222 -rrb- reply to a query that in saint ' office nothing be to be add and nothing be to be change and this reply apply to all sort of office old and new the order to be observe in recite the divine office in recite the divine office two point of order be to be note : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the order or arrangement of office -lrb- 2 -rrb- the order or arrangement of hour the order of office indicate which office be to be say on each day as lay down in the calendar the order of the hour point out which of the seven hour should be recite firstly secondly etc matins laud prime terce etc it be of obligation to observe both order but be it a sin to change wilfully the order of the office it be not if there be a reasonable cause for the change for instance if a priest can not say the office proper to he diocese on a certain day but say some other approved office the change be not a sin but if a priest _ ex industria _ substitute one office for another it be _ per se _ a venial sin but if a office be say which be very much shorter than the calendar office or if this change or substitute be so frequent as to disturb gravely the good order of the year 's office the sin may be -lrb- and accord to some author be -rrb- a mortal sin it be ask whether a person fulfil he debt to the church if he have recite by mistake a office other than the one assign in the calendar of the day theologian teach that such a recitation fulfil the debt the church do not wish to impose a second recitation and she axiom _ officium pro officio valet _ hold provide always that the order of the psalm as lay down in the new psaltery be follow this order be necessary always for validity however if the substitute office be very much shorter than the omit office it be advise to equalise they by recite the psalm of matins this be a counsel and be not lay down by theologian as a obligation a office thus omit be not to be transfer to another day -lrb- scr June 17th 1673 -rrb- the office may be omit altogether for that year if there be leisure the omit office should be recite this practice be in conformity with the spirit of the liturgy and with the right order of the calendar the sacred congregation of rite question on this matter reply _ sic debere fierus _ such should be do if a priest recite by mistake one day 's office for another -lrb- eg the Tuesday office on a Monday -rrb- he be bind to recite Tuesday 's office on Tuesday -lrb- st alphonsus -rrb- if however after a portion of the office have be read it be notice that a mistake have be make in read the calendar or the _ ordo _ and that the office partly recite be not the office of the current day what be to be do if the priest have without fault make the mistake of recite some office not ascribe to the current day he be not bind to repeat the part already recite -lrb- eg matins -rrb- it be sufficient valid and lawful to follow the correct office in the follow hour the priest recite be not bind to repeat even part of a hour if he find out he mistake during the recitation of even a small hour and he may finish the psalm or hymn or prayer which he be recite when he discover he mistake and he may then take up the correct office at the part or hour at which he leave off or he may finish the hour at which he be engage the former solution of the difficulty seem the better as it more accurately agree with the maxim _ error corrigatur ubus apprehenditur _ if the error in the selecting of the office have be wilful say through gross carelessness and be the fault of the priest who change a notable part of a canonical hour he be oblige -- the more probable opinion teach -- to repeat the full hour and this obligation bind under pain of venial sin -- _ ie _ the obligation to recite the office in the prescribed manner what be a person bind to do who forget part of a hour -- be he oblige to repeat the full hour he be bind to recite the part forget only unless the mistake be make through gross carelessness and unless it be a considerable part -lrb- eg two nocturn -rrb- in that case he be bind under pain of venial sin to repeat the full hour if a person say the same hour -lrb- eg terce -rrb- twice may he compensate for extra labor by the omission of a equivalent part -lrb- eg none -rrb- such omission be unlawful he must recite all the hour without omission -lrb- scavinus 391 -rrb- be there a obligation to repeat the hour in the order fix in the breviary yes there be such a obligation and a person may sin venially by the inversion of the hour the obligation bind _ sub venialus _ only the inversion do not mean any grave breach of order which be fix by a secondary precept and as a circumstance of light importance if the whole office be recite the substance of the office -- which be the main and primary matter -- be safeguard several author argue that any inversion of the canonical hour if frequent be a mortal sin but the opinion which say that the inversion of the hour be only a venial sin be the more probable -lrb- st alph 169 gury 77 lehmkuhl ii 621 -rrb- which cause justify a inversion of the hour any reasonable cause justify this inversion thus if a friend invite a priest to joint recitation of a hour and the priest have not the precede canonical hour recite he be justified in accept the invitation and in invert the order of the hour or if a person have a diurnal only at hand he may read the day hour although he have not matins for the day read again a priest may not have the lesson for matins at hand but he may recite the psalm for matins laud and add the lesson at matins when they be to hand -lrb- gury n 78 st alph n 170 -rrb- be it a sin to say matins for follow day before finish office of current day some theologian answer affirmatively because the office of the current day should be complete before another office be begin other hold that such recitation be both valid and licit as the office of one day and its obligation have no bond with the office of another day and that any reasonable cause exempt from all sin or fault -lrb- gury n 79 -rrb- not to recite the commemoration in the prescribe order set out in the _ ordo _ be hold by some theologian to be a venial sin as they hold that the rubric be preceptive other hold that it be not any sin as they say that the rubric be directive article iii -- time of recitation the time fix for the recitation of the entire office of the day be from midnight to the midnight follow and anyone bind to recite the divine office do not sin gravely if he have recite carefully the entire office of the day between these limit of time because within these limit the substance of the obligation binding to time be fulfil of course it be lawful in virtue of a privilege grant by the church to recite on the previous evening matins and laud for the follow day in the recitation the time fix by the church for each hour should be observe but the non-recital at those fix time be never a mortal sin and be rarely a venial sin unless they postponement or anticipation be without cause when may a priest begin the recitation of matins and laud for the follow day there be two different reply give to this question one opinion state that it be lawful to begin matins and laud after 2 o'clock pm and this could be lawfully do every day in the year and in every land another opinion -- and st alphonsus call it _ sententium verior _ -- deny that such a course be lawful the old french breviary give a _ horarium _ arrange the hour of anticipation of matins and laud so that no one should through temerity or ignorance begin the anticipation before the sun have pass half way in its course between mid-day and sunset on January 20th the time to begin the anticipation of hour be 215 pm but on June 8th the anticipation be not to begin till 4 pm nowadays the first opinion be hold almost universally the principal _ internal _ argument for this opinion be the teaching that the anticipation may begin from the public hour of first vespers and these may be recite publicly accord to present-day custom at 2 pm therefore this time 2 o'clock pm be the beginning of the ecclesiastical day and can be take as the time for private anticipation of matins and laud the _ external _ argument in favor of this opinion be the authority of theologian in 1905 the sacred congregation of rite be ask the question _ utrum in priva recitatione matutinum sequenti dieus incipus possit 2da pomeriddiane _ the reply be _ consulantur probatus auctore _ -lrb- _ acta sanctae sedis _ xxxvii p 712 -rrb- now many approve author -lrb- eg lehmkuhl ii 793 ballerini-palmieri iv 515 slater i p 609 -rrb- hold that it be lawful privately to anticipate matins and laud at 2 o'clock pm lehmkuhl who previously favor a stricter view be compel in the latest edition of he _ moral theology _ to say of this opinion which allow anticipation to begin at 2 o'clock pm : _ quae sententia hodie a multis usque gravissimi viri tenetur et observatur ut specta consuetudine extrinseca saltem probabilita negarus nequit _ we conclude accordingly that always and everywhere the private anticipation of matins and laud may begin at 2 pm -lrb- _ cf irish ecclesiastical record _ fifth series vol i no 541 -rrb- doubt have arise in connection with time change make by various state in europe the various scheme of new time of daylight saving of co-ordination of time uniformity of time all through certain state have give rise to doubt and query regard the time for fulfil the precept of the office and also regard the time for lawful anticipation of matins and laud these doubt be solve several year ago and now there be no longer any difficulty or anxiety over true time new time legal time in relation to matter ecclesiastical in reply to query dr m j o'donnell in the _ irish ecclesiastical record _ -lrb- vol iii p 582 -rrb- explain clearly this time difficulty and its solution by the congregation of the council on 22nd July 1893 the bishop of trier explain to the congregation of the council that owe to the state legislation in the german empire all public clock should register the same time and that this mean that in he diocese the legal computation differ by half a hour from the mean time may cleric follow the legal time in recite the divine office be the bishop 's question the congregation of the council answer by a simple affirmative in 1892 greenwich time be introduce for state purpose into all railway postal and government office in holland the query be put to the congregation of the inquisition if the clergy and people might for the purpose of fast and other ecclesiastical obligation follow the new time or be they oblige to retain the true time the reply be _ affirmative ad primam : negative ad secundam partem _ in a word the constant roman answer have be ` do as you please ' so far as the approval of the legal time be concern it confirm the conclusion of the editor of the _ acta _ -lrb- xxxii-251 -rrb- that in computing time the church follow the rule that regulate all business concern in different locality in the meantime take into account the conventional character of ` time ' and the liberal principle of rome in the past we have no doubt that everyone priest or layman be fully justify in follow the new time if he feel so inclined -lrb- see _ codex juri canon _ can 33 -rrb- be priest bind to recite matins and laud before mass the first sentence of the _ ritus servandus in celebratione missae _ in the missal contain the clause _ saltem malutino cum laudibus absoluto _ the word _ saltem _ indicate that the church notify the minimum and expect a further hour prime or even other of the small hour to be finish before mass but theologian hold that there be no grave obligation for such prior-to-mass recital and that any reasonable cause excuse from the obligation -lrb- lehmkuhl ii 628 -rrb- in connection with this matter a very instructive and devotional essay in the _ irish ecclesiastical record _ -lrb- fourth series xxxi n 533 -rrb- by father m russell sj be well worth read it be entitle a neglect adverb the adverb be _ saltem _ from the clause quote at what time should the small hour be recite prime may be and probably with more appropriateness should be use as morning prayer and say before mass terce and sext may be say before mid-day or sext and none may be say after mid-day vespers should be say after mid-day compline be the night prayer of the monk who probably institute the hour it should be bear in mind that the substance of the law of recitation be fulfil if the whole office of the day be recite before midnight and that the obligation for entire and complete recitation be grave while the recitation of the hour at set hour of the day be a light obligation article iv-of the place of recitation and the attitude in recite the office where should the divine office be recite the divine office should be recite in the place intend and set apart by the church for that purpose -- viz in the choir or in the church -lrb- con trid sess 24 -rrb- canon and religious be bind to recite they office in choir of course this refer to canon in residence at a cathedral for daily service and to religious in the strict application of the term the divine office may be recite by priest anywhere in the church in a dwelling-house walk in the field etc in recite the office a priest should observe a attitude in harmony with the great work in which he be engage prayer to god hence he attitude should be become on he knee stand sit walk but not sprawl or lie the rubric which prescribe kneel sit standing apply to choir recitation only but writer recommend that in private recitation these direction should not be altogether omit and they say that the practice of these rubric of kneel bow standing etc be laudable and a aid to devout recital article v -- pronunciation of the word what kind of pronunciation be to be attend to in the recitation of the divine office the pronunciation should be vocal -- that be there should be some sound _ aliqui sonitus verborum _ as st alphonsus write -lrb- n 162 -rrb- hence to read the breviary merely mentally or with the eye only do not satisfy the obligation -lrb- a -rrb- although the reader may not hear the sound produce he must be careful to form with he lip every syllable this must be do not necessarily in a throaty way the formation of the word clearly with the lip suffice but writer on this point emphasise the importance of audible recitation as a preventive of slurred mutilate latinity which often lead to careless or even invalid recitation they note too that the reading with the eye merely be a habit which reader bring from the reading of other book to they reading of the breviary german author dwell at length on the fact that many priest very early in they career contract the habit of faulty vocalisation of liturgy and that they never seem to notice they fault or at least never seem to attempt a amendment these author attribute the defect to sub-voce recitation and recommend audible recitation long and frequent audible recitation to all priest read they hour -lrb- footnote a : the privilege of mental recitation be grant to the friar minor by pope leo x and pius v but it be probable that the privilege be withdraw by pope gregory xv in 1622 in he letter _ romanus pontifex _ and urban viii 1635 withdraw all privilege grant _ vivae vocis oraculo _ the text of the document grant the privilege be obscurely word still several theologian of repute maintain that the privilege still exist and extend to the whole office this be teach by the salaraenticens _ de hor can cap _ 3 n 55 tamburinus rodriguez etc other oppose this view of the privilege exist after pope urban 's letter _ alias _ this privilege extend to secular priest who be franciscan tertiary if it exist at all -rrb- can a priest fulfil he obligation by recite the office with a companion yes he can for such recitation be the church 's ideal and the priest who say he part -lrb- alternate verse etc -rrb- as in choir fulfil he obligation even when he companion be a layman or a inattentive person in such recitation a priest should be careful -lrb- 1 -rrb- that he recitation be of alternate verse -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the verse recitation be successive and not simultaneous -lrb- 3 -rrb- that the verse etc chant by one companion -lrb- or by one choir -rrb- be hear by the other companion or choir there be no necessity for a priest at such recitation to say one verse in a loud voice and to say he companion 's verse in a low inaudible voice some priest do this with distressing result imperfect vocal recitation often lead to doubt and scruple in old age when remedy either can not be apply or prove useless those who recite the office in choir be bind by the rubric concern kneel sit standing etc secondly they be bind to observe the rule of the liturgy especially the rule as to the stop in each verse at the asterisk mark thirdly they be bind to recite clearly and distinctly but even if they can not hear distinctly the alternate choir or even if they recite in a low voice they fulfil the obligation of recitation and canon be bind at cathedral office to sing and chant or to lose they manual distribution and the fruit of they prebend if a person recite he office with a companion or in a choir do not understand the word recite by he companion or by the choir he be not bind at the end to repeat the part which he do not understand because such a person have the intention of offer prayer and praise to god and that intention suffice moreover the church 's precept of recite the office should he interpret benignly otherwise it must give rise to many scruple for companion in recitation then always should be anxious as to the duty of repetition or the non-fulfilled duty of complete recitation pronunciation of the word of the office should be _ integral _ that be the word and syllable be to be repeat fully without mutilation or abbreviation hence if mutilation of the word occur to such a extent that the sense or meaning of the word be notably change mortal sin may be commit but if the mutilation be small in quantity there be only a venial sin commit and often no sin at all may be commit as the mutilation of word or syllable may be quite involuntary or may be do inadvertently or may arise from a inveterate habit very difficult to correct and in the attempt to cure it time and patience may have be spend -lrb- st alph 164-165 -rrb- this bad habit if it extend over a large portion of the recitation and destroy notably the sense of the word may bind _ sub gravus _ to repetition as this fault or habit affect the very substance of recitation priest seldom be bind to such a repetition as the mutilation be not destructive to the sense of a notable part of the office and hence do not affect the substance of the obligation to vocal recital st alphonsus hold -lrb- n 165 -rrb- that the obligation be fulfil as long as the meaning be not destroy _ quando servatur aliqua significatio verborum _ pronunciation should be _ continuous _ that be the recitation of each hour should be continuous non-interrupted and every notable stoppage or break in the recitation of a canonical hour be a venial sin if there be no excuse cause for such a interruption any reasonable cause for interruption -lrb- eg to obey a bell call to see a parishioner who call to hear a confession -rrb- excuse from all fault -lrb- st alph n 168 -rrb- if the recital of the office for any canonical hour be interrupt should the whole hour be repeat some theologian say that it should be repeat but the more probable opinion deny that there be any such obligation it hold that the union of the prayer prescribe by the church be not break as each psalm each lesson each prayer have a complete signification and they be unite sufficiently in one round of prayer by the intention form of continue the hour or even by the actual continuation gury state that a priest interrupt the office between the verse of a psalm be not bind to repeat the entire psalm on resume the recitation as he say each verse have its own signification may matins be say separately from laud without any excuse cause yes for it be the practice of the early church to say these part of the liturgy at time separate by interval but if matins be say separately without laud follow immediately _ pater noster _ with dominus vobiscum and the prayer of the day should be say at the end of the _ te deum _ if laud follow matins immediately the _ pater _ and _ ave _ should not be say for the congregation -lrb- same decree -rrb- say _ laude incohanda ut in psalterio _ but in the psalter the _ pater _ and _ ave _ be not assign for the beginning of laud a notable time may elapse between the nocturn of matins without any excuse cause in the early church interval occur between each nocturn some author state that a interval of three hour between two nocturn be quite lawful even when there be no cause for the delay with a reasonable cause the interval may last as long as the excuse cause require article vi -- intention and attention the valid recitation of the divine office require that the priest should have in he mind a intention of pray for the divine office be a true and real prayer not a mere vocal exercise hence a priest read he office as a mere study or as a means of remember the word of the psalm do not validly recite he office -lrb- st alph n 176 -rrb- now what sort of intention be best and what sort of intention be necessary a actual explicit intention which state expressly when the breviary be open i intend to pray be the best intention the devout recital of the prayer _ aperus domine _ express well the best form of the actual explicit intention of those recite the office but such a express actual intention be not necessary a virtual intention which find expression in the opening of the breviary to recite the office suffice the mere opening of the book the find out of the office the arrangement of the book marker be ample evidence of the existence of a virtual intention quite sufficient for the valid recitation of the office st alphonsus write _ imo puto semper adesse exercite intentionem actualem implendus officium _ -lrb- n 176 -rrb- this question of intention give great trouble to the timid and scrupulous whose doubt and difficulty seem hard to solve the common sense and common practice in everyday affair seem to desert some people when they prepare to read the canonical hour for who have not see the nervous pious anxious cleric stupidly labor to acquire even a sufficient intention before begin he hour attention in read the hour be a much more discuss and much more difficult mental effort it mean the application of the mind to the thing in which we be engage when we listen to a conversation or when we write a letter the mind be fix and attentive to the matter speak or write intention be a act of the will attention be a act of the understanding attention may be either external or internal external attention be attention of such a kind that it exclude every exterior action physically incompatible with the recitation of the office -- eg to write or type a letter to listen attentively to those converse be act incompatible with the simultaneous recitation of the office but walk poke a fire look for the lesson whilst recite from memory all the time be not incompatible with the external attention require in office recital because such act do not require mental effort which could count as a serious disturbing element however in this matter of external attention no rule can be formulate for all breviary reader for what may lightly disturb and distract one reader may have no effect on another and yet may seriously disturb the recitation of another -lrb- st alph n 176 -rrb- external attention be necessary for the valid recitation of the office internal attention be application or advertence of the mind be such internal attention such deliberate application or mental advertence necessary for the valid recitation of the office there be two opinion on this matter two reply to the question accord to one opinion and this be the more common and the more probable one internal attention be require for the valid recitation of the hour 1 because the divine office be a prayer but there can be no true or real prayer without internal attention for prayer be define as a elevation of the soul to god but if there be no internal attention there be no elevation of the soul to god and no prayer 2 we lord complain of those who have external attention at prayer but lack internal attention or advertence this people honor I with they lip but they heart be far from I -lrb- st matt xv -rrb- 3 the church appear to demand internal attention at prayer for although she have not give any positive precept deal with this kind of attention she do the same thing when she command that the recitation of the divine office take the form of prayer for god 's honor and this recitation of word can not be true prayer without internal attention 4 the council of trent seem to exact this attention when it wish that the divine office be say reverently distinctly and devoutly reverenter distincte devote 5 if no internal attention be require in recite the hour it be difficult to see how voluntary distraction be forbid by divine law this be the opinion hold by cajetan -lrb- 1496-1534 -rrb- sa -lrb- 1530-1596 -rrb- azor -lrb- 1539-1603 -rrb- sanchez -lrb- 1550-1610 -rrb- roncaglaus -lrb- 1677-1737 -rrb- concina -lrb- 1687-1756 -rrb- and st alphonsus the great doctor of prayer -lrb- 1696-1787 -rrb- accord to the other opinion external attention suffice always and ever to satisfy substantially the obligation of read the office and for the avoidance of mortal sin which invalid recitation entail for -lrb- 1 -rrb- to pray be to speak to god to trust in he to manifest to he the wish and want of the soul but this can be do by a person who have voluntary distraction of mind just as a man can read to he king a address setting forth the thanks and request of he subject although the reader 's mind be far from dwelling on the word or the meaning of the sentence before he eye but he be careful to read all the word in a clear intelligible manner now the theologian who maintain this opinion say that _ a fortiorus _ this method of read the hour should be valid for in the read the priest act principally in the name of the church as she minister and offer up prayer to god in she name and they say that the irreverence of the servant do not render the prayer of the church unplease to he -lrb- 2 -rrb- he who make a vow and resolve to do a certain act fulfil he vow even when fulfil it he act with voluntary distraction so a parus with the recitation of the office -lrb- 3 -rrb- the administration of the sacrament -- even the administration of extreme unction the form of which be a prayer -- with full voluntary distraction be valid so too should be the recital of breviary prayer -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the other opinion it be hard to see how if voluntary distraction destroy the substance of prayer involuntary distraction do not produce similar effect and hence there can be no prayer if there be distraction of any kind this opinion be hold by lugo -lrb- 1583-1660 -rrb- gobat -lrb- 1600-1679 -rrb- sporer -lrb- 1609-1683 -rrb- st antonnius -lrb- 1389-1459 -rrb- and other eminent man it be quote by st alphonsus as _ sati probabili _ of it lehmkuhl write quae ad substantiam divini officii dicamus sati probabiliter sufficere cum intentione orandus observasse attentionem externam -lrb- ii 635 -rrb- what be the division or kind of internal attention i objectively they be -lrb- 1 -rrb- spiritual attention -lrb- 2 -rrb- literal attention -lrb- 3 -rrb- superficial or material attention spiritual attention be that advertence of soul which tend towards god the term of all prayer when the soul meditate on the power wisdom goodness of god on the passion on the mother of god on god 's saint literal attention be that which strive to lay hold of the meaning of the word say in the office superficial attention be that advertence of soul which apply itself to the correct recitation of the word avoid error of pronunciation mutilation transposition etc etc ii subjectively virtual attention suffice habitual be divide into actual and interpretative actual attention be that which exist at the moment -- eg the attention pay by a pupil to a question put by a teacher virtual attention be attention which be once actual but be not such at the time speak of but which live virtually habitual be attention which once be actual which do not remain in act but which be not retract interpretative attention be that which never exist at all but which would have exist if the agent have advert which kind of internal attention be require in the reading of the office i objectively material or superficial attention be necessary since the breviary be a vocal prayer and therefore it be necessary to pronounce distinctly all the word of the day 's office and to observe the rubric but this suffice it be not necessary that a priest recite he hour should carefully notice each word it be sufficient to have general and moral attention to recite every part well and with the intention of pray sed sufficere moralem et generalem qua quis curet bene omnium dicere cum intentione orandus -lrb- st alphonsus -rrb- hence objectively neither attention which be call spiritual because it be not easy to attain nor the literal attention which religious who do not understand latin strive after be need for valid recitation by this it be not mean to convey that spiritual attention be not very excellent and very commendable and praiseworthy subjectively virtual attention suffice habitual do not suffice neither do interpretative best of all be actual attention but it be not necessary because it be not always within the power of mortal this want of internal attention be call mental distraction theologian distinguish two kind of distraction voluntary and involuntary voluntary distraction be thought which the mind freely and directly embrace to the exclusion of pious thought which should occupy it in prayer of which the office be a high form or they may be thought which arise from previous laziness thoughtlessness pre-occupation or some engrossing worldly affair involuntary distraction be those which come unbidden and unsought to the mind be neither place directly nor by they cause by the person at prayer do a person recite the hour sin if he have distraction if the distraction be involuntary there be no sin but if the distraction be voluntary there be sin but unless the mind be altogether fill with distraction not think of god of prayer of the word or of the meaning and unless the distraction be _ fully voluntary _ and _ reflective _ during a notable part of the office there be no mortal sin hence st alphonsus the great doctor of prayer write _ ut dicatur aliqui officio non satisfacere non solum requiritur ut voluntarie se distrahat sed etiam ut plene advertat se distrahi nam alias iste licet sponte se divertat non taman sponte se divertit a recitatione _ -lrb- st alphonsus n 177 -rrb- therefore before a person accuse himself of not satisfy the precept of recitation on account of inattention or distraction he must be able to affirm positively -lrb- 1 -rrb- that he be wilfully distract -lrb- 2 -rrb- he must have notice not only he distraction and mental occupation by vain thought but he must have notice _ also _ that he be distract in he recitation -lrb- 3 -rrb- he must be able to state positively that the intention resolution or desire to recite piously which he make at the beginning of he prayer be revoke with full advertence and that it do not exist either actually or virtually during the time of distraction in he recitation seldom indeed be these condition fulfil and seldom be there gravely sinful distraction this subject of attention in prayer in the official prayer of the church be important long and learn dispute about its nature and requirement occupy great thinker in time long go by to-day theologian argue on different side and anxiety serious painful and life-long reign in the soul of many who struggle to recite the office _ digne attente ac devote _ article vii-cause which excuse from read the office author generally give six cause which excuse a person from say the hour : lawful dispensation important work grave illness grave fear blindness want of a breviary they be record in the well-known line : -- quem papa dispenset multus labor opprimit aeger quus timet aut occulus officioque caret 1 the obligation of read the office be impose by the church and the pope can dispense in it even without cause bishop can give temporary dispensation 2 a grave occupation excuse from the whole or from a part of the office thus missioner give mission or parish retreat be excuse from the whole office so too be priest combatant in the battle line but when in rest camp they be bind to say the hour a priest engage in say he office if he receive a urgent call to a die person may not have time to finish he office before midnight he be exempt from the part of the office omit and do not sin by the omission the proposition claim exemption from the office for those engage in great study be condemn by pope alexander vii the biographer of lamennai trace the beginning of he downfall to he exemption from he daily office a difficulty arise sometimes as regard the full or partial or non-exemption of those who foresee that serious occupation which can not be neglect must arise to prevent the recitation of the hour in such case priest be bind to recite the office or as much of it as possible within the limit of the current day in do this they may anticipate the time fix for the recitation of the small hour and they may anticipate vespers and compline by recite they in the forenoon if a priest foresee that he may not be able to recite matins for next day he be not bind to anticipate as there be no obligation to anticipation the obligation be recital between midnight and midnight it be become to anticipate if possible so that the office may be full and entire if before midnight there be a cessation from necessary professional work -lrb- eg hearing confession -rrb- a priest be bind to finish he office for the day or to say as much of it as time allow if however there be time merely to take a necessary meal before midnight -lrb- eg to prepare for a late mass on next day Sunday -rrb- and not time to eat and to recite the obligation of say the hour cease a grave illness exempt from the say of the canonical hour hence those seriously ill those who fear the say of the office may upset they in they weak state and convalescent from a serious illness be excuse from say the hour in this matter the advice of a spiritual or a medical adviser should be faithfully carry out by patient st alphonsus teach that invalid and convalescent may be allow to say mass and yet not be bind to say the office as the say of mass do not fatigue they so much as the say of the office -lrb- st alphonsus n 155 -rrb- a grave fear exempt from the say of the office a priest amongst furious persecutor of the church should be excuse from any recitation of he hour which he fear may draw on he cruel or severe punishment blindness make the recitation of the office a physical impossibility even very defective sight although not total blindness exempt from the obligation of say the office in all such case a formal declaration of exemption should be seek some theologian hold that such priest if they have commit to memory a notable part of the psalm should repeat that part from memory the new psaltery make such memorise a extremely difficult feat and no obligation for such a repetition from memory can be impose want of a breviary excuse from the recitation of the office for example if a priest set out on a long journey forget to take he breviary or leave it in a railway carriage and can not procure another or can not procure another without great inconvenience he be exempt from the obligation of he office and the omission be involuntary be sinless the wilful casting away of a breviary as a excuse for not be able to read the office be gravely sinful and unless the sinful desire be retract there may be question of many mortal sin of wilful omission to fulfil the obligation as the omission be then wilful in cause priest travel be unable sometimes to recite the proper office of the day as they breviary lack something -lrb- eg the proper prayer or the lesson of the second nocturn -rrb- the sacred congregation of rite -lrb- December 1854 -rrb- decide _ sacerdo peregre profectus cuus molestus difficiliorque esset officius recitatio cuus et pauca desunt in libro officius praesenti nempe oratio et legenda valet de communi absque obligatione proprium deinde ad supplementum recitandus atque ita servarus mandavit _ the psalm as arrange in the new psalter must always be say for a valid recitation of the office -lrb- _ v divino afflatu _ -rrb- what be a priest bind to do who from a grave cause can not find time to recite the whole office but only a part of it st alphonsus give the rule if you can recite a part equivalent to a small hour you be bind to do so under pain of mortal sin but if you can not read or repeat a part equivalent to a small hour you be bind to nothing as a part so small -- less than a small hour -- take separately be consider inappreciable for the end the church 's law of recitation have in view article viii -- the direction of the scrupulous person who be scrupulous about the recitation of the hour should have help from they confessor who should deal specifically with any of the scruple which arise in the daily task scruple generally concern the necessary intention the necessary attention pronunciation and the time necessary for a good and faithful recitation of the canonical hour how should a confessor deal with scruple about intention a confessor should tell a cleric scrupulous in this point that he fear be groundless and that by the very act of take up he breviary he express he intention of pray of say he hour that it be not necessary that such intention be actual or reflexive it be sufficient if it be virtual and that such a intention _ do _ exist every time one open the breviary to say he hour the say slowly and deliberately the prayer _ aperus domine _ be a great aid to the scrupulous in form a right intention and in dispel they vain fear cleric trouble about attention be help and comfort by they confessor repeat to they what they well know themselves about voluntary and involuntary distraction and the tell of the anxious one that this very anxiety and anguish show that they fear of lose attention in they prayer be a true and real sign of its existence in deal with scruple about vocal and integral pronunciation a confessor should advise that no stop should be make in the say of the psalm etc but that the recitation should be continue quietly without restrain the voice without impatience and without scrutiny of the pronunciation of the part say god be a father full of goodness not a exacting taskmaster and he be more honor by moderate care than by a disturbing solicitude above all thing a confessor should remember that it be important to forbid scrupulous person to repeat the whole or even the part of a hour a effort should be make by he to tranquilise the troubled soul with the principle that the precept of the church do not bind he to repeat the hour with such inconvenience as lead to bodily and mental illness the church be we mother and do not wish she child to be trouble and solicitous but to pray in peace chapter iv some rule of ascetic theology for the pious recitation of the breviary there be many reason why we should recite the divine office devoutly for -lrb- 1 -rrb- the word which we read be holy -lrb- 2 -rrb- he to whom we speak be god -lrb- 3 -rrb- we speak in the name of holy church -lrb- 4 -rrb- we be the associate of thousand on earth and in heaven who sing god 's praise -lrb- 5 -rrb- the purpose of we prayer be sublime -lrb- 6 -rrb- it give glory to god and draw down he grace and mercy on he church -lrb- 7 -rrb- and finally the recitation of the office bring help and strength to those who repeat it fervently and firstly let we see what be the word of the office they be the word of god or of he church in the psalm scripture lesson gospel extract response and antiphon we have god 's inspired word in the prayer sermon homily hymn and often in the response and antiphon as the church be guide and assist by the holy ghost it may be in a sense true to say that these she word be divine for what be more worthy of respect than the word of god st augustine say that it be no less worthy of respect than the body of jesus christ _ non minus est verbum dei quam corpus christus _ -lrb- sermon 300 -rrb- how very careful should we be to treat the word of god with respect worthily attentively and devoutly -lrb- _ digne attente ac devote _ -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- to whom do we speak in we daily service of prayer we speak to we master whose very special work we be do in offer up the great prayer he adorable eye be fix upon we at this sacred duty he listen to we he read we thought he judge we intention we effort and they fulfilment he be the king of king the almighty god mindful of he presence and majesty should we not try earnestly to bless he holy name and to free we heart from vain evil and wander thought we pray _ ad benedicendum nomen sanctum tuum munda quoque cor meum ab omnibus vani perversis et alienis cogitationibus _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- in whose name do we speak it be a great honor to be a ambassador for a great king and a mighty kingdom guard the interest of the fatherland in a foreign land the priest be always such a ambassador for christ we be ambassador say st paul in this work of daily recitation of the office we be ambassador not of some petty king or tiny state but we represent the entire church the well-beloved spouse of christ to whose prayer he ever hearken _ sonet vox tua in auribus mei vox enim tua dulcis est _ -lrb- canticle of canticle ii 14 -rrb- and st bernard say _ sacerdo publica persona et totius ecclesie os _ hence every priest be the ambassador of christ and of he church the guardian of he interest and as it be the duty of ambassador to study carefully to watch and further the interest of the king whom they represent it be a priest 's duty to study carefully and further the interest of christ 's church by the devout fulfilment of the great daily duty the recitation of the divine office history brand as traitor those ambassador who through ignorance of the language of the foreign court or through want of vigilant attention allow the interest of they royal master to suffer what a punishment await the day and year of ignorant careless or inattentive fulfilment of the great official work of a priest -- the divine office who be a priest 's associate in this work they be the thousand of priest and religious throughout the world who say the hour and who send up daily and nightly the great prayer of praise and thanksgiving to god _ secundum noman tuum sic et laus tua in fine terrae _ -lrb- p 47 v ii -rrb- _ die diei eructat verbum et nox nocti indicat scientiam _ -lrb- p 18 v 3 -rrb- in this holy work of recite the hour we be unite with the angel and saint in heaven in honor we common creator for the church herself remind we of this ineffable honor in the hymn for the dedication of the church : -- sed ilium sede coelitum semper resultat laudibus dumque trinum el unicum jugus canore jungimur alma sioni aemulus that house on high -- it ever ring with praise of the king of king for ever there on harp divine they hymn th ' eternal one and trine we here below the strain prolong and faintly echo sion 's song what be the end for which the office be say -lrb- a -rrb- to glorify god -lrb- b -rrb- to help holy church and -lrb- c -rrb- to sanctify ourselves -lrb- a -rrb- to glorify god that be to adore he infinite majesty to thank he for he innumerable and constant blessing to satisfy he justice in expiate the sin of the world and to beg he grace and mercy the end for which the office be say be the same as those for which mass be offer for the office be the supplement of the mass -lrb- tronson -rrb- -lrb- b -rrb- to help holy church the church militant have many and great need it be she mission to extend the kingdom of christ and to do this great work she need freedom from hostile law strength and courage to withstand tyrant and persecution unity and peace amongst she child and pastor zeal in she minister and recruit for she militant force to obtain these result the church rely very much on the devout recitation of the office doubtless it be for these purpose that the church have confide to the care of she choose minister this public official prayer and have lay no such obligation on the laity st alphonsus do not hesitate to say that if priest and religious say the office as they should say it the church should not be in the deplorable state that it then be in this doctor of the church add that by devout say of the office many sinner could be draw from the slavery of the devil and many soul would love god with more fervor the want of the church be greater now than they be ever before each devoutly-said hour draw down god 's blessing on he church what a vast number of blessing come from a life of daily recitation offer worthily attentively and devoutly -lrb- _ digne attente ac devote _ -rrb- -lrb- c -rrb- the benefit of the person who recite the hour the third end for which the canonical hour be offer be for the benefit of the person who recite they st alphonsus write if they say the office as they ought priest themselves should not be always the same always imperfect prone to anger greedy attach to self-interest and to vanity but if they recite the office not as they say it with distraction and irreverence but with devotion and recollection unite the affection of the heart with so many petition which they present to god they should certainly not be so weak as they be but would acquire fervor and strength to resist all temptation and to lead a life worthy of priest another blessing spring from the attentive recitation of the breviary -- viz the daily withdrawal from the world and its care which must be banish from the soul which speak with god for as st alphonsus write the say of the hour devoutly give occasion to pious soul to elicit many act of virtue act of faith of hope of charity of humility etc for one psalm say the saint move all the power of the soul and cause we to elicit a hundred act and in the breviary be find the most beautiful formula of adoration and praise the psalm above all other part of the office be wonderfully rich in magnificent praise of god 's attribute where can such sublime form of prayer and praise be find as in psalm 8 9 17 18 21 23 28 29 33 45 46 49 54 -- to name but a few finally the attentive recitation of the breviary be a source of light and of grace and of merit how many light in prayer spring from these divine word how many maxim enter the soul how many beautiful prayer be say and if they be well say they would obtain for priest treasure of grace accord to christ 's infallible promise ask and you shall receive a person can merit several degree of glory by one devout recitation of the office what a abundance of merit may be gain by the devout recitation in a life of twenty thirty or forty year and it be this thought of lose opportunity and of the great treasure within the reach of priest which cause st alphonsus when a old man to study the breviary psalm and to write he well-known work nor be st alphonsus alone in he opinion of the great means of sanctification which the breviary afford to priest st joseph of cupertino -lrb- 1603-1663 -rrb- be ask by monsignor claver bishop of potenza to point out a means for the greater sanctification of the priest of he diocese the saint reply monsignor if you wish to sanctify you priest strive to procure two thing for they that they say the office piously and that they say mass with fervor nothing more be necessary to ensure they salvation -lrb- _ life of st joseph cupertino _ by berninus -rrb- the word of the wonderful franciscan whose life be a marvel of piety be repeat a century later by st leonard of port maurice -lrb- 1671-1751 -rrb- and be often quote as he own in every age of the church earnest soul draw great sweetness and consolation from read the psalm or from read the canonical hour writer deal with this part of priestly work quote the word of eminent servant of god they quote st augustine st gregory nazianzan st bernard st catherine of bologna st philip neri st francis de sale and st alphonsus it would make this section of this book too long to quote the word of these saint but the word of st franci de sale seem to have a special force sometimes i be so low-spirited write the saint by business and event that i do not know where to turn nor at what end to begin : but during the office nothing annoy I i have not even distraction i imagine that i be in heaven singing with the angel the praise of my creator and on leave the choir i find often that the mighty problem which have give I trouble be clear away and solve in a instant biography of god 's servant record many great favor bestow on priest who recite the breviary piously cardinal bona record a vision vouchsafe to st bernard tell how the saint see a angel beside each choir monk record he disposition of soul some angel write in letter of gold other in letter of silver other in ink other in water and other hold they pen but write nothing we lord explain to the saint the meaning of the vision the writing in gold typify charity and the fervor of the recitation the writing in silver denote devotion but little charity or fervor the word in ink-writing signify careful attention to the full verbal recitation but to little else the word write in water mean distraction and little attention to the meaning or to the word and the angel who write nothing watch the insolence of those who be voluntarily distract the vision have furnish the theme of much pious writing and a theme for christian painter it show how god watch over the daily work of priest while he angel record in golden or silvern letter the work of pious recitation or perhaps hold they pen at rest what means should be use to promote pious recitation article ii -- the means to adopt for the pious recitation of the breviary a -- the means to adopt before the recitation preparation be necessary before begin every prayer for the holy ghost say before prayer prepare thy soul and be not as a man that tempteth god -lrb- ecclesia 18 23 -rrb- this preparation necessary before other prayer be above all necessary before the recitation of the divine office which be the greatest of all prayer two kind of preparation be necessary the remote and the proximate the remote preparation demand the removal of all obstacle which impede prayer and the greatest of all prayer the church 's official prayer the chief or capital obstacle which impede or prevent a pious recitation of the breviary be : sin the passion the absorb thought of creature and the ignorance of the divine office and the means to remove these obstacle be to purify the conscience science to mortify the passion to guard the sense and to have a intelligent knowledge of the duty and requirement of a proper fulfilment of the daily task of the say of the canonical hour the first means be to purify the conscience from sin for sin hinder prayer but what effect have sin on the recitation of the office the office be a prayer a elevation of the soul to god and as all writer on ascetic teach sin be a chain that bind we to earth it be say st franci as birdlime which impede the soul in its flight upward prayer be a conversation with god but a soul loving sin can not converse with god _ peccatore deus non audit _ -lrb- st john ix 31 -rrb- prayer be a intimate union with god but a soul rest in sin can have no intimate union with god there can be no intimate union between light and darkness between sanctity and sin between good and evil in a word between christ and belial _ quae participatio quae societas lucis ad tenebras quae conventio christus el belial _ the second means of procure fervent prayer be the mortification of the passion it be not enough to secure fervor in prayer that we soul should be free from sin we must struggle to master we passion this point be important -- for a soul upset by its passion anger pride etc can not with fervor recite the hour for it can not converse with god it can not elevate itself to god it can have no true union with god it can not converse with god for god will not converse with a unmortified soul for three reason first he will not speak if there be no one to listen for the holy ghost tell we where there be no hearing pour not out word -lrb- ecclus xxxii 6 -rrb- god wish a soul in converse with he to be calm and still for god be not in the earthquake -lrb- 3 king xix ii -rrb- again even if god speak to a unmortified soul it can not hear he as the passion fix its attention on worldly matter and even when such a soul try to listen and to understand the passion surge and war drown all sound and sense of holy thing for the animal man perceiveth not these thing that be of the spirit of god for it be foolishness to he and he can not understand because it be spiritually examine -lrb- i cor ii 14 -rrb- the human soul can not truly unite itself to god if the passion be not conquer because by they very nature they be oppose to god and hence inspire estrangement from and disgust for holy thing thirdly the sens must be guard we five sens can impede the recitation of the office because they present to we soul image of the thing which occupy they and they can draw we will towards the pleasure which correspond with these object it be necessary for the worthy attentive and devout saying of the office that each sense be guard the sense of sight should be guard from gaze at object at hand person book landscape etc the sense of hearing should be guard in fly from the company of evil speaker calumniator detractor those who speak of worldly affair or who give evil counsel it be necessary too to guard the tongue from evil speech i have set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stand against I -lrb- psalm 38 2 -rrb- and it be well to guard against too frequent or too long conversation which fill the soul with thought disturb to a prayerful disposition the sense of touch should likewise be guard for st thoma say that the sense of touch be the maintenance of the other sens -lrb- 1 p q 76 a 75 -rrb- and when the foundation of a house commence to fall asunder the wall the frame and the roof totter and fall so it be with the sens when the sense of touch be disturb the other sens quickly complete the ruin what knowledge be need for the valid and for the licit recitation of the hour must the person know the meaning of the word read no such knowledge be necessary for god hear the prayer of the ignorant and illiterate and of the babe to the chief priest and scribe who hear the child cry out the savior 's praise in the temple christ say yea have you not read ` out of the mouth of infant and suckling thou hast perfect praise ' -lrb- st matth xxi 15-16 -rrb- st augustine defend from the sneer of the learn those who pray to god in rude and barbarous word or word which they do not understand _ noverint non esse vocem ad aure dei nisi animi affectum _ -lrb- _ de catech _ rud ci -rrb- the church have bind religious both man and woman to say the office in choir even though they may not understand latin nevertheless it be highly desirable that those who understand latin should understand what they read daily in the breviary god the church the practice of the saint we own intelligence we spiritual advantage demand that every priest should read with knowledge so that with more certainty he may read attentively and devoutly for -lrb- 1 -rrb- the holy ghost warn we to sing wisely _ psallite sapienter _ -lrb- p 468 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- that priest may sing wisely may say the daily office piously be the reason and end of liturgical study of the psalm and of the breviary in theological college -lrb- 3 -rrb- the saint who write so piously and so learnedly on the psalm and on psalmody be for ever impress this matter of intelligent recitation st augustine write _ et quare dicta sunt nisus ut sciantur quare sonuerunt nisus ut audiantur quare audita sunt nisus ut intelligantur _ -lrb- tract xxxi in joan -rrb- again comment on psalm 146 he write david teach that we sing wisely let we not seek the mere sound for the ear but a light for the soul st thoma aquina comment on for i pray in a tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding be without fruit -lrb- i cor xiv 14 -rrb- write _ constat quod plus lucratur quus orat nam ille quus intelligit reficitur quantum ad intellectum et quantum ad affectum sed mens ejus qui non intelligit est sine fructu refectioni _ and -lrb- 4 -rrb- we own intellect tell we that the breviary should be read intelligently and devoutly one of the end of the church in impose the divine office as a obligation be that by honor the holy mystery or the holy memory of the saint we may raise we heart and soul to god as st paul wish we may the god of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind towards one another accord to jesus christ that with one mind and one mouth you may glorify god -lrb- rom xv 5-6 -rrb- a effect that can not be produce by the recital of word which be not understand it be almost impossible to avoid very grave distraction and to sustain attention if there be not a good knowledge of the matter and form of the hour recite it seem irrational that priest should spend daily more than a hour reading word that they understand not at all or very imperfectly and that the beautiful and sublime thought and language of the book of psalm which be admire by all educate man should be to those who read they every day for year nothing but a tinkle cymbal _ vox et praeterea nihil _ this be often the case even with priest who practice piously and methodically mental prayer and yet nowhere be such beautiful act of faith and confidence in god 's power express as in the psalm -lrb- eg 3 4 5 6 7 10 12 16 19 25 27 30 34 43 54 55 56 etc -rrb- no more sublime expression of praise exist than in the psalm 8 9 17 18 20 21 etc time spend in study the history of the breviary the structure and the growth of the contents of each hour the meaning of the prayer and hymn be time well spend b -- the immediate preparation for the recitation of the hour first it be necessary to foresee from the reading of the _ ordo _ what be to be say and to mark all the psalm lesson response antiphon and prayer by this practice st bonaventure say all be recite and recite in order _ librus et alia necessaria ad officium praeparantur et legenda studiose ante praevisa quando et quomodo sint dicenda dicuntur _ -lrb- intit novit p i c 4 -rrb- unless this matter be arrange before the prayer _ aperus _ be begin a priest be certain to suffer from distraction to run the risk of violate the rubric and to lose some of the spiritual profit which arise from preparation this point of preparation be attend to by all thoughtful priest and it be ever the practice of the great student and lover of liturgy second it be necessary to recollect ourselves this be simply to draw off from profane thought the mind and the heart and to apply they to the sublime work of converse with god which we do in the divine office this recollecting of we wander thought before prayer be impress on we by holy scripture by the example of the saint and by we own common sense holy scripture warn we before prayer prepare thy soul and be not as a man that tempteth god -lrb- ecclus 18 23 -rrb- and as typical of the preparation make by saintly priest the example of st charle borromeo may be mention the saint always spend a quarter of a hour in preparatory prayer before begin the church 's official prayer the venerable john d'avilum make the same practice general amongst he disciple this holy man narrate how one day he meet a priest of the society of jesus who ask he to recite the hour with he and that before begin they prayer the jesuit fall on he knee say there be some who speak of say the office as if it be a trifle come they say let we say we hour together and so immediately begin this be show very little appreciation for so holy a duty for it well merit a few moment at least of recollection -lrb- bacquez -rrb- we own common sense tell we not to rush heedlessly to begin any important work to converse with god be a work of sublime importance which need preparation so that it may be do attentively third we must invoke god 's aid by prayer no prayer be more suitable than the prayer give as a preparatory prayer in the breviary _ aperus domine os meum _ open thou o lord my mouth to bless thy holy name cleanse my heart from vain evil and wander thought enlighten my understanding inflame my will that so i may worthily attentively and devoutly recite this office and deserve to be hear in the presence of thy divine majesty through christ we lord amen o lord in union with that divine intention wherewith thou whilst here on earth didst thyself praise god i offer these hour to thee fourth to unite ourselves with jesus christ in the prefatory prayer _ aperus domine _ we say _ domine in unione _ etc in baptism christian be unite to jesus to he life to he spirit he be the head of the church and we be its member and this union should be a real explicit vivify union when we fulfil we ministry of social prayer this union with christ be seek for by himself by the apostle by the church and be practice ever by god 's saint the word of the prayer should be reduce to action 1 christ we model in all thing be we model in prayer and so he teach we that when we pray we must say we father who art in heaven that be to use he very word and sentiment and this desire of we lord that soul should be unite to he in prayer have often be manifest by he to he saint to st gertrude he say my daughter behold my heart look upon it in future as supply you own defect when you would pray ask it to help you to give my father the homage you owe he i shall be ever ready to second you as soon as you call I to you aid st bernard school in this practice by the holy ghost know all its sweetness : david he say rejoice of old to have find he heart to pray to he master and he god -- _ invenit servus tuus cor tuum ut oraret te oratione hac _ -lrb- ii king viii 27 -rrb- and i that i may pray have find the heart of my king and my brother of my sweet savior shall i not then also pray yes certainly for i be too happy as i have if not the heart of jesus in place of mine at least have i mine in that of jesus -lrb- bacquez p 191 -rrb- 2 st paul recommend we to offer we prayer through jesus christ by he therefore let we offer the sacrifice of praise always to god that be to say the fruit of lip confess to he name -lrb- heb xiii 15 -rrb- 3 the church wish this union with christ and mention it several time in she prayer _ per dominum nostrum jesum christum _ she express she wish in the preparatory prayer _ aperus domine _ she wish the word and sentiment of the psalm to be apply to jesus the savior whom david typify and to whom the psalm in great number relate and in the frequent repetition of the _ pater noster _ we speak christ 's sentiment and word 4 the life of the saint furnish many example and precept of this union with christ in we prayer to the example of st gertrude and st bernard many other can be add several such example be quote by bacquez in he work on the office 5 the remembrance of the sublime work of the office should aid in its fervent recitation priest should remember the word of st alphonsus : after the sacrifice of the mass the church possess no treasure so great as the divine office it be god 's church the spouse of christ who have do I the honor of choose I for this great work -- I in preference to a hundred other she put into my hand she holy book of heavenly language and ask I to read its word before god to unite with the angel and saint in honor god 6 to propose some particular intention before the recitation of the hour begin and to renew it during the recitation be a excellent means of guard against distraction and mechanical routine it sustain during the prayer the fervor with which it be begin st bonaventure say to priest give _ great _ attention to the sign -lrb- _ ie _ to the direction about kneel standing sign of cross etc -rrb- _ greater _ attention to the word and the _ greatest _ attention to the -lrb- particular -rrb- intention but what intention ought we to have we should have general intention and particular intention we must have the general intention of the church whose ambassador we be we must pray that god be know and adore loved and thank and praise we must pray that the church have freedom that she may be exalt that the kingdom of christ may spread and flourish that the pope and clergy of the world may be bless and guide by god that holy soul may be confirm in virtue and that sinner may be convert we should have also some particular intention in read we hour thus we may pray to obtain a more lively faith a greater hope a more ardent charity greater meekness and humility greater patience detachment from the world greater fraternal charity help in keep vow -- in a word a increase of virtue especially those in which we may have great want again a priest may and should beg god to help he and guide he by he light and grace in doubt in trouble in cross in he daily work as a priest in he parish in he school in he college particularly and fervently should a priest pray for success in he religious instruction in school in church in the pulpit for st augustine tell we that success in this matter depend more on prayer than on preaching -lrb- _ de doc christ lib _ 4 chap 15 -rrb- and at every hour a priest should pray for a happy death before say he hour a priest may form a special intention of pray for other he superior he parent he brother and sister he benefactor he friend he enemy for those who have ask for prayer for some one in sorrow for some one in sin for a soul in purgatory of course these prayer benefit the priest who offer they for as st gregory the great say so well _ plus enim pro se valere preces suas efficit qui have et pro aliis impendit _ -lrb- moral ii 25 -rrb- aid during the recitation i a suitable place should be select the psalmist sing _ in omnus loco dominationis ejus benedic anima mea domino _ -lrb- p 102 22 -rrb- we lord wish we to pray always st paul say -lrb- i tim ii -rrb- that we should pray in every place and theologian teach that a priest may validly and licitly say he hour walk in the field in he room or in any suitable place the most suitable place be the church for it be a house of prayer -lrb- st matt xxi 43 -rrb- and the holy ghost ask we to go there to pray _ in templo ejus omnes dicent gloriam _ -lrb- p 28 9 -rrb- the apostle go to the temple to pray at the sixth and at the ninth hour show we how suitable be the place holier than the temple -- the church the practice of the saint impress on we the suitability of the church for the church 's official prayer in the life of every modern saint we find recommend and practice the say of the hour at the altar perhaps the example which be best know to missionary priest be the example of the cure d'ar who in the early day of he priestly life always say he breviary kneel in the sanctuary he parishioner like from time to time to slip into the church to watch he often say a eye-witness he pause while pray he look fix on the tabernacle with eye in which be paint so lively a faith that one might suppose we lord be visible to he gaze later he church be continually fill with a attentive crowd follow he least movement he take pain to avoid everything that might excite they admiration yet still he might be frequently find after a long day pass in the sacred tribunal recite he hour on he knee either in the sacristy or in a corner of the choir a few step from the altar so strong be the attraction that draw he to unite he prayer to that of we lord so great be the love and respect inspire by the presence and infinite majesty of he divine master -lrb- _ life of cure d'ar _ by monnin -rrb- every priest must feel that the church bench or the sanctuary with they silence they every part awakening and remind the soul that this be the house of god this be the gate of heaven be place most suitable for prayer and be great aid to fervent prayer the thought of the presence of christ with he adoring angel to whose song of praise the priest should unite himself should help wonderfully in the devout recitation of the hour st alphonsus recommend that priest say the breviary should say it before a crucifix or before a statue or picture of the bless virgin so that gaze from time to time on these holy object may foster or renew pious thought ii a great aid to pious recitation of the hour be to take up a respectful position the office be a prayer a elevation of the soul to god and should be treat as such and as everyone know the union of soul and body be such that in vocal prayer both be employ if the body take up a lazy or unbecoming position in prayer it be a insult to god to whom prayer be offer and be a certain source of distraction and faulty prayer habit do much in this matter and where a priest labor to correct a inclination to take up a too comfortable position in say he hour he be strive to pray well priest young and old say writer on this point should be vigilant in this aid to fervent prayer the well-known word of st teresa recommend a comfortable attitude in prayer do not clash with this doctrine in the _ selva _ st alphonsus write : it be related that while two religious recite matins a devil appear cause a intolerable stench and through mockery say ` to the prayer which you offer such incense be suit ' -- _ ad talem orationem tale debetur incensum _ which attitude be the best see the example of the saint st charle borromeo st vincent de paul st francis de sale st john de la salle the cure d'ar and of many other saintly man the best attitude in recite the hour be kneel other saint accustom themselves to recite they hour stand with head uncovered other follow in private recitation all the position -- sit kneel standing -- require in choir the practice be say to aid in banish distraction and contribute greatly to attention and devotion of course in private recitation no one be bind to any of these practice but they have prove useful to many in practise devout prayer everyone be bind to pray with fervor and a respectful attitude be a big help towards that end slow deliberate pronunciation be another aid to the fervent saying of the hour of the breviary the life of saintly man show they practice in this matter know that they be the ambassador of the church in present she praise thanks and want to god they read with care and attention from they slow and deliberate reading of the holy word they soul draw out the sublime thought and sentiment which they lip express in rapid read the mind and heart have not time to think well on the meaning of the word and of the sentiment and hence no holy thought fill the soul no act of virtue be elicit no prayer of petition be offer no holy resolution be form indeed very often -- to quote the word of a venerable author -- priest seem to say with they lip and to express by they rapid reading not _ deus in adjutorium meum intende _ o god make haste to help I but _ domine ad festinandum I adjuva _ -- o god help I to hasten wise old rodriguez advise reader of spiritual book to observe a hen drinking and to imitate she slow and deliberate sip by read in small quantity with pause sometimes priest acquire the habit of hurry reading quite unconsciously and afterwards labor hard and in vain too to correct it it be important for beginner in the breviary to go at a slow pace as the trot and the gallop be fatal to good and pious recitation sometimes priest excuse this hurry reading as they wish to save time why do priest wish to save time for study some may say but the obligation of the divine office precede all obligation of study and its devout recitation be of far greater importance to the priest and to the church than be any other or every other study some priest gallop through the hour to gain time for other ministerial work they say but they forget that the primary work -- after the celebration of mass -- and the _ most important work _ of a priest be the great official prayer of the church who amongst priest lead the life of ceaseless toil which the cure d'ar lead and we have read how he say he hour st franci xavier find time to preach to he many neophyte to teach they to baptize they and yet he do not use the permission give he to shorten he breviary prayer he read the whole office daily and add to it prayer to obtain the grace of better attention and devotion sometimes the reading of the hour be hurry for a motive less praiseworthy than the motive of study or of priestly work _ producitur somnus producitur mensa produncuntur confabulatione lusus nuga nugarum solius suprema magestrati cultus summa qua potest celeritate deproperatur _ -lrb- kugler _ de spiritu eccles _ -rrb- on this god complain one day to st bridget say that some priest lose so much time every day in converse with friend on worldly affair and afterwards in converse with he while they recite the office they be so hurry that they dishonor he more than they glorify he -lrb- st alphonsus _ selva _ -rrb- in the hurry reading of the office time a few minute perhaps be gain but what be lose do the loss of all the light and grace and blessing of the office compensate for the time gain it be important that all who read the breviary hurriedly or who may be tempt to acquire the habit should weigh well the word read therein -lrb- Friday 's vespers -rrb- _ labor labiorum ipsorum operiet eo cadent super eo carbone _ -lrb- p 139 -rrb- the labor of they lip shall overwhelm they burn coal shall fall upon they to acquire this important habit the practice of reading at a slow pace the word of the breviary author suggest several little hint one be never to start read the hour unless there be _ ample _ time for finish the hour or hour intend to be then and there read the practice of squeeze the small hour into scrap of time -lrb- eg in the interval between hearing confession in the confessional at a session -rrb- be fatal to careful and pious reading another hint be to read everything every word -lrb- _ eg pater noster ave credo _ -rrb- and to repeat nothing from memory because the print word meet the eye and the speak word reach the ear help to fix the attention and there be less risk of they pass unnoticed this be the practice of st charle borromeo st philip neri never recite from memory even in say the small hour st vincent de paul always spend a great time in say he breviary he intense fervor be help by he careful reading of every word and this practice of keep he eye fix steadily on the print matter of the book he recommend to he congregation of priest some holy priest maintain that they could recite from memory with greater fervor than from the reading of the page of the breviary but the practice be not one for the many another hint to help pious recitation be to _ earnestly wish _ to say the office worthily attentively and devoutly this wish must bring up before the mind the thought of how displease to god and how great be the daily loss -- not to speak of a lifetime 's loss-to the soul of a priest who pray carelessly tepidly and mechanically but in spite of all precaution it may be notice during the recitation of the hour that without we own fault the word be say too quickly it be advise then to pause and to say mentally what the venerable boudon be wont to say to he soul in similar circumstance : to punish and mortify thee i will go more slowly i will devote to my office to-day a longer time -lrb- bacquez -rrb- iv to prevent distraction and to banish they be no easy matter it be impossible to avoid all distraction involuntary distraction do not hinder merit still it be important that a effort be make to diminish and repress the quality of such disturbing element in prayer first of all we can never totally avoid all distraction nor can we entirely and completely remove they when they enter we soul the human soul can not pray for any notable time without distraction the greatest saint know this well st augustine write _ vult se tenere ut stet et quodammodo fugit a se nec invenit cancello quibus se includat _ -lrb- in psalm 95 -rrb- st thoma write _ vix unum pater noster potest homo dicere quin men ad alium fertur _ the author of the _ imitation of christ _ write for i confess truly that i be accustom to be very much distract for oftentimes i be not there where i be bodily standing or sit but be rather there where my thought carry I -lrb- bk iii c 48 -rrb- the same writer write and i a wretch and the vilest of man i can hardly spend one half hour as i ought st teresa write i be not less distract than you be during office and try to think that it arise from weakness of head do not fear to think so too do not we lord know that when we perform this duty we would wish to do it with the greatest possible attention after read these word we can understand how prayer offer up with involuntary distraction be true holy prayer st thoma tell we _ dicendum quod in spiritu et veritate orat qui ex instinctu spiritus ad orandum accedit etiamsi ex aliqua infirmitate mens postmodum evagetur evagatio vero mentis quae fit praeter propositum orationi fructum non tollat _ -lrb- 22 q 83 a 13 -rrb- nevertheless every effort should be make to avoid and to banish distraction the way of do this be give in all treatise on prayer every priest know they well there be negative means and positive mean the negative means consist in withdraw the sens and the power of the soul from everything disturb the soul 's converse with god in guard against any too absorb interest in worldly affair so that the mind be unmanageable and can not be fix on sacred thing st franci of assisus work at a piece of furniture before say terce be during the say of that hour disturb by the thought of he manual work when he re-enter he cell he take the bit of work and throw it in the fire say i wish to sacrifice to the lord the thing which hinder my prayer to he the positive means of avoid and of banish distraction be give above they be to read slowly to read every word to read in a become position to observe choir direction to give ample time to each hour another rule give by writer on the pious recitation of the office be to pause at certain place in the psalm to renew attention and elicit affection some author recommend such pause at the end of the invitatory at the end of each hymn or after each _ glorium _ study well the _ glorium patrus _ say st franci of assisus for in it you find the substance of the scripture v to apply the mind to what be read be another help to pious recitation it seem to be a useless repetition of a obvious fact that to apply the mind to the prayer read help to ward off and to drive away distraction such a practice be natural for a person of intelligence and the church wish and expect such intelligent and heartfelt prayer god say to the jewish priest what apply to the christian priesthood too : and now o ye priest this commandment be to you if you will not hear if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name saith the lord of host i will curse you blessing because you have not lay it to heart -lrb- mal ii 1-2 -rrb- christ complain about the jewish people who honor he with they lip but have they heart far from he and god 's great servant realize this fully st paul say and he that speaketh by a tongue -lrb- the gift of speak strange tongue -rrb- let he pray that he may interpret for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prayeth _ but my understanding be without fruit _ what be it then i will pray with the spirit i will pray also with the understanding i will sing with the spirit i will sing also with the understanding -lrb- i cor xiv 13-15 -rrb- st gregory the great say that true prayer consist not only in the articulation of the word but also in the attention of the heart for to obtain the divine grace we good desire have greater efficacy than mere word -lrb- _ moral lib _ 22 _ cap _ 13 -rrb- peter de blois write of the priest of he time _ labium sunt in canticis et animus in patini _ they lip be in the psalm but they heart be in the dish -lrb- _ selva _ -rrb- _ age quod agi _ say the _ imitation of christ _ vi it be advisable not to dwell on the literary excellence of the breviary during the recitation of the office it be a useful thing that priest should recognize the authorship of the psalm recite they probable date the circumstance of they composition the sublimity of they think the peculiarity of they hebrew style the rhythm and poetry of the hebrew but the _ dwelling _ on these thought lead to distraction again some priest like the cleric of the renaissance and post-renaissance time despise and dislike the breviary for its alleged barbarous style these unworthy and foolish sentiment be meet with very rarely they be oppose to the priestly spirit which should love and respect the scripture extract god 's inspired word the homily from the father be well choose and suitable for the greatest prayer and for the greatest prayerbook the world have ever know the hymn be the wonder and study of scholar of every religion st augustine after he conversion even feel a repugnance for the holy scripture as unequal to cicero in form but in he mature age and consider judgment the saint reverse he judgment _ non habent _ he write of the pagan classic _ illae pagina vultum pietati lacryma confessioni spiritum contribulatum cor contritum et humiliatum _ -lrb- confess bk 7 c 21 -rrb- vii to think of christ 's passion be another aid to good breviary recitation we have see in the theological part of this book -lrb- page 4 -rrb- the seven principal stage of the passion which correspond with the seven principal part of the office and this devout thought on some scene of the passion be recommend by all writer on the divine office as a easy and very profitable means and aid to attentive and devout saying of the hour it be a means practice by thousand of priest st bonaventure recommend that at each hour some thought of the mystery of the life and death of christ should be hold in mind thus matin the night office might be offer up in honor of the birth and infancy of christ laud in honor of he resurrection terce in honor of the come of the holy ghost none in memory of christ 's death vespers in thanksgive for the eucharist viii to remember the presence of god of we angel guardian and of the demon be a practice recommend by writer on recitation of the office in or out of choir this thought of the presence of god be one of the aid recommend by st benedict to he religious to aid they devout fulfilment of the great work of recite they hour worthily attentively and devoutly century after st benedict 's death we find st bonaventure repeat this advice to he novice bless peter faber sj to make he breviary prayer more fervent use to picture to himself the presence of he guardian angel at he side record he pious and holy thought and the demon record he distraction dearly beloved priest write st alphonsus when you take the breviary in you hand imagine that a angel stand on one side to register you merit in the book of life if you say the office with devotion and on the other a devil who if you recite it with distraction write you fault in the book of death with this thought excite yourself to say the office with the greatest possible devotion endeavor then not only at the beginning of the office but also at the beginning of each psalm to renew you attention that you may be able to excite in you heart all the sentiment that you shall read -lrb- _ selva _ -rrb- article iv -- after say the divine office 1 give god thanks for he goodness in permit we to join in the great work for hear we prayer and for he help and grace during its duration 2 ask god 's pardon for fault commit in the course of this prayer of he church 3 devoutly recite the _ sacro-sanctae et individuae trinitati _ amen v _ bea viscera_r _ et beata ubera _ this prayer which be generally print in breviary immediately before the psalter be to be say kneel where this be physically possible this be necessary in order to gain the indulgence grant by pope pius x to all person oblige to recite the divine office it be not of obligation and its omission be not sinful it form no part of the obligatory office it must be say kneel but at the request of cardinal asquinus prefect of the congregation of indulgence pope pius ix be please to make one exception -lrb- July 12 1865 -rrb- in favor of person who be not able to say it kneel -- _ infirmitati tantum causa _ hence traveller or person on a journey be not exempt for they can say it kneel at the end of the journey it be sufficient to say the ' _ sacro-sanctae _ ' once only that be at the end of compline with the intention of obtain pardon of all the defect a person may have be guilty of in say the entire office yet it may be repeat after each hour eg after matins and laud after the small hour and after compline in each case one would thereby get forgiveness for the fault commit during the part of the office recite this explanation have be give by the holy father -lrb- pius ix -rrb- himself the usage amongst the chapter at rome as at st peter 's st mary 's etc be to recite it every time they leave the choir -lrb- maurel sj _ le chretien e claire sur la nature et l'usage des indulgence _ -rrb- the beauty and sublimity of this prayer be not always appreciate its translation here may inspire fresh thought of fervor to the most holy and undivided trinity to the humanity of we lord jesus christ crucify to the fruitful virginity of the most glorious mary ever a virgin and to the company of all the saint be give by every creature eternal praise honor power and glory and to we the remission of all we sin amen bless be the womb of the virgin mary which bear the son of the eternal father and bless be the breast which give suck to christ we lord in connection with this prayer a interesting question be discuss in the _ irish ecclesiastical record _ -lrb- no 540 December 1912 -rrb- be this prayer merely a sacramental have it a indulgence attach to it at all the querist quote _ the new raccolta _ in answer the second part of he query but wish to know if it be a indulgence how it produce its effect for either the defect commit in read the divine office be voluntary or involuntary if voluntary they be sin and consequently can not be touch by a indulgence if involuntary they be not sinful and therefore stand in no need of a indulgence in a very long reply dr john m harty sum up for we part we adhere to the view which say that the efficacy of the privilege annex by leo x and pius x to the _ sacro-sanctae _ be derive from a indulgence at the same time we think that these prayer be also sacramental since they be official prayer of the church under this aspect they obtain the ordinary benefit which be attach to sacramental and accordingly lead to a remission of sin and temporal punishment by means of sorrow and satisfaction which be elicit under the influence of the abundant grace give by god through the intercession of the church they also placate god so as to render he willing to grant he favor even though defect exist in the recitation of the office though these defect be not produce _ ex opere operato _ they nevertheless be real and be a encouragement to priest whose human frailty prevent the perfect performance even of the most sacred function of they priestly office part iii the canonical hour chapter i matins _ etymology _ the word _ matins _ be derive from _ matuta _ the latin name for the greek goddess of morning the word use in the roman breviary be _ matutinum -lrb- ie tempus -rrb- _ it be the old name for laud _ laude matutinae _ the word be also use to denote the office of vigil hence the word be use in three sens to denote the nocturn and laud to denote laud only and to denote the vigil office in liturgical study the word be confusing and sometimes it be the context only which give the author 's meaning this the principal hour of the church 's public prayer be in the early day of christianity say at night and be call _ nocturnum _ and _ vigiliae _ _ origin _ the night office of vigil date from the very earliest day of christianity it derive its name from the vigil or night watch of the soldier who divide the night from six o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning into four watch of three hour each the nightly meeting of the christian come to be call by the name _ vigil _ but the meeting be not begin at the state hour of military vigil and do not finish with they why these meeting of christian be hold at night and in what they religious exercise consist in both in matter and form be a unsolved problem but it be certain that they resemble the service of the jewish synagogue in the reading from scripture psalm-singing and prayer and differ from those service by have reading from the gospel the epistle and from non-canonical book such as the epistle of st clement the eucharistic service always form part of they indeed the very name synagogue be give to these assembly of christian as we see from the pastor of herme in they common prayer they face towards the east as the jew do towards jerusalem they have precentor and janitor as in the jewish rite they service consist of the reading from the mosaic law from gospel and epistle exposition of scripture a set sermon long and fervent blessing or thanksgiving and psalm before there be any write gospel to read we gather that the reading of the old law of the prophet and the psalm be follow by a set sermon on the life and death of christ -lrb- bickel _ messe und pascha _ p 91 -rrb- from st basil -lrb- fourth century -rrb- it be conclude that two choir sing the psalm cassian write that the monk of the fifth century celebrate the night office with twelve psalm and reading from the old and the new testament hence we find the same element repeat the psalm generally chant in the form of response that be to say by one or more cantor the choir repeat one verse which serve as a response alternately with the verse of the psalm which be sing by the cantor reading take from the old and the new testament and later on from the work of the father and doctor litany supplication prayer for diver member of the church clergy faithful neophyte and catechumen for emperor traveller the sick and generally for all the necessity of the church and even for jew and for heretic it be quite easy to find these essential in we modern matins -lrb- dom cabrol _ cath encyclopedia _ art matins -rrb- matins on account of its length and position in the breviary be the most important part of the daily office and on account of the variety and beauty of its element be consider the most remarkable the prayer _ pater noster _ begin the office it be the lord 's prayer _ divina institution formata _ when christ tell he apostle _ sic vo orabitis _ -lrb- st matt vi 9 -rrb- it be the most excellent of all prayer be most excellent in its author its form its depth of mean its effect the prayer consist of a preface we father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be do on earth as it be in heaven and in the body of the prayer be seven petition -- three for the honor and glory of god in and by ourselves and four for we own want spiritual and temporal very excellent matter on the greatest of prayer be to be find in the _ catechism of the council of trent _ -lrb- translation duffy dublin -rrb- and in _ a lapide _ -lrb- st matt vi -rrb- writer on liturgy say that the recitation of the _ pater noster _ as the opening prayer of matins be _ not obligatory _ until the beginning of the twelfth century it be say that the monk be wont to say a _ pater noster _ at each altar in the church before enter they stall for office recitation this practice delay the beginning of the office in choir and a rule be make that those who wish to say this prayer must say it in they stall in a low tone of course in the breviary of pius v -lrb- 1568 -rrb- this practice become obligatory on each person bind to read the hour _ ave marium _ this be a lead prayer amongst the great prayer of the mass and the office it too be excellent in its author its form -lrb- clear short devotional -rrb- in motive -lrb- in honor mary mother of god and in beg she intercession -rrb- it be divide into three part the word of the angel of st elizabeth and of the church devout thought on this prayer have be pen by countless client of mary in every age priest be familiar with many such writings great and small but _ a lapide _ -lrb- st luke i -rrb- bear reading and re-read the prayer as it stand in the breviary to-day be not of very ancient date in point of fact there be little or no trace of the hail mary as a

much force that david must be regard as the sole author of the entire psaltery answer : in the negative ii whether it may rightly be argue from the concordance of the hebrew text with the alexandrine greek text and other ancient version that the title prefix to the hebrew text be older than the version know as the septuagint and that therefore they have be derive if not from the author themselves of the psalm at least from the ancient judaic tradition answer : in the affirmative iii whether the say title of the psalm as witness of judaic tradition may be prudently call into question when there

of the holy ghost in the composition of religious canticle the institution lay down by he for the liturgical chant of the psalm the attribution to he of psalm make both in the old and new testament and in the very inscription which have be prefix to the psalm from antiquity and in addition to all this the agreement of the jew and the father and doctor of the church it can be prudently deny that david be the principal author of the canticle of the psaltery or that it can be affirm that only a few of the canticle be to be attribute to the royal psalmist answer : in the negative to both part v whether specifically the davidical origin can be deny of those psalm which both in the old and the new testament be cite expressly under the name of david among which be specially to be reckon psalm ii quare fremuerunt gente psalm xv conserva I domine psalm xvii diligam te domine fortitudo mea psalm xxxi beatus quorum remissa sunt iniquitate psalm lxviii salvum I fac deus psalm cix dixit dominus domino meo answer : in the negative vi whether it be possible to admit the opinion of those who hold that among the psalm of the psaltery there be some either of david or of other author which on account of liturgical or musical reason the carelessness of amanuensis or other unknown cause have be divide or unite and also that there be other psalm such as the miserere mei deus which in order that they might be better adapt to the historical circumstance or solemnity of the jewish people have be slightly revise or modify by the omission or addition of a versicle or two save however the inspiration of the whole sacred text answer : in the affirmative to both part vii whether the opinion can with probability be maintain of those among more recent writer who have endeavor to show from merely internal indication or a inaccurate interpretation of the sacred text that not a few of the psalm be compose after the time of esdra and nehemia or even after the time of the macchabee answer :

people several prophetic and messianic psalm be to be recognize as prophesy concern the come kingdom priesthood passion death and resurrection of the future redeemer and that therefore the opinion be to be absolutely reject of those who pervert the prophetic and messianic character of the psalm twist these same prophecy regard christ into merely a prediction regard the future lot of the choose

the old writer on liturgy say to excite attention and devotion to thank god for the instruction give in the lesson to make we realize and practice what have be read and to teach we that bless be they who hear the word of god and keep it again those writer know why the chanter say only one verse and the worshipper reply in chorus -- to show that all they soul be unite and free from schism _ te deum _ -lrb- title xxxi -rrb- _ author _ in the breviary prior to the reform of pius x this hymn be print under the word hymnus ss ambrosius et augustini however no one think now of attribute this canto to either st ambrose or st augustine -lrb- battifol _ op cit _ p 110 -rrb- formerly it be piously believe to have be compose and sing by these saint on the evening of augustine 's baptism the question of the authorship of this hymn have lead to much study and much controversy some scholar attribute it to st hilary other to sisebut a benedictine other to niceta bishop of treve in the year 527 to-day the opinion of the learn benedictine dom morin -- who follow the reading of the irish manuscript -- that the hymn be write by niceta of remesiana -lrb- circa 400 ad -rrb- be the most probable this opinion have be criticise by several continental scholar -lrb- v _ cath encly _ art te deum -rrb- _ rubric _ the te deum be always say at the end of matins unless in matins of feast of holy innocent of sunday of advent and from septuagesima to palm Sunday and feria outside eastertide -lrb- from low Sunday to ascension day -rrb- _ the structure of the hymn _ in this wonderful composition there be probably two hymn connect and follow by a set of versicle and response which might be use with any similar hymn it be probable that the first hymn -lrb- _ te deum paraclitum spiritum _ -rrb- line 1 to 13 of te deum be older than the second part which be write probably as a sequel to the early hymn the rhythm of the hymn be very beautiful be free from abruptness and monotony student of poetry may note that seven line have the exact hexameter end if scan accentually as voce proclamant deus sabbaoth etc seven have two dactyl as laudabili numerus laudat exercitus one end with spondee apostolorum chorus the other six line have a less regular end this hymn of praise to the bless trinity be divide into two part and seem to be model on the line of the psalm 148 _ laudate dominum de coelis _ -lrb- see Sunday laud i -rrb- the verse 1 to 6 of the hymn like the opening verse of the psalm record the worship and adoration of the angel the second part of the hymn record the worship of human being live or dead -- apostle prophet martyr the second hymn _ tu rex gloriae christus _ etc be a prayer to christ the god incarnate the redeemer now in glory to aid he servant and to aid they to be of the number of he saint in everlasting glory the third part of the hymn vv 22-29 -lrb- _ salvum fac _ _ in aeternum _ -rrb- be consider by scholar to be simply versicles response and prayer the verse 22-23 -lrb- salvum fac usque in aeternum -rrb- be the versicle and verse 24-25 -lrb- per singulo die saeculus -rrb- verse 2 of psalm 144 be the response before the beautiful verse of prayer dignare domine die isto sine peccato nos custodire etc vouchsafe o lord to keep we this day from sin o lord have mercy on we etc etc this hymn have a special interest for irish priest as the irish recension of it find in the bangor antiphoner -lrb- to be see in the library of trinity college dublin -rrb- be of the greatest value to scholar engage in critical study they date from the tenth century and give niceta as the author the wording in the old irish antiphoner differ in some verse from the text give in we breviary thus in verse 6 the bangor text have _ universa _ before the word _ terra _ again in verse 18 the breviary read _ tu ad deteram dei sedes _ bangor and probably more correctly read _ seden _ verse 26-29 _ dignare domine _ _ confundar in aeternum _ be not find in the irish book those who wish to study these old irish mss may receive great help from warren 's _ bangor antiphoner _ -lrb- ii pp83-91 -rrb- and light come too from julian 's _ dictionary of hymnology _ -lrb- pp

the person of christ just as the _ capitulum _ do too and for whom it would not be consonant to ask a blessing it conclude without _ tu autem _ because these word be correlative of _ jube _ and since

some of these hymn be of considerable poetical merit : that for Sunday _ aeterne rerum conditor _ be a little masterpiece the ` benedictus ' correspond with the _ magnificat _ of vespers both be sing with the same solemnity and be of the same importance they form as it be the culminate point of they respective hour and for feast day the altar be incense while they be chant the ` benedictus ' or canticle of zachary recall the precursor 's mission of proclaim the messiah and the new alliance it be altogether appropriate to the office of daybreak as usher in the dawn of a new era the closing

translate by the word collect the word collect means either that the priest who celebrate mass collect in a short form the need the thanksgiving and the praise of the people to offer they up to god or most probably the original meaning seem to have be this : it be use for the service hold at a certain church on the day when there be a station hold somewhere else the people gather together and become a collection at the first church after certain prayer have be say they go in procession to the station church just before they start the celebrant say a prayer the _ oratio ad collectam _ -lrb-

introduction of collect into the divine office be doubtful in the early christian church there seem to have be one and only one prayer the _ pater noster _ in liturgical use st benedict lay it down in he rule that there should be none other it be generally hold by student of liturgy that the collect be originally use in mass only and be introduce into the office at a time much later than they introduction into the mass book in the mass for holy week we see the collect in they oldest existing form the rite of the mass have be shorten at all other season and there remain now only the greet _ oremus _ and the collect itself the _ oremus _ do not refer immediately to the collect but rather to the silent prayer that go before it this also explain the shortness of the older collect they be not the prayer itself but its conclusion one short sentence sum up the petition of the people it be only since the original meaning of the collect have be forget that it have become itself a long

salutation to aza and the angel gabriel express the same idea _ dominn tecum _ to the bless virgin it be bless and honor by we lord himself when to he apostle he say ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus

it be find in the sacramentarium gelasianum -lrb- sixth century -rrb- these word be call the divine salutation they mean that the priest who utter they be at peace with all clergy and people and thus wish god to remain with they -- the highest and holiest of wish for the presence of god who be the source of every good and the author of every best gift be a certain pledge of divine protection and of that peace and consolation which the world can not give this formulum be use even in private recitation of the office as the priest pray in union with and in the name of the church the word _ et cum spiritu tuo _ add a new and further significance to the salutation for it be the spirit the human soul that pray and when the spirit pray in the name of the church for she child its work be a work of high spiritual order demand the use of all the soul 's power _ oremus _ this exhortation be of very great antiquity and in this form be find in the liturgy of st jame and of st mark in those day it be say by the priest in a loud voice the priest the mediator follow the example of the great mediator christ call other to join with he in prayer st augustine tell we that sometimes after pronounce the word _ oremus _ the priest pause for a while and the people pray in silence and then the priest collect the unite prayer of the congregation and offer they to god hence the name _ collect _ -lrb- st augustine epistle 107 -rrb- -lrb- _ cf _ probst _ abendl messe _ p 126 -rrb- _ invocation and conclusion _ prayer be address generally to god the father this practice be in accordance with the example and doctrine of christ father i give thee thanks -lrb- st john xi 41 -rrb- amen aman i say to you if you ask the father anything in my name he will give it to you -lrb- st john xvi 23 -rrb- and he teach we to say ` we father ' in the early age of the church seldom be prayer address to god the son innocent iii tell we that the reason for the practice be a fear that such prayer might lead the catechumen the jew or the pagan convert to christianity to allege or to believe that christian worship several god however with the advent of the early heresy it become necessary to formulate prayer witness the divinity of christ and he equality in all thing to the father and the holy ghost in some of the great prayer of the liturgy the three person of the holy trinity be name to show they equality and unity of nature and substance nearly all the prayer of this kind be the product of the church during the storm of early heresy against the divinity nature or personality of christ the conclusion of the prayer generally contain the word _ per dominum nostrum jesum christum _ because all grace come through jesus christ we lord and savior who plead as mediator between god and man as he himself have say no man cometh to the father but by I -lrb- st john xiv 6 -rrb- hence in every collect we may distinguish five part : the invocation the motive the petition the purpose the conclusion -lrb- 1 -rrb- the invocation take some form such as _ deus domine _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- the motive be commonly introduce by the relative _ quus _ eg deus _ qui corda fidelium sancti spiritus illustratione docuistus _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- the petition the body or center or substance of the prayer be always note for the solemn simplicity of language which mark liturgical prayer eg _ multiplica _ super no misericordiam tuam -lrb- 4 -rrb- the purpose be a enforcement of the petition it have reference generally to the need of the petition and be marked usually with the word _ ut _ multiplica super no misericordiam tuam _ ut _ quae nobis agendis praecipis te miserante adimplere possimus -lrb- prayer for feast of st patrick -rrb- -lrb- 5 -rrb- the _ conclusion _ vary eg per dominum nostrum per eundem dominum etc those who pay intelligent attention to the liturgical chant at high mass and in particular to the chant of the celebrant will be able to discover for themselves that the intonation use in the singing of the collect and the post-communion serve as a rule to mark off two at least of the main division indicate two inflection a greater and a lesser occur in the body of the prayer the greater for the most part come at the close of the ` motive ' while the lessor conclude the ` petition ' and produce the purpose of the prayer when the prayer be correctly print as in the authentic ` missale romanum ' the place of the inflexion be indicate by a colon ` punctum principal ' and a semicolon ` semi-punctum ' respectively these step it will he observe indicate not precisely ` break in the sense ' -lrb- as haberl incorrectly say -rrb- but rather the logical division of the sentence which be not quite the same thing -lrb- father luca sj _ holy mass _ chap vi -rrb- the question be often ask why _ dominus vobiscum _ be say after the collect or prayer writer on liturgy reply that it be so place because christ frequently use the salutation _ pax vobi _ and the priest in public prayer hold the place of christ and as he the priest use this formulum of salvation before the collect to obtain the spirit of prayer and the grace of god he repeat it so that these gift may be retain in the collect the fatherland of the saint be rarely find because the saint ' true home and fatherland be heaven where they be bear again to life eternal and they fatherland be not this valley of exile where they spend they temporal life nor be they surname give in the collect -lrb- see the collect of st jane france fremiot de chantel give on p 180 -rrb- but it be not infrequent in the collect to find certain appellation characterise a saint or note some special prerogative or wonderful gift of grace the church 's collect record the wonderful gift of st john chrysostom -lrb- the golden-mouthed -rrb- st peter chrysologus -lrb- quus ob auream ejus eloquentiam chrysologus cognomen adeptus est -rrb- -lrb- _ rom brev _ -rrb- sometimes the nation or earthly

more know it would have be more widely adopt and the compactness and lucidity of its statement and the enthusiasm-inspiring character of its style would have contribute to make it highly prize

suarez think it should be attribute to the apostle -lrb- _ de relig _ l2 ch5 n9 -rrb- and benedict xiv hold that it be establish by the infant church at rome to draw off the christian from the profane and sinful revelry which mark the pagan feast of this date however these statement be hardly accurate with regard to the antiquity and spread of the feast it be unknown in north africa during the third century for tertullian make no reference to it and even in the time of st augustine it be reject by the donatist as a oriental novelty in origen 's time at least it be not generally observe as a festival in alexandrium since he do not reckon it as such for rome evidence be want for the earliest time but since the daughter church of africa know nothing -- of the festival at first it may be infer that originally it be not keep at rome but be introduce there in course of time in spain it be a feast-day in 380 in gaul in 361 -lrb- kellner _ op cit _ p172 -rrb- in the antiphon for the

theme of the ancient sermon bear on this feast on the other hand the visit of the magus be the sole event commemorate by st augustine in he six sermon deliver on this feast day the third event the marriage feast be of later commemoration and maximus of turin doubt if they all actually happen on the same day the octave to the feast date from the eighth century it be customary on this date in the eastern church to read publicly the epistolum festali of the patriarch of alexandrium arrange the date of easter and the practice be order by the fourth council of orlean in 541 in epiphany the invitatory be not say in the beginning of matins in order say the liturgist not to repeat the inquiry make by herod from the scribe about the birthplace of christ a inquiry and invitation inspire by hatred and anger the invitatory be omit they tell we that we like the magus may come to christ without other than a silent invitation teacher of olden time use to urge those who be slow to believe to imitate the magus but the invitatory be not quite omit it be read in the third nocturn which typify the law of grace in which the apostle and they successor invite all to praise and worship god the psalm of the feast be take from the psalm of each day of the week but chiefly from Friday 's psalm perhaps because the magus 's visit be on that day septuagesima during the age of the persecution it be scarcely possible for christian to observe any other festival than Sunday and so it be not surprising that the two writer who have occasion to speak of the institution of the festival of the church mention only easter and pentecost both of which fall on a Sunday to these christmas be add in the fourth century and epiphany somewhat earlier these chief festival along with other soon add to they number form the element for the organization of a festal system in the church as centre round which the lesser festival group themselves the last step of importance however in the development of the church 's year be to connect these chief festival with one another so as to make they part of a whole the sunday afford a convenient means for effect this they be associate with the festal character of the nearest feast and be connect with it as link in a chain the way for this development have be prepare by the season of preparation for easter and the sunday in the fifty day between easter and pentecost -- quinquagesima -- be mark with the festal character with which antiquity invest the whole period all that be need be first of all to connect christmas easter and pentecost and in the second place the institution of a season of preparation before christmas this be accomplish between the sixth and the eighth century during the first six century the ordinary sunday of the year have neither liturgical position or character since they be not even enumerate there be a sort of _ commune dominicarum ie _ a number of mass exist from which one could be choose at will for each Sunday to these sunday which be call simply _ dominicae quotidiana _ those after epiphany and pentecost belong they number altogether twenty-nine or thirty accord as the calendar give fifty-two or fifty-three sunday in the year the smaller number of these six at most come between epiphany and septuagesima but the larger twenty-three to twenty-eight between whit Sunday and advent the variation depend on the date of easter there be no historical circumstance forthcoming to give these a specially festal character -lrb- kellner _ op cit _ pp 176 _ et seq _ -rrb- septuagesima Sunday come nine week before easter it can not come before the 18th January nor after the 22nd February it be the first day of a period of mourning and penance preparatory to the great penitential period of lend on the Saturday precede septuagesima two _ alleluia _ be add to the benedicamus and deo gratia to intimate that the period of rejoice in the savior 's birth have pass violet the penitential color be use at mass and the chapter in genesis record the fall of adam warn man to think well to humble himself and to do penance every part of the office the lesson antiphon and hymn bear the note of mourning and penance lend _ lend _ -- the teutonic word _ lend _ originally mean the spring season it have come to mean the forty day precede easter scholar use to maintain that this season of penance be of apostolic origin but modern scholar note the diversity of practice and the diversity of duration in different church and the easter controversy hold that it be not of apostolic origin and that it date from the third century or even from the fourth century it be not mention in the didascalium -lrb- circa 250 ad -rrb- but be enjoin by st athanasius upon he flock in 331 easter and paschal time easter be the chief festival of christendom the first and oldest of all festival the basis on which the church 's year be build the connect link with the festival of the old covenant and the central point on which depend the date of the other movable feast some of the very early christian writer call it feast of feast -lrb- festum festorum -rrb- the english word easter be from _ eastre _ the goddess of spring in the liturgy we never find the word _ pascha _ always the word _ dominica resurrectionsis _ pascha have no connection with the greek -lrb- greek : pascho -rrb- but be the aramaic form of _ pesach _ some point regard this festival be to be note its antiquity its connection with jewish feast and christian feast its preparation character and duration _ antiquity _ no mention of this feast be in the _ didache _ in justin 's dialogue with trypho or in he apology but in the year 198 ad a exchange of letter between pope victor bishop narcissus of jerusalem polycrate of ephesus show that the feast have be for year in existence many reference be find in tertullian and writer of he time to this festival _ connection of the christian festival with the jewish _ the connection between the christian and the jewish feast be both historical and ideal -- historical because we lord 's death happen on the 15th nisan the first day of the jewish feast ideal because what take place have be prefigure in the old testament by type of which itself be the antitype the jewish rite and ceremony -lrb- exodus xii -rrb- be refer to in the prophecy of the messia thus isaia call he the lamb choose by god who bear the iniquity of other the baptist call jesus the lamb of god the evangelist refer to the typical character of the passover rite when he apply ' a bone of it shall not be break ' -lrb- exod xii 46 -rrb- to christ on the cross justin and tertullian see in the christian sacrifice the fulfilment of the imperfect sacrifice of the old law hence there be no doubt that the jewish passover be take over into christianity thereby its typical ceremony find they due fulfilment to the real and historical connection between easter and the passover be due the explanation of a striking peculiarity in the church 's year viz the moveable feast of which easter be the start point easter fall on no fixed date because the jewish 15th nisan unlike the date of the julian and gregorian calendar vary year by year the preparation for easter be the lenten fast the fare on fast day consist of water and soup make with flour fruit and oil and bread be also eat the catechumen also fast on wednesday and friday among the faithful there be some who eat nothing from they repast on Sunday until the follow Saturday eg for five day and who all the year round take only one meal a day other abstain in lend from all food for two consecutive day but other fast by take nothing to eat all day until the evening -lrb- kellner _ op cit _ p 93 -rrb- the easter celebration be in the early age chiefly note for the great

that the day begin with a solemn procession follow by a sermon on st luke ii 22 seqq and a mass it have not yet a name but be call the fortieth day after the epiphany and this naming show that at

687-701 -rrb- order a procession on this festival the opinion that be so often meet with in pious book that this feast with its procession of candlebearer be establish by the church to replace the riot and revel of the pagan _ lupercalium _ be now reject by scholar for procession with or without light be so common amongst pagan and christian that any connection between these two feast be negligible _ march st joseph _ in the western church the cultus of st joseph be not find in any calendar before the ninth century although numerous trace of the esteem and veneration pay to he by individual be find the public cultus of st joseph be introduce by the private devotions of great servant of god such as st bernard st gertrude st bridget of sweden john gerson st bernardine of sienna and other franciscan preacher the spread of the devotion in several country lead pope sixtus iv -lrb- 1471-1484 -rrb- to introduce st joseph 's feast as a simplex have only one lesson clement xi -lrb-

apostle after the death of she son fervent and widespread devotion be traceable in the church 's early day but the organising of we lady 's feast be a work of some time and difficulty a great difficulty be the fear of blasphemy from pagan and of error amongst pagan convert so train in myth and genealogy of the god then the festival commemorate the fact of the life death and resurrection be primarily commemorative of the redeemer and secondarily of he mother long before the institution of she feast the cultus of mary be almost universal the feast of the annunciation fall on the 25th march with we its date depend entirely on the date of christmas but the birth of christ be not always place in calendar on the 25th December in early day the feast of martyr and other saint be not celebrate in lend and hence this feast of the bless virgin be set down in some calendar as transfer and be celebrate in advent in spain it be celebrated eight day before christmas in the east the feast be generally celebrate on the 25th march and gradually this date be fix and be sanction by several council in the eleventh century _ may the finding of the holy cross _ the history of the finding of the true cross by st helena be well know the alexandrine chronicle give the day as the 14th September 320 this September feast of the holy cross be of earlier origin than the feast of may the latter be establish to commemorate the act of the emperor in 629 when he bring back to jerusalem the true cross from the persian conqueror on 3rd may he hand it over to the patriarch zacharia and strange to say this festival of may spread rapidly in the western church whilst in the east only one feast -lrb- the September one -rrb- of the finding of the cross be celebrate for century in milan for instance the September feast be receive in the eleventh century whilst the may feast be root in the western church very many year before that time the antiphon and hymn of this office be it be say amongst the most beautiful and sublime prayer of we liturgy _ the apparition of st michael _ the cultus of the holy angel be of jewish origin and exist in the christian church from the beginning in st paul 's epistle to the colossian -lrb- modern _ khonus on the lycus _ -rrb- he speak of this devotion and of the attempt of a gnostic sect to spread false doctrine on this point -lrb- col ii 18 -rrb- although the evil work be long live true devotion to the angel be practice in colossa and there the archangel michael appear in honor of this apparition the festival of st michael in September be establish devotion to the archangel be of very early date in rome and in the western church generally mass in he honor be find in the oldest roman sacramentary -lrb- 483-492 -rrb- and in these he be mention by name in prayer and preface the may feast be institute in the sixth century to commemorate a second apparition near sipontum on monte gargano which take place on the 8th may 520 _ June 29 feast of st peter and st paul _ there always have be a constant tradition in rome that these two saint suffer martyrdom on the same day 29th June and it be only natural that this day should be keep with great devotion and solemnity at rome in the east feast in honor of these martyr be hold at different season christma February and epiphany the day be keep in many place as a solemn holiday servile work be prohibit but in rome devotion be closely connect with the date and with the exact place of martyrdom owe to the distance which separate the two church of the apostle from each other it be most fatiguing to celebrate mass at both place and so in course of time the festival be divide into two part and the mass in honor of st paul take place on the 3oth June _ July the visitation _ this feast be probably originate by the franciscan in the thirteenth century it certainly be preach and spread by they zeal it be mention amongst franciscan record bear date 1263 it be keep in

the revolutionary yoke _ feast of st mary magdalen _ commentator on sacred scripture be not agree whether mary of magdalum be the sister of lazarus or whether there be two or three mary connect with we lord -- mary the sister of lazarus mary of magdalum and mary the sinner name in st luke 's gospel vii 27 the roman liturgy seem to favor the opinion that mary of magdalum be the sister of lazarus and that she be a sinner and be possess by seven devil the history of mary magdalen after we lord 's death have be write with large and vary addition of adventure by pious mediaevalist in the western church trace of the saint 's cultus be meet with in bede and he contemporary but devotion far and wide begin with mediaeval time the many legend which have grow up around she name and history have so obscure historic truth that the breviary give no historic lesson on she feast day but give as a lesson part of a homily from st gregory some of the legend may be find in the office of st martha -lrb- July 29th -rrb- _ August the assumption _ in all probability this be the earliest of we lady 's festival -lrb- kellner _ op cit _ p 235 -rrb- early writer mention the garden of gethsemanus as the place of mary 's burial and the third year -- some say the twelfth year -- after we lord 's death as the year of she death st john damascene rely on the writings of euthymius tell we what we know of

solemnize the anniversary of a martyr 's death for christ at the place of martyrdom the neighbouring diocese begin to interchange feast to transfer they and to divide they and to join in a common feast frequently group of martyr suffer on the same day which naturally lead to a joint commemoration in the persecution of diocletian the number of martyr become so great that a separate day could not be assign to each but the church feeling that every martyr should be venerate appoint a common day for all the first trace of it we find in antioch on the Sunday after pentecost at first only martyr and st john the baptist be honor by a special day other saint be add gradually and increase in number when a general process of canonization be establish still as early as 411 there be in the

epistle : i have give all my care to this collection of new hymn because learn priest and friend of good latinity who be now oblige to praise god in a barbarous style be expose to laugh and to despise holy thing santeuil -lrb- 1630-1697 -rrb- characterise the breviary hymn as the product of ignorance the disgrace of the latin language the disreputable relic of the early age the result of lunacy violent attack lead to violent defense both be generally bear of ignorance a partizan spirit and exaggeration pious catholic defender write that the roman breviary have hymn far superior to the classic lyric of ancient rome that they have a inimitable style that they be far superior to horatian poetry that there be nothing to compare with they style and beauty in pagan classic indeed zeal have lead some holy man to censure pope leo x clement vii and urban viii for they attempt to correct these composition which they hold to have be perfect truth seem to hold the place of the golden mean between the bitter critic and the over zealous defender of we breviary hymn the following proposition draw from father barnard 's _ cours de liturgie romaine _ may be take as a fair and accurate statement of the view of scholar view which may be safely hold by all student of this portion of liturgy _ first proposition _ : -- many of the hymn of the roman breviary have not the elegance of the ode of horace of the hymn of santeuil and of coffin proof : - -lrb- 1 -rrb- the holy father have outline in a rough sketch rather than perfect they hymn -lrb- pope urban viii bull quamvi 17th June 1644 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- speaking of the new hymnal of ferrerus pope clement viii say that the new work could only add to the splendor of worship and help to the common interest imply that the new hymn help religion by they accuracy and grace of correct poetic form -lrb- 3 -rrb- pimont the author of a classic work on the breviary hymn in a number of comment note the crudity of the breviary hymn even in they revised form thus in the hymn for prime he note apparent ruggedness he pass similar comment on the hymn assign to the little hour -lrb- 4 -rrb- bacquez state that all the hymn do not join beauty of expression to the merit of the think express and that a certain number lack style and good prosody these opinion should not be extend to all nor even to very many of the breviary hymn all serious critic agree about the beauty of such hymn as the _ aeterne rerum conditor _ the _ somno refecti artubus splendor aeternae gloriae verbum supernum prodiens _ and a good number of other the greater part of the breviary hymn be compose accord to the rule of prosody and they form be lyric the popular form of latin song which precede in italy the prosodical system borrow from the greek and use by the classic pagan poet the critic of the renaissance period be very loud and very wrathful over the form of these hymn some of they accuse st ambrose prudentius and gregory the great of gross ignorance of the rule of latin verse and what to the critic be worse ignorance of the way of pagan classical model but be the rhymed tonic accented lyric which be to be sing by all sort and condition of man in public such a outrageous literary sin be it ignorance or prudence that guide the early hymn writer in they adoption of popular poetic form it be not certain by any means that the early hymn writer wish to copy or adopt the classic form of the augustinian age nor be it clear that such man of genius as st ambrose prudentius st gregory the great be ignorant of the rule and model of the best latin poet it seem that they do not wish to follow they they wilfully and designedly adopt the popular lyric form so that they might give to they flock in popular and easily remembered form prayer and formula of faith _ second proposition _ : - the breviary hymn have the principal element of poetic beauty briefly these element be sublimity of thought beauty of sentiment aptness of expression unction of form in these matter the breviary hymn be not inferior to the classic poetry of paganism nor to the much-belauded beauty of the gallican breviary hymn -lrb- _ vide _ bacquez _ le saint office _ note vi and viii in finem -rrb- the composition of the hymn be in perfect harmony with the end for which they be intend that be liturgical prayer chant prayer they phrase do not display the vain and superfluous literary glitter of the much-lauded gallican hymn but they accent go out from the sanctuary and live in the heart of the people they language be like the thought and expression of the psalm the word of a soul pray to god and adore he in fervor in simplicity and in faith of the piety and expression of the french hymn foinard a ardent apostle of the french liturgical novelty write : il ne parait pas que ce soit l'onction qui domine dans les nouveaux breviary on y a la verite travaille beaucoup pour l'esprit mais il semole qu ' on n ' y a pas travaille autant pour le coeur letourneux the fierce jansenist write to the breviary-poet santeuil he co-worker : vous faites fumer l'encens mais c'est un feu estranger qui brule dans l'ensenoir la vanite fait en vous ce que la charite devrait faire and the catholic de maistre so famed for he fair-minded criticism write of the new hymn-maker ' work : they make a certain noise in the ear but they never breathe prayer because they writer be all alone -lrb- _ ie _ unaided by the grace and guidance of the holy spirit -rrb- when they compose they of the roman breviary hymn he write : they always pray and excite the soul to prayer train you heart to attention and hear all they prayer you will in they see the true religion as clearly as you see the sunbeam _ fourth proposition _ : -- the characteristic of the roman breviary hymn be to express with lively sentiment and with unction the noble idea and beautiful sentiment of the supernatural order in a simple manner without prosodical pretension yet have ever a true rhythm which sometimes vie with better composition the characteristic mention in this proposition which come as a corollary from the three precede proposition be one which be clearly note in we breviary hymn for by they very position in the breviary side by side with the psalm scripture extract and word of the father the church show she esteem and she use of these lyric of prayer and praise again the church 's mind be show by she retention of she hymn in she liturgy notwithstanding the many effort make to substitute a new hymnal up to the sixteenth century these breviary hymn be

secular and regular the hymn be venerate and love although there be many man of genius in every age and in every part of the christian church the hymn escape until the renaissance under leo x -lrb- 1475-1521 -rrb- the lover of everything classic and pagan be pained and exasperated at the venerable simplicity the lack of prosody the vagueness and crudity of the wording of the liturgical hymn in

innovator who be ardent student of pagan antiquity commission ferrerus to compose a new hymnal for liturgical use he book be allow for liturgical use but be not prescribe it omit all the old hymn sanction by the church for century and sing with fervor by thousand down the age there be find in the work of ferrerus write dom gueranger all the image and all the allusion to pagan belief and usage which we find in horace sometimes it be only fair to say he hymn be beautiful and simple but they follow generally and too servilely the pagan model but they be the work of strong and clear inspiration which under the mask of classic diction show itself in every part -lrb- _ inst liturg _ t i p 370 -rrb- during the reign of pope paul iii new hymnal be issue but the breviary hymn be not

genitor regalus solio forti _ -lrb- April 13 -rrb- he great desire be the correction of the breviary hymn this work of correction be not beyond the personal power of the pope himself if we judge he by he hymn he view be express in the bull _ divinam psalmodiam _ issue to promulgate the correct hymn it find a place in all copy of the roman breviary in the last century to carry out the correction outline by the pope four jesuit be appoint and whether the result of the correction be the pope 's or the jesuit ' be a highly and hotly dispute point first of all the task set to the jesuit be a very difficult one and one demand much prudence as well as learn it may seem to we that to begin the correction mutilation and reconstruction of the work and word of man so great in church history and liturgy as prudentius sedulius st ambrose st paulinus be a work of rashness a sort of sacrilege attempt to remodel the glowing piety of they poem to the pattern of horace 's verse but the jesuit have get they command and they be bind to obey they be choose on account of they classical scholarship which be keep sharp by they daily teaching in college and they be specially bind by a vow of loyal obedience to papal order it be only fair to give they the credit that out of respect for the wish of urban viii they treat these ancient composition with extreme reserve and while they make some impression clearer they maintain the primitive unction in a large number of passage -lrb- baudot _ op cit _ p 185 -rrb- they correct more than nine hundred false quantity find scatter through the breviary 58 in the psalter per hebdomadam 359 in the proper de tempore 283 in the proper of saint and 252 in the common of saint they change the opening word of more than thirty hymn some hymn be untouched -- eg the three hymn of the bless sacrament the _ ave mari stellum _ which be rhythmic prose not verse and the hymn of the angel which be sufficiently perfect the metre of three hymn _ tibus christe splendor patri _ and the _ urb jerusalem _ and _ angulari fundamentum _ be change the jesuit have be censure very bitterly for they work of correction perhaps they merit some censure but surely they do not merit the censure heap on they by hostile critic like thier henri valoi and the franciscan cavallus they answer they critic splendidly and triumphantly by the work of father arevalo

give in monsignor battifol 's work and other in dom baudot 's if the reader read in the breviary the hymn _ te luci ante terminum _ he may note a difference in that the revised form and this the
