of great britain in may 1880 by john fiske _ voicus un fait entièrement nouveau dan le monde et dont l'imagination elle-même ne saurait saisir la portée _ tocqueville to edward livingston youman noblest of man and dearest of friend whose unselfish and untiring work in educate the american people in the principle of sound philosophy deserve the gratitude of all man i dedicate this book preface in the spring of 1879 i give at the old south meeting-house in boston a course of lecture on the discovery and colonization of america and presently through the kindness of my friend professor huxley the course be repeat at university college in london the lecture there be attend by very large audience and awaken such a interest in american history that i be invite to return to england in the following year and treat of some of the philosophical aspect of my subject in a course of lecture at the royal institution in the three lecture which be write in response to this invitation and which be now publish in this little volume i have endeavor to illustrate some of the fundamental idea of american politics by set forth they relation to the general history of mankind it be impossible thoroughly to grasp the meaning of any group of fact in any department of study until we have duly compare they with ally group of fact and the political history of the american people can be rightly understand only when it be study in connection with that general process of political evolution which have be go on from the earliest time and of which it be itself one of the most important and remarkable phase the government of the united state be not the result of special creation but of evolution as the town-meeting of new england be lineally descend from the village assembly of the early aryan as we huge federal union be long ago foreshadow in the little league of greek city and swiss canton so the great political problem which we be -lrb- thus far successfully -rrb- solve be the very same problem upon which all civilized people have be work ever since civilization begin how to insure peaceful concerted action throughout the whole without infringe upon local and individual freedom in the part -- this have ever be the chief aim of civilization view on its political side and we rate the failure or success of nation politically accord to they failure or success in attain this supreme end when thus consider in the light of the comparative method we american history acquire add dignity and interest and a broad and rational basis be secure for the detailed treatment of political question when view in this light moreover not only do american history become especially interesting to englishman but english history be clothe with fresh interest for american mr freeman have do well in insist upon the fact that the history of the english people do not begin with the norman conquest in the deepest and widest sense we american history do not begin with the declaration of independence or even with the settlement of jamestown and plymouth but it descend in unbroken continuity from the day when stout arminius in the forest of northern germany successfully defy the might of imperial rome in a more restricted sense the statesmanship of washington and lincoln appear in the noblest light when regard as the fruition of the various work of de montfort and cromwell and chatham the good fight begin at lewe and continue at naseby and quebec be fitly crown at yorktown and at appomattox when we duly realize this and further come to see how the two great branch of the english race have the common mission of establish throughout the larger part of the earth a higher civilization and more permanent political order than any that have go before we shall the better understand the true significance of the history which english-speaking man have so magnificently work out upon american soil in deal concisely with a subject so vast only brief hint and suggestion can be expect and i have not think it worth while for the present at least to change or amplify the manner of treatment the lecture be print exactly as they be deliver at the royal institution more than four year ago on one point of detail some change will very likely by and by be call for in the lecture on the town-meeting i have adopt the view of sir henry maine as to the common holding of the arable land in the ancient german mark and as to the primitive character of the periodical redistribution of land in the russian village community it now seem highly probable that these view will have to undergo serious modification in consequence of the valuable evidence lately bring forward by my friend mr denman ross in he learn and masterly treatise on the early history of landholding among the german but as i be not yet quite clear as to how far this modification will go and as it can in nowise affect the general drift of my argument i have make no change in my incidental remark on this difficult and disputed question in describe some of the characteristic feature of country life in new england i have especially in mind the beautiful mountain village in which this preface be write and in which for nearly a quarter of a century i have feel myself more at home than in any other spot in the world in write these lecture design as they be for a special occasion no attempt be make to meet the ordinary requirement of popular audience yet they have be receive in many place with unlooked-for favor the lecture on manifest destiny be three time repeat in london and once in edinburgh

of local self-government in the various portion of the aryan world illustrate in the contrast case of france and england significant contrast between the aristocracy of england and that of the

between france and england for the possession of north america and prodigious significance of the victory of england ii _ the federal union _ wonderful greatness of ancient athen cause of the

city as a school for political training intensity of the jealousy and rivalry between adjacent self-governing group of man smallness of simple social aggregate and universality of warfare in primitive time for the formation of larger and more complex social aggregate only two method be practicable -- _ conquest _ or _ federation _ greek attempt at employ the higher method that of federation the athenian hegemony and its overthrow the achaian and aetolian league in a low stage of political development the roman method of _ conquest with incorporation _ be the only one practicable peculiarity of the roman conquest of italy cause of the universal dominion of rome advantage and disadvantage of this dominion : -- on the one hand the _ pax romana _ and the break down of primitive local superstition and prejudice on the other hand the partial extinction of local self-government despotism inevitable in the absence of representation cause of the political failure of the roman system partial reversion of europe between the fifth and eleventh century towards a more primitive type of social structure power of rome still wield through the church and the imperial jurisprudence preservation of local self-government in england and at the two end of the rhine the dutch and swiss federation the lesson to be learn from switzerland federation on a great scale could only be attempt successfully by man of english political training when work without let or hindrance in a vast country not preoccupy by a old civilization without local self-government a great federal union be impossible illustration from american history difficulty of the problem and failure of the early attempt at federation in new england effect of the war for independence the article of confederation and the constitution pacific implication of american federalism iii _ manifest destiny _ the american boast of the bigness of they country how to bind the united state manifest destiny of the anglo-saxon race the term anglo-saxon slovenly and misleading statement relate to the english race have a common interest for american and for englishman work of the english race in the world the prime feature of civilization be the diminution of warfare which become possible only through the formation of great political aggregate in which the part retain they local and individual freedom in the earlier stage of civilization the possibility of peace can be guarantee only through war but the preponderant military strength be gradually concentrate in the hand of the most pacific community and by the continuance of this process the permanent peace of the world will ultimately be secure illustration from the early struggle of european civilization with outer barbarism and with aggressive civilization of lower type greece and persium keltic and teutonic enemy of rome the defensible frontier of european civilization carry northward and eastward to the rhine by caesar to the oder by charle the great to the vistulum by the teutonic knight to the volga and the oxus by the russian danger in the dark age from hun and mongol on the one hand from mussulman on the other immense increase of the area and physical strength of european civilization which can never again be in danger from outer barbarism effect of all this secular turmoil upon the political institution of europe it hinder the formation of closely coherent nation and be at the same time a obstacle to the preservation of popular liberty tendency towards the _ asiaticization _ of european life oppose influence of the church and of the germanic tribal organization military type of society on the continent old aryan self-government happily preserve in england strategic position of england favourable to the early elimination of warfare from she soil hence the exceptionally normal and plastic political development of the english race significant coincidence of the discovery of america with the beginning of the protestant revolt against the asiaticize tendency significance of the struggle between spain france and england for the possession of a enormous area of virgin soil which should insure to the conqueror a unprecedented opportunity for future development the race which gain control of north america must become the dominant race of the world and its political idea must prevail in the struggle for life moral significance of the rapid increase of the english race in america fallacy of the notion that centralized government be need for very large nation it be only through federalism combine with local self-government that the stability of so huge a aggregate as the united state can be permanently maintain what the american government really fight for in the late civil war magnitude of the result achieve unprecedented military strength show by this most pacific and industrial of people improbability of any future attempt to break up the federal union stupendous future of the english race -- in africa in australium and in the island of the pacific ocean future of the english language probable further adoption of federalism probable effect upon europe of industrial competition with the united state : impossibility of keep up the present military armament the state of europe will be force by pressure of circumstance into some kind of federal union a similar process will go on until the whole of mankind shall constitute a single political body and warfare shall disappear forever from the face of the earth american political idea i _ the town-meeting _ the traveller from the old world who have a few week at he disposal for a visit to the united state usually pass straight from one to another of we principal city such as boston new york washington or chicago stop for a day or two perhaps at niagara fall -- or perhaps after traverse a distance like that which separate england from mesopotamium reach the vast table-land of the far west and inspect they interesting fauna of antelope and buffalo red indian and mormon in a journey of this sort one get a very superficial view of the peculiarity physical and social which characterize the different portion of we country and in this there be nothing to complain of since the knowledge gain in a vacation-journey can not well be expect to be thorough or profound the traveller however who should visit the united state in a more leisurely way with the purpose of increase he knowledge of history and politics would find it well to proceed somewhat differently he would find himself richly repay for a sojourn in some insignificant place the very name of which be unknown beyond sea -- just as mr mackenzie wallace -- whose book on russium be a model of what such book should be -- get so much invaluable experience from he month of voluntary exile at ivánofka in the province of novgorod out of the innumerable place which one might visit in america there be none which would better reward such careful observation or which be more full of interest for the comparative historian than the rural town and mountain village of new england that part of english america which be oldest in civilization -lrb- though not in actual date of settlement -rrb- and which while most completely english in blood and in tradition be at the same time most completely american in so far as it have most distinctly illustrated and most successfully represent those political idea which have give to american history its chief significance in the general work of civilization the united state be not unfrequently speak of as a new country in term which would be appropriate if apply to australia or new zealand and which be not inappropriate as apply to the vast region west of the mississippus river where the white man have hardly set foot before the beginning of the present century new england however have a history which carry we back to the time of jame i and while its city be full of such bustling modern life as one see in liverpool or manchester or glasgow its rural town show we much that be old-fashioned in aspect -- much that one can approach in a antiquarian spirit we be there introduce to a phase of social life which be highly interesting on its own account and which have play a important part in the world yet which if not actually pass away be at least become so rapidly modify as to afford a theme for grave reflection to those who have learn how to appreciate its value as any far-reaching change in the condition of land property in england due to agricultural cause might seriously affect the position of one of the noblest and most useful aristocracy that have ever exist so on the other hand as we consider the possible action of similar cause upon the _ personnel _ and upon the occupation of rural new england we be unwillingly force to contemplate the possibility of a deterioration in the character of the most perfect democracy the world have ever see in the outward aspect of a village in massachusett or connecticut the feature which would be most likely first to impress itself upon the mind of a visitor from england be the manner in which the village be lay out and build neither in england nor anywhere else in western europe have i ever meet with a village of the new england type in english village one find small house closely crowd together sometimes in block of ten or a dozen and inhabit by people belong to the lower order of society while the fine house of gentleman stand quite apart in the country perhaps out of sight of one another and surround by very extensive grounds the origin of the village in a mere aggregation of tenant of the lord of the manor be thus vividly suggest in france one be still more impressed i think with this closely packed structure of the village in the new england village on the other hand the finer and the poorer house stand side by side along the road there be wide straight street overarch with spread elm and maple and on either side stand the house with little green lawn in front call in rustic parlance door-yard the finer house may stand a thousand foot apart from they neighbor on either side while between the poorer one there may be interval of from twenty to one hundred foot but they be never find crowd together in block build in this capacious fashion a village of a thousand inhabitant may have a main street more than a mile in length with half a dozen cross street lose themselves gradually in long stretch of country road the finest house be not ducal palace but may be compare with the ordinary country-house of gentleman in england the poorest house be never hovel such as one see in the scotch highland the picturesque and cosy cottage at shottery where shakespeare use to do he court will serve very well as a sample of the humblest sort of old-fashioned new england farm-house but most of the dwelling in the village come between these extreme they be plain neat wooden house in capaciousness more like villa than cottage a new england village street lay out in this way be usually very picturesque and beautiful and it be highly characteristic in compare it with thing in europe where one rarely find anything at all like it one must go to something very different from a village as you stand in the court of hero at versaille and look down the broad and noble avenue that lead to pari the effect of the vista be much like that of a new england village street as american village grow into city the increase in the value of land usually tend to crowd the house together into block as in a european city but in some of we western city found and settle by people from new england this spacious fashion of building have be retain for street occupy by dwelling-house in cleveland -- a city on the southern shore of lake erie with a population about equal to that of edinburgh -- there be a street some five or six mile in length and five hundred foot in width border on each side with a double row of arch tree and with handsome stone house of sufficient variety and freedom in architectural design standing at interval of from one to two hundred foot along the entire length of the street the effect it be needless to add be very noble indeed the vista remind one of the nave and aisle of a huge cathedral now this generous way in which a new england village be build be very closely associate with the historical origin of the village and with the peculiar kind of political and social life by which it be characterize first of all it imply abundance of land as a rule the head of each family own the house in which he live and the ground on which it be build the relation of landlord and tenant though not unknown be not commonly meet with no sort of social distinction or political privilege be associate with the ownership of land and the legal difference between real and personal property especially as regard ease of transfer have be reduce to the smallest minimum that practical convenience will allow each householder therefore though a absolute proprietor can not be call a miniature lord of the manor because there exist no permanent dependent class such as be imply in the use of such a phrase each larger proprietor attend in person to the cultivation of he own land assist perhaps by he own son or by neighbor work for hire in the leisure leave over from the care of they own smaller estate so in the interior of the house there be usually no domestic service that be not perform by the mother of the family and the daughter yet in spite of this universality of manual labor the people be as far as possible from present the appearance of peasant poor or shabbily-dressed people be rarely see and there be no one in the village whom it would be proper to address in a patronize tone or who would not consider it a gross insult to be offer a shilling as with poverty so with dram-drinking and with crime all alike be conspicuous by they absence in a village of one thousand inhabitant there will be a poor-house where five or six decrepit old people be support at the common charge and there will be one tavern where it be not easy to find anything stronger to drink than light beer or cider the danger from thief be so slight that it be not always think necessary to fasten the outer door of the house at night the universality of literary culture be as remarkable as the freedom with which all person engage in manual labor the village of a thousand inhabitant will be very likely to have a public circulate library in which you may find professor huxley 's lay sermon or sir henry maine 's ancient law : it will surely have a high-school and half a dozen school for small child a person unable to read and write be as great a rarity as a albino or a person with six finger the farmer who thresh he own corn and cut he own firewood have very likely a piano in he family sitting-room with the _ atlantic monthly _ on the table and milton and tennyson gibbon and macaulay on he shelf while he daughter who have baked bread in the morning be perhaps ready to paint on china in the afternoon in former time theological question largely occupy the attention of the people and there be probably no part of the world where the bible have be more attentively read or where the mystery of christian doctrine have to so great a extent be make the subject of earnest discussion in every household hence we find in the new england of to-day a deep religious sense combine with singular flexibility of mind and freedom of think a state of society so completely democratic as that here describe have not often be find in connection with a very high and complex civilization in contemplate these old mountain village of new england one descry slow modification in the structure of society which threaten somewhat to lessen its dignity the immense productiveness of the soil in we western state combine with cheapness of transportation tend to affect seriously the agricultural interest of new england as well as those of we mother-country there be a visible tendency for farm to pass into the hand of proprietor of a inferior type to that of the former owner -- man who be content with a lower standard of comfort and culture while the son of the old farmer go off to the university to prepare for a professional career and the daughter marry merchant or lawyer in the city the mountain-stream of new england too afford so much water-power as to bring in ugly factory to disfigure the beautiful ravine and to introduce into the community a class of people very different from the landholding descendant of the puritan when once a factory be establish near a village one no longer feel free to sleep with door unbolt it will be long however i trust before the simple earnest and independent type of character that have be nurture on the blue hill of massachusett and the white hill of new hampshire shall cease to operate like a powerful leaven upon the whole of american society much have be say and sing in praise of the spirit of chivalry which after all as a great historian remind we imply the arbitrary choice of one or two virtue to be practice in such a exaggerated degree as to become vice while the ordinary law of right and wrong be forget -lrb- 1 -rrb- quite enough have be say too in discredit of puritanism -- its narrowness of aim its ascetic proclivity its quaint affectation of hebraism yet these thing be but the symptom of the intensity of its reverence for that grand spirit of hebraism of which mr matthew arnold speak to which we owe the bible and christianity no loftier ideal have ever be conceive than that of the puritan who would fain have make of the world a city of god if we could sum up all that england owe to puritanism the story would be a great one indeed as regard the united state we may safely say that what be noblest in we history to-day and of happiest augury for we social and political future be the impress leave upon the character of we people by the heroic man who come to new england early in the seventeenth century the settlement of new england by the puritan occupy a peculiar position in the annals of colonization and without understand this we can not properly appreciate the character of the purely democratic society which i have seek to describe as a general rule colony have be found either by government or by private enterprise for political or commercial reason the aim have be -- on the part of government -- to annoy some rival power or to get rid of criminal or to open some new avenue of trade or -- on the part of the people -- to escape from straitened circumstance at home or to find a refuge from religious persecution in the settlement of new england none of these motive be operative except the last and that only to a slight extent the puritan who flee from nottinghamshire to holland in 1608 and twelve year afterwards cross the ocean in the _ mayflower _ may be say to have be drive from england by persecution but this be not the case with the puritan who between 1630 and 1650 go from lincolnshire norfolk and suffolk and from dorset and devonshire and found the colony of massachusett and connecticut these man leave they home at a time when puritanism be wax powerful and could not be assail with impunity they belong to the upper and middle class of the society of that day outside of the peerage mr freeman have point out the importance of the change by which after the norman conquest the old-english nobility or _ thegnhood _ be push down into a secondary place in the political and social scale of the far-reaching effect of this change upon the whole subsequent history of the english race i shall hereafter have occasion to speak the proximate effect be that the ancient lord of the soil thus thrust down into the second rank form that great body of freeholder the stout gentry and yeomanry of england who be for so many age the strength of the land -lrb- 2 -rrb- it be from this ancient thegnhood that the puritan settler of new england be mainly descend it be no unusual thing for a massachusett family to trace its pedigree to a lord of the manor in the thirteenth or fourteenth century the leader of the new england emigration be country gentleman of good fortune similar in position to such man as hampden and cromwell a large proportion of they have take degree at cambridge the rank and file be mostly intelligent and prosperous yeoman the lowest rank of society be not represent in the emigration and all idle shiftless or disorderly people be rigorously refuse admission into the new community the early history of which be therefore singularly free from anything like riot or mutiny to a extent unparalleled therefore in the annals of colonization the settler of new england be a body of _ pick man _ they puritanism be the natural outcome of they free-thinking combine with a earnestness of character which could constrain they to any sacrifice needful for realize they high ideal of life they give up pleasant home in england and they leave they with no feeling of rancor towards they native land in order that by dint of whatever hardship they might establish in the american wilderness what should approve itself to they judgment as a god-fearing community it matter little that they conception be in some respects narrow in the unflinching adherence to duty which prompt they enterprise and in the sober intelligence with which it be carry out we have as i say before the key to what be best in the history of the american people out of such a colonization as that here describe nothing but a democratic society could very well come save perhaps in case of a scarcity of arable land between the country gentleman and the yeoman who have become a land proprietor the difference be not great enough to allow the establishment of permanent distinction social or political immediately on they arrival in new england the settler proceed to form for themselves a government as purely democratic as any that have ever be see in the world instead of scatter about over the country the requirement of education and of public worship as well as of defense against indian attack oblige they to form small village community as these village multiply the surface of the country come to be lay out in small district -lrb- usually from six to ten mile in length and breadth -rrb- call _ township _ each township contain its village together with the woodland surround it in later day two or more village have often grow up within the limit of the same township and the road from one village to another be sometimes border with homestead and cultivate field throughout nearly its whole length in the neighborhood of boston village and small town crowd closely together for twenty mile in every direction and all these will no doubt by and by grow together into a vast and complicated city in somewhat the same way that london have grow from the outset the government of the township be vest in the town-meeting -- a institution which in its present form be say to be peculiar to new england but which as we shall see have close analogy with local self-governing body in other age and country once in each year -- usually in the month of march -- a meeting be hold at which every adult male residing within the limit of the township be expect to be present and be at liberty to address the meeting or to vote upon any question that may come up in the first year of the colony it seem to have be attempt to hold town-meeting every month and to discuss all the affair of the community in these assembly but this be soon find to be a cumbrous way of transact public business and as early as 1635 we find _ selectman _ choose to administer the affair of the township during the interval between the assembly as the system have perfect itself at each annual town-meeting there be choose not less than three or more than nine selectman accord to the size of the township besides these there be choose a town-clerk a town-treasurer a school-committee assessor of tax overseer of the poor constable surveyor of highway fence-viewer and other officer in very small township the selectman themselves may act as assessor of tax or overseer of the poor the selectman may appoint police-officer if such be require they may act as a board of health in addition to sundry specific duty too numerous to mention here they have the general superintendence of all public business save such as be expressly assign to the other officer and whenever circumstance may seem to require it they be authorize to call a town-meeting the selectman be thus the principal town-magistrate and through the annual election they responsibility to the town be maintain at the maximum yet in many new england town re-election of the same person year after year have very commonly prevail i know of a instance where the office of town-clerk be fill by three member of one family during one hundred and fourteen consecutive year besides choose executive officer the town-meeting have the power of enact by-law of make appropriation of money for town-purpose and of provide for miscellaneous emergency by what might be term special legislation besides the annual meeting hold in the spring for transact all this local business the selectman be require to call a meeting in the autumn of each year for the election of state and county officer each second year for the election of representative to the federal congress and each fourth year for the election of the president of the united state it only remain to add that as a assembly of the whole people become impracticable in a large community so when the population of a township have grow to ten or twelve thousand the town-meeting be discontinue the town be incorporate as a city and its affair be manage by a mayor a board of alderman and a common council accord to the system adopt in london in the reign of edward i in america therefore the distinction between city and town have nothing to do with the presence or absence of a cathedral but refer solely to difference in the communal or municipal government in the city the common council as a representative body replace -lrb- in a certain sense -rrb- the town-meeting a representative government be substitute for a pure democracy but the city officer like the selectman of town be elect annually and in no case -lrb- i believe -rrb- have municipal government fall into the hand of a self-perpetuating body as it have do in so many instance in england owe to the unwise policy pursue by the tudor and stuart in they grant of charter it be only in new england that the township system be to be find in its completeness in several southern and western state the administrative unit be the county and local affair be manage by county commissioner elect by the people elsewhere we find a mixture of the county and township system in some of the western state settle by new england people town-meeting be hold though they power be somewhat less extensive than in new england in the settlement of virginium it be attempt to copy directly the parish and vestry borough and guild of england but in the southern state generally the great size of the plantation and the wide dispersion of the population hinder the growth of town so that it be impossible to have a administrative unit smaller than the county as tocqueville say fifty year ago the farther south we go the less active do the business of the township or parish become the population exercise a less immediate influence on affair the power of the elect magistrate be augmented and that of the election diminish while the public spirit of the local community be less quickly awaken and less influential this be almost equally true to-day yet with all these difference in local organization there be no part of we country in which the spirit of local self-government can be call weak or uncertain i have describe the town-meeting as it exist in the state where it first grow up and have since chiefly flourish but something very like the town-meeting principle lie at the bottom of all the political life of the united state to maintain vitality in the center without sacrifice it in the part to preserve tranquillity in the mutual relation of forty powerful state while keep the people everywhere as far as possible in direct contact with the government such be the political problem which the american union exist for the purpose of solve and of this great truth every american citizen be suppose to have some glimmering however crude it have be say that the town-government of new england be establish without any conscious reference to precedent but however this may be they be certainly not without precedent and analogy to enumerate which will carry we very far back in the history of the aryan world at the beginning of he essay on the growth of the english constitution mr freeman give a eloquent account of the may assembly of urus and appenzell when the whole people elect they magistrate for the year and vote upon amendment to the old law or upon the adoption of new one such a sight mr freeman seem to think can be see nowhere but in switzerland and he reckon it among the highest privilege of he life to have look upon it but i be unable to see in what respect the town-meeting in massachusett differ from the _ landesgemeinde _ or cantonal assembly in switzerland save that it be hold in a town-hall and not in the open air that it be conduct with somewhat less of pageantry and that the freeman who attend do not carry arm even by way of ceremony in the swiss assembly as mr freeman truly observe we see exemplify the most democratic phase of the old teutonic constitution as describe in the germanium of tacitus the earliest picture which history can give we of the political and social being of we own forefather the same remark in precisely the same term would be true of the town-meeting of new england political institution on the white mountain and on the alp not only closely resemble each other but be connect by strict bond of descent from a common original the most primitive self-governing body of which we have any knowledge be the village-community of the ancient teuton of which such strict counterpart be find in other part of the aryan world as to make it apparent that in its essential feature it must be a inheritance from prehistoric aryan antiquity in its teutonic form the primitive village-community -lrb- or rather the spot inhabit by it -rrb- be know as the _ mark _ -- that be a place define by a boundary-line one characteristic of the mark-community be that all its free member be in theory suppose to be relate to each other through descent from a common progenitor and in this respect the mark-community agree with the _ gen _ -lrb- greek : _ gino _ -rrb- or _ clan _ the earliest form of political union in the world be one which rest not upon territorial contiguity but upon i blood-relationship either real or assume through the legal fiction of adoption in the lowest savagery blood-relationship be the only admissible or conceivable ground for sustained common action among group of man among people which wander about support themselves either by hunting or at a somewhat more advanced stage of development by the rearing of flock and herd a group of man thus permanently associate through tie of blood-relationship be what we call a _ clan _ when by the development of agricultural pursuit the nomadic mode of life be bring to a end when the clan remain stationary upon some piece of territory surround by a strip of forest-land or other boundary natural or artificial then the clan become a mark-community the profound linguistic research of pictet fick and other have make it probable that at the time when the old-aryan language be break up into the dialect from which the exist language of europe be descend the aryan tribe be pass from a purely pastoral stage of barbarism into a incipient agricultural stage somewhat like that which characterize the iroquois tribe in america in the seventeenth century the comparative study of institution lead to result in harmony with this view show we the mark-community of we teutonic ancestor with the clear trace of its origin in the more primitive clan though with mr kemble i do not doubt that by the time of tacitus the german tribe have long since reach the agricultural stage territorially the old teutonic mark consist of three division there be the _ village mark _ where the people live in house crowd closely together no doubt for defensive purpose there be the _ arable mark _ divide into as many lot as there be householder and there be the _ common mark _ or border-strip of untilled land wherein all the inhabitant of the village have common rights of pasturage and of cut firewood all this land originally be the property not of any one family or individual but of the community the study of the mark carry we back to a time when there may have be private property in weapon utensil or trinket but not in real estate -lrb- 3 -rrb- of the three kind of land the common mark save where curtail or usurp by lord in the day of feudalism have generally remain public property to this day the pleasant green common or square which occur in the midst of town and city in england and the united state most probably originate from the coalescence of adjacent mark-community whereby the border-land use in common by all be bring into the center of the new aggregate in town of modern date this origin of the common be of course forget and in accordance with the general law by which the useful thing after discharge its function survive for purpose of ornament it be introduce as a pleasure-ground in old town of new england however the little park where boy play ball or child and nurse take the air be once the common pasture of the town even boston common do not entirely cease to be a grazing-field until 1830 it be in the village-mark or assemblage of homestead that private property in real estate naturally begin in the russian village to-day the homestead be private property while the cultivate land be own in common this be the case with the _ arable mark _ of we ancestor the arable mark belong to the community and be temporarily divide into as many field as there be household though the division be probably not into equal part : more likely as in russium to-day the number of labourer in each household be take into the account and at irregular interval as fluctuation in population seem to require it a thorough-going redivision be effect in carry out such division and redivision as well as in all matter relate to village plough field or pasture the mark-community be a law unto itself though individual freedom be by no means considerable the legal existence of the individual be almost entirely merge in that of he clan the mark-community be a completely self-governing body the assembly of the mark-man or member of the community allotted land for tillage determine the law or declare the custom as to method of tillage fix the date for sowing and reap vote upon the admission of new family into the village and in general transact what be then regard as the public business of the community in all essential respects this village assembly or _ mark-mote _ would seem to have resemble the town-meeting of new england such be the mark-community of the ancient teuton as we gather partly from hint afford by tacitus and partly from the comparative study of english german and scandinavian institution in russium and in hindustan we find the same primitive form of social organization exist with very little change at the present day alike in hindu and in russian village-community we find the group of habitation each despotically rule by a _ pater-familias _ we find the pasture-land own and enjoy in common and we find the arable land divide into separate lot which be cultivate accord to minute regulation establish by the community but in indium the occasional redistribution of lot survive only in a few locality and as a mere tradition in other the arable mark have become private property as well as the homestead in russium on the other hand re-allotment occur at irregular interval average something like fifteen year in indium the local government be carry on in some place by a council of village elder and in other place by a headman whose office be sometimes describe as hereditary but be more probably elective the choice be confine as in the case of the old teutonic kingship to the member of a particular family in the russian village on the other hand the government be conduct by a assembly at which every head of a household be expect to be present and vote on all matter of public concern this assembly elect the village elder or chief executive officer the tax-collector the watchman and the communal herd-boy it direct the allotment of the arable land and in general matter of local legislation its power be as great as that of the new england town-meeting -- in some respects perhaps even greater since the precise extent of its power have never be determine by legislation and -lrb- accord to mr wallace -rrb- there be no means of appeal against its decision to those who be in the habit of regard russium simply as a despotically-governed country such a statement may seem surprising to those who because the russian government be call a bureaucracy have be lead to think of it as analogous to the government of france under the old régime it may seem incredible that the decision of a village-assembly should not admit of appeal to a higher authority but in point of fact no two despotic government could be less alike than that of modern russium and that of france under the old régime the russian government be autocratic inasmuch as over the larger part of the country it have simply succeed to the position of the mongolian khan who from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century hold the russian people in subjection this mongolian government be -- to use a happy distinction suggest by sir henry maine -- a tax-taking despotism not a legislative despotism the conqueror exact tribute but do not interfere with the law and custom of the subject people when the russian drive out the mongol they exchange a despotism which they hate for one in which they feel a national pride but in one curious respect the position of the people with reference to they ruler have remain the same the imperial government exact from each village-community a tax in gross for which the community as a whole be responsible and which may or may not be oppressive in amount but the government have never interfere with local legislation or with local custom thus in the _ mir _ or village-community the russian still retain a element of sound political life the importance of which appear when we consider that five-sixth of the population of european russium be comprise in these community the tax assess upon they by the imperial government be however a feature which -- even more than they imperfect system of property and they low grade of mental culture -- separate they by a world-wide interval from the new england township to the primeval embryonic stage of which they correspond from these illustration we see that the mark or self-governing village-community be a institution which must be refer back to early aryan time whether the mark ever exist in england in anything like the primitive form in which it be see in the russian _ mir _ be doubtful professor stubb -lrb- one of the greatest living authority on such a subject -rrb- be incline to think that the teutonic settler of britain have pass beyond this stage before they migrate from germany -lrb- 4 -rrb- nevertheless the trace of the mark as all admit be plentiful enough in england and some of its feature have survive down to modern time in the great number of town-name that be form from patronymic such as _ walsingham _ the home of the walsing _ harlington _ the town of the harling etc -lrb- 5 -rrb- we have unimpeachable evidence of a time when the town be regard as the dwelling-place of a clan indeed the comparative rarity of the word _ mark _ in english law charter and local name -lrb- to which professor stubb allude -rrb- may be due to the fact that the word _ town _ have precisely the same meaning _ mark _ mean originally the belt of waste land encircle the village and secondarily the village with its periphery _ town _ mean originally a hedge or enclosure and secondarily the spot that be enclose : the modern german _ zaun _ a hedge preserve the original meaning but trace of the mark in england be not find in etymology alone i have already allude to the origin of the common in english town what be still more important be that in some part of england cultivation in common have continue until quite recently the local legislation of the mark appear in the _ tunscipesmot _ -- a word which be simply old-english for town-meeting in the shire where the dane acquire a firm foothold the township be often call a by and it have the power of enact its own by-law or town-law as new england township have to-day but above all the assembly of the markman have leave vestige of itself in the constitution of the parish and the manor the mark or township transform by the process of feudalization become the manor the process of feudalization throughout western europe in general be no doubt begin by the institution of benefice or grant of roman provincial land by the chieftain of the teutonic tribe which overrun the roman empire such grant be confer on they associate upon certain condition of which the commonest be military service -lrb- 6 -rrb- the feudal régime naturally reach its most complete development in france which afford the most perfect example of a roman territory overrun and permanently hold in possession by teutonic conqueror other cause assist the process the most potent perhaps be the chaotic condition of european society during the break-up of the carolingian empire and the scandinavian and hungarian invasion land be better protect when hold of a powerful chieftain than when hold in one 's own right and hence the practice of commendation by which free allodial proprietor be transform into the tenant of a lord become fashionable and be gradually extend to all kind of estate in england the effect of feudalization be different from what they be in france but the process be still carry very far especially under the norman king the theory grow up that all the public land in the kingdom be the king 's waste and that all landholder be the king 's tenant similarly in every township the common land be the lord 's waste and the landholder be the lord 's tenant thus the township become transform into the manor yet even by such a change as this the townsman or tenant of the manor do not in england lose they self-government the encroachment of the lord as sir henry maine observe be in proportion to the want of certainty in the rights of the community the lord 's proprietorship give he no authority to disturb customary rights the old township-assembly partially survive in the court baron court leet and customary court of the manor and in these court the arrangement for the common husbandry be determine this metamorphosis of the township into the manor however be but partial : along with it go the partial metamorphosis of the township into the parish or district assign to a priest professor stubb have point out that the boundary of the parish and the township or township with which it coincide be generally the same : in small parish the idea and even the name of township be frequently at the present day sink in that of the parish and all the business that be not manorial be despatch in vestry-meeting which be however primarily meeting of the township for church purpose -lrb- 7 -rrb- the parish officer include overseer of the poor assessor and way-warden be still elect in vestry-meeting by the freeman of the township and while the jurisdiction of the manorial court have be define by charter or by the customary law exist at the time of the manorial grant all matter arise outside that jurisdiction come under the management of the vestry in england therefore the free village-community though perhaps nowhere find in its primitive integrity have nevertheless survive in partially transfigured form which have play no unimportant part in the history of the english people in one shape or another the assembly of freeman for purpose of local legislation have always exist the puritan who colonize new england therefore do not invent the town-meeting they be familiar already with the proceedings of the vestry-meeting and the manorial court but they be sever now from church and from aristocracy so they have but to discard the ecclesiastical and lordly terminology with such limitation as they involve and to reintegrate the separate jurisdiction into one -- and forthwith the old assembly of the township found in immemorial tradition but revivify by new thought and purpose gain through age of political training emerge into fresh life and enter upon a more glorious career it be not to a audience which speak the english language that i need to argue the point that the preservation of local self-government be of the highest importance for the maintenance of a rich and powerful national life as we contemplate the vicissitude of local self-government in the various portion of the aryan world we see the contrast fortune of france and england illustrate for we most forcibly the significance of this truth for the preservation of local self-government in england various cause may be assign but of these there be two which may be cite as especially prominent in the first place owe to the peculiar circumstance of the teutonic settlement of britain the civilization of england previous to the norman conquest be but little affect by roman idea or institution in the second place the thrust down of the old thegnhood by the norman conquest -lrb- to which i have already allude -rrb- check the growth of a _ noblesse _ or _ adel _ of the continental type -- a nobility raise above the common people like a separate caste for the old thegnhood which might have grow into such a caste be push down into a secondary position and the peerage which arise after the conquest be something different from a _ noblesse _ it be primarily a nobility of office rather than of rank or privilege the peer be those man who retain the right of summons to the great council or witenagemote which have survive as the house of lord the peer be therefore the holder of a legislative and judicial office which only one of he child could inherit from the very nature of the case and which none of he child could share with he hence the brother and younger child of a peer be always commoner and they interest be not remotely separate from those of other commoner hence after the establishment of a house of common they best chance for a political career lay in represent the interest of the people in the lower house hence between the upper and lower stratum of english society there have always be keep up a circulation or interchange of idea and interest and the effect of this upon english history have be prodigious while on the continent a sovereign like charle the bold could use he nobility to extinguish the liberty of the merchant town of flander nothing of the sort be ever possible in england throughout the middle age in every contest between the people and the crown the weight of the peerage be throw into the scale in favor of popular liberty but for this peculiar position of the peerage we might have have no earl simon it be largely through it that representative government and local liberty have be preserve to the english race in france the course of event have bring about very different result i shall defer to my next lecture the consideration of the vicissitude of local self-government under the roman empire because that point be really incident upon the study of the formation of vast national aggregate suffice it now to say that when the teuton overcome gaul they become ruler over a population which have be subject for five century to that slow but mighty process of trituration which the empire everywhere bring to bear upon local self-government while the teuton in britain moreover enslave they slightly romanized subject and give little heed to they language religion or custom the teuton in gaul on the other hand quickly adopt the language and religion of they intensely romanized subject and acquire to some extent they way of look at thing hence in the early history of france there be no such stubborn mass of old aryan liberty to be deal with as in the early history of england nor be there any powerful middle class distribute through the country to defend such liberty as exist beneath the turbulent throng of teutonic noble among whom the king be only the most exalted and not always the strongest there lay the gallo-roman population which have so long be accustom to be rule without representation by a distant government exercise its authority through innumerable prefect such teutonic rank and file as there be become absorb into this population and except in sundry chartered town there be nothing like a social stratum interpose between the noble and the common people the slow conversion of the feudal monarchy of the early capetian into the absolute despotism of loui xiv be accomplish by the king gradually _ conquer _ he vassal one after another and add they domain to he own as one vassal territory after another be add to the royal domain the king send prefect responsible only to himself to administer its local affair sedulously crush out so far as possible the last vestige of self-government the noble deprive of they provincial rule in great part flock to pari to become idle courtier the means for carry on the gigantic machinery of centralized administration and for support the court in its folly be wring from the groan peasantry with a cynical indifference like that with which tribute be extort by barbaric chieftain from a conquered enemy and thus come about that abominable state of thing which a century since be abruptly end by one of the fiercest convulsion of modern time the prodigious superiority -- in respect to national vitality -- of a freely govern country over one that be govern by a centralized despotism be nowhere more brilliantly illustrated than in the contrast fortune of france and england as _ colonize _ nation when we consider the declare rivalry between france and england in they plan for colonize the barbarous region of the earth when we consider that the military power of the two country have be not far from equal and that france have at time show herself a maritime power by no means to be despise it seem to I that she overwhelming and irretrievable defeat by england in the struggle for colonial empire be one of the most striking and one of the most instructive fact in all modern history in my lecture of last year -lrb- at university college -rrb- i show that in the struggle for the possession of north america where the victory of england be so decisive as to settle the question for all come time the cause of the french failure be very plainly to be see the french colony in canada be one of the most complete example of a despotic government that the world have ever see all the autocratic and bureaucratic idea of loui xiv be here carry out without let or hindrance it would be incredible be it not attest by such abundant evidence that the affair of any people could be subject to such minute and sleepless supervision as be the affair of the french colonist in canada a man could not even build he own house or rear he own cattle or sow he own seed or reap he own grain save under the supervision of prefect act under instruction from the home government no one be allow to enter or leave the colony without permission not from the colonist but from the king no farmer could visit montreal or quebec without permission no huguenot could set he foot on canadian soil no public meeting of any kind be tolerate nor be there any means of give expression to one 's opinion on any subject the detail of all this which may be read in mr parkman 's admirable work on the old regime in canada make a wonderful chapter of history never be a colony moreover so load with bounty so foster pet and protect the result be absolute paralysis political and social when after a century of irritation and skirmish the french in canada come to a life-and-death struggle with the self-governing colonist of new england new york and virginium the result for the french power in america be instant and irretrievable annihilation the town-meeting pit against the bureaucracy be like a titan overthrow a cripple the historic lesson owe its value to the fact that this ruin of the french scheme of colonial empire be due to no accidental circumstance but be involve in the very nature of the french political system obviously it be impossible for a people to plant beyond sea a colony which shall be self-supporting unless it have retain intact the power of self-government at home it be to the self-government of england and to no lesser cause that we be to look for the secret of that boundless vitality which have give to man of english speech the uttermost part of the earth for a inheritance the conquest of canada first demonstrate this truth and when -- in the two follow lecture -- we shall have make some approach towards comprehend its full import we shall all i think be ready to admit that the triumph of wolfe mark the greatest turning-point as yet discernible in modern history ii _ the federal union _ the great history of thukydide which after twenty-three century still rank -lrb- in spite of mr cobden -rrb- among we chief text-book of political wisdom have often seem to I one of the most mournful book in the world at no other spot on the earth 's surface and at no other time in the career of mankind have the human intellect flower with such luxuriance as at athen during the eighty-five year which intervene between the victory of marathon and the defeat of ægospotamos in no other like interval of time and in no other community of like dimension have so much work be accomplish of which we can say with truth that it be -lrb- greek : ktaema es aei -rrb- -- a eternal possession it be impossible to conceive of a day so distant or a era of culture so exalted that the lesson teach by athen shall cease to be of value or that the writings of she great thinker shall cease to be read with fresh profit and delight we understand these thing far better to-day than do those monster of erudition in the sixteenth century who study the classic for philological purpose mainly indeed the older the world grow the more varied we experience of practical politics the more comprehensive we survey of universal history the stronger we grasp upon the comparative method of inquiry the more brilliant be the light throw upon that brief day of athenian greatness and the more wonderful and admirable do it all seem to see this glorious community overthrow shear of half its virtue -lrb- to use the homeric phrase -rrb- and thrust down into a inferior position in the world be a mournful spectacle indeed and the book which set before we so impartially yet so eloquently the innumerable petty misunderstanding and contemptible jealousy which bring about this direful result be one of the most mournful of book we may console ourselves however for the premature overthrow of the power of athen by the reflection that that power rest upon political condition which could not in any case have be permanent or even long-endure the entire political system of ancient greece base as it be upon the idea of the sovereign independence of each single city be one which could not fail sooner or later to exhaust itself through chronic anarchy the only remedy lay either in some kind of permanent federation combine with representative government or else in what we might call incorporation and assimilation after the roman fashion but the incorporation of one town with another though effect with brilliant result in the early history of attika involve such a disturbance of all the association which in the greek mind cluster about the conception of a city that it be quite impracticable on any large or general scale scheme of federal union be put into operation though too late to be of avail against the assault of macedonium and rome but as for the principle of representation that seem to have be a invention of the teutonic mind no statesman of antiquity either in greece or at rome seem to have conceive the idea of a city send delegate arm with plenary power to represent its interest in a general legislative assembly to the greek statesman no doubt this too would have seem derogatory to the dignity of the sovereign city this feeling with which the ancient greek statesman and to some extent the roman also regard the city have become almost incomprehensible to the modern mind so far remove be we from the political circumstance which make such a feeling possible teutonic civilization indeed have never pass through a stage in which the foremost position have be hold by civic community teutonic civilization pass directly from the stage of tribal into that of national organization before any teutonic city have acquire sufficient importance to have claim autonomy for itself and at the time when teutonic nationality be form moreover all the city in europe have so long be accustom to recognize a master outside of they in the person of the roman emperor that the very tradition of civic autonomy as it exist in ancient greece have become extinct this difference between the political basis of teutonic and of græco-roman civilization be one of which it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and when thoroughly understand it go farther perhaps than anything else towards account for the successive failure of the greek and roman political system and towards inspiring we with confidence in the future stability of the political system which have be work out by the genius of the english race we see in the precede lecture how the most primitive form of political association know to have exist be that of the _ clan _ or group of family hold together by tie of descent from a common ancestor we see how the change from a nomadic to a stationary mode of life attendant upon the adoption of agricultural pursuit convert the clan into a _ mark _ or village-community something like those which exist to-day in russium the political progress of primitive society seem to have consist largely in the coalescence of these small group into larger group the first series of compound group result from the coalescence of adjacent mark be that which be know in nearly all teutonic land as the _ hundred _ in athen as the -lrb- greek : _ phratrium _ -rrb- or _ brotherhood _ in rome as the _ curia _ yet alongside of the roman group call the _ curia _ there be a group whose name the _ century _ exactly translate the name of the teutonic group and as mr freeman say it be difficult to believe that the roman _ century _ do not at the outset in some way correspond to the teutonic _ hundred _ as a stage in political organization but both these term as we know they in history be survival from some prehistoric state of thing and whether they be originally apply to a hundred of house or of family or of warrior we do not know -lrb- 8 -rrb- m geffroy in he interesting essay on the germanium of tacitus suggest that the term _ canton _ may have a similar origin -lrb- 9 -rrb- the outline of these primitive group be however more obscure than those of the more primitive mark because in most case they have be either cross and efface or at any rate diminish in importance by the more highly compound group which come next in order of formation next above the _ hundred _ in order of composition come the group know in ancient italy as the_pagus _ in attika perhaps as the _ deme _ in germany and at first in england as the _ gau _ or _ ga _ at a later date in england as the _ shire _ whatever its name this group answer to the _ tribe _ regard as settle upon a certain determinate territory just as in the earlier nomadic life the aggregation of clan make ultimately the tribe so in the more advanced agricultural life of we aryan ancestor the aggregation of mark or village-community make ultimately the _ gau _ or _ shire _ properly speak the name _ shire _ be descriptive of division and not of aggregation but this term come into use in england after the historic order of formation have be forget and when the _ shire _ be look upon as a _ piece _ of some larger whole such as the kingdom of mercium or wessex historically however the _ shire _ be not make like the _ department _ of modern france by the division of the kingdom for administrative purpose but the kingdom be make by the union of shire that be previously autonomous in the primitive process of aggregation the _ shire _ or _ gau _ govern by its _ witenagemote _ or meeting of wise man and by its chief magistrate who be call _ ealdorman _ in time of peace and _ heretoga _ army-leader _ dux _ or _ duke _ in time of war -- the _ shire _ i say in this form be the largest and most complex political body we find previous to the formation of kingdom and nation but in say this we have already pass beyond the point at which we can include in the same general formulum the process of political development in teutonic country on the one hand and in greece and rome on the other up as far as the formation of the tribe territorially regard the parallelism be preserved but at this point there begin a all-important divergence in the looser and more diffused society of the rural teuton the tribe be spread over a shire and the aggregation of shire make a kingdom embrace city town and rural district hold together by similar bond of relationship to the central govern power but in the society of the old greek and italian the aggregation of tribe crowd together on fortify hill-top make the _ ancient city _ -- a very different thing indeed from the modern city of later-roman or teutonic foundation let we consider for a moment the difference sir henry maine tell we that in hindustan nearly all the great town and city have arise either from the simple expansion or from the expansion and coalescence of primitive village-community and such as have not arise in this way include some of the greatest of indian city have grow up about the intrenched camp of the mogul emperor -lrb- 10 -rrb- the case have be just the same in modern europe some famous city of england and germany -- such as chester and lincoln strasburg and maintz -- grow up about the camp of the roman legion but in general the teutonic city have be form by the expansion and coalescence of thickly-peopled township and hundred in the united state nearly all city have come from the growth and expansion of village with such occasional case of coalescence as that of boston with roxbury and charlestown now and then a city have be lay out as a city _ ab initio _ with full consciousness of its purpose as a man would build a house and this be the case not merely with martin chuzzlewit 's eden but with the city of washington the seat of we federal government but to go back to the early age of england -- the country which best exhibit the normal development of teutonic institution -- the point which i wish especially to emphasize be this : _ in no case do the city appear as equivalent to the dwelling-place of a tribe or of a confederation of tribe _ in no case do citizenship or burghership appear to rest upon the basis of a real or assumed community of descent from a single real or mythical progenitor in the primitive mark as we have see the bond which keep the community together and constitute it a political unit be the bond of blood-relationship real or assumed but this be not the case with the city or borough the city do not correspond with the tribe as the mark correspond with the clan the aggregation of clan into tribe correspond with the aggregation of mark not into _ city _ but into _ shire _ the multitude of compound political unit by the further compounding of which a nation be to be form do not consist of city but of shire the city be simply a point in the shire distinguish by greater density of population the relation sustain by the thinly-peopled rural township and hundred to the general government of the shire be co-ordinate with the relation sustain to the same government by those thickly-peopled township and hundred which upon they coalescence be know as city or borough of course i be speak now in a broad and general way and without reference to such special privilege or immunity as city and borough frequently obtain by royal charter in feudal time such special privilege -- as for instance the exemption of borough from the ordinary session of the county court under henry i -lrb- 11 -rrb- -- be in they nature grant from a external source and be in nowise inherent in the position or mode of origin of the teutonic city and they be moreover posterior in date to that embryonic period of national growth of which i be now speak they do not affect in any way the correctness of my general statement which be sufficiently illustrate by the fact that the oldest shire-mote or county-assembly be attend by representative from all the township and hundred in the shire whether such township and hundred form part of borough or not very different from this be the embryonic growth of political society in ancient greece and italy there the aggregation of clan into tribe and confederation of tribe result directly as we have see in the city there burghership with its political and social rights and duty have its theoretical basis in descent from a common ancestor or from a small group of closely-related common ancestor the group of fellow-citizen be associate through its related group of ancestral household-deity and through religious rite perform in common to which it would have be sacrilege to have admit a stranger thus the ancient city be a religious as well as a political body and in either character it be complete in itself and it be sovereign thus in ancient greece and italy the primitive clan-assembly or township-meeting do not grow by aggregation into the assembly of the shire but it develop into the _ comitium _ or _ ecclesium _ of the city the chief magistrate be not the _ ealdorman _ of early english history but the _ rex _ or _ basileus _ who combine in himself the function of king general and priest thus too there be a severance politically between city and country such as the teutonic world have never know the rural district surround a city might be subject to it but could neither share its franchise nor claim a co-ordinate franchise with it athen indeed at a early period go so far as to incorporate with itself eleusis and marathon and the other rural town of attika in this one respect athen transgress the bound of ancient civic organization and no doubt it gain greatly in power thereby but generally in the hellenic world the rural population in the neighborhood of a great city be mere -lrb- greek : _ perioikous _ -rrb- or dweller in the vicinity the inhabitant of the city who have move thither from some other city both they and they descendant be mere -lrb- greek : metoikous -rrb- or dweller in the place and neither the one class nor the other could acquire the rights and privilege of citizenship a revolution indeed go on at athen from the time of solon to the time of kleisthene which essentially modify the old tribal division and admit to the franchise all such family resident from time immemorial as do not belong to the tribe of eupatrid by whom the city be found but this change once accomplish the civic exclusiveness of athen remain very much what it be before the popular assembly be enlarged and public harmony be secure but athenian burghership still remain a privilege which could not be acquire by the native of any other city similar revolution with a similarly limited purpose and result occur at sparta eli and other greek city at rome by a like revolution the plebeian of the capitoline and aventine acquire parallel rights of citizenship with the patrician of the original city on the palatine but this revolution as we shall presently see have different result lead ultimately to the overthrow of the city-system throughout the ancient world the deep-seated difference between the teutonic political system base on the shire and the græco-roman system base on the city be now i think sufficiently apparent now from this fundamental difference have come two consequence of enormous importance -- consequence of which it be hardly too much to say that take together they furnish the key to the whole history of european civilization as regard purely from a political point of view the first of these consequence have no doubt a very humble origin in the mere difference between the shire and the city in territorial extent and in density of population when people live near together it be easy for they to attend a town-meeting and the assembly by which public business be transact be likely to remain a _ primary assembly _ in the true sense of the term but when people be disperse over a wide tract of country the primary assembly inevitably shrink up into a assembly of such person as can best afford the time and trouble of attend it or who have the strongest interest in go or be most likely to be listen to after they get there distance and difficulty and in early time danger too keep many people away and though a shire be not a wide tract of country for most purpose and accord to modern idea it be nevertheless quite wide enough in former time to bring about the result i have mention in the time before the norman conquest if not before the complete union of england under edgar the shire-mote or county assembly though in theory still a folk-mote or primary assembly have shrink into what be virtually a witenagemote or assembly of the most important person in the county but the several township in order to keep they fair share of control over county affair and not wish to leave the matter to chance send to the meeting each its _ representative _ in the person of the town-reeve and four discreet man i believe it have not be determine at what precise time this step be take but it no doubt long antedate the norman conquest it be mention by professor stubb as be already in the reign of henry iii a custom of immemorial antiquity -lrb- 12 -rrb- it be one of the greatest step ever take in the political history of mankind in these four discreet man we have the forerunner of the two burgher from each town who be summon by earl simon to the famous parliament of 1265 as well as of the two knight from each shire whom the king have summon eleven year before in these four discreet man send to speak for they township in the old county assembly we have the germ of institution that have ripen into the house of common and into the legislature of modern kingdom and republic in the system of representation thus inaugurate lay the future possibility of such gigantic political aggregate as the united state of america in the ancient city on the other hand the extreme compactness of the political structure make representation unnecessary and prevent it from be think of in circumstance where it might have prove of immense value in a aristocratic greek city like sparta all the member of the ruling class meet together and vote in the assembly in a democratic city like athen all the free citizen meet and vote in each case the assembly be primary and not representative the only exception in all greek antiquity be one which emphatically prove the rule the amphiktyonic council a institution of prehistoric origin concern mainly with religious affair pertain to the worship of the delphic apollo furnish a precedent for a representative and indeed for a federal assembly delegate from various greek tribe and city attend it the fact that with such a suggestive precedent before they eye the greek never once hit upon the device of representation even in they attempt at frame federal union show how thoroughly they whole political training have operate to exclude such a conception from they mind the second great consequence of the graeco-roman city-system be link in many way with this absence of the representative principle in greece the formation of political aggregate higher and more extensive than the city be until a late date render impossible the good and bad side of this peculiar phase of civilization have be often enough comment on by historian on the one hand the democratic assembly of such a imperial city as athen furnish a school of political training superior to anything else that the world have ever see it be something like what the new england town-meeting would be if it be continually require to adjust complicated question of international polity if it be carry on in the very center or point of confluence of all contemporary stream of culture and if it be in the habit every few day of listen to statesman and orator like hamilton or webster jurist like marshall general like sherman poet like lowell historian like parkman nothing in all history have approach the high-wrought intensity and brilliancy of the political life of athen on the other hand the smallness of the independent city as a political aggregate make it of little or no use in diminish the liability to perpetual warfare which be the curse of all primitive community in a group of independent city such as make up the hellenic world the tendency to warfare be almost as strong and the occasion for warfare be almost as frequent as in a congery of mutually hostile tribe of barbarian there be something almost lurid in the sharpness of contrast with which the wonderful height of humanity attain by hella be set off against the fierce barbarism which characterize the relation of its city to one another it may be lay down as a general rule that in a early state of society where the political aggregation be small warfare be universal and cruel from the intensity of the jealousy and rivalry between adjacent self-governing group of man nothing short of chronic warfare can result until some principle of union be evolve by which dispute can be settle in accordance with general principle admit by all among people that have never rise above the tribal stage of aggregation such as the american indian war be the normal condition of thing and there be nothing fit to be call _ peace _ -- there be only truce of brief and uncertain duration be it not for this there would be somewhat less to be say in favor of great state and kingdom as modern life grow more and more complicated and interdependent the great state subserve innumerable useful purpose but in the history of civilization its first service both in order of time and in order of importance consist in the diminution of the quantity of warfare and in the narrowing of its sphere for within the territorial limit of any great and permanent state the tendency be for warfare to become the exception and peace the rule in this direction the political career of the greek city assist the progress of civilization but little under the condition of graeco-roman civic life there be but two practicable method of form a great state and diminish the quantity of warfare the one method be _ conquest with incorporation _ the other method be _ federation _ either one city might conquer all the other and endow they citizen with its own franchise or all the city might give up part of they sovereignty to a federal body which should have power to keep the peace and should represent the civilized world of the time in its relation with outlying barbaric people of these two method obviously the latter be much the more effective but it presuppose for its successful adoption a higher general state of civilization than the former neither method be adopt by the greek in they day of greatness the spartan method of extend its power be conquest without incorporation : when sparta conquer another greek city she send a _ harmost _ to govern it like a tyrant in other word she virtually enslave the subject city the effort of athen tend more in the direction of a peaceful federalism in the great delian confederacy which develop into the maritime empire of athen the ægean city be treat as ally rather than subject as regard they local affair they be in no way interfere with and could they have be represent in some kind of a federal council at athen the course of grecian history might have be wonderfully alter as it be they be all deprive of one essential element of sovereignty -- the power of control they own military force some of they as chio and mitylene furnished troops at the demand of athen other maintain no troops but pay a fix tribute to athen in return for she protection in either case they feel shear of part of they dignity though otherwise they have nothing to complain of and during the peloponnesian war athen have to reckon with they tendency to revolt as well as with she dorian enemy such a confederation be naturally doom to speedy overthrow in the century follow the death of alexander in the closing age of hellenic independence the federal idea appear in a much more advanced stage of elaboration though in a part of greece which have be hold of little account in the great day of athen and sparta between the achaian federation frame in 274 bc and the united state of america there be some interesting point of resemblance which have be elaborately discuss by mr freeman in he history of federal government about the same time the aetolian league come into prominence in the north both these league be instance of true federal government and be not mere confederation that be the central government act directly upon all the citizen and not merely upon the local government each of these league have for its chief executive officer a general elect for one year with power similar to those of a american president in each the supreme assembly be a primary assembly at which every citizen from every city of the league have a right to be present to speak and to vote but as a natural consequence these assembly shrink into comparatively aristocratic body in ætolia which be a group of mountain canton similar to switzerland the federal union be more complete than in achaium which be a group of city in achaium case occur in which a single city be allow to deal separately with foreign power here as in earlier greek history the instinct of autonomy be too powerful to admit of complete federation yet the career of the achaian league be not a inglorious one for nearly a century and a half it give the peloponneso a larger measure of orderly government than the country have ever know before without infringe upon local liberty it defy successfully the threat and assault of macedonium and yield at last only to the all-conquering might of rome thus in so far as greece contribute anything towards the formation of great and pacific political aggregate she do it through attempt at _ federation _ but in so low a state of political development as that which prevail throughout the mediterranean world in pre-christian time the more barbarous method of _ conquest with incorporation _ be more likely to be successful on a great scale this be well illustrate in the history of rome -- a civic community of the same generic type with sparta and athen but present specific difference of the highest importance the beginning of rome unfortunately be prehistoric i have often think that if some beneficent fairy could grant we the power of somewhere raise the veil of oblivion which enshroud the earliest age of aryan dominion in europe there be no place from which the historian should be more glad to see it lift than from rome in the century which see the formation of the city and which precede the expulsion of the king even the legend which be uncritically accept from the day of livy to those of we grandfather be provokingly silent upon the very point as to which we would fain get at least a hint this much be plain however that in the embryonic stage of the roman commonwealth some obscure process of fusion or commingling go on the tribal population of rome be more heterogeneous than that of the great city of greece and its earliest municipal religion seem to have be a assemblage of various tribal religion that have point of contact with other tribal religion throughout large portion of the græco-italic world as m de coulange observe -lrb- 13 -rrb- rome be almost the only city of antiquity which be not keep apart from other city by its religion there be hardly a people in greece or italy which it be restrain from admit to participation in its municipal rite however this may have be it be certain that rome early succeed in free itself from that insuperable prejudice which elsewhere prevent the ancient city from admit alien to a share in its franchise and in this victory over primeval political idea lay the whole secret of rome 's mighty career the victory be not indeed complete until after the terrible social war of bc 90 but it be begin at least four century earlier with the admission of the plebeian at the consummation of the conquest of italy in bc 270 roman burghership already extend in vary degree of completeness through the greater part of etrurium and campanium from the coast to the mountain while all the rest of italy be admit to privilege for which ancient history have elsewhere furnished no precedent hence the invasion of hannibal half a century later even with its stupendous victory of thrasymene and canna effect nothing toward detach the italian subject from they allegiance to rome and herein we have a most instructive contrast to the conduct of the community subject to athen at several critical moment of the peloponnesian war with this consolidation of italy thus triumphantly demonstrate the whole problem of the conquer career of rome be solve all that come afterwards be simply a corollary from this the concentration of all the fight power of the peninsula into the hand of the ruling city form a stronger political aggregate than anything the world have as yet see it be not only proof against the effort of the greatest military genius of antiquity but whenever it be bring into conflict with the looser organization of greece africa and asia or with the semi-barbarous tribe of spain and gaul the result of the struggle be virtually predetermine the universal dominion of rome be inevitable so soon as the political union of italy have be accomplish among the roman themselves there be those who thoroughly understand this point as we may see from the interesting speech of the emperor claudius in favor of admit gaul to the senate the benefit confer upon the world by the universal dominion of rome be of quite inestimable value first of these benefit and -lrb- as it be -rrb- the material basis of the other be the prolonged peace that be enforce throughout large portion of the world where chronic warfare have hitherto prevail the _ pax romana _ have perhaps be sometimes depict in exaggerated color but as compare with all that have precede and with all that follow down to the beginning of the nineteenth century it deserve the encomium it have receive the second benefit be the mingling and mutual destruction of the primitive tribal and municipal religion thus clear the way for christianity -- a step which regard from a purely political point of view be of immense importance for the further consolidation of society in europe the third benefit be the development of the roman law into a great body of legal precept and principle leaven throughout with ethical principle of universal applicability and the gradual substitution of this roman law for the innumerable local usage of ancient community thus arise the idea of a common christendom of a brotherhood of people associate both by common belief regard the unseen world and by common principle of action in the daily affair of life the common ethical and traditional basis thus establish for the future development of the great nationality of europe be the most fundamental characteristic distinguishing modern from ancient history while however it secure these benefit for mankind for all time to come the roman political system in itself be one which could not possibly endure that extension of the franchise which make rome 's conquest possible be after all the extension of a franchise which could only be practically enjoy within the wall of the imperial city itself from first to last the device of representation be never think of and from first to last the roman _ comitium _ remain a primary assembly the result be that as the burgherhood enlarged the assembly become a huge mob as little fitted for the transaction of public business as a town-meeting of all the inhabitant of new york would be the function which in athen be perform by the assembly be accordingly in rome perform largely by the aristocratic senate and for the conflict consequently arise between the senatorial and the popular party it be difficult to find any adequate constitutional check outside of italy moreover in the absence of a representative system the roman government be a despotism which whether more or less oppressive could in the nature of thing be nothing else than a despotism but nothing be more dangerous for a free people than the attempt to govern a dependent people despotically the bad government kill out the good government as surely as slave-labour destroy free-labour or as a debased currency drive out a sound currency the existence of proconsul in the province with great army at they beck and call bring about such result as might have be predict as soon as the grow anarchy at home furnish a valid excuse for armed interference in the case of the roman world however the result be not to be deplore for it simply substitute a government that be practicable under the circumstance for one that have become demonstrably impracticable as regard the province the change from senatorial to imperial government at rome be a great gain inasmuch as it substitute a orderly and responsible administration for irregular and irresponsible extortion for a long time too it be no part of the imperial policy to interfere with local custom and privilege but in the absence of a representative system the centralize tendency inseparable from the position of such a government prove to be irresistible and the strength of this centralize tendency be further enhance by the military character of the government which be necessitate by perpetual frontier warfare against the barbarian as year after year go by the provincial town and city be govern less and less by they local magistrate more and more by prefect responsible to the emperor only there be other co-operating cause economical and social for the decline of the empire but this change alone which be consummate by the time of diocletian be quite enough to burn out the candle of roman strength at both end with the decrease in the power of the local government come a increase in the burden of taxation and conscription that be lay upon they -lrb- 14 -rrb- and as the dislocation of commerce and industry cause by the barbarian inroad and the increase demand of the central administration for the payment of its countless official and the maintenance of its troops all go together the load at last become greater than human nature could endure by the time of the great invasion of the fifth century local political life have go far towards extinction throughout roman europe and the tribal organization of the teuton prevail in the struggle simply because it have come to be politically stronger than any organization that be leave to oppose it we have now see how the two great political system that be found upon the ancient city both end in failure though both achieve enormous and lasting result and we have see how largely both these political failure be due to the absence of the principle of representation from the public life of greece and rome the chief problem of civilization from the political point of view have always be how to secure concerted action among man on a great scale without sacrifice local independence the ancient history of europe show that it be not possible to solve this problem without the aid of the principle of representation greece until overcome by external force sacredly maintain local self-government but in secure permanent concert of action it be conspicuously unsuccessful rome secure concert of action on a gigantic scale and transform the thousand unconnected tribe and city it conquer into a organize european world but in do this it go far towards extinguish local self-government the advent of the teuton upon the scene seem therefore to have be necessary if only to supply the indispensable element without which the dilemma of civilization could not be surmount the turbulence of europe during the teutonic migration be so great and so long continue that on a superficial view one might be excuse for regard the good work of rome as largely undo and in the feudal isolation of effort and apparent incapacity for combined action which characterize the different part of europe after the downfall of the carolingian empire it might well have seem that political society have revert towards a primitive type of structure in truth however the retrogradation be much slighter than appear on the surface feudalism itself with its curious net-work of fealty and obligation run through the fabric of society in every direction be by no means purely disintegrative in its tendency the mutual relation of rival barony be by no means like those of rival clan or tribe in pre-roman day the central power of rome though no longer exert politically through curator and prefect be no less effective in the potent hand of the clergy and in the tradition of the imperial jurisprudence by which the legal idea of mediaeval society be so strongly color so powerful indeed be this twofold influence of rome that in the later middle age when the modern nationality have fairly take shape it be the capacity for local self-government -- in spite of all the teutonic reinforcement it have have -- that have suffer much more than the capacity for national consolidation among the great modern nation it be only england -- which in its political development have remain more independent of the roman law and the roman church than even the teutonic fatherland itself -- it be only england that come out of the mediæval crucible with its teutonic self-government substantially intact on the main-land only two little spot at the two extremity of the old teutonic world have fare equally well at the mouth of the rhine the little dutch community be prepare to lead the attack in the terrible battle for freedom with which the drama of modern history be usher in in the impregnable mountain fastness of upper germany the swiss canton have bid defiance alike to austrian tyrant and to burgundian invader and have preserve in its purest form the rustic democracy of they aryan forefather by a curious coincidence both these free people in they effort towards national unity be lead to frame federal union and one of these political achievement be from the stand-point of universal history of very great significance the old league of high germany which earn immortal renown at morgarten and sempach consist of german-speaking canton only but in the fifteenth century the league win by force of arm a small bit of italian territory about lake lugano and in the sixteenth the powerful city of bern annex the burgundian bishopric of lausanne and rescue the free city of geneva from the clutch of the duke of savoy other burgundian possession of savoy be seize by the canton of freiburg and after awhile all these subject and ally be admit on equal term into the confederation the result be that modern switzerland be make up of what might seem to be most discordant and unmanageable element four language -- german french italian and rhaetian -- be speak within the limit of the confederacy and in point of religion the canton be sharply divide as catholic and protestant yet in spite of all this switzerland be as thoroughly unite in feeling as any nation in europe to the german-speaking catholic of altdorf the german catholic of bavarium be foreigner while the french-speaking protestant of geneva be fellow-countrymen deeper down even than these deep-seated difference of speech and creed lie the feeling that come from the common possession of a political freedom that be greater than that possess by surround people such have be the happy outcome of the first attempt at federal union make by man of teutonic descent complete independence in local affair when combine with adequate representation in the federal council have effect such a intense cohesion of interest throughout the nation as no centralized government however cunningly devise could ever have secure until the nineteenth century however the federal form of government have give no clear indication of its capacity for hold together great body of man spread over vast territorial area in orderly and peaceful relation with one another the empire of trajan and marcus aurelius still remain the greatest known example of political aggregation and man who argue from simple historic precedent without that power of analyze precedent which the comparative method have supply come not unnaturally to the conclusion that great political aggregate have a inherent tendency towards break up and that great political aggregate can not be maintain except by a strongly - centralized administration and at the sacrifice of local self - government a century ago the very idea of a stable federation of forty powerful state cover a territory nearly equal in area to the whole of europe carry on by a republican government elect by universal suffrage and guarantee to every tiniest village its full meed of local independence -- the very idea of all this would have be scout as a thoroughly impracticable utopian dream and such scepticism would have be quite justifiable for european history do not seem to afford any precedent upon which such a forecast of the future could be logically base between the various nation of europe there have certainly always exist a element of political community bequeath by the roman empire manifest during the middle age in a common relationship to the church and in modern time in a common adherence to certain uncodified rule of international law more or less im perfectly define and enforce between england and spain for example or between france and austrium there have never be such utter political severance as exist normally between greece and persium or rome and carthage but this community of political inheritance in europe it be needless to say fall very far short of the degree of community imply in a federal union and so great be the diversity of language and of creed and of local historic development with the deep-seated prejudice attendant thereupon that the formation of a european federation could hardly be look for except as the result of mighty though quiet and subtle influence operate for a long time from without from what direction and in what manner such a irresistible though perfectly pacific pressure be likely to be exert in the future i shall endeavor to show in my next lecture at present we have to observe that the experiment of federal union on a grand scale require as its condition _ first _ a vast extent of unoccupied country which could be settle without much warfare by man of the same race and speech and _ secondly _ on the part of the settler a rich inheritance of political training such as be afford by long age of self-government the atlantic coast of north america easily accessible to europe yet remote enough to be free from the political complication of the old world furnish the first of these condition : the history of the english people through fifty generation furnish the second it be through english self-government as i argue in my first lecture that england alone among the great nation of europe be able to find durable and self-supporting colony i have now to add that it be only england among all the great nation of europe that could send forth colonist capable of deal successfully with the difficult problem of form such a political aggregate as the united state have become for obviously the preservation of local self-government be essential to the very idea of a federal union without the town-meeting or its equivalent in some form or other the federal union would become _ ipso facto _ convert into a centralize imperial government should anything of this sort ever happen -- should american town ever come to be rule by prefect appoint at washington and should american state ever become like the administrative department of france or even like the county of england at the present day -- then the time will have come when man may safely predict the break-up of the american political system by reason of its overgrown dimension and the diversity of interest between its part state so unlike one another as maine and louisiana and californium can not be hold together by the stiff bond of a centralize government the durableness of the federal union lie in its flexibility and it be this flexibility which make it the only kind of government accord to modern idea that be permanently applicable to a whole continent if ¸ the united state be to-day a consolidated republic like france recent event in californium might have disturb the peace of the country but in the federal union if californium as a state sovereign within its own sphere adopt a grotesque constitution that aim at infringe on the rights of capitalist the other state be not directly affect they may disapprove but they have neither the right nor the desire to interfere meanwhile the law of nature quietly operate to repair the blunder capital flow away from californium and the business of the state be damage until presently the ignorant demagogue lose favor the silly constitution become a dead-letter and its formal repeal begin to be talk of not the smallest ripple of excitement disturb the profound peace of the country at large it be in this complete independence that be preserve by every state in all matter save those in which the federal principle itself be concern that we find the surest guaranty of the permanence of the american political system obviously no race of man save the race to which habit of self-government and the skilful use of political representation have come to be as second nature could ever have succeed in found such a system yet even by man of english race work with out let or hindrance from any foreign source and with the better part of a continent at they disposal for a field to work in so great a political problem as that of the american union have not be solve without much toil and trouble the great puzzle of civilization -- how to secure permanent concert of action without sacrifice independence of action -- be a puzzle which have tax the ingenuity of american as well as of older aryan people in the year 1788 when we federal union be complete the problem have already occupy the mind of american statesman for a century and a half -- that be to say ever since the english settlement of massachusett in 1643 a new england confederation be form between massachusett and connecticut together with plymouth since merge in massachusett and new haven since merge in connecticut the confederation be form for defense against the french in canada the dutch on the hudson river and the indian but owe simply to the inequality in the size of these colony -- massachusett more than outweigh the other three combine -- the practical working of this confederacy be never very successful in 1754 just before the outbreak of the great war which drive the french from america a general congress of the colony be hold at albany and a comprehensive scheme of union be propose by benjamin franklin but nothing come of the project at that time the commercial rivalry between the colony and they dispute over boundary line be then quite like the similar phenomenon with which europe have so long be familiar in 1756 georgium and south carolina actually come to blow over the navigation of the savannah river the idea that the thirteen colony could ever overcome they mutual jealousy so far as to unite in a single political body be receive at that time in england with a derision like that which a proposal for a permanent federation of european state would excite in many mind to-day it be confidently predict that if the common allegiance to the british crown be once withdraw the colony would forthwith proceed to destroy themselves with internecine war in fact however it be the shake off of allegiance to the british crown and the common trial and suffering of the war of independence that at last weld the colony together and make a federal union possible as it be the union be consummate only by degree by the article of confederation agree on by congress in 1777 but not adopt by all the state until 1781 the federal government act only upon the several state government and not directly upon individual there be no federal judiciary for the decision of constitutional question arise out of the relation between the state and the congress be not provide with any efficient means of raise a revenue or of enforce its legislative decree under such a government the difficulty of insure concerted action be so great that but for the transcendent personal quality of washington the bungling mismanagement of the british ministry and the timely aid of the french fleet the war of independence would most likely have end in failure after the independence of the colony be acknowledge the formation of a more perfect union be see to be the only method of secure peace and make a nation which should be respect by foreign power and so in 1788 after much discussion the present constitution of the united state be adopt -- a constitution which satisfy very few people at the time and which be from begin to end a series of compromise yet which have prove in its work a masterpiece of political wisdom the first great compromise answer to the initial difficulty of secure approximate equality of weight in the federal council between state of unequal size the simple device by which this difficulty be at last surmount have prove effectual although the inequality between the state have greatly increase to-day the population of new york be more than eighty time that of nevada in area the state of rhode island be smaller than montenegro while the state of texa be larger than the austrian empire with bavarium and würtemberg throw in yet new york and nevada rhode island and texa each send two senator to washington while on the other hand in the lower house each state have a number of representative proportion to its population the upper house of congress be therefore a federal while the lower house be a national body and the government be bring into direct contact with the people without endanger the equal rights of the several state the second great compromise of the american constitution consist in the series of arrangement by which sovereignty be divide between the state and the federal government in all domestic legislation and jurisdiction civil and criminal in all matter relate to tenure of property marriage and divorce the fulfilment of contract and the punishment of malefactor each separate state be as completely a sovereign state as france or great britain in speak to a british audience a concrete illustration may not be superfluous if a criminal be condemn to death in pennsylvanium the royal prerogative of pardon reside in the governor of pennsylvanium : the president of the united state have no more authority in the case than the czar of russium nor in civil case can a appeal lie from the state court to the supreme court of the united state save where express provision have be make in the constitution within its own sphere the state be supreme the chief attribute of sovereignty with which the several state have part be the coining of money the carrying of mail the imposition of tariff due the grant of patent and copyright the declaration of war and the maintenance of a navy the regular army be support and control by the federal government but each state maintain its own militia which it be bind to use in case of internal disturbance before call upon the central government for aid in time of war however these militia come under the control of the central government thus every american citizen live under two government the function of which be clearly and intelligibly distinct to insure the stability of the federal union thus form the constitution create a system of united state court extend throughout the state empower to define the boundary of federal authority and to enforce its decision by federal power this omnipresent federal judiciary be undoubtedly the most important creation of the statesman who frame the constitution the closely-knit relation which it establish between the state contribute powerfully to the growth of a feeling of national solidarity throughout the whole country the united state today cling together with a coherency far greater than the coherency of any ordinary federation or league yet the primary aspect of the federal constitution be undoubtedly that of a permanent league in which each state while retain its domestic sovereignty intact renounce forever its right to make war upon its neighbor and relegate its international interest to the care of a central council in which all the state be alike represent and a central tribunal endowed with purely judicial function of interpretation it be the first attempt in the history of the world to apply on a grand scale to the relation between state the same legal method of procedure which as long apply in all civilized country to the relation between individual have render private warfare obsolete and it be so far successful that during a period of seventy-two year in which the united state increase fourfold in extent tenfold in population and more than tenfold in wealth and power the federal union maintain a state of peace more profound than the _ pax romana _ twenty year ago this unexampled state of peace be suddenly interrupt by a tremendous war which in its result however have serve only to bring out with fresh emphasis the pacific implication of federalism with the eleven revolt state at first completely conquer and then reinstate with full rights and privilege in the federal union with they people accept in good faith the result of the contest with they leader not execute as traitor but admit again to seat in congress and in the cabinet and with all this accomplish without any violent constitutional change -- i think we may fairly claim that the strength of the pacific implication of federalism have be more strikingly demonstrate than if there have be no war at all certainly the world never behold such a spectacle before in my next and conclude lecture i shall return to this point while sum up the argument and illustrate the part play by the english race in the general history of civilization iii _ manifest destiny _ among the legend of we late civil war there be a story of a dinner-party give by the american reside in pari at which be propound sundry toast concern not so much the past and present as the expect glory of the great american nation in the general character of these toast geographical consideration be very prominent and the principal fact which seem to occupy the mind of the speaker be the unprecedented _ bigness _ of we country here be to the united state say the first speaker bound on the north by british america on the south by the gulf of mexico on the east by the atlantic and on the west by the pacific ocean but say the second speaker this be far too limit a view of the subject : in assign we boundary we must look to the great and glorious future which be prescribe for we by the manifest destiny of the anglo-saxon race here be to the united state -- bound on the north by the north pole on the south by the south pole on the east by the rise and on the west by the setting sun emphatic applause greet this aspiring prophecy but here arise the third speaker -- a very serious gentleman from the far west if we be go say this truly patriotic american to leave the historic past and present and take we manifest destiny into the account why restrict ourselves within the narrow limit assign by we fellow-countryman who have just sit down i give you the united state -- bound on the north by the aurora boreali on the south by the precession of the equinox on the east by the primeval chaos and on the west by the day of judgment i offer this anecdote at the outset by way of self-defence inasmuch as i shall by and by have myself to introduce some consideration concern the future of we country and of what some people without the fear of mr freeman before they eye call the anglo-saxon race and if it should happen to strike you that my calculation be unreasonably large i hope you will remember that they be quite modest after all when compare with some other the manifest destiny of the anglo-saxon race and the huge dimension of we country be favorite topic with fourth-of-july orator but they be none the less interesting on that account when consider from the point of view of the historian to be a citizen of a great and grow state or to belong to one of the dominant race of the world be no doubt a legitimate source of patriotic pride though there be perhaps a equal justification for such a feeling in be a citizen of a tiny state like holland which in spite of its small dimension have nevertheless achieve so much -- fight at one time the battle of freedom for the world produce statesman like william and barneveldt general like maurice scholar like erasmus and grotius and thinker like spinoza and take the lead even to-day in the study of christianity and in the interpretation of the bible but my course in the present lecture be determine by historical or philosophical rather than by patriotic interest and i shall endeavor to characterize and group event as impartially as if my home be at leyden in the old world instead of cambridge in the new first of all i shall take side with mr freeman in eschew altogether the word anglo-saxon the term be sufficiently absurd and misleading as apply in england to the old-english speech of we forefather or to that portion of english history which be include between the fifth and the eleventh century but in america it be frequently use not indeed by scholar but by popular writer and speaker in a still more loose and slovenly way in the war of independence we great-great-grandfather not yet have cease to think of themselves as englishman use to distinguish themselves as continental while the king 's troops be know as the british the quaint term continental long ago fall into disuse except in the slang phrase not worth a continental which refer to the debased condition of we currency at the close of the revolutionary war but american and british might still serve the purpose sufficiently whenever it be necessary to distinguish between the two great english nationality the term english however be so often use with sole reference to people and thing in england as to have become in some measure antithetical to american and when it be find desirable to include the two in a general expression one often hear in america the term anglo-saxon colloquially employ for this purpose a more slovenly use of language can hardly be imagine such a compound term as anglo-american might perhaps be logically defensible but that have already become restricted to the english-descended inhabitant of the united state and canada alone in distinction from spanish american and red indian it be never so use as to include englishman refrain from all such barbarism i prefer to call the english race by the name which it have always apply to itself from the time when it inhabit the little district of angeln on the baltic coast of sleswick down to the time when it have begin to spread itself over three great continent it be a race which have show a rare capacity for absorb slightly foreign element and mould they into conformity with a political type that be first work out through century of effort on british soil and this capacity it have show perhaps in a heighten degree in the peculiar circumstance in which it have be place in america the american have absorb considerable quantity of closely kindred european blood but he be rapidly assimilate it all and in he political habit and aptitude he remain as thoroughly english as he forefather in the day of de montfort or hampden or washington premising this we may go on to consider some aspect of the work which the english race have do and be do in the world and we need not feel discourage if in order to do justice to the subject we have to take we start far back in ancient history we shall begin it may be say somewhere near the primeval chaos and though we shall indeed stop short of the day of judgment we shall hope at all event to reach the millennium we eloquent friend of the paris dinner-party seem to have be strongly impressed with the excellence of enormous political aggregate we too approach the subject from a different point of view have be lead to see how desirable it be that self-governing group of man should be enable to work together in permanent harmony and on a great scale in this kind of political integration the work of civilization very largely consist we have see how in its most primitive form political society be make up of small self-governing group that be perpetually at war with one another now the process of change which we call civilization mean quite a number of thing but there be no doubt that on its political side it mean primarily the gradual substitution of a state of peace for a state of war this change be the condition precedent for all the other kind of improvement that be connote by such a term as civilization manifestly the development of industry be largely dependent upon the cessation or restriction of warfare and furthermore as the industrial phase of civilization slowly supplant the military phase man 's character undergo though very slowly a corresponding change man become less inclined to destroy life or to inflict pain or -- to use the popular terminology which happen here to coincide precisely with that of the doctrine of evolution -- they become less _ brutal _ and more _ humane _ obviously then the prime feature of the process call civilization be the general diminution of warfare but we have see that a general diminution of warfare be render possible only by the union of small political group into larger group that be keep together by community of interest and that can adjust they mutual relation by legal discussion without come to blow in the precede lecture we consider this process of political integration as variously exemplify by community of hellenic of roman and of teutonic race and we see how manifold be the difficulty which the process have to encounter we see how the teuton -- at least in switzerland england and america -- have succeed best through the retention of local self-government combine with central representation we see how the roman fail of ultimate success because by weaken self-government they weaken that community of interest which be essential to the permanence of a great political aggregate we see how the greek after pass through they most glorious period in a state of chronic warfare have begin to achieve considerable success in form a pacific federation when they independent career be suddenly cut short by the roman conqueror this last example introduce we to a fresh consideration of very great importance it be not only that every progressive community have have to solve in one way or another the problem of secure permanent concert of action without sacrifice local independence of action but while engage in this difficult work the community have have to defend itself against the attack of other community in the case just cite of the conquest of greece by rome little harm be do perhaps but under different circumstance immense damage may have be do in this way and the nearer we go to the beginning of civilization the greater the danger at the dawn of history we see a few brilliant point of civilization surround on every side by a midnight blackness of barbarism in order that the pacific community may be able to go on do its work it must be strong enough and warlike enough to overcome its barbaric neighbor who have no notion whatever of keep peace this be another of the seeming paradox of the history of civilization that for a very long time the possibility of peace can be guarantee only through war obviously the permanent peace of the world can be secure only through the gradual concentration of the preponderant military strength into the hand of the most pacific community with infinite toil and trouble this point have be slowly gain by mankind through the circumstance that the very same political aggregation of small primitive community which make they less disposed to quarrel among themselves tend also to make they more than a match for the less coherent group of they more barbarous neighbor the same concert of action which tend towards internal harmony tend also towards external victory and both end be promote by the co-operation of the same set of cause but for a long time all the political problem of the civilized world be complicate by the fact that the community have to fight for its life we seldom stop to reflect upon the imminent danger from outside attack whether from surround barbarism or from neighbour civilization of lower type amid which the rich and high-toned civilization of greece and rome be develop when the king of persium undertake to reduce greece to the condition of a persian satrapy there be imminent danger that all the enormous fruition of greek thought in the intellectual life of the european world might have be nip in the bud and who can tell how often in prehistoric time some little gleam of civilization less bright and steady than this one have become may have be quench in slavery or massacre the greatest work which the roman perform in the world be to assume the aggressive against menacing barbarism to subdue it to tame it and to enlist its brute force on the side of law and order this be a murderous work and in do it the roman become excessively cruel but it have to be do by some one before you could expect to have great and peaceful civilization like we own the warfare of rome be by no means adequately explain by the theory of a deliberate immoral policy of aggression -- infernal i believe be the stronger adjective which dr draper use the aggressive war of rome be largely dictate by just such consideration as those which a century ago make it necessary for the english to put down the raid of the scotch highlander and which have since make it necessary for russium to subdue the caucasus it be not easy for a turbulent community to live next to a orderly one without continually stir up frontier disturbance which call for stern repression from the orderly community such consideration go far towards explain the military history of the roman and it be a history with which on the whole we ought to sympathize in its european relation that history be the history of the moving of the civilized frontier northward and eastward against the disastrous encroachment of barbarous people this great movement have on the whole be steadily keep up in spite of some apparent fluctuation in the fifth and sixth century of the christian era and it be still go on to-day it be a great gain for civilization when the roman overcome the keltiberian of spain and teach they good manners and the latin language and make it for they interest hereafter to fight against barbarian the third european peninsula be thus win over to the side of law and order danger now remain on the north the gaul have once sack the city of rome horde of teuton have lately menace the very heart of civilization but have be overthrow in murderous combat by caius marius another great teutonic movement lead by ariovistus now threaten to precipitate the whole barbaric force of south-eastern gaul upon the civilized world and so it occur to the prescient genius of caesar to be beforehand and conquer gaul and enlist all its giant barbaric force on the side of civilization this great work be as thoroughly do as anything that be ever do in human history and we ought to be thankful to caesar for it every day that we live the frontier to be defend against barbarism be now move away up to the rhine and be very much shorten but above all the gaul be make to feel themselves to be roman they country become one of the chief stronghold of civilization and of christianity and when the frightful shock of barbarism come -- the most formidable blow that have ever be direct by barbaric brute force against european civilization -- it be in gaul that it be repel and that its force be spend at the beginning of the fifth century a enormous horde of yellow mongolian know as hun pour down into europe with avowed intent to burn and destroy all the good work which rome have work in the world and terrible be the havoc they effect in the course of fifty year if attilum have carry he point it have be think that the work of european civilization might have have to be begin over again but near chálons-on-the-marne in the year 451 in one of the most obstinate struggle of which history preserve the record the career of the scourge of god be arrest and mainly by the prowess of gaul and of visigoth whom the genius of rome have tame that be the last day on which barbarism be able to contend with civilization on equal term it be no doubt a critical day for all future history and for its favourable issue we must largely thank the policy adopt by caesar five century before by the end of the eighth century the great power of the frank have become enlist in behalf of law and order and the roman throne be occupy by a frank -- the ablest man who have appear in the world since caesar 's death and one of the worthiest achievement of charle the great be the conquest and conversion of pagan germany which throw the frontier against barbarism eastward as far as the oder and make it so much the easier to defend europe in the thirteenth century this frontier be permanently carry forward to the vistulum by the teutonic knight who under commission from the emperor frederick ii overcome the heathen prussian and lithuanian and now it begin to be show how greatly the military strength of europe have increase in this same century batu the grandson of jinghi khan come down into europe with a horde of more than a million mongol and try to repeat the experiment of attilum batu penetrate as far as silesium and win a great battle at liegnitz in 1241 but in spite of he victory he have to desist from the task of conquer europe since the fifth century the physical power of the civilized world have grow immensely and the impetus of this barbaric invasion be mainly spend upon russium the growth of which it succeed in retard for more than two century finally since the sixteenth century we have see the russian redeem from they mongolian oppressor and rich in many of the element of a vigorous national life -- we have see the russian resume the aggressive in this conflict of age begin to do for central asia in some sort what the roman do for europe the frontier against barbarism which cæsar leave at the rhine have be carry eastward to the volga and be now advance even to the oxus the question have sometimes be raise whether it would be possible for european civilization to be seriously threaten by any future invasion of barbarism or of some lower type of civilization by barbarism certainly not : all the nomad strength of mongolian asia would throw itself in vain against the insuperable barrier constitute by russium but i have hear it quite seriously suggest that if some future attilum or jinghi be to wield as a unit the entire military strength of the four hundred million of chinese possess with some suddenly-conceived idea of conquer the world even as omar and abderrahman wield as a unit the newly-welded power of the saracen in the seventh and eighth century then perhaps a staggering blow might yet be deal against european civilization i will not waste precious time in consider this imaginary case further than to remark that if the chinese be ever go to try anything of this sort they can not afford to wait very long for within another century as we shall presently see they very number will be surpass by those of the english race alone by that time all the element of military predominance on the earth include that of simple numerical superiority will have be gather into the hand not merely of man of european descent in general but more specifically into the hand of the offspring of the teutonic tribe who conquer britain in the fifth century so far as the relation of civilization with barbarism be concerned to-day the only serious question be by what process of modification the barbarous race be to maintain they foothold upon the earth at all while once such people threaten the very continuance of civilization they now exist only on sufferance in this brief survey of the advance frontier of european civilization i have say nothing about the danger that have from time to time be threaten by the follower of mohamm -- of the overthrow of the saracen in gaul by the grandfather of charle the great or they overthrow at constantinople by the image-breaking leo of the great mediæval crusade or of the mischievous but futile career of the turk for if i be to attempt to draw this outline with anything like completeness i should have no room leave for the conclusion of my argument consider my position thus far as sufficiently illustrated let we go on to contemplate for a moment some of the effect of all this secular turmoil upon the political development of the progressive nation of europe i think we may safely lay it down as a large and general rule that all this prodigious warfare require to free the civilized world from peril of barbarian attack serve greatly to increase the difficulty of solve the great initial problem of civilization in the first place the turbulence thus arise be a serious obstacle to the formation of closely-coherent political aggregate as we see exemplify in the terrible convulsion of the fifth and sixth century and again in the ascendency acquire by the isolate feature of feudalism between the time of charle the great and the time of loui vi of france in the second place this perpetual turbulence be a serious obstacle to the preservation of popular liberty it be a very difficult thing for a free people to maintain its free constitution if it have to keep perpetually fight for its life the one-man-power less fit for carry on the peaceful pursuit of life be sure to be bring into the foreground in a state of endless warfare it be a still more difficult thing for a free people to maintain its free constitution when it undertake to govern a dependent people despotically as have be wont to happen when a portion of the barbaric world have be overcome and annex to the civilized world under the weight of these two difficulty combine the free institution of the ancient roman succumb and they government gradually pass into the hand of a kind of close corporation more despotic than anything else of the sort that europe have ever see this despotic character -- this tendency if you will pardon the phrase towards the _ asiaticization _ of european life -- be continue by inheritance in the roman church the influence of which be beneficent so long as it constitute a wholesome check to the isolate tendency of feudalism but begin to become noxious the moment these tendency yield to the centralize monarchical tendency in nearly all part of europe the asiaticize tendency of roman political life have become so powerful by the fourth century and have since be so powerfully propagate through the church that we ought to be glad that the teuton come into the empire as master rather than as subject as the germanic tribe get possession of the government in one part of europe after another they bring with they free institution again the political idea of the goth in spain of the lombard in italy and of the frank and burgundian in gaul be as distinctly free as those of the angle in britain but as the outcome of the long and uninterrupted turmoil of the middle age society throughout the continent of europe remain predominantly military in type and this fact greatly increase the tendency towards despotism which be bequeath by rome after the close of the thirteenth century the whole power of the church be finally throw into the scale against the liberty of the people and as the result of all these force combine we find that at the time when america be discover government be harden into despotism in all the great country of europe except england even in england the tendency towards despotism have begin to become quite conspicuous after the wholesale slaughter of the great baron and the confiscation of they estate which take place in the war of the rose the constitutional history of england during the tudor and stuart period be mainly the history of the persistent effort of the english sovereign to free himself from constitutional check as he brother sovereign on the continent be do but how different the result how enormous the political difference between william iii and loui xiv compare with the difference between henry viii and franci i the close of the seventeenth century which mark the culmination of the asiaticize tendency in europe see despotism both political and religious firmly establish in france and spain and italy and in half of germany while the rest of germany seem to have exhaust itself in the attempt to throw off the incubus but in england this same epoch see freedom both political and religious establish on so firm a foundation as never again to be shake never again with impunity to be threaten so long as the language of locke and milton and sydney shall remain a living speech on the lip of man now this wonderful difference between the career of popular liberty in england and on the continent be due no doubt to a complicated variety of cause one or two of which i have already seek to point out in my first lecture i allude to the curious combination of circumstance which prevent anything like a severance of interest between the upper and the lower rank of society and something be also say about the feebleness of the grasp of imperial rome upon britain compare with its grasp upon the continent of europe but what i wish now to point out -- since we be look at the military aspect of the subject -- be the enormous advantage of what we may call the _ strategic position _ of england in the long mediæval struggle between civilization and barbarism in professor stubb 's admirable collection of charter and document illustrative of english history we read that on the 6th of July -lrb- 1264 -rrb- the whole force of the country be summon to london for the 3d of August to resist the army which be come from france under the queen and she son edmund _ the invade fleet be prevent by the weather from sailing until too late in the season _ the papal legate guy foulquoi who soon after become clement iv threaten the baron with excommunication but the bull contain the sentence be take by the man of dover as soon as it arrive and be throw into the sea -lrb- 15 -rrb- as i read this i think of the sturdy man of connecticut beat the drum to prevent the reading of the royal order of jame ii deprive the colony of the control of its own militia and feel with pride that the indomitable spirit of english liberty be alike indomitable in every land where man of english race have set they foot as master but as the success of american in withstand the unconstitutional pretension of the crown be greatly favor by the barrier of the ocean so the success of englishman in defy the enemy of they freedom have no doubt be greatly favor by the barrier of the british channel the war between henry iii and the baron be a event in english history no less critical than the war between charle i and the parliament four century later and british and american alike have every reason to be thankful that a great french army be not able to get across the channel in August 1264 nor be this the only time when the insular position of england do goodly service in maintain its liberty and its internal peace we can not forget how lord howard of effingham aid also by the weather defeat the armada that boast itself invincible send to strangle freedom in its choose home by the most execrable and ruthless tyrant that europe have ever see a tyrant whose victory would have mean not simply the usurpation of the english crown but the establishment of the spanish inquisition at westminster hall nor can we forget with what longing eye the corsican barbarian who wield for mischief the force of france in 1805 look across from boulogne at the shore of the one european land that never in word or deed grant he homage but in these latter day england have have no need of stormy weather to aid the prowess of the sea-king who be she natural defender it be impossible for the thoughtful student of history to walk across trafalgar square and gaze on the image of the mightiest naval hero that ever live on the summit of he lofty column and guard by the royal lion look down towards the government-house of the land that he free from the dread of napoleonic invasion and towards that ancient church wherein the most sacred memory of english talent and english toil be cluster together -- it be impossible i say to look at this and not admire both the artistic instinct that devise so happy a symbolism and the rare good-fortune of we teutonic ancestor in secure a territorial position so readily defensible against the assault of despotic power but it be not merely in the simple facility of ward off external attack that the insular position of england be so serviceable this ease in ward off external attack have its most marked effect upon the internal polity of the nation it never become necessary for the english government to keep up a great standing army for purpose of external defense a navy be all-sufficient and there be this practical difference between a permanent army and a permanent navy both be originally design for purpose of external defense but the one can readily be use for purpose of internal oppression and the other can not nobody ever hear of a navy put up a empire at auction and knock down the throne of the world to a didius julianus when therefore a country be effectually screen by water from external attack it be screen in a way that permit its normal political development to go on internally without those manifold military hinderance that have ordinarily be so obstructive in the history of civilization hence we not only see why after the norman conquest have operate to increase its unity and its strength england enjoy a far greater amount of security and be far more peaceful than any other country in europe but we also see why society never assume the military type in england which it assume upon the continent we see how it be that the bond of feudalism be far looser here than elsewhere and therefore how it happen that nowhere else be the condition of the common people so good politically we now begin to see moreover how thoroughly professor stubb and mr freeman be justified in insist upon the fact that the political institution of the german of tacitus have have a more normal and uninterrupted development in england than anywhere else nowhere indeed in the whole history of the human race can we point to such a well-rounded and unbroken continuity of political life as we find in the thousand year of english history that have elapse since the victory of william the norman at senlac in england the free government of the primitive aryan have be to this day uninterruptedly maintain though everywhere lose or seriously impaired on the continent of europe except in remote scandinavium and impregnable switzerland but obviously if in the conflict of age between civilization and barbarism england have occupy such a inferior strategic position as that occupy by hungary or poland or spain if she territory have be liable once or twice in a century to be overrun by fanatical saracen or beastly mongol no such remarkable and quite exceptional result could have be achieve have duly fathom the significance of this strategic position of the english race while confine within the limit of the british island we be now prepare to consider the significance of the stupendous expansion of the english race which first become possible through the discovery and settlement of north america i say at the close of my first lecture that the victory of wolfe at quebec mark the greatest turning-point as yet discernible in all modern history at the first blush such a unqualified statement may have sound as if a american student of history be incline to attach a undue value to event that have happen upon he own soil after the survey of universal history which we have now take however i be fully prepare to show that the conquest of the north american continent by man of english race be unquestionably the most prodigious event in the political annals of man kind let we consider for a moment the cardinal fact which this english conquest and settlement of north america involve chronologically the discovery of america coincide precisely with the close of the middle age and with the opening of the drama of what be call _ modern _ history the coincidence be in many way significant the close of the middle age -- as we have see -- be characterize by the increase power of the crown in all the great country of europe and by strong symptom of popular restlessness in view of this increase power it be characterize also by the great protestant outbreak against the despotic pretension of the church which once in its antagonism to the rival temporal power have befriend the liberty of the people but now -lrb- especially since the death of boniface viii -rrb- seek to enthrall they with a tyranny far worse than that of irresponsible king or emperor as we have see aryan civilization in europe struggle for many century to prove itself superior to the assault of outer barbarism so here we find a decisive struggle beginning between the antagonist tendency which have grow up in the midst of this civilization have at length win the privilege of live without risk of slaughter and pillage at the hand of saracen or mongol the question now arise whether the people of europe should go on and apply they intelligence freely to the problem of make life as rich and fruitful as possible in varied material and spiritual achievement or should fall forever into the barren and monotonous way of living and thinking which have always distinguish the half-civilized population of asia this -- and nothing less than this i think -- be the practical political question really at stake in the sixteenth century between protestantism and catholicism holland and england enter the list in behalf of the one solution of this question while spain and the pope defend the other and the issue be fight out on european soil as we have see with vary success but the discovery of america now come to open up a enormous region in which whatever seed of civilization should be plant be sure to grow to such enormous dimension as by and by to exert a controlling influence upon all such controversy it be for spain france and england to contend for the possession of this vast region and to prove by the result of the struggle which kind of civilization be endowed with the higher and sturdier political life the race which here should gain the victory be clearly destine hereafter to take the lead in the world though the rival power could not in those day fully appreciate this fact they who found colony in america as trading-station or military outpost probably do not foresee that these colony must by and by become imperial state far greater in physical mass than the state which plant they it be not likely that they be philosopher enough to foresee that this prodigious physical development would mean that the political idea of the parent state should acquire a hundred-fold power and seminal influence in the future work of the world it be not until the american resolution that this begin to be dimly realize by a few prescient thinker it be by no means so fully realize even now that a clear and thorough-going statement of it have not somewhat a air of novelty when the highly-civilized community represent the ripest political idea of england be plant in america remove from the manifold and complicate check we have just be study in the history of the old world the growth be portentously rapid and steady there be no attila now to stand in the way -- only a philip or a pontiac the assault of barbarism constitute only a petty annoyance as compare with the conflict of age which have go on in europe there be no occasion for society to assume a military aspect principle of self-government be at once put into operation and no one thought of call they in question when the neighbouring civilization of inferior type -- i allude to the french in canada -- begin to become seriously troublesome it be strike down at a blow when the mother-country under the guidance of a ignorant king and short-sighted minister undertake to act upon the antiquated theory that the new community be merely group of trading-station the political bond of connection be sever yet the war which ensue be not like the war which have but just now be so gloriously end by the victory of wolfe it be not a struggle between two different people like the french of the old regime and the english each represent antagonistic theory of how political life ought to be conduct but like the baron ' war of the thirteenth century and the parliament 's war of the seventeenth it be a struggle sustain by a part of the english people in behalf of principle that time have show to be equally dear to all and so the issue only make it apparent to a astonished world that instead of _ one _ there be now _ two england _ alike prepare to work with might and main toward the political regeneration of mankind let we consider now to what conclusion the rapidity and unabated steadiness of the increase of the english race in america must lead we as we go on to forecast the future carlyle somewhere speak slightingly of the fact that the american double they number every twenty year as if to have forty million dollar-hunter in the world be any better than to have twenty million dollar-hunter the implication that american be nothing but dollar-hunter and be thereby distinguishable from the rest of mankind would not perhaps bear too elaborate scrutiny but during the present lecture we have be consider the gradual transfer of the preponderance of physical strength from the hand of the war-loving portion of the human race into the hand of the peace-loving portion -- into the hand of the dollar-hunter if you please but out of the hand of the scalp-hunter obviously to double the number of a pre-eminently industrious peaceful orderly and free-thinking community be somewhat to increase the weight in the world of the tendency that go towards make community free and orderly and peaceful and industrious so that from this point of view the fact we be speak of be well worth consider even for its physical dimension i do not know whether the united state could support a population everywhere as dense as that of belgium so i will suppose that with ordinary improvement in cultivation and in the industrial art we might support a population half as dense as that of belgium -- and this be no doubt a extremely moderate supposition now a very simple operation in arithmetic will show that this mean a population of fifteen hundred million or more than the population of the whole world at the present date another very simple operation in arithmetic will show that if we be to go on double we number even once in every twenty-five year we should reach that stupendous figure at about the close of the twentieth century -- that be in the day of we great-greatgrandchildren i do not predict any such result for there be discernible economic reason for believe that there will be a diminution in the rate of increase the rate must nevertheless continue to be very great in the absence of such cause as formerly retard the growth of population in europe we modern war be hideous enough no doubt but they be short they be settle with a few heavy blow and the loss of life and property occasion by they be but trifle when compare with the awful ruin and desolation work by the perpetual and protracted contest of antiquity and of the middle age chronic warfare both private and public periodic famine and sweeping pestilence like the black death -- these be the thing which formerly shorten human life and keep down population in the absence of such cause and with the abundant capacity of we country for feed its people i think it a extremely moderate statement if we say that by the end of the next century the english race in the united state will number at least six or seven hundred million it use to be say that so huge a people as this could not be keep together as a single national aggregate -- or if keep together at all could only be so by means of a powerful centralized government like that of ancient rome under the emperor i think we be now prepare to see that this be a great mistake if the roman empire could have possess that political vitality in all its part which be secure to the united state by the principle of equal representation and of limited state sovereignty it might well have defy all the shock which tribally-organized barbarism could ever have direct against it as it be its strong centralized government do _ not _ save it from political disintegration one of its weakest political feature be precisely this -- that its strong centralized government be a kind of close corporation govern a score of province in its own interest rather than in the interest of the provincial in contrast with such a system as that of the roman empire the skilfully elaborate american system of federalism appear as one of the most important contribution that the english race have make to the general work of civilization the work out of this feature in we national constitution by hamilton and madison and they associate be the finest specimen of constructive statesmanship that the world have ever see not that these statesman originate the principle but they give form and expression to the principle which be latent in the circumstance under which the group of american colony have grow up and which suggest itself so forcibly that the clear vision of these thinker do not fail to seize upon it as the fundamental principle upon which alone could the affair of a great people spread over a vast continent be keep in a condition approach to something like permanent peace state broadly so as to acquire somewhat the force of a universal proposition the principle of federalism be just this : -- that the people of a state shall have full and entire control of they own domestic affair which directly concern they only and which they will naturally manage with more intelligence and with more zeal than any distant govern body could possibly exercise but that as regard matter of common concern between a group of state a decision shall in every case be reach not by brutal warfare or by weary diplomacy but by the systematic legislation of a central government which represent both state and people and whose decision can always be enforce if necessary by the combined physical power of all the state this principle in various practical application be so familiar to american to-day that we seldom pause to admire it any more than we stop to admire the air which we breathe or the sun which give we light and life yet i believe that if no other political result than this could to-day be point out as come from the colonization of america by englishman we should still be justify in regard that event as one of the most important in the history of mankind for obviously the principle of federalism as thus broadly state contain within itself the seed of permanent peace between nation and to this glorious end i believe it will come in the fulness of time and now we may begin to see distinctly what it be that the american government fight for in the late civil war -- a point which at the time be by no means clearly apprehend outside the united state we use to hear it often say while that war be go on that we be fight not so much for the emancipation of the negro as for the maintenance of we federal union and i well remember that to many who be burn to see we country purge of the folly and iniquity of negro slavery this use to seem like take a low and unrighteous view of the case from the stand-point of universal history it be nevertheless the correct and proper view the emancipation of the negro as a incidental result of the struggle be a priceless gain which be greet warmly by all right-minded people but deeper down than this question far more subtly interweave with the innermost fiber of we national well-being far heavier laden too with weighty consequence for the future weal of all mankind be the question whether this great pacific principle of union join with independence should be overthrow by the first deep-seated social difficulty it have to encounter or should stand as a example of priceless value to other age and to other land the solution be well worth the effort it cost there have be many useless war but this be not one of they for more than most war that have be it be fight in the direct interest of peace and the victory so dearly purchase and so humanely use be a earnest of future peace and happiness for the world the object therefore for which the american government fight be the perpetual maintenance of that peculiar state of thing which the federal union have create -- a state of thing in which throughout the whole vast territory over which the union hold sway question between state like question between individual must be settle by legal argument and judicial decision and not by wager of battle far better to demonstrate this point once for all at whatever cost than to be burden hereafter like the state of europe with frontier fortress and stand army and all the barbaric apparatus of mutual suspicion for so great a end do this most pacific people engage in a obstinate war and never do any war so thoroughly illustrate how military power may be wield when necessary by a people that have pass entirely from the military into the industrial stage of civilization the event falsify all the prediction that be draw from the contemplation of society less advanced politically it be think that so peaceful a people could not raise a great army on demand yet within a twelvemonth the government have raise five hundred thousand man by voluntary enlistment it be think that a territory involve military operation at point as far apart as pari and moscow could never be thoroughly conquer yet in April 1865 the federal army might have inarch from end to end of the gulf state without meet any force to oppose they it be think that the maintenance of a great army would beget a military temper in the american and lead to manifestation of bonapartism -- domestic usurpation and foreign aggression yet the moment the work be do the great army vanish and a force of twenty-five thousand man be find sufficient for the military need of the whole country it be think that eleven state which have struggle so hard to escape from the federal tie could not be re-admit to voluntary co-operation in the general government but must henceforth be hold as conquered territory -- a most dangerous experiment for any free people to try yet within a dozen year we find the old federal relation resume in all they completeness and the disunion party powerless and discredit in the very state where once it have work such mischief nay more we even see a curiously dispute presidential election in which the vote of the southern state be give almost with unanimity to one of the candidate decide quietly by a court of arbitration and we see a universal acquiescence in the decision even in spite of a general belief that a extraordinary combination of legal subtlety result in adjudge the presidency to the candidate who be not really elect such have be the result of the first great attempt to break up the federal union in america it be not probable that another attempt can ever be make with anything like a equal chance of success here be eleven state geographically contiguous govern by group of man who for half a century have pursue a well-defined policy in common unite among themselves and mark off from most of the other state by a difference far more deeply root in the groundwork of society than any mere economic difference -- the difference between slave-labour and free-labour these eleven state moreover hold such a economic relationship with england that they count upon compelling the naval power of england to be use in they behalf and finally it have not yet be demonstrate that the maintenance of the federal union be something for which the great mass of the people would cheerfully fight never could the experiment of secession be try apparently under fairer auspices yet how tremendous the defeat it be a defeat that work conviction -- the conviction that no matter how grave the political question that may arise hereafter they must be settle in accordance with the legal method the constitution have provide and that no state can be allow to break the peace it be the thoroughness of this conviction that have so greatly facilitate the reinstatement of the revolted state in they old federal relation and the good sense and good faith with which the southern people in spite of the chagrin of defeat have accept the situation and act upon it be something unprecedented in history and call for the warmest sympathy and admiration on the part of they brethren of the north the federal principle in america have pass through this fearful ordeal and come out stronger than ever and we trust it will not again be put to so severe a test but with this principle unimpaired there be no reason why any further increase of territory or of population should overtask the resource of we government in the united state of america a century hence we shall therefore doubtless have a political aggregation immeasurably surpass in power and in dimension any empire that have as yet exist but we must now consider for a moment the probable future career of the english race in other part of the world the colonization of north america by englishman have its direct effect upon the eastern as well as upon the western side of the atlantic the immense growth of the commercial and naval strength of england between the time of cromwell and the time of the elder pitt be intimately connect with the colonization of north america and the establishment of plantation in the west indy these circumstance react powerfully upon the material development of england multiply manifold the dimension of she foreign trade increase proportionately she commercial marine and give she in the eighteenth century the dominion over the sea endow with this maritime supremacy she have with a unerring instinct proceed to seize upon the key of empire in all part of the world -- gibraltar malta the isthmus of suez aden ceylon the coast of australium island after island in the pacific -- every station in short that command the pathway of maritime commerce or guard the approach to the barbarous country which she be begin to regard as in some way she natural heritage any well-filled album of postage-stamp be a eloquent commentary on this maritime supremacy of england it be enough to turn one 's head to look over she colonial blue-book the natural outcome of all this overflow vitality it be not difficult to foresee no one can carefully watch what be go on in africa to-day without recognize it as the same sort of thing which be go on in north america in the seventeenth century and it can not fail to bring forth similar result in course of time here be a vast country rich in beautiful scenery and in resource of timber and mineral with a salubrious climate and fertile soil with great navigable river and inland lake which will not much longer be leave in control of tawny lion and long-eared elephant and negro fetich-worshipper already five flourish english state have be establish in the south besides the settlement on the gold coast and those at aden command the red sea english explorer work they way with infinite hardship through its untravelled wild and track the course of the congo and the nile as they forefather track the potomac and the hudson the work of la salle and smith be find its counterpart in the labor of baker and livingstone who can doubt that within two or three century the african continent will be occupy by a mighty nation of english descent and cover with populous city and flourish farm with railroad and telegraph and other device of civilization as yet undreamed of if we look next to australia we find a country of more than two-third the area of the united state with a temperate climate and immense resource agricultural and mineral -- a country sparsely people by a race of irredeemable savage hardly above the level of brute here england within the present century have plant six greatly thriving state concern which i have not time to say much but one fact will serve as a specimen when in america we wish to illustrate in one word the wonderful growth of we so-called north-western state we refer to chicago -- a city of half-a-million inhabitant stand on a spot which fifty year ago be a uninhabited marsh in australium the city of melbourne be found in 1837 the year when the present queen of england begin to reign and the state of which it be the capital be hence call victorium this city now -lrb- 16 -rrb- just forty-three year old have a population half as great as that of chicago have a public library of 200000 volume and have a university with at least one professor of world-wide renown when we see by the way within a period of five year and at such remote point upon the earth 's surface such erudite and ponderous work in the english language issue from the press as those of professor hearn of melbourne of bishop colenso of natal and of mr hubert bancroft of san francisco -- even such a little commonplace fact as this be fraught with wonderful significance when we think of all that it imply then there be new zealand with its climate of perpetual spring where the english race be now multiply faster than anywhere else in the world unless it be in texa and minnesota and there be in the pacific ocean many rich and fertile spot where we shall very soon see the same thing go on it be not necessary to dwell upon such consideration as these it be enough to point to the general conclusion that the work which the english race begin when it colonize north america be destine to go on until every land on the earth 's surface that be not already the seat of a old civilization shall become english in its language in its political habit and tradition and to a predominant extent in the blood of its people the day be at hand when four-fifth of the human race will trace its pedigree to english forefather as four-fifth of the white people in the united state trace they pedigree to-day the race thus spread over both hemisphere and from the rise to the setting sun will not fail to keep that sovereignty of the sea and that commercial supremacy which it begin to acquire when england first stretch its arm across the atlantic to the shore of virginium and massachusett the language speak by these great community will not be sunder into dialect like the language of the ancient roman but perpetual intercommunication and the universal habit of reading and write will preserve its integrity and the world 's business will be transact by english-speaking people to so great a extent that whatever language any man may have learn in he infancy he will find it necessary sooner or later to learn to express he thought in english and in this way it be by no means improbable that as grimm the german and candolle the frenchman long since foretell the language of shakespeare may ultimately become the language of mankind in view of these consideration as to the stupendous future of the english race do it not seem very probable that in due course of time europe -- which have learn some valuable lesson from america already -- will find it worth while to adopt the lesson of federalism probably the european state in order to preserve they relative weight in the general polity of the world will find it necessary to do so in that most critical period of american history between the winning of independence and the framing of the constitution one of the strongest of the motive which lead the confederated state to sacrifice part of they sovereignty by enter into a federal union be they keen sense of they weakness when take severally in physical strength such a state as massachusett at that time amount to little more than hamburg or breman but the thirteen state take together make a nation of respectable power even the wonderful progress we have make in a century have not essentially change this relation of thing we greatest state new york take singly be about the equivalent of belgium we weakest state nevada would scarcely be a match for tha county of dorset yet the united state take together be probably at this moment the strongest nation in the world now a century hence with a population of six hundred million in the united state and a hundred and fifty million in australium and new zealand to say nothing of the increase of power in other part of the english-speaking world the relative weight will be very different from what they be in 1788 the population of europe will not increase in anything like the same proportion and a very considerable part of the increase will be transfer by emigration to the english-speaking world outside of europe by the end of the twentieth century such nation as france and germany can only claim such a relative position in the political world as holland and switzerland now occupy they greatness in thought and scholarship in industrial and aesthetic art will doubtless continue unabated but they political weight will severally have come to be insignificant and as we now look back with historic curiosity to the day when holland be navally and commercially the rival of england so people will then need to be remind that there be actually once a time when little france be the most powerful nation on the earth it will then become as desirable for the state of europe to enter into a federal union as it be for the state of north america a century ago it be only by thus adopt the lesson of federalism that europe can do away with the chance of useless warfare which remain so long as its different state own no allegiance to any common authority war as we have see be with barbarous race both a necessity and a favorite occupation as long as civilization come into contact with barbarism it remain a too frequent necessity but as between civilized and christian nation it be a wretched absurdity one sympathize keenly with war such as that which russium have lately conclude for set free a kindred race endowed with capacity for progress and for humble the worthless barbarian who during four century have work such incalculable damage to the european world but a sanguinary struggle for the rhine frontier between two civilized christian nation who have each enough work to do in ithe world without engage in such a strife as this will i be sure be by and by condemn by the general opinion of mankind such question will have to be settle by discussion in some sort of federal council or parliament if europe would keep pace with america in the advance towards universal law and order all will admit that such a state of thing be a great desideratum : let we see if it be really quite so utopian as it may seem at the first glance no doubt the lord who dwell in haddon hall in the fifteenth century would have think it very absurd if you have tell he that within four hundred year it would not be necessary for country gentleman to live in great stone dungeon with little cross-barred window and loophole from which to shoot at people go by yet to-day a country gentleman in some part of massachusett may sleep securely without lock he front-door we have not yet do away with robbery and murder but we have at least make private warfare illegal we have array public opinion against it to such a extent that the police-court usually make short shrift for the misguided man who try to wreak vengeance on he enemy be it too much to hope that by and by we may similarly put public warfare under the ban i think not already in america as wre have see it have become customary to deal with question between state just as we would deal with question between individual this we have see to be the real purport of american federalism to have establish such a system ovrer one great continent be to have make a very good beginning towards establish it over the world to establish such a system in europe will no doubt be difficult for here we have to deal with a immense complication of prejudice intensify by linguistic and ethnological difference nevertheless the pacific pressure exert upon europe by america be become so great that it will doubtless before long overcome all these obstacle i refer to the industrial competition between the old and the new world which have become so conspicuous within the last ten year agriculturally minnesota nebraska and kansa be already formidable competitor with england france and germany but this be but the begin it be but the first spray from the tremendous wave of economic competition that be gather in the mississippus valley by and by when we shameful tariff -- falsely call protective -- shall have be do away with and we manufacturer shall produce superior article at less cost of raw material we shall begin to compete with european country in all the market of the world and the competition in manufacture will become as keen as it be now begin to be in agriculture this time will not be long in come for we tariff-system have already begin to be discuss and in the light of we present knowledge discussion mean its doom bear of crass ignorance and self-defeating greed it can not bear the light when this curse to american labor -- scarcely less blighting than the curse of negro slavery -- shall have be once remove the economic pressure exert upon europe by the united state will soon become very great indeed it will not be long before this economic pressure will make it simply impossible for the state of europe to keep up such military armament as they be now maintain the disparity between the united state with a standing army of only twenty-five thousand man withdraw from industrial pursuit and the state of europe with they standing army amount to four million of man be something that can not possibly be keep up the economic competition will become so keen that european army will have to be disband the sword will have to be turn into ploughshare and _ thus _ the victory of the industrial over the military type of civilization will at last become complete but to disband the great army of europe will necessarily involve the force of the great state of europe into some sort of federal relation in which congress -- already hold on rare occasion -- will become more frequent in which the principle of international law will acquire a more definite sanction and in which the combined physical power of all the state will constitute -lrb- as it now do in america -rrb- a permanent threat against any state that dare to wish for selfish reason to break the peace in some such way as this i believe the industrial development of the english race outside of europe will by and by enforce federalism upon europe as regard the serious difficulty that grow out of prejudice attendant upon difference in language race and creed a most valuable lesson be furnished we by the history of switzerland i be incline to think that the greatest contribution which switzerland have make to the general progress of civilization have be to show we how such obstacle can be surmount even on a small scale to surmount they on a great scale will soon become the political problem of europe and it be america which have set the example and indicate the method thus we may foresee in general outline how through the gradual concentration of the preponderance of physical power into the hand of the most pacific community the wretched business of warfare must finally become obsolete all over the globe the element of distance be now fast become eliminate from political problem and the history of human progress politically will continue in the future to be what it have be in the past -- the history of the successive union of group of man into larger and more complex aggregate as this process go on it may after many more age of political experience become apparent that there be really no reason in the nature of thing why the whole of mankind should not constitute politically one huge federation -- each little group manage its local affair in entire independence but relegate all question of international interest to the decision of one central tribunal support by the public opinion of the entire human race i believe that the time will come when such a state of thing will exist upon the earth when it will be possible -lrb- with we friend of the paris dinner-party -rrb- to speak of the united state as stretch from pole to pole -- or with tennyson to celebrate the parliament of man and the federation of the world indeed only when such a state of thing have begin to be realize can civilization as sharply demarcate from barbarism be say to have fairly begin only then can the world be say to have become truly christian many age of toil and doubt and perplexity will no doubt pass by before such a desideratum be reach meanwhile it be pleasant to feel that the dispassionate contemplation of great mass of historical fact go far towards confirm we faith in this ultimate triumph of good over evil we survey begin with picture of horrid slaughter and desolation : it end with the picture of a world cover with cheerful homestead bless with a sabbath of perpetual peace -lrb- footnote
