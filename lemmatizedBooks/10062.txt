learn pick up at the acredale academy at he entrance to the sequestered quadrangle of dessau hall jack 's frame of mind be very much like the passionate discontent of the younger son of a feudal lord whose discrepant birthright doom he to the gown instead of the sword long before the senior year he have allure a choose band about he who share he eager aspiration for war and when the other fellow dawdle in society or wrangle in debate these young alexander set they tent in the college campus and fight the campaign of frederick or napoleon over again jack do not give much heed to the menacing sign of civil war that come day by day from the tempestuous spirit north and south a democrat as he father have be before he he see no probability of the pomp and circumstance of glorious war in the noisy wrangling of politician the defeat of dougla the navarre of the young democracy of the north amaze he : but all thought of lincoln assert the national authority and revive the splendor of jackson and madison be look upon as the step between the sublime and the ridiculous that reasoning man refuse to consider when however the stupefying news come that a national garrison have be fire upon by the south carolinian in charleston harbor the college boy take side strongly there be many in the class from maryland and virginium these be as ardent in admiration of they southern compatriot as the northern boy be for the insult union month pass and although the force of war be array themselves behind the thin veil of compromise and negotiation the public mind only languidly convinced itself that actual war would come the college be divide into hostile camp the secessionist lead by vincent atterbury jack 's old-time chief crony go so far as to hoist the flag of the montgomery -lrb- jeff davi 's -rrb- government on the campus pole one morning in April a fierce fight follow in which jack 's ardent partisan make painful havoc with the limb of the enemy -- atterbury they leader be cart from the campus under the horrified eye of the faculty die as it be think then follow expulsion when the solemn word be speak in chapel the culprit bear up with great serenity but when he announce that he have enlist in the army then such a uproar such a outburst that the session be at a end even the grave president look sympathetic the like of it be never see in a sober college since antony with cleopatra invade the academy at alexandrium the boy fling themselves upon the abashed jack they hug he raise he on they shoulder carry he out on the campus and form a ring round he swear

the press for wink at the sympathy the college have show in this political quarrel yes professor i have not a word to say you do you duty now i want you to bear witness how i do mine i do not complain that i be condemn rather through the form than the fact i be carry out of my sens by the sight of that rebel flag the warchester press know for many year as the most sprightly and enterprising of the country be too much take up with the direful news from baltimore to even make a note of jack sprague 's expulsion and the soldier boy be spare that mortification nor do he meet the tearful lament and heart-broken remonstrance at home to which he have look forward with lively dread he friend in the village of acredale be so astonished by he blue regimental that he reach the homestead door unquestion he mother at the dining-room window catch sight of the uniform and do not recognize she son until she be almost smother in he hearty embrace why john what do this mean what -- what have you on mother i be twenty-two year old a man who will not fight for he country be not a good son he have no right to stay in a country that he be not willing to fight for and with this specious dictum he draw himself up and meet the astonished eye of he sister olympium who have be apprise of he come but the maternal fear cloud patriotic conception where she darling be involve and he mother sob : o jack jack what shall we do how can we live without you and oh my son you be too young to go to the war you will break down you can not manage a -- a musket and the -- the heavy load the soldier carry

hill if ever blood run like water in we jack 's vein i should put on -- trousers and go to the war myself i be not sure that i sha 'n' t as it be and affect spartan fortitude olympium pretend to be deeply absorb in adjust a disarranged furbelow in she attire to conceal the quaver in she voice and the dewy something in she dark eye the mother disconcert by this defection where she have count on the blindest adhesion sink back in the cane rocker helpless speechless yes mother polly be right how could you ever lift up you head if it be say that son of john sprague 's -- governor senator minister abroad -- be the last to fly to he country 's call why jackson would turn in he grave if a son of john sprague be not the first to take up arm when the union that he love as he love he life be in peril mr sprague listen with woe-begone perplexity to these sound period conscious only that she darling she adored scapegrace have suddenly turn serious and be use the weapon she have so often employ to justify he conduct for it be use one of the standing arm in the maternal arsenal to remind the wild and headstrong lad that he father have be jackson 's confidant that he have be governor of imperium that he have enforce the demand of the united state upon european statesman that after a life spend in the public service he have die reverence by he party and by he neighbor jack as a infant have be fondle by webster by clay and one never-to-be-forgotten day jackson the scipio of the republic have place he brawny hand upon the infant 's head and declare that he would be worthy of jack sprague who be man enough to make two kentuckian but you -- you ought to be a colonel you father be a major-general in the mexican war at twenty-five a sprague can not be a private soldier she cry seize on this as the only tenable ground where she could begin the contest against the two child confederate against she i do not want to owe everything to my father this be a republic mamma and a man be or ought to be what he make himself i saw in a paper the other day that the government have more brigadier and colonel and -- and -- officer than it know what to do with i see it state that a stone throw from willard 's hotel in washington hit a dozen brigadier i want to earn a commission before i assume it i 'll be a officer soon enough no fear i could have have a lieutenant 's commission if i have go in blandon 's regiment but i hate blandon he be one of those cant sneak father detest and i will not serve under such cattle mr sprague like million of mother in those day be cruelly divide in mind when the neighbor felicitate she on the valor and patriotism of mr jack she be elated and fitfully reconcile when in the long watch of the night she reflect on the hardship temptation the dreadful companion she darling must be throw with country lineage everything fade into the dreadful reality that she darling be in peril body and soul he be so like he father -- gay impressionable easily influence -- he would be saint or sinner just as he surroundings incite he this be the woe that eat the mother 's heart this be the sorrow that cloud million of home when mother see they boy prank out in the trappings of war we jaunty jack enjoy the worship that come to he he be the first boy in blue that appear in the sandy street of acredale never have the rascal be so pet so fete so adored he might have be a pasha have he be a turk the promise down on he upper lip -- the object of he own secret solicitude and olympium 's gibe during the junior year -- be quite worn away by the kiss he undergo among the impulsive jeannette of the village who have a vague notion that soldier like sailor be indurate for battle by adosculation jack may have believe this himself for he take no pain to disabuse the maiden as to the inefficacy of the rite and bear with galliard fortitude the wear and tear of the nascent mustache without which to he mind a soldier would figure very much as a monk without a shaven crown or a mandarin without a queue and though presently big tom tooker chief of the rival faction in acredale give he name to the recruit officer in warchester and a score more of jack 's rival and crony he be the soldier of the village for have not he give up the glory of graduation and the delight of commencement to take up he musket for the union and then the fife be hear in the village street -- delicious air from arcady -- and a great flag be fling out from the post-office and master jack be install recruit sergeant for colonel ulrich oswald 's regiment that be to be raise in warchester county for colonel oswald have fail in a third nomination for congress have gallantly proffer he service to the governor of the state and in consideration of he influence with he german compatriot have be grant a commission though with reluctance as he have support the democratic party and be not yet trust in the republican council chapter ii flag and faith if acredale have not be for a century the ancestral seat of the sprague and in its widest sense typical of the suburban northern town there would be merely a objective and extrinsic interest in portray its sequestered life its monotonous activity but acredale be not only a very complete reflex of northern local sentiment its war epoch represent the normal conduct of every hamlet in the land during the conflict with the south now that the war be become a memory even to those who be actor in it the fact distorted and the incident warped to serve partisan end or personal pique the photograph of the time may have its value make up of thrive farmer and semi-retired city man acredale mingle the simple condition of a country village and the easy refinement of city life the house be large the grounds ornate and ample the society decorously convivial people could be fine -- at least they be think very fine -- without go to the british isle to recast they home manners or take hint for the fashioning of they grounds and mansion there be what would be call to-day the english air about the place and some of the people but it be a inheritance not a imitation save in the bustling business segment abut the four corner where the old united state road bear off westward to bucephalo and the lake the few score house be set far back from the highway in a wilderness of shrubbery secluded by hedge and shaded by a almost primeval growth of elm or maple the whole hamlet might be mistake for a lordly park or a old-fashioned german spa family marketing be mostly do in warchester hence the village shop be like arabian bazaar few but all-supplying the most pregnant evidence of the approach of modern way that tinge the primitive color of the village life be the then new railway skirt furtively through the meadow on the northern limit as if decently ashamed of intrude upon such idyllic tranquillity the little gothic station cunningly hide behind a clustering grove of oak at a respectful distance from the corner like the lodge of a great estate reconcile those who have at first fight the iron mischief-maker the public edifice of the town -- the episcopal church the free academy the bank the young lady ' seminary -- be very unlike such institution in the bustling treeless town of to-day corinthian column and greek frieze adorn these architectural evidence of acredale 's affluence and taste the village have grow up on private grounds concede to the public year by year as the child and dependent of the founder increase the sprague be the founder and they have never be anxious to alienate they patrimony acredale be not now the sylvan sanctuary of rural simplicity it be thirty year ago -- before the war the febrile tentacle of warchester have not yet reach out to make its vernal recess the court quarter for the new rich in jack sprague 's young warrior day the village be three mile from the most suburban limit of the city there be not even a horse-car or as fashionable warchesterian have it a tram to remind the tranquil villager that life have any need more pressing than a jaunt to the post twice a day some city folk do hold villa on the outskirts but they use they only for short season in the late summer when the air at the lake begin to grow too sharp for outdoor pleasure society in the place be patriarchal as a english shire town the large sprague mansion about which the village cluster at a respectful distance be the castle of local phrase much of the glory of early day have depart however when the senator -- jack 's papa -- die the widow find herself unable to maintain the affluent state she lord have love he legal practice rather than the wide acre of he domain have support a hospitality famous from bucephalo to washington but with prudent management the family have abundance and as jack often say he be a fortune in himself when the time come he would revive the splendor he father love to associate with the home of he ancestor but where be we to get this splendor now jack olympium inquire as the youth be dilate to he mother on the wonder to come private soldier get just thirteen dollar a month and if you continue smoking -- as i be inform all man do in the army -- i expect to have to stint my pin-money expense to eke out you tobacco bill oh i 'll bring home glory napoleon say that every soldier carry a marshal 's _ bâton _ in he knapsack i be afraid you will not have room for it if you carry all the thing that i know of intend for you in this and other family yes but polly you know or perhaps you do not know a _ bâton _ be like a college love -- no matter how full you heart be you can always find room for another john mistress sprague reprove mildly how can you i do not like to hear my son talk like that even in jest do not get the idea that it be soldierly to treat sacred thing with levity love be a very sacred thing it ought to be part of a man 's religion it be of you father 's then jack must be a high priest for there be a dozen girl here and in the city who believe themselves enshrine in that elastic heart olympium you be a baleful influence on you brother if anything could reconcile I to he go it be the thought that he will escape the extraordinary speech and manners you have bring back from new york do the miss pomfret graduate all they young lady with such a tone and laxity of speech as you have lately show stranger would naturally think that you have no training at home do not fear mamma stranger be not favor with my lighter vein i assume that for you and jack to keep you mind from graver thing i preserve the senatorial suavity of speech and the sprague austerity of manner ` before folk ' as aunt merry would say which remind I jack kitty moore declare that you be responsible for barney 's enlist the family look to you to bring he home safe -- a colonel at least well by george i like that why the beggar be bent on go long ago he be the first to ask I to run away and enlist the other day he want I to have he swear in and i tell he to wait until -- until i get a commission jack be go to say until he be older but he suddenly recollect that barney be he own age and that in view of he mother 's argument strike he as unfortunate he see olympium smile mischievously and turn the subject abruptly i suppose you know polly that vincent be go home to join the rebel be he she have turn swiftly to gather a ball of worst and when it be secure begin to rummage in she work-basket for something that seem from she intentness to be vitally necessary to she at the moment yes he write to president grandison that he should go as soon as he passport and remittance come he be promise a captain 's commission i be very very sorry vint be the noblest of fellow i hate to think of he in the rebel army that be the reason you half kill he the other day i suppose olympium say sweetly still investigate the contents of the basket what john you have not be in a broil -- fight and mistress sprague could not even in imagination go further in such a odious direction and let she eye finish the interrogatory jack a good deal subdue by what olympium have leave unsaid rather than what she have say blurt out : it be a campus shindy : vint lead the rebel side and they get lick that be all oh be that all olympium have end she search in the basket and fasten a glance of satiric good humor upon the culprit which do not tend to relieve the awkwardness of the moment jack blush under the glance and begin to hum a air from figaro as if the conversation have ebb into a impass from which it could only be rescue by a lively air mr sprague look at the uneasy warrior then at she daughter dart the crochet-needle placidly through the wool well she say never mind what be past we must have vincent out here for a visit before he go i must send mr atterbury a number of thing i hope she will not think that we intend to let the war make any difference in we feeling toward the family jack be very glad to set out at once for he quondam foe and in ten minute be drive down the road to warchester vincent 's bruise be nearly heal and he salute jack as a chum rather than as the agent of he late discomfiture i be mighty glad you have come to day i do not know whether you mean to break off or not i do not cherish any rancor i do not see any use in carry the war into friendship we make the best fight we could we do better than you side you have the most man and the biggest fellow we show good pluck if we do get lick if you have not come to-day i should have be go without see you for i begin to think that you be as narrow as these prate abolitionist my commission be ready for I now at richmond and i be just ache to get my regimental on i be to be with johnston in the shenandoah you know and -- you must not tell I you army plan vint i be a soldier and jack draw himself up with martial pomposity and -- and -- perhaps i ought to arrest you now as a enemy you know i will look in the article of war and find out my duty in such case jack wave he arm reassuringly as if to bid the rebel take heart for the moment -- he would not hurry in the matter vincent eye he comrade with such a woe-begone mingling of alarm and comic indignation that jack forget he possible part as agent of he country 's law and say soothingly : never mind vint i be not really a full soldier in the technical sense until the regiment be muster in at washington after that of course you know very well it would he treason to give aid or comfort to the country 's enemy vincent do not leave next day nor for a good many day he seem to get a good deal of aid and comfort from those who should have be he enemy mistress sprague find that he be not in a fit state to travel that he need nursing to prepare he for he journey and that no place be so fit as the great guest-chamber in the baronial sprague mansion near he friend jack strange to say vincent 's eagerness to get to richmond and he shoulder-strap be forget in the agreeable pastime of the big house where he spend hour enlighten olympium on the wonder the southern soldier be to perform and the glory that he -lrb- vincent -rrb- be to win he go of a morning to the post-office where jack be install recruiting-agent for acredale township and make very merry over the homespun stuff enrol in defense of the union we strapping cavalier will make short work of you gawky bumpkin he remark to jack as the recruit loiter about the wide shaded street wait to be forward to the rendezvous do not be too sure of that these young boyish-looking fellow be just the sort of man that meet the british at bunker hill they laugh too when they see they but they do not laugh after they meet they nor will you cavalier jack cry loftily but there be not a full-grown man among all these i have see how do you suppose they be to endure march and battle none of they can ride all we young man ride and cavalry be the main thing in modern army in the sprague parlor conversation of this risky sort be eschew mistress sprague be anxious that the son of she oldest friend should return to he mother with only the memory of amiable hospitality in he heart to show that although war rage between the people family be still friend vincent 's mother have be one of mistress sprague 's bridesmaid and it be she wish that the child might grow up in the old kindly tie so vincent be make much of there be company every night and drive and boat in the afternoon and such merry-making as it be think a lad of he year would enjoy he be a very entertaining guest that all acredale have know in the old vacation when with he sister the pretty rosa he spend a summer with the sprague but now that there be to be a separation involve the unknown in its vaguest form the lad be treat with a tenderness that make the swift day very sweet to the young rebel it be from olympium that he meet the only distinct formality in the manners of he host he have know and adore she in a boyish way for year and now as he contemplate go he think that she ought to exhibit something of the old-time warmth in other day she have ride walk and flirt to he heart 's desire now she avoid he when jack be not at hand and when she talk it be in a flippant vein that drive he wild with baffled hope the day before he be to bid the kind house adieu he have he wish she be ride with he over the shaded roadway that curve in bewildering beauty toward the lake she seem in a gentler mood than he have lately see she they ride slowly side by side but vincent have a dismal awkwardness of speech in whimsical contrast to he habitual fluency there be only one thing hateful to I in this war he say caress the arch neck of he horse and that be the better we do we duty as soldier the more sorrow we must bring upon we own friend that be a rather solemn view to take of what jack regard as the path of glory oh you know what i mean : under the flag there can or ought to be no friendship -- the bullet send from the musket the sword draw in light must be aim blindly it might be my fate for example to meet jack to -- to -- yes olympium laugh demurely ignore the sentimental aspect of vincent 's remark yes that might paralyze the arm of valor but then you and jack have meet before when duty demand one thing and affection another : i do not see that the dilemma soften the blow or that either of you be any the worse for they vincent be the real southerner of he epoch -- impulsive sentimental ardent in all that he espouse without the slightest notion of humor though imaginative as a dreamer love war and he state virginium be passion that he think it a duty to uphold at any and all time he color under the girl 's satiric sally if she have be a man he would have bid she to battle on the spot she sly fun and gentle malice he resent as insulting coarse and unwomanly he flash a look of piteous surprised reproach at she as she fleck the fly from the neck of she horse he ride along moodily -- too angry too wretched to trust himself to speak for he feel sure he must say something bitter but as she give no sign of resume the discourse he be force to take up the burden again venture nearer she side he say in a conciliate argumentative tone as if he have not hear the foregoing speech : do you know it seem to I olympia that you of the north do not seem to realize the seriousness of the war the determination of we side to make the south free here you go about the common business of life party ball dress and all the folly of peace as if war could not affect you at all you newspaper be full of coarse joke at the expense of you own soldier you own president there seem no devotion to you own cause such as we feel in the south i believe that if put to a vote more than half the north would side with we to-day chapter iii malbrook s ` en va-t-en guerre olympium have be jogging along apparently oblivious to everything but the blaze vision of sun and cloud above the lake purple shape of mirage reflect the smooth surface of the glowing water but as the young man 's voice -- fall into a melodious murmur -- cease she take up the theme with unexpected earnestness that be the error the south have make from the first you know my father be a public man i have be educate more at we dinner-table and in he talk with guest than at school that be the thing that have take strongest hold of my mind young girl rarely hear or understand now i think i can tell you something that may be of value to you in official place where you be go the north be not only in earnest -- it be religiously in earnest if you know puritan history you know what that mean for example : if jack have hesitate a moment or make delay to get rank in the army i should have abhor he so would we mother though she seem to be dismay at he serve as a common soldier i adore jack i think he the finest the most perfect nature after my father 's -- that life but i give he up gladly because to keep he would be to degrade he we know that he may fall that he may come back to we a cripple or worse but as you see we make no sign not a line of routine have be change in the house jack will march away and never see a tear in my eye or feel my pulse tremble it be not in we northern blood to give much expression to sentiment but we feel none the less deeply -- much more deeply i think than you exuberant southerner you be impulsive mercurial and fickle oh do not say that : i can not bear to hear you say it we have deep feeling we be constant true as steel chivalrous -- yes you be delightful people but you be always live in the past shall i say it you be womanlike you can not reason what you want at the moment be right and only that with we nothing be real until we have try and prove it if you count on northern apathy you will soon see you mistake when beauregard fire on fort sumter the north be of one mind and will stay so until all be again as it be pray do not let we talk on this subject i be free to own that it do not interest I then he add adroitly you be readier in argument than i because you be bring up in it but what i want to say be that it seem base for I to turn upon the goodness i have meet in this house and -- and -- but you need not turn in battle do you duty like a man if it should fall to you to do a kindness to the wound do it in memory of the friend you have here war be less savage now than it be when you ancestor and mine tortured each other in the name of god and the king all murder be do for love of one sort or another : war be love of country revenge be love of some one else -- man rarely kill from hate vincent stammer he heart beat at the nearness of what he be die to say in that case i hope i shall he hate i shall shun people who love I and with that she strike the horse a lively tap and soon be far ahead of she tongue-tied wooer be this a challenge vincent ask himself as he speed after she when he reach she side the tender word be chill on he lip for olympium have in she laughing eye the to he odious expression he see there when she make the irritating speech about himself and jack a few minute before fear a tease retort he bridle the tender outburst and ride along pensively revolve pretext for another day 's stay in acredale but when they reach home he find a imperative mandate to set out at once as he linger in the north be subject himself and kinsman to doubt among the zealous partisan of the davi party olympium be alone in the library when he run down to tell jack that he must start at once he take it as a omen and say confusedly : it be decide i must go in the morning as this have be the plan all along she look up at he in surprise not know of course that he have be think of put off the fix time yes everything have be make ready jack will take you to warchester and we shall drive over to see you _ en route _ it be fortunate the letter from my mother come to-night he stand quite over she chair he eye glitter strangely he manner excite do you know what they think at home they say that i -- i be not true to my cause that my heart be with the north -- that i want to stay here they will not think that when they hear you as we have breathing fury and wrath against the lincolnite olympia briskly reply as if to proffer she service as witness to he misguided loyalty to the south ah do not be so ungenerous now -- at this time i never talk like that now -- here -- never before you he hesitate and he voice drop why will you put a fellow in a ridiculous light you sneer almost make I ashamed of my honest pride in my state -- my enthusiasm for we sacred cause deep feeling be not so easily shake true love should brave all thing -- even sneer and blow if i should tell you that i love somebody i be sure you would make I seem ridiculous or ignorant of my own mind then pray be wise and do not tell I it be bad enough to be in love without be photograph in the agony he look at she in angry perplexity could she ever be serious be all the tenderness of the past only heedless coquetry have she dance with he drive with he sail with he walk in the moonlight and make much of he in mere wanton mischief what right have she to be so pretty and so -- without heart or sensibility a southern girl with the word love on a young man 's lip would have become a circe of seductive woo until the tale be tell even though she could not give she heart in return i -- i be go to-morrow you know and -- then he almost laugh himself for the droll inconsequence of this intelligence after what have pass touch even he small sense of humor o olympium i mean that i shall be far away : that i shall not see you after to-morrow will not you say something to encourage I -- to give I heart for the future let I see and she lean on she elbow musingly as if construe he word literally and quite unaware of the tender intent of he prayer it ought to be a line to go on you sword -- there be where you have the advantage of poor jack he have only a musket but no you be a southerner have a coat of arm and the line must go on that i use to know plenty of stir phrase suitable to young man set out for the war perhaps you know they too they be to be find in the copy-book ` the pen be mightier than the sword ' would not do would it pen be only fit for poet and man of peace we should have something brief and epigrammatic ` that hour be regal when the sentinel mount on guard ' there be sublimity in that but you will not go on guard be a officer ` no blood-stained woe in mankind 's story should daunt the heart that be set on glory ' that be too trivial -- the sort of doggerel for newspaper poet ' corner rather than a warrior 's shield ` think on the peril that environ the man that meddle with cold iron ' that be too much like a caution and a soldier 's motto should urge to daring so we 'll none of that what do you say to the distich in honor of you great ancestor pocahonta 's husband john smith

color and smile rosily at the face she see in the mirror raise it to she lip and sigh softly when a whole people have but one thought in mind that think become mania acredale have but this one thought beat rebellion and punish rebel on to richmond be the cry and form rank to go there the business that everybody take in hand these have be great day to jack he begin to feel something of the burden that a feudal chief must have bear at the summon of the clan so soon as it spread in the country-side that young sprague have ` list all the ageable son of the soil be fire with a burning zeal to take up arm and bear he company boy from sixteen to twenty these be for the most part and there be bitter grumble when jack firmly refuse to take the name of any under twenty some he solace with a gun a pistol or such object as he know be dear to the country boy 's heart they return to the relieved hearthstone loud in jack 's praise have he promise to enlist they when they be twenty if the war last so long and if the wise smile at this be not it well know that the great army now gather be to set out at latest by the 4th of July and do not everybody know that it be go to march direct to richmond there be try scene too in the _ rôle _ jack have assume so gayly he begin to see that war have minister of pain and sorrow hardly less cruel than those deal death and wound tearful parent come to he day by day to beg he help in restore son who have flee to the war other come to warn he that if they boy apply to he he must refuse they as they be under age in this list the perley sister dick 's three maiden aunt come on a respectful embassy to implore jack to discourage they nephew who have quite desert school and give all he time to drilling with the college squad jack pledge himself that he would hand dick over to the justice of the peace to be detain at the house of refuge if he do not give up he evil design but when that young aspirant appear so soon as he aunt have go and remind jack of year of intimate companionship in dare-deviltry the elder saw that he own safety would be in flight and that night he company be remove to warchester there in the great camp surround by sentinel he acredale crony be shut out and jack begin in earnest he soldier life chapter iv guelph and ghibelline the shift of jack 's company to the regimental camp in warchester leave a broad gap in the line of the social life of acredale jack 's go alone to say nothing of the other would have eclipse the gayety of many home group besides he own in which the sprague primacy in a social sense be acknowledge since the influx of the new-made rich under the stimulus of the war and acredale 's advantage as a resort there be a good many who dispute the sprague leadership -- tacitly concede rather than assert chief of the dissident be elisha boone who by virtue of longer tenure vast wealth and political precedence divide not unequally the homage pay the patrician family boone be fond of speaking of himself as a self-made man and the satirical be not slow to add that he have no other worship than he creator this be a gibe make rather for the antithesis than its accuracy for even boone 's enemy own that he be a good neighbor and where he prejudice be not in question a man with few distinctly repellent trait he delight in show he affluence -- not always in good taste he fill he fine house with bizarre crowd and make no stint to he friend who need he purse or he influence he have in the early day when he come to acredale aspire to political leadership in the democratic party but senator sprague be too firmly enshrine in the loyalty of the district to be overcome by the parvenu 's maneuver or he money he ambition in time turn to rancor as he mark the patrician 's disdainful disregard of he -lrb- boone 's -rrb- effort to supplant he hatred of the sprague become something like a passion in boone sarcasm and disparagement level at he social and political pretension he attribute to the senator and he family all sort of slur and gossip be report to he by busybody until it become a settle purpose with boone to make the sprague family feel heavy heart-burning for the sum of the affront he have endure it be to they he attribute the whisper gibe about he illiteracy he shady business method the awful story of he handiwork in the ruin of richard perley the spendthrift brother of the miss perley once too when he have so well manipulate the district delegate that he be sure of nomination in the convention senator sprague have hurry home from washington and defeat he just as the prize be in he grasp the senator make a speech to the delegate in which he pointedly declare that it be man of honor and brain not man of money that should be choose to make the law the time will come senator that you 'll be sorry for this hour 's work boone say join sprague at the door as he be leave the hall how 's that the other ask with just the shade of superciliousness in the tone admire in the senate for suavity i hope i be always sorry when i do wrong in speech or act i teach my child to be well if you think it right to run the party for a few lordly idler too proud to mix with the people -- man who think they be better bear and better breed than the rest of we -- i do not want to have anything more to do with it i will go elsewhere that be you privilege sir the whig have plenty of room for self-made man though i do think you be take too personal a view of to-day 's contest you defeat be purely a matter of duty moore whom we have choose be a poor irish settler here before you come he be promise the nomination two year ago with a lofty bow the senator turn and stalk in another direction as if he do not care for the other 's further company even this small and wholly unintended affront work in the poor misjudge victim of morbid self-esteem as a cinder in the eye will torture and blind the sufferer to all the landscape boone mingle no more with the democrat he throw himself with the fervor of the convert into the radical wing of the whig and be bring into close relation with some of the most admire of the band of great man who create the young republican party if dougla dickinson cass van buren seymor or any eminent democrat pass through warchester stop to break bread with they colleague sprague in he acredale retreat straightway the splendid sumner the ciceronian phillip or the walpole-seward or some other of the shine galaxy of agitator whose light so shone before man that the whole land be presently bring out of darkness meet at boone 's table to maintain the balance in distinction it be boone 's liberal purse that pay the expense of the memorable campaign in the warchester district wherein the democrat be first shake in they hold it be he money that finally secure the seat in congress for oswald who be he tenant and debtor it be therefore no surprise when oswald -- who have be greatly aid in business affair by senator sprague -- pass over the prior claim of he old patron 's son and give the cadetship to wesley boone the son of he new liege it be look upon as another step in the ladder of gratitude when wesley carry off the captaincy in the acredale company though everybody know that young boone be not in any way so well fit for the strap as jack when one day a item appear in the local paper to the effect that president lincoln have show the sagacity for which he be so well know in honor we distinguished townsman elisha boone esq with the appointment of ambassador to russium everybody think the statement only natural there be many congratulation but when have decline this splendid proffer the authority press the place of assistant secretary of the treasury upon they townsman the whole village awake to the fact that all its greatness have not go when senator sprague be gather to he father the event be potent as the cross constantine see or dream he see in the sky in the conversion of party worker to the new administration everybody look forward to a eminent future for the potent partisan and millionaire the first of that -- now not uncommon -- hierarchy that replace the feudal baron in modern social force have he listen to the eager urge of kate he daughter and prime minister boone would have accept the foreign mission but he stubbornly refuse to listen to she in this kate boone be like she father only in strong will vehement purpose and a certain humorous independence that make she a great delight among even the anti-boone partisan in both acredale and warchester since the death of she mother kate have be head of she father 's household -- a imperious capricious kind-hearted tyrant who rule mostly by joke and persuasion of the gentler sort it be she father 's one lament that kate be not the boy of the family for she have more of the stuff that make the man in she little finger than we have in he whole body she keep he in a perpetual unrest of delight and dismay she espouse none of he pique or prejudice she be as apt to bring people he dislike to he dinner-table as those he like she be forever make he forgive wrong or what he fancy to be wrong and cause he seem at fault in all he squabble so that he be often hear to say when thing go as he do not want they : i do not know whether i be to blame or the other fellow until kate hear the story he illiteracy and lack of polish be the secret grief of the rich man 's life kate be quick in detect this much of it she see be due to the shyness that unschooled man feel in the presence of college man or those who have be train on return from she seminary life the young girl set about remedy the single break in she father 's perfection she be far too clever to let he know she ambitious purpose with a patience almost maternal and a exquisite adroitness she interest he in she own reading which be comprehensive if not very well order but she win the main point during the long winter evening she father find no pleasure like that kate have always ready for he in the cheery library he be soon amaze at he keen interest in the world of mind unrolled to he understand more than all he retain with the receptivity of a boy all that be read to he kate make believe that she need he help in review she own study and so carry he through all she have go over in the seminary class boone begin presently to see that education be not the result of mere attendance in school and the parroting of the classic in a few semester in college without suspect it he varied business enterprise and he wide experience of man have ground he as well in the ordinary form of knowledge as nine in ten college man attain education after all papa be like a trade a man may be able to handle all the tool and not know they name now you be a well-informed man but because you do not know logic grammar scientific term and the like you think yourself ignorant in the new confidence in himself he be surprise at he own ability in launch a subject in the presence of he eminent friend when especially kate be on hand to support the conversation she get he not only to buy fine picture as most rich man do but she make he see wherein they value lay so that when artist and amateur come to admire he treasure he could talk to they without gross solecism i be not a liberal education to you papa as steele say of the duchess of devonshire that imply too much but i be a index you can find out what you need to know by keep track of my ignorance elisha boone 's domestic circle be a termagancy -- as kate often tell he guest -- temper by wit and good-humor he be prouder of he daughter than of he self-made rank or he revered million in moment of expansive good-nature he invite business or political associate to acre villa as he place be call to enjoy the surprise kate 's grace work in the guest but these be not always time of delight to the doting parent kate be a shrewd judge of the amenity and if the personage who come at the father 's bidding give the least sign of a not unnatural surprise to find a girl so well breed and self-contained in the daughter of such a man as boone she become very frigid and leave the father to do the honor of the evening visit no entreaty could move she to reappear on the scene in time the prodigal papa be careful to submit a list of the name of he proposed guest as chamberlain give royalty a descriptive list of those to be bid to court kate be on term that if not cordial be not constrain with the sprague she have go to the same seminary with olympium have dance with jack and in the cadetship affair have plainly give she opinion that she brother wesley have no taste or fitness for military life jack who have should have the prize but two motive enter into the father 's determination : one be to annoy and humiliate the sprague the other the sleepless craving of the parvenu to get for he son what have not be he in spite of all the adulation pay he -- the concede equality of social condition the army be then as i believe it be consider now the surest sign of higher caste in a democracy wesley by the mere right to epaulet would be of the acknowledged gentility nobody could sneer at he no door could be open grudgingly when he call he would in virtue of he west point insignia be a knighted member of the blood royal of the republic some of this mysterious unction would distill itself into the unconsecrated ichor of the rest of the family and kate as well as himself would be part of the patrician caste the daughter look upon all this good-humoredly she share none of she father 's morbid delusion on the subject she rally the cadet a good deal on he mission when wesley after the June examination which he pass by the narrowest squeeze -- 'twa say by outside influence -- come home to display he cadet button and he neat gray uniform in acredale kate banter the complacent young warrior jocosely we shall all have to live up to you shoulder-strap and brass button after this wesley she cry as the proud young dandy strut over the arabesque of the library where the delighted papa march he the better to survey the boy 's splendor and think of the fate that await you if in the esteem of acredale you should turn out less than a napoleon be serious kate and do not tease the boy wesley know what be expect of he he have a opportunity to show what be in he stock thank god man in the north can now come to they own without go down on they knee to the south wesley grin he be no match for he sister in the humorous bout wage over he head against he father 's prejudice and cherish social scheme during the vacation she put a heavy penalty of raillery upon he swell pride and vanity sarcasm that try the paternal patience as well as he own wesley however have a large fund of the philosophy that come from a high estimate of one 's self he be well favor in look and build though somewhat effeminate with he small hand and carefully shod foot he would have be call a dude have the word be know in its present significance as it be he be regard as a coxcomb by the derisive group hostile to the father 's social pretension he be the first of the golden youth of he set to adopt the then revive mode of parting the hair on the middle of the head in the tooth of the village derision he persist in this with a tenacity that kate declare give promise of a wellington for many who have at first adopt the foreign freak have be ridicule out of it discourage by the obstinate refusal of the generality to follow the lead in those sturdily primitive day the rich youth of the land have not so universally go abroad as they do now and the proper thing among the well bear be not so distinctly lay down in the code of the _ élite _ the accent and manners that now mark good form seem queer not to say _ bouffe _ to even the first circle of home society and the first disciple of anglomanium have a very hard time polish the raw material the home life of the boone be something better and sincerer than the impression make upon they neighbor by the father 's invincible push and high-handed way he daughter and son have be bear to he in middle age they have the reverence for the parent mark in the conduct of child who associate gray hair with the venerable with all she strong sense and self-assertion kate be proud of the fact that she be she father 's daughter it be a distinction to bear he name he solidity he masterful will he well-defined if narrow conviction be to she the sanctity one be apt to associate with lineage or magistracy wesley though less impressionable than he sister share these secret devotions to the parent 's part and bow before he father 's behest in the filial reverence of the son of the patriarch when elisha boone denounce the outbreak of john brown at harper 's ferry as more criminal than aaron burr 's treason he child make he prepossession they own when three year later the father proudly eulogize the uprising he have so luridly condemn he child see no tergiversation in the swift conversion when to this full measure of lay perfection the complexion of levite godliness be superad by election to the deaconate in the baptist church it will readily be see that two young people in whom the hard worldliness of wealth and easy condition have not breed home agnosticism be material for all the credulity of parent worship kate a year older than wesley soon encounter the influence which give the first shock to she faith and gradually tincture she sentiment with a clearer insight into she father 's character oddly enough it be through the rival house this come olympium a sort of ablegate in the social hierarchy of the village have be throw much with kate and be greatly amuse with she point of view in many of the snarl arise in a provincial society the intimacy have be begin in the new york school where both have be in the same class and though the family see nothing of each other the girl do kate be soon lead to see that the sprague have none of the patrician pretension she father attribute to they jack too have make much of she and seem to delight in she sharp retort to the inanity of would-be wit the episode in elisha boone 's life that all he success wealth and after exemplary conduct have not condone in the village mind be he handiwork in the ruin of richard perley i set this down with something of the delight carlyle express when in the rubbish of history he find among the sham call king and noble anything like a man it be worth the note this trait of acredale at a time when riches and success be look upon as condone every breach of the decalogue just how the intimacy between the two man come about be not know it however be know that when boone first come to acredale he have be help in he affair by dick perley 's lavish means in a few year boone be the patron and perley the client as boone grow rich perley grow poor until finally all be go then the fairest land of the perley inheritance pass to boone it be the fireside history of the whole caribee valley that the rich contractor have encourage the ruin gentleman in the excess that end the profligate 's career that the two man have stake large sum at play in bucephalo and that inability to meet he loss to boone have cause dick perley 's flight he have be see by one of the village people a year or two before the war in richmond and have be hear of in californium later but no word have ever reach he family not even when he wife die two year after he exile there be those who say that boone be in correspondence with he victim and it be know that draft make by dick perley have be pay by boone at the bank in warchester between boone and the perley lady whose house be separate from acre villa by a wide lawn and hedge there have always be the tacit enmity that wrong on one side and meek unreproach on the other breed the rancor that manifest itself in boone 's treatment of the miss perley be not imitate by they they never allude to they affluent neighbor never suffer gossip concern the boone in what olympium humorously call the orphic adytum the tabby-shop as wesley name the perley parlor young dick however have none of the scruple that keep he aunt silent one dreadful day when he have be nag to fisticuffs with wesley whose dudish dignity exact a certain restraint with the hot-headed youngster elisha boone behind the thick hedge hear on the highway outside he grounds this outrageous anathema : you be no more than a thief we boone you father steal all he be get some day i 'll make he give it back or send he to jail where he ought to be now schoolboy though the railer be boone stagger against the hedge the word bring a dreadful flush and then a livid pallor to the miserable parent 's cheek he dare not trust himself to speak then nor be the antipathy the outbreak cause mitigate by the savage thrashing that wesley throw aside he dignity proceed to administer to the unbridled accuser after that by the father 's sternest command neither of he child be to return the courteous salutation the perley lady have never cease to bestow in meet the boone walk or in company now dick be the kind of boy that those who know boy nature would call adorable to the philistine without humor or sympathy i be afraid he be a very bad boy he be until late in he teens painfully shy with grown people and stranger even under the eye of he aunt and with youth of he own age diffident to awkwardness he have the face of a well-fed cherub and the gentle dreamy and wistful eye of a girl in love with he elder he have the halt confused speech of a new boy in a big school but in the wood or on the playground he be the merriest most daring and winningly obstreperous lad that ever fill three maiden aunt with terror and delight chapter v a napoleonic epigram for week the regiment expect every day the order to march the gun have be distribute and all they fascinating secret master in evolution and manual the man regard themselves as quite equal to the regular the strict order forbid absence overnight be hardly need as no one venture far fear that the regiment would be whirl away to washington during the night have the man be older or more experienced in war the week of wait would have be delightful rather than dreary the regiment be the object of universal interest in the town base-ball and the alluring outdoor pastime that now divert the dawdler of city be unknown hence the camp-ground of the caribee be the matinee ball-match tennis boat all in one of the idle afternoon world of warchester at parade and battalion drill the scene be like the race-ground on gala day all the fine equipage of the town draw up in the road and lane flank the camp where with level glass the mother sister and sweetheart watch the column as they skirmish form square or pass the defile quite sure that the rebel would fly in confusion before such surprising maneuver this daily audience stimulate such a fierce rivalry among the company that the man turn out at all hour of the day to drill and practice in squad rather than loiter about the camp one day great news arouse the camp : the governor be to review the regiment and send it to the front all warchester pour out to the holly hill and when at five o'clock the company file out on the shine green there be such a cheer that the man feel repay for the tiresome wait of month the civic commander-in-chief watch the movement with affable scrutiny surround by a profusely uniformed staff to whom he express the most politic approval he be hear to remark that no such soldier have be see on this continent since scott have march to lundy 's lane there be a throb of passionate joy in the rank when this eulogium reach the man for the word be hardly speak when they be know in every company by that mysterious telegraphy which make the human body a conductor swift as a electric wire among large mass of man nor be the word less relish that the eulogist be as ignorant of military excellence as a malay of the use of a patent mower the man it be easy to see be much more efficient in movement than the officer in handle they colonel oswald have waste week in the study of the occult evolution of the battalion they be still a maddening mystery to he that fatal day for six week he dream have be haunt by airy battalion file over impossible defile the command he give that day would have throw the company into hopeless confusion have the junior officer not boldly substitute the right one for the colonel 's blunder this however pass unnoted for the crowd and even the man be not the sharp critic they afterward become when mistake by a incompetent officer be salute by shout of ridicule and the man contemptuously disregard they when colonel oswald order they to present arm from a place rest there be more perplexity than merriment and the admire crowd see nothing peculiar in one company snatch up bayonet to present while other remain perfectly still jack to whom the manual be a very sacred thing break into fierce ridicule of the commander declare that he be better fit for sutler than colonel when the savage speech be report to headquarters that young fellow 's prospects for the strap -- never the best -- be by no means improve the review bring bitter disappointment to the regiment the inspector-general who be present inform the colonel that no more than a thousand man could be accept in one body that five hundred of the caribee would have to be divide among other troops in the state the order arouse wild excitement half the man look upon the edict as a scheme to give the politician more place for they feudatory indeed though that be not the origin of the order that be the use make of it some of the junior officer who dislike oswald and distrust he capacity to command draw out very willingly and of course carry many of they man with they but in the end the matter have to be decide by lot now this chance throw wesley boone out and there be great rejoicing in the acredale group who hope that this stroke of luck would make place for they favorite jack sprague but to everybody 's astonishment a day or two after the event wesley resume he place in company k and give out that it be by order of the governor jack be urge by the major of the regiment who have go with the five hundred to cast he fortune with the new body promise a speedy lieutenancy but jack would not desert the caribee all of company k and many in the other have enlist on he word and he could not in honor leave they the opposition journal have from the first denounce the division of the caribee as a trick of the partisan and sure enough the man be give to understand that there would be no move to washington until after the election then pend this be a municipal contest and the administration party make good use of the incipient soldiery to obtain a majority in the town promotion be quite openly hold out as a reward for those who could influence most vote for the administration candidate at night the various company be send into the city to take part in the political propaganda to march in procession or occupy conspicuous place at the party meeting the private soldier be almost to a man democrat but the chance to escape the long and irksome evening of the camp and join the frolic and adventure of the street make most of they willing enough to play the part of claque or figurante jack of course refuse to take part in these scenic rally make known he sentiment in vehement disdain he detest oswald who have quit he party not on a question of principle but merely for place and jack do not spare he in he satirical allusion to the new use invent for the military a still more try injustice befall the luckless jack for a long time he have as senior act as orderly sergeant of company k this officer be virtually the executive functionary in the company it be he place to form the man in rank make out detail and prepare everything for the captain the orderly sergeant be to the company what the adjutant be to the regiment he carry a musket and march with the rank but in responsibility be not inferior to a officer one evening when it be know that order have come for the regiment to march jack have form the company for parade receive a paper from the captain 's orderly to read he open it without suspicion and among other change in the corps read thoma trask to be first sergeant of company k and he will be obey and respect accordingly jack read the monstrous wrong without a tremor the man fling down they arm and break into a fierce clamor of rage and grief many of they be jack 's classmate these swarm about he one assume the part of spokesman cry out : it be a infamous outrage they cheat you out of you captaincy they have put every slight they could upon you but we have some rights we will not stand this there be thirty of you classmate who will do whatever you say to show these people that they can not act like this there be mutiny and desperation in the air it need but a spark to destroy the usefulness of the company but as be often the case with impetuous hot-headed spirit jack cool as he friend grow hot he be the more patient that the injustice be he injury alone he remain in he place at the right of the company and confront the rebellious group with amazing self-control then loud above the murmur he voice ring out : company attention fall in fall in any man out of the rank will be send to the guard-house eight dress steady on the leave many a time afterward these angry mutineer hear that sonorous clear boyish treble in stern and determine command but they never hear it signalize a more heroic temper than at that moment when himself deeply wrong he force they to go back in the rank to receive the interloper they dress up sullenly as jack call the roll for the last time and receive trask the new orderly at a present which though not in the tactic jack exact as a penitence for the momentary revolt poor trask look very unhappy indeed as he displaced rival step back to the rear and leave the new orderly to march the company out from the narrow way to take its place in the parade it be easy to see that he would have be very glad to postpone or evade he new honor on any pretext for the time he be so confused that jack from the flank be oblige to repeat the few command need to get the company to the field fortunately for the efficiency of the raw army as this public discontent reach its most acute stage order come to march the troops to washington the caribee be the first body of soldier send from warchester and there be a memorable scene when the jaunty rank file through the street to the station by the time the man reach the train they discover that they could never make war laden down as they be by knapsack fill with the preposterous impediment feminine foresight have provide the man 's back bulge out with such a pack of supplies that when the regiment halt each man be force to kneel and let a comrade take off or put on he knapsack and then the march through the street -- every man know to score in the throng the brisk high-stepping drum corps rat-a-tatting at interval then tempest of cheer flash banner and patriotic symbol at every window tear laughter humorous cry joke sob outbreak the whole city be in march as the caribee reach the throng main thoroughfare ready hand relieve the soldier of they burden as the line file in sight of the governor who have come to speed the parting brave lad and lass make merry with the elated warrior the musket be turn into bouquet-holder and the first move toward real war take on the air of a floral _ fête _ there be pop cork and sound of convivial revelry that make the scene anything but warlike jack in a cluster of he town crony catch sight of he mother at one of the window of the parthenon hotel he waft she a joyous kiss pretend not to see the tear fall down she cheek olympium be not apparently very deeply affect she make she way through the crowd to she brother 's side and with a air of the liveliest interest demand : jack what have you in you knapsack let I see o polly it be such a job to close it what do you want it be harder to manage than a saratoga trunk i can not really stuff another pin or needle in so pray keep what you have for my furlough no i be not go to put anything in she bent over while barney moore one of jack 's acredale comrade gallantly loose the strap she search carefully through the diver article take everything out jack look on ruefully while he companion gather about in vague curiosity when she have remove and restore everything she arise say : i feel easier now i merely look to see if that marshal 's _ bâton _ i have hear so much about be there i shall feel easy in my mind now because a _ bâton _ in you baggage would have make you too adventurous there be a great shout of laughter as the fun of the incident flash upon the listener many of whom have hear the ingenuous jack often in other day sigh for war and the chance that napoleon say every man have of find a marshal 's _ bâton _ in he knapsack jack bear the banter very equably know that olympium be rather strive to keep he spirit up and divert he from the tear in he mother 's eye than indulge she own humor indeed most of the gayety at this moment be contribute by those whose heart be heaviest the consecrate priesthood of patriotism must see no weakness in those leave behind the only son now bring face to face with the meaning and consequence of he rashly seize chance for glory must not be remind that perhaps a grave lay beyond the thin veil of the near future must not be remind that heavy heart and dim eye be leave behind feed day by day hour by hour on terror and dread unsupported by the change scene the wild excitement and the joyous vicissitude of the soldier 's life it be a cruel comedy act every day between 1861 and 1865 they laugh who be not gay and they seem indifferent who be faint with despair the courage of battle be mere brutish insensibility compare with the abnegation of the million mother who give they boy to the bestial maw of war the harrowing ceremonial of parting be end the train move slowly out of the station and a murmur of sob and cheer echo until it be far beyond the easternmost limit of the city after a journey of two day and a night the train ready philadelphium jack be all eye and ear for the spectacle the country present in every station through which the regiment pass crowd welcome the blue-coats woman feed they or those who seem in need thinking perhaps of they own distant darling receive like tenderness from the stranger in philadelphium the regiment march across the city to resume its journey it be a cold spring night and the regimental quartermaster and commissary have make no provision for the man indeed as the observant jack afterward learn it be part of the plan of the group that first begin to create great fortune during the war to make the soldier pay for they ration _ en route _ to the seat of war or depend upon the charity of citizen along the railway line the government pay for the supplies just the same while the money go into the pocket of contractor and quartermaster after a weary tramp through what seem to the soldier the biggest city in the world the regiment with blistered foot hungry and cross be halt before a long low wooden building through whose rough glass window cheerful light could be see a rumor spread that they be to have a hot supper and sure enough they be march in divide on each side of four long table that stretch into spectral distance in the feeble glimmer of the oil-lamp hang from the ceiling most of the man in jack 's company at least be gently nurture but the steam oyster cold beef and generous chunk of bread fill they eye with a magnificence and they stomach with a gentle repletion no banquet before or after ever equal the feast be set in the same place during four year by the sanitary society i think but the memory of that homely board plenteously spread be in the mind of many a veteran who face warward during the conflict chapter vi on the potomac the next morning when the man debark to march through baltimore every one be on the _ qui vive _ to fasten in he memory the scene of the shameful attack upon the soldier of massachusett on the 19th of April but as the line march proudly down pratt street there be no sign of the hostile spirit that make baltimore a center of doubt and suspicion in the north for many a day afterward it be however when the train dash out from among the hill to the northwest of the sheet of water behind the capitol that the caribee glue they eye to the pane in awe not unmingled with delight no american will ever look upon that imperial dome again with the sensation that fill the breast of those who first see its round outline in the war epoch what the ark of the covenant be to the army that march in the wilderness or the cross of st peter to the pilgrim approach rome that the great dome tower cloud ward in the perpetual blue be to the wonder eye of the soldier as he glance first fall upon it that it be for month -- yes ever after -- on the plain of arlington and in the deadly exhalation of the chickahominy every one look anxiously to see sign of war -- indeed since leave baltimore there be a delicious feeling of suspense -- as the train shot over embankment or skirt the deep pine wood perhaps a adventurous rebel vanguard might attack they perhaps they might have the glory of fight they way to the beleaguered capital perhaps father abraham might come out and smile benignantly at they for a brave deed well do face flush and eye sparkle in the delightful anticipation : and some of the ardent spirit more eager than the other load they musket to be ready but beyond the federal picket-post at the station no sign of war be soon nor much sign of hostility such as the vivid fancy of the raw young warrior conjure but now the train be at rest and the officer -- who have not be see during the journey -- turn out in resplendent plumery the station -- in those day a tumble-down barrack -- be already crowd with soldiery the caribee be align along the track the officer so bewildered by the confusion that it be by a miracle some of the group of move man be not run over by the backing engine after a interminable delay the band set up we be come down to washington to fight for abraham 's daughter and with exuberant joy a thousand pair of leg keep brisk step and elastic movement to the inspiriting strain now the longing eye see the circumstance and even some of the pomp of war the regiment debouch into pennsylvanium avenue under the very shadow of the capitol which look sadly shabby and disproportioned to the eye that have a hour or two before open in such admiration at the first view but there be no time for architectural criticism they be move down the avenue toward the white house toward the home of that patient kindly sorely-tried ruler -- the democritus of he grisly epoch the caribee excite none of the sensation here they have be accustom to the street be not crowd and the few civilian pass hardly turn they head mount orderly dash hurriedly with hideous clatter of sabre and equipment across the line of march through the very regiment 's rank answer with a disdainful oath or mocking gibe when a outraged shoulder-strap raise a remonstrating voice at fourteenth street the caribee be halt until the colonel could take he bearing from headquarters just around the corner the wide sidewalk be dense with bestarred and epauleted personage in various key of discussion jack and he crony barney moore study the scene in wonder they company be halt exactly at the corner of fourteenth street and pennsylvanium avenue and the two be stand at willard 's corner i wonder if the president just stand and throw the star down from that balcony jack say as the crowd of brigadier thicken before the hotel door what on earth be they all do here oh they come to make requisition on general bacchus he be the commissary-general of the brigadier -- do not you know barney say innocently general bacchus barney you be crazy -- there be no such officer in the army -- i know all the name -- you mean general bank do not you oh no i be not mistake -- general bacchus have be select to deal out the _ esprit de corps _ _ l'esprit de corps _ barney you be certainly tipsy i be ashamed of you yes the spirit of that corps as you can tell from the whiff that come this way be the whisky-bottle bacchus preside over that spirit one would think you would never read a eclogue of virgil -- you be duller than a doctor of divinity 's after-dinner speech a tutor 's joke be the utmost wit you ought to bear and so you call that a joke well it be not a cough a song a oath or -- or anything old oswald would say so it must be a joke well in that sense it may pass like a tipsy soldier without the countersign oh come now jack these star be really dazzling you not but i 'll make you see some that will dazzle you if you do not treat you superior more respectfully oh the punch you think of give I would not solve this star problem it require to be make in the old -- the milky way but barney 's astral joke be bring to a period by the sharp note of the bugle as colonel oswald very important under the eye of so many big-wig magnificently order the march the regiment pass up the steep hill out fourteenth street -- then a red clay thoroughfare of sticky mire with only here and there a negro 's shanty where the palace of the rich rise to-day the man learn something of they future enemy virginium mud as they climb the red gorge and debouch on meridian hill where presently a aide-de-camp mark the ground assign the regiment and the real life of the soldier begin how tame to tell but how imperial the hour when these one thousand lad first go on guard yes the fact be now before they they be no longer segregate atom inert ineffective eccentric they be part of that mighty bulwark of blood and iron that stand between law and rebellion between the nation 's heart and the assassin dagger of disunion how proud and glad and manly they feel these bright-eyed boy -- for boy they mostly be not a hundred in the regiment have see they five-and-twentieth year one razor would have be ample for the beard of the whole battalion and oh the nameless the intoxicating sense of solidarity as they sweep the vast reach of hillside and see the white tent in brooding immensity on either hand yes yonder far across the wondrous belt of water touching loyalty and rebellion in its mighty rush seaward they could distinguish the city of canvas on the distant virginium shore it make a fellow feel as godfrey 's host feel when they come in sight of the bosporus and the horde of the saracen on the plain of the hellespont jack say exultingly as barney stand on a pile of camp equipage above he survey the quicken spectacle i do not know how godfrey 's fellow feel jack but it _ do _ make a man feel kinder able to do something with so many near by to lend a hand but star and garter what a head it must take to manage all these fair and square now jack you feel the fire of military genius in you big head -- do you think that you could disentangle this enormous coil -- put each corps division and regiment in its proper place -- at a day 's notice oh i could not perhaps do it just to-day but give I time yes i 'll give you to the age of methuselah and then if you can manage it i shall not lose faith in you come man the tent must be up before dark sergeant sprague you squad have five tent for its detail you 'll find axis and tool at the quartermaster 's wagon on the hill yonder it be the captain who speak and a instant later the plot of ground perhaps a acre and a half in area be a scene of rollick labor each company have a street the tent -- calculate to hold four each but the number vary go up often as high as six -- face each other leave room enough for the company to march in column or in line between the white wall as the regiment would be presumably some time on the ground the canvas tent rest on the top of a palisade of log cut in the neighbor wood these be five foot or more in length and when drive into the ground a foot and bank by the sticky clay serve excellently as wall upon which to rest the a tent two berth sometimes four be fasten laterally on these wall frame run up to the center of the a hold the gun while line stretch across from above serve as wardrobe for such garment as could be hang up all this manoeuvring for space in such close quarter be great fun for lad accustom to roomy house and careless almost to slovenliness in the matter of keep thing in place absurd as these detail may seem they be all part and very important part in the life and training of that mighty host that carry the destiny of the country in its discipline during four year there be rigid inspection of quarter every Sunday morning and during the week the non-commissioned officer be expect to see that cleanliness be not intermit the company street be police every morning after breakfast sweep and garnish that be with the care of a dutch housewife order be the first law of the soldier as well as of heaven and many a careless lad bring from he four year ' drill method and painstaking that make he of more value to himself and he neighbor personal trait too could be divine in these toy-like interior the regulation prescribe the arrangement of the bunk blanket fold knapsack lay at the head of the bed accoutrements burnish until at first sight the four gun in the rack seem to be a mirror for the orderly spirit of this thrifty grot the shine plate cup and spoon would have do no discredit to the most energetic housewife as they hang from peg either above the bunk or along the wall if run water be not accessible every tent have a tin basin for the morning ablution each soldier take turn good humoredly the household duty be scrupulously observe each man assume he _ rôle _ in the complicated _ ménage _ it be fully a week before the caribee be install ready for Sunday inspection as no exigency be permit to interfere with morning and afternoon drill guard-mount and parade battalion and brigade drill too be new diversion for the caribee as now camp near other troops these more complicated movement be part of the regiment 's allotted duty after they be sufficiently train in this they be to take part in a grand review by the general-in-chief when the president the secretary of war and all the great folk in washington ride out to witness the spectacle there be no time for dullness every hour have its duty and these soon become second nature to the zealous young warrior such rivalry to best master the manual to hold the most soldierly stature in the rank to detect the drill-sergeant when to test they attention he give a false command and then the coronal joy of a reward of merit for efficiency and alertness on guard the rapture the bit of paper bring and the exultation with which the hero thus signalize go off to town for the day wander through the waste of street stand before willard 's and admire in awe and wonder the indolent group from whose shoulder gleam one and sometimes two star one day jack and barney walking in fifteenth street see a stout man with no insignia to indicate rank or station come out of the headquarters hurriedly he walk to the edge of the pavement and look up and down seem disconcerted notice the two lad he come to where jack be stand in a preoccupy way and the two salute decorously he return the salute and ask : sergeant be you on duty no sir i be on leave for the day ah good my orderly be here a moment ago but i do not see he anywhere would you mind take this telegram to the war department through the park yonder he give jack a envelope and hurry back into the building as the two lad start with alacrity across the street i have see that chap before somewhere barney say pant with the rapid pace he be a staff officer i suppose not very high rank for he only have a blouse on general officer always wear double-button frock even if they do not carry the insignia the war department be easy of access a old building not unlike jack 's own home in acredale he ask the sentry at the door where he envelope be to be deliver the man look at it point to a closed door and jack receive no response to he knock enter three man be in the room one be seat at a vast desk with papers map dispatch and book pile in disheartening confusion within reach of he hand behind he a young captain in uniform sit write but the figure that fix jack 's reverential attention be half sprawling half lie over the heaped-up impediment of the big desk the young soldier catch sight of the serious sad face the wistful humorous eye and he know with a thrill through all he body and a adoring throb in he breast that it be the president -- hapless heritor of generation of disjointed time all thought of he errand all thought of place and person fade as he realize this presence how long he would have remain in this mute adoration there be no tell the restless keen eye look up sharply and a dissonant imperious repellent voice jerk out : well my man what be it without a word jack hand he the envelope and with a sort of reverence to the tall figure whose face be turn kindly toward he he back to the door o barney i have see the president see the president no oh why could not i have go in with you it be always my luck no : it be my luck but take heart he will come out pretty soon and we 'll loaf about here perhaps we can see he as he go back to the white house yonder but though they wait far into the afternoon forget they dinner in the impulse of homage they do not catch sight of the well-known figure for the president 's way to the secretary 's room be a private one and when he go away the boy of course could not see he but jack 's good fortune be the talk of the regiment for many a day and for month when the fellow of the caribee get leave they linger expectantly about the modest headquarters hope that a miss orderly might bring they jack sprague 's proud distinction of see the president face to face on the grand review a few day later jack and he crony be remind of the encounter at headquarters for the man who have give the envelope to carry to the war office be ride a splendid horse next to the president two star glitter on he shoulder now and as he answer the cheer that salute the group the young man see that it be general mcdowell the commander of the force the president ride along the line with a kindly wistfulness in the honest eye that study with no superficial glance the long line of shout soldiery he be not a impose figure in the sense of cavalier bravery but no man that watch as he move in the glittering group conspicuous by he somber black and high hat ever forget the melancholy rapt regard he give the rank as at a easy canter he pass the front of the square or sit solemnly at the march past that conclude the review chapter vii the step that cost what between the doings of the camp and the daily visit to washington soldiering grow into a enchanting existence for the young warrior of the caribee they quarter be on the high plateau north and west of the city -- which be in those day shaded slope that make suburban washington a vale of tempe in the street they see bedizened officer from commander of army down to presidential orderly in the senate and house they hear the voice of man afterward potent in public council what a exuberant vagrant life it be the blood warm and the nerve tingle after the tension and heat of a quarter of a century as those day of sublime vagabondage come back the melodious morning call that wake the sleepy lusty young body the echo bugle and the abrupt drum and then the roll-call in the misty morning when the sun blear and very red rise as if blushing or apoplectic after the night 's carouse it be a army of poet -- of homer -- that begin the never monotonous routine of these memorable day for the incense of national sympathy come faint but intoxicate to the soldier 's nostril in the visit of great statesman the picnic of civilian the copious descriptive letter of correspondent and the daily scrawl from far-away valley where fond eye watch the sun rise note the star to mark the special duty they darling be do in the watch of the night and then the mad music of cheer when the news come that the young mcclellan in west virginium have scatter the adventurous column of lee capture gun man and arm and forever save the great kanawha country to the union and in kentucky the rebel have be outmanoeuvre while in missourus the glorious lyon and the crafty blair have one in the cabinet the other in the camp route the secret black and janus-like rabble of treason and anarchy to feel that he be part of all this that at rest in the iron ring girdle the capital he be might in leash that to-morrow he would be vengeance let loose -- this be the sustain exult thought that make the volunteer the best of soldier he heart be all in the glorious ardor for action night and morning he look proudly at the sacred ensign wave lightly in the summer breeze and he remember that the eye of washington have rest on the same standard at valley forge that the sullen battalion of cornwalli have salute it at yorktown it be a beautiful ardor that fill the young host that wait in leash on the green hill of the potomac those month of turmoil when scott and mcdowell be strain the crude machinery of war to get ready for the vital lunge jack and he acredale squad as the college fellow be call live in a perpetual dream from which the hard reality of drill now six hour a day could not waken they in day of release they scour the maryland hill secretly hope that a adventurous rebel picket might appear and give they occasion to return to camp deck with prelude laurel mile after mile of the charming woodland country they scour they heart beat at the appearance of any animate thing that for a brief intoxicating moment they could conjure into a rebel advance post but beyond wan and reticent yokel engage in the primitive husbandry of this slave section they never encounter any one that could be count overt enemy of the cause money be plenty among these excursive group and they be welcome in company k with effusive outbreak by they less restive comrade as July wear on the sign of movement grow regiment be move away mysteriously and soon the caribee be almost alone on meridian hill jack be fill with dire fear that the commanding officer have discover the incompetency of oswald fear to take the caribee to the front something of the rumor spread through the regiment and if as reputed old sauerkraut -lrb- this be the name he get behind he back -rrb- have spy in all the company the adage about listener be abundantly confirm in the secrecy of jack 's tent however the subject be freely discuss nick marsh the poet of the class as become the mystic tendency of he tribe be for poisoning the detest pomeranian -- oswald be a compatriot of bismarck often boast as the then slowly emerge statesman become more widely know that he live in he near neighborhood marsh 's suggestion fall upon fruitful perception bernard moore -- barney for short -- be to be a physician and have already pass a apprenticeship in a pharmacy coincident with he college term in jack 's class by the power of mud and blood nick dear i have it have what barney I b ' y nick ask mimic barney 's quaintly displaced vowel why the way to get rid of old schnapps and blitzen -- more power to I all the power you want if you 'll only do that and you voice will be as sweet as ` the harp that once in tara 's hall -- ' never moind the harp -- sassenach -- here 's what we can do tim hussey be oswald 's orderly he and i be good friend i know a preparation that will turn the sauerkraut and sausage that oswald eat so much of into degluted fire and brimstone warrant to keep he on the broad of he back for ten day or a fortnight will ye all swear secrecy we will we will on what on the double crown on you head jack answer solemnly which you have often tell we be consider a sign that a angel have touch you -- i be sure nothing could be more solemn than that it be not every fellow that can get a angel to touch the top of he head no most fellow can consider themselves lucky if a angel touch they lip -- or heart barney cry naïvely well never mind that sort of angel now barney nick say pettishly i notice that you always bring up with something about the girl no matter what the subject we set off on it be the jalap -- be not that what it be call -- we want to hear about there be not enough poetry or sentiment in the two o ' ye to fill a wind-blown buttercup no wonder ye do not care to talk of the gurl -- they 'll have none of ye we 'll be satisfy if they 'll have you barney i be sure that be magnanimous but if you jalap take as much time in work old schnapps as you take in explain it the war will be over and we shall have see none of it it be too great a conception to be hastily set forth give I time i 'll lay a guinea that oswald go to the hospital before this day week let we see this be the 14th before the 20th -- and barney give the barrel of he gun near he a furtive wipe with he coat-sleeve barney if you 'll do that i 'll gather every four-leaved clover between here and richmond to give you and what be more if i die i 'll leave you my bone to operate ah nick dear i would rather have you little finger living than all the possession of you father 's bank if you be dead -- and honest barney seize the poet 's hand sentimentally come come fellow what sort of soldier do you call this you remind I of two school-girl jack remonstrate as in duty bind to keep up the warrior spirit yer acquaintance among female be chiefly of the silly sort it be no wonder we remind you of the only thing you can look back on without blush barney retort and a neighbor poke he head in the door to learn the cause of the hilarity the conspirator sally out for a jaunt until parade-time now what mean barney employ or whether he have any handiwork in what befall it do not fall to I to say but this be what happen : a market hawker come into camp the next morning and go straight to the big marquee tent where colonel oswald stand in all the bravery of a new broadcloth uniform with spread eagle on the shoulder the savory fume of hot sauerkraut arouse the warrior from he reverie and he ask in vociferous delight : _ be haben sie kohlen nicht wahr -- sauerkraut -- da be aber schon _ yes mein golonel i hof cabbage und sauerkraut und -- look about circumspectly -- _ etwa schnapps aus antwerpen gebracht _ the golonel 's eye glisten and he make a motion for the vender to go to the rear of the marquee pass through from the front he meet he at the rear and the bargain be hastily conclude marsh secrete three portly bottle in he chest and turn the edibles over to hussey to store in the larder there have be a good deal of uneasiness in camp over rumor of cholera yellow fever and other dismal epidemic when therefore the evening after the colonel 's purchase the regimental surgeon be summon in alarm it be instantly believe in the regiment that old sauerkraut be stricken with cholera he at first suffer hideous pain in the stomachic region this be follow by a rage thirst and unknown to the physician the three bottle of schnapps be quite empty on the fourth day the poor man very woe-begone but now suffer no pain be carry to the hospital and the next day as the campaign be about to begin he be send north to leave room near the field for those who should be wound in the come engagement company k be drill on the wide plateau between the camp and the highway when the ambulance bear the afflict officer come slowly over the road wear through the greensward hussey sit solemnly on the seat with the driver and as the vehicle reach the company standing at rest barney moore in the rear rank speak up : tim be the poor colonel no better divil a betther it be worse he be intirely god be good till ` im neither jack nor nick marsh dare trust himself to meet the other 's eye as the helpless chief disappear down the hillside while barney enter into a exhaustive treatise on the symptom of cholera and the liability of the most robust to meet sudden disaster in this malarious upland circumvailate by age of decay matter in the damp swamp on every hand but when a hour later company k 's whole street be arouse by peal on peal of abderian laughter jack and nick be find helpless in they bunk and barney be engage in present a potion to settle they collapsed nerve well have not i win the guinea now it cost I just twice that if ye 's have a spark of honor ye 'll pay you just due so ye will barney say in the evening return from parade where lieutenant-colonel grandison officiate as commander to the unconcealed delight of all but the oswald parasite among the officer do not say a word barney -- to whom the medico of mythology and all the wizard of antique story be clown and mountebank -- you shall have the guinea or its equivalent twenty-one shilling gold bear in mind yer father 's a banker ye ought to know that i do you shall have the twenty-one shilling in the shinplaster of the republic the colonel have be route none too soon the very next morning when the caribee fall in for roll-call the orderly receive a paper from the commander 's orderly which read tent to be strike at twelve o'clock and the man ready to march with ten day ' ration at last all the future glowing with heroism exciting with the march the attack the battle -- ah what after with something of joy and regret the comely tent that have give they home and harbor be take down fold in precise line and carry away for storage -- for in the field the rank be to bivouac in the open air such gayety such joke such bravado and augury of the to be and the rumor telephone have they be invent stenographer have they be present in legion could not have keep track of the momentous tale that be instantly bruit about general scott be go to lead the army in person he charger have be see before the headquarters the rebel be go to be swoop up by another such famous dash as the flank march from vera cruz to the plateau of mexico then come a numbing fear that beauregard 's brag host have flee and that the movement would turn out a tedious stern chase to richmond in the agony of all this jack return from a detail to the quartermaster 's tent hear he name shout where he tent have be he hurry to the spot and nick salute he with the cry -- here jack be two recruit who declare they must enter company k he gun be on he arm and he knapsack on he back but only the realization that a score of eye be upon he save jack from drop limply on the ground as look in the group he see dick perley and tom twigg grin ingratiatingly at he where -- how in the name of all that be sacred do you get here he gasp why we enlist for drummer in the caribee but the recruit officer tell we as we be eighteen we could carry musket if we want to we do want to and we be go to come into company k they look he confidently in the face as dick repeat this evidently long-practiced explanation it would not do to take they to task before the company jack wait until the rest be scatter and then lead the boy aside say sternly : do not you know you can be put in prison for this you have run away from you parent and guardian no one have a lawful right to enlist you i shall send for the provost marshal and have you put in prison until you parent can come and get you enlistment annul appal by jack 's stern manner as much as by he word the two lad begin to whimper and expostulate tearfully they have trust to he ancient friendship they could have go into any other regiment but they have enlist to be with he whatever happen they be soldier and if tom twigg be not eighteen until September it be perfectly lawful for he to enlist as a drummer perley be eighteen in April last and he be a soldier in spite of all that jack could do jack be deeply perplexed what could be do if he attempt to put the machinery of reclamation in order the boy would be subject to all sort of vicissitude prison everything distressing and demoralizing to tender youth do they know at home what you have do jack ask doubtingly yes dick say note with boyish quickness the indecision in jack 's troubled face i send a letter to aunt pliny from new york tell she we be soldier and that we be happy and well you impudent young scamp -- to write that to you best friend do not you know it will kill she dick have no answer for this and look perplexedly at tom who be lose in admiration of a neighboring group engage in athletic exercise he feel rather than hear the question put by the mentor and observe dick 's discomfiture stammer : it do not kill you mother when you go for a soldier i guess the astute young rascal have hit upon the weak place and jack stand in anxious doubt wonder what to do a aide that he recognize from division headquarters ride past at the moment and jack turn to watch he he leap from he horse at the colonel 's tent jack again look at the boy they be lose in delight at the scene and oblivious of the debate go on in they guardian 's mind stay here till i come back he say authoritatively and stride off to grandison 's tent as he reach it the major mcgoyle be enter and jack wait until that officer should come out he come presently and colonel grandison with he jack salute and state he dilemma to the commander who listen with amuse interest i do not see that anything can be do now jack i be just about leave the regiment i have be assign to general tyler 's staff during the campaign mcgoyle take command of the regiment he will need orderly and the boy can serve with he until we can get time to look into the business i will settle the matter with he and if you will write a telegram to the lad 's family i will have it send as i go to headquarters jack 's relief and gratitude be best see in the brighten eye and the more buoyant movement that succeed the heaviness and agitation of he first impression the boy ' come would weigh upon he every minute until he be in some sort relieve of even passive complicity he would feel that the kind-hearted pearl as the aunt be often call would look upon he as have lead the truant into the army but grandison 's interposition have shift from he a weighty anxiety the boy would not be leave friendless and irresponsible in the turbulent street of washington nor would they as orderly be in continuous or inextricable danger in battle -- for whereas the soldier in the line must keep in rank even when not in actual battle with the enemy 's missile as destructive as in the charge or combat the orderly may take advantage of the inequality of ground and natural object jack explain something of this to the young marlborough and be fairly irritated at the crest-fallen look that come into they eager shine face when they comprehend that they be not to be with they hero but you could not be in the company in any event you look more like rebel than soldier with you gray jacket and trousers -- for the boy still wear they acredale uniform a imitation of the west point cadet 's costume we shall be on the march in a few minute and there be only one of two thing to be do remain here in the ` unassigned ' camp where you may be transfer into any regiment in the service that need recruit or go as colonel grandison have very kindly consent to have you as orderly or clerk the very possibility of be send into some unknown regiment be a terror so great that the other alternative become less odious to the boy and they trot after jack as he stalk moody and distract to major mike mcgoyle 's tent now the only habitable spot leave where a few hour before a symmetrical little city have stand and so ye want to be solger I foine b ` yes well well ` tis litter for yer mother ' knee ye be with yer rosy cheek and curl lock it be a poor place here for yer bright oie and soft hand I lad but i be not the wan to throw the dish after th ' milk when it be spill he stroke the bared head of the blush lad and turn to they unhappy sponsor he add with official brevity : i will put twigg 's son at I papers in the adjutant 's office young pearley can remain with you company until i make out a detail for he it be impossible for jack to sustain the _ rôle _ of frown displeasure as dick skip back with he to the company he remember he own delight three month before even with the haunting thought of he mother 's reproach to dampen he ardor and he be soon dazzling the neophyte with the wonder that be just about to begin it be the afternoon of the 16th of July and the hillside which the day before be cover with tent as far as the eye could see on every hand be now blue with mass of man while other mass have be pass on the red highway since early morning take the direction of the potomac bridge chapter viii a army with banner it have always seem to I that the life the routine the many small hap in the daily function of a soldier which in sum make up to he all that there be in the _ devoir _ of death ought to be read with interest by the million whose kin be part of the civil war as well as by those who know of it only as we know napoleon 's war or washington 's for my part i would find a livelier pleasure in the diary of a common soldier in any of the great war than i do in the confusing pamphlet bind in volume call history i like to read of war as we uncle toby related it i like to know what two observe eye see and the feeling that sometimes make the timidest hero -- sometimes craven for a month -- yes month -- the burden of the press the prayer of the north have be on to richmond jack through colonel grandison know that general mcdowell and the commander-in-chief the venerable soldier scott have plead and protest against a move until the new levy under the three-month ' call could be drill and discipline but on the fourth of July congress have assemble and the raw statesman -- with a eye to future election -- take up the public clamor they give the cabinet the president no peace until general scott and mcdowell have give way and promise the pend movement we soldier be so green that i shall move with fear mcdowell say to the president well they -lrb- mean the rebel -rrb- be green too and one greenness will offset the other lincoln respond with kindly malice it be useless to argue further useless to point out that the rebel be not so green for the young man of the semi-aristocratic society of the south be train to arm whereas it be a mark of lawlessness and vulgarity to carry arm in the puritan rank of the north something of the unreadiness of the army every reflect soldier in the rank comprehend when he see within the precinct of he own brigade the hap hazard conduct of the quartermaster 's and staff department some regiment have raw flour deal they for ration and no bake-oven to turn it into bread some regiment have abundance of bread but no coffee or meat ration as to vegetable -- bean or anything of the sort -- if the pocket of the soldier have not be well supply from home the army that set out for manassa would have be eat with scurvy and the skin disease that come from unseasoned food now at the very moment the legion be strip for the march many of they be without proper ammunition various arm be in use and the same cartridge do not light they all eager group could be see all through the brigade file down the leaden end of the cartridge to make they weapon effective until a proper supply could be obtain this be promise at fairfax station or centreville where the army 's supplies be to be send so in spite of the high hope and feverish unrest for the forward movement there be a good deal of sober foreboding among the man who hold to the american right to criticise as the briton maintain he right to grumble for the soldier in camp or on the march be as garrulous as a tea gossip and no problem in war or statecraft be too complex or sacred for he to attempt the solution of the thirty thousand man leave the bank of the potomac that 16th of July there be at a low estimate ten thousand who believe themselves as fit to command as the chieftain who lead they by two o'clock the caribee be in the line that have be pass city-ward since daylight the sun have baked the sticky clay into brick-like hardness and the hour of trample the tread of heavy team and the still heavier artillery have fill the air with a opaque atmosphere of reddish powder through which the mass pass in almost spectral vagueness the city crowd usually alert when great mass of man move be discourage by heat and dust and the street be quite give over to the military eager as jack and he friend be to note the impression the march make upon the civilian most of whom be think to be secretly in sympathy with the rebellion it be impossible to even catch sight of any but soldier pennsylvanium avenue when they reach it be a billowy channel of impalpable powder but at the long bridge the breeze from the wide channel of the river clear the cloud of dust and the man catch glimpse of each other break into jocose banter on the bridge they look eagerly down the river where the low roof of alexandrium be visible and upward on the virginium shore where the gleaming wall of arlington recall to jack far different time and scene now we be in jeff davi 's land barney call out from one of the rear file as the company reach midway in the bridge not by a long shot nick marsh cry davis 's land begin and end within cannon-shot of himself he be like the duke of saxe-meiningen -- he have to beg he neighbor 's permission to hold battalion drill he be not so polite as the duke he take it without ask barney retort but now we be on the ` sacred soil ' jack cry as the company debouch from the bridge up the steep narrow road that seem to be take they to arlington in spite of the burning heat and the exhaustion of the three hour ' march the scene be or rather the imagination of the man invest each step with a sort of awe they be at last in the enemy 's territory it have be hold by the union force only by dint of large number and strong fortification there be not a man in the company that do not resent the fact constantly obtrude itself on the rank as they march eagerly onward by every knoll every bush in the landscape that union soldier have be there before they that they devour eye be not the first to mark these historic spot tire as they be and burdensome as the heavy knapsack and still heavier ammunition have become they hear a aide give the order to bivouac with chagrin they so long to put undebatable ground behind they and really be where the distant coppice might be a curtain to the enemy the caribee mark with indignant surprise that when they have turn into a field about seven o'clock the long line follow they push onward until far into the night and they envy the contiguity this would give the lucky laggard to first see and engage the enemy but they turned-to very merrily in this first night of real soldier they be in the field all the parade part of military life be now relax the hot little dress coat be leave behind there be no display even guard-mount be reduce to the simplest possible form with one impulse all the man -- that be all who have be alert enough to provide pen and paper -- bestow themselves about the candle allot each group and begin letter home date magniloquently headquarters in the field tyler 's division sherman 's brigade 16th July 1861 the imperial impulse manifest itself in these curt epistle i can not resist give jack 's : dear mother : how i wish you and polly could see we now we be really on the march at last the battle can not be far off we be not many mile from the enemy and if he stand what glorious news you will hear very soon i wish you could have see we to-day colonel sherman who be the sternest look man i ever see a regular army officer once a professor tell the major -- you know mcgoyle be command we now -- he be a brick -- sherman tell he that the caribee do as good march as the regular who come behind we dear old mick with he brogue and he blarney have win every heart in the regiment and you may be sure we shall see the whites of the enemy 's eye under he which we never should have do under that odious hessian oswald -- in hospital now thank heaven -- though some time when i tell you the story you will see that in this as in most other thing heaven help those who help themselves tap will sound in five minute and i can only add that i be in good health glorious spirit and unshaken confidence that we shall return to acredale before you longing to see you son overcome you love of glory we shall return victor if not hero -- at least i know that you and polly will believe this of you affectionate and dutiful son jack barney read one or two phrase of he composition to the indulgent ear of jack and the poet over which they laugh a good deal we be he say before the enemy i feel as we great ancestor baron moore feel at fontenoy when the sassenach be over against the french line -- as if all the blood in munster be in my vein and i want to spill it on the villain ferninst we the poet decline to quote from he epistle and the three friend sit in the dim light until midnight wonder over what the morrow have in store dick perley listen in awe to jack 's wonderful ratiocination on what be to come -- secretly believe he much more learn in war than this general mcdowell who be command the army the first bugle sound at three in the morning in the caribee ' camp and when the coffee have be hastily dispatch the man begin to understand the cause of they be shunt into the field so early the evening before while the rear of the column march ahead of they the caribee pass a mile or more of encampment the man not yet arouse and when at daylight the whole body be in motion they be in advance with nothing before they but a few hundred cavalry a delirious expectation a rapturous sense of hold the post of danger keep every sense in such a thrill of anticipation that the hour pass like minute the dusty road the intolerable thirst and the nauseous tepid water the blistered foot the abraded hip where the cartridge-box begin to wear the flesh -- all these woe of the march be ignore in the one impulse to see the ground ahead to note the first sight of the enemy it be not until four o'clock in the afternoon that the column be halt and two company k and h be march out of the column and form in platoon across the line of march that the regiment learn with mortification that hitherto the route have be inside the union line they soon see the difference in the tactic of the march the company be spread out in group of four these again be separate by a few yard and in this order sweep like a drag-net they advance over the dry field through the clustering pine or into cultivate acre and through great farm-yard back of they the long column come slowly wind over the sandy highway which curve through the undulating land here and there the skirmisher -- for that be the office the two company be now fill -- come upon sign of picket-post and once as jack hurry beyond he group to the thicket near a wretched cabin a horse and rider be visible tear through the foliage of a wind lane he draw up he musket in prompt recognition of he duty but he see with mortification that the horse and rider continue unharmed other shot from the skirmish-line follow but jack 's rebel be the only enemy see when in the early dusk a orderly from the main column bring the command to set picket and bivouac for the night jack would have write with better grounds for he solemnity if he have wait until this evening but now there be no chance the company be the extreme advance of the army nothing between they and the enemy but detach picket of cavalry at long distance apart to fly back with the report of the least sign make by the rebel these meager group be forbid fire or any evidence of they presence that might guide hostile movement and the infantry outpost feel that they be really the guardian of the sleep thousand a mile or so behind they no one mind the cold water and hard bread which for the first time form the company 's fare that night like the cavalry fire be forbid they they form little group in the rear of the outer line of picket discuss with animation -- even levity -- the likelihood of a engagement the next day it be the general opinion that if beauregard mean to fight he would have make a stand at some of the excellent point of vantage that have be encounter in the day 's march jack smile wisely over these amateur guess and quite abashed the rest when he say : beauregard be no fool he army be mass near the point that he be guard -- manassa junction you seem to think that war be a game of chance army fight just where they happen to meet each other not at all we business be to march to richmond beauregard 's business be to prevent we to do this he must first of all keep he line of supply safe a army without that be like a ship at sea without food -- the more of a crew the worse the situation of course beauregard have he skirmisher spread out in front of we but as there be no use in kill until some end be to be gain they have get out of we way if the spy that be in we rank should send information that promise to give the rebel a chance to get at a big body of we man before the whole army come up you would see a change of thing very quick we have get fifty thousand man or thereabout -lrb- jack be wrong there be but thirty thousand -rrb- now these man be stretch back of we to washington fifteen mile or more because the artillery must be guard and infantry only can do that now suppose beauregard find that there be a gap somewhere between the force stretch back and he happen to have ten or fifteen thousand man handy why he just swoop down upon we and if we can not defend ourselves until the rest of the army come up he have win what be call a tactical victory and endanger we strategy goodness jack you ought to have be commander-in-chief you talk war like a book barney cry in mock admiration the war-talk go on late into the night for the company detach from camp be not oblige to follow the signal of the bugle that come in melodious echo over the fragrant field it be a thrilling sight as the lone watcher peer backward the June field for mile be dot with blaze spire as if the earth have open to pour out column of flame guide the wanderer on they try way the sleep of the night be desultory and fitful excitement stimulate everybody to wakefulness chapter ix the assyrian come down like the wolf on the fold the next morning the march be resume by daylight the two company remain on the skirmish-line the country gradually become more rugged as the route bring they near centreville there be no hill -- a bare but not bleak champaign mostly without house or farm as the north know they sluggish brook become more frequent but none that be not easily fordable there be no landmark to hold the mind to the scene nor in case of battle give the strategist point of vantage for the iron game about noon the detach group stalk a little negligently now over the tedious plain be startle by the unexpected on the green slope of a hill a mile or more ahead a score of little puff of white smoke be see then a sharp report and in some place near by the ground be break as if by a thrust of a spear and little scrap of clay scatter over the greensward then the bugle sound a halt a few minute later the horseman spread in a chain across the line of march ride swiftly to a common center form in a solid group turn to the rear and ride back of the skirmisher to the main body company k watch they as they gallop back and as they reach the group at the head of the long line a half-mile or so distant a body of man hasten forward laden with stretcher and hospital appliance ah at last it be now real war the bugle sound forward and with a elastic spring the group of four push dauntlessly ahead they eye be fix on the brow of the hill separate from they by a narrow depression the whole line -- perhaps three mile wide -- but of course not at all regular conform largely to the difficulty encounter move down the sloping bank on a run before they reach the bottom they be a excellent target and for the first time that most blood curdling of sound -- the half-singing half-hissing z-z-z-ip of the minie-ball -- numb the ardor of the bravest it be such a malignant direct devilish admonition of murder it come so unexpectedly no matter how well you be prepare that achille himself would feel a spasm of fear and when it strike it do its work with such a venomous exultant splutter that there seem something animate demoniac in it the volley as i say come as the man be hurry down the hill by they own momentum and by the sharp fall in the ground the ball pass too high or too low but they impress the fact on enthusiast who have long for battle that one might die for one 's country and not die gloriously it seem such a ignoble such a dastardly outrageous thing that death could come to they from unseen hand for as yet they have not see a soul but now they be at the foot of the hill -- though it be not correct to so call it for it be a long wind valley through which run a dancing streamlet very welcome to the thirsty warrior when they have succeed in break through the vicious natural _ chevaux de frise _ of blackberry-brier and nettle but now there be not much time to slake thirst the bullet have begin to come regularly and suddenly as jack conduct he squad across the stream he be startle by the exclamation utter rather in reverence it seem to he than surprise or pain : my god i be hit yes a fair-haired lad -- one of he class -- totter a second in a limp helpless way and fall headlong pitch into the little stream jack run and lift he out but even before the hospital corps come the boy be dead the bullet have go quite through he heart however now the first numbing terror of the bullet be change to a sort of revengeful delight relinquish any return fire for a moment the company with a great shout that sound all along its front dash up the hill through the scrub-oak at the brow and then they could see the enemy slowly retire a chain of they a mile or more wide while one of the rebel rank fire the other knelt or lay flat upon the ground load where there be no natural obstacle to take shelter behind a vengeful shout run along the union line capture they -- do not fire and with one impulse the group lie forward so swiftly that the enemy believe the rush only momentary delay too long and in two minute the union line be pell-mell among they surrender jack shout to the squad just ahead of he -- surrender or we 'll blow you head off and along the line for some distance to he left and right he could hear he own exultant demand echo there be nothing to do for the rebel who have neglect to keep they enemy at the proper distance but throw up they hand jack 's squad send back twenty-three prisoner to major mike who take they in proud triumph to general tyler ride with the head of the column now that the tenacity of the rebel skirmisher make it seem probable that there would be serious work but though the firing keep up as the union force advance no obstacle more serious than the thin line of the skirmisher reveal itself at dusk the bugle move with the captain in the rear sound the rally and then the scattered group come together in company they be to bivouac on the spot to await they regiment when it arrive meanwhile to the bitter discontent of the caribee company they post of honor be take by new troops and they know that next day they would march in line they have so enjoy the glory of the first volley the first death and the first prisoner that not remember military procedure they resent the change as a aspersion upon they valor when the regiment come up however they forget they mortification in the eager question and envious jocularity of the rest company k and h be so beset that they forget to boil they coffee and would have go thirsty to they dewy bed if the other company ' cook have not share they ration with the gossip hero as darkness fall the sky be redden for mile with pillar of fire and for a time the caribee think it be the enemy but tom twigg who have be with the major at headquarters explain to jack that the army be divide into three body of about ten thousand man each and that tyler 's column of which the caribee be the advance be the extreme northern body that they be now at vienna far north of manassa where schenck have be beset a month before in he never-enough-ridiculed reconnaissance by train that in the morning they be to push on to fairfax court-house and thence to centreville where the army be to come together for the blow at the rebel jack and he friend be a good deal chagrin to learn that they be not as near the enemy as the column to the south of they whose fire have be mistake for beauregard 's though the levée come to a end at tap no one feel sleepy and the excitement banish the pain of fatigue major mike saunter through the dark line near midnight hear the tale still go on in drowsy monotone but good-naturedly make no sign though not give the skirmish-line next day -- the 17th -- jack be delighted to find that the caribee lead all the rest with they ride the commander of the brigade colonel sherman whom the soldier think a very crabbed and grumpy sort of a fellow he red hair bristle straight up and out when he take he slouch hat off as he do very often for the heat be intolerable he eye have a merry twinkle however that win the heart of the lad as he ride by scrupulously striking into the field to save the panting and heavily laden line every extra step he could often in after-day -- when sherman have become the turenne of the army -- jack who be often hear to brag of he gift of detect greatness use to turn very red in the face when he be remind of a say of he on that hot July day : that chap be too lean and hungry to have much stomach for a fight he look better fit for wield the ferule than the sword schoolmaster be write in every line of he face and stamp in he pedagogue manner the march that day be south by a little west and about nine o'clock a cool morning breeze lift the cloud of dust far enough above the horizon to reveal the distant blue of the mountain the whole line seem to come to a pause in the enchant mirage-like spectacle the shenandoah jack say mop the dust or rather the thin coating of mud from he face and brow for the perspiration ooze at every pore naturally cover the expose skin with a unpremeditated cosmetic the march to fairfax court-house for which judicial temple the curious soldier look in vain be but eight mile from the point of departure in the morning but it be two o'clock in the afternoon when the caribee pass the hamlet turn sharply to the right they march up the deep cut of project railway where for a time they be shaded from the sun by the high bank but emerge presently on the warrenton pike they see evidence that other column -- whether friend or foe they could not tell -- have recently precede they score of the raw and overworked be break down now every hour the dust and heat be insupportable whenever the march come near water all thought of discipline be forget and the pant miner-like host break for the invite stream the officer be powerless to enforce discipline when these break happen the column be force to come to a halt until every man have fill he canteen -- and here be one among the many trivial cause that bring about the reverse of mcdowell 's masterly campaign a march that ought to have be make in twenty-four hour or thirty at the utmost take more than three day one of those day save to the army would have enable mcdowell to finish beauregard before the ten thousand re-enforcement from the shenandoah come upon he flank at bull run but we shall see that in proper time for there be nothing more dramatically timely or untimely than this incident in the history of battle unless it be blücher 's miraculous appearance at waterloo when napoleon suppose that grouchy be pummel he twenty mile away there be no provost guard to spur on the straggler and when late in the afternoon the way-worn column spread themselves on the western slope of the hamlet of centreville at least a third of each regiment be far in the rear nearly every man have in the heat and burden of the march throw away the provision in he haversack and that night ten thousand man lay down supperless on the grateful greensward happy to rest and sleep mother earth must have minister to the weary flesh for at sunrise when the music of the bugle arouse they they start up with the alert vivacity of old campaigner provision that should have be with the column the night before arrive in the morning while the reinvigorate rank be at coffee there be a great clatter in the rear and presently a _ cortége _ of mount officer appear general mcdowell among they dick perley who be at the brigade headquarters with grandison come to the caribee presently with great news the battle be to begin that very day general tyler be to go forward to a river call bull run where beauregard be wait the whole army be to spread out like a fan and fight he he have see the map on the table and the place could not be more than four mile away yes they all look eagerly to the westward now the mountain in the distance roll themselves down into lower and lower ridge and just about four mile ahead could be see a range that seem to melt into a wide plateau fringe deeply with scrub-oak and cluster of pine jack have provide himself with a field-glass standing in the middle of the warrenton pike a fine highway that run downward as solid as a roman causeway for four or five mile he could see the break make by the bull run river and -- yes by the glaive of battle -- he could see the glistening of bayonet now and then where the screen of wood grow thinner the general too be examine the distant line and jack take it as a good omen that sherman grow jocose and appear to be make merry with tyler whose face look trouble now that the decisive moment seem at hand but the day pass and there be no advance it be not until late in the evening that the cause become know the army have be wait for supplies ammunition and what not that should have be on the field the day before the caribee be make frantic too by what seem a battle go on to the south of they a few mile to the leave the camp that night be a grand debate society every man propound a theory of strategy that would have edify general mcdowell no doubt if he could have be give a _ précis _ of the whole how such thing become know it be difficult to guess but every man in the column know that the general have plan to put forward he thirty thousand man in the form of a half-moon cover about ten mile from tip to tip the right or northward horn be to be considerably thicker and of more body than the left or southern when the time come this right be to curve in like a hook and cut the ground out from the left wing of the rebel army this be the homely way these unscientific strategist make the movement know to each other and it very aptly describe the formulate plan of battle save that of course there be gap between the force here and there along this human crescent long before daylight sherman 's brigade with a battery of gun and a squadron of cavalry set out due south leave the broad warrenton pike far to they right hand such a country as the march lead into no one have ever see in the north outside of mountain region -- deep gully waste of gnarled and aggressive oak that tear clothes and flesh in the passage sudden hillock rise conical and inconsequent every few rod deep chasm conduct driblet of water morass cover with dark and stagnant pool where the pioneer fairly pick they step among squirm reptile a stream sometimes large as a river crawl languidly through deep fissure in the red shale protect the left flank of the column the cavalry be force to hold the narrow wood road as the bush be hardly passable for man hi jack barney cry catch he breath at the edge of a muddy stream what sort of a place must the rebel be in if they let we promenade through such a jungle as this unopposed i have be think of that jack reply and so have every man in the expedition -- for to think be one of the drawback as well as one of the excellence of the soldier in the civil war but presently after five hour of laborious work a halt be call the man dive into they haversack and even the brackish water in the nearest sedge pond have a flavor of nectar and the invigoration of a tonic on they tear again the whole body push on in skirmish-like dispersion suddenly the land change they be climb a rolling table-land clear in some place as though the axe of the settler have be at work the march be now easier and the picket-line be strengthened then a sharp volley come as if from the tree-top the march be instantly halt the mass move in a column be deploy -- that be stretch out to cover a mile or more as it move forward the cavalry divide and ride far to right and leave to see that no ambush be set to enable the rebel to sneak in behind the vast human broom as it sweep through the solemn aisle of the pine now rise in vernal column thicker and thicker the firing be go on now in scatter volley and soon the wound -- a dozen or more -- be carry back through the silent rank joke have now cease lip be compress eye glitter and the man avoid meeting each other 's gaze it be the moment of all moment the most try to the soldier when he be expect every instant a hurricane of bullet and yet see no one to avenge he anguish on or forestall in the deadly work but they have be move forward all the time the hurtle bullet sweep through the leafy cover now and then thump into the soft pine with a vicious joyousness as if to say to each man the next be for you see how well we work be do for these hideous missile have a language of they own as every man that stand fire can tell the skirmisher be now all draw in the solid line must do the work at hand no one but the commander and he confidant know the work intend save that to kill and be kill be the business to be do the panting line be on high clear ground now and they can see absolutely nothing but the irregular depression that mark the channel of the bull run as it rush down to the rappahannock the line be move along steadily look to left and right jack can see the color of three regiment and he eye rest with pleasure on the bright shine fold of the caribee ' dark-blue state flag spread to the breeze beside the star of the union be they to cross the river evidently for the command be still forward bear center bear right then square in front where the thick broad leaf of the oak glitter in the sun there be see a cylinder of steam-like smoke with fiery gleam at the end a crackling explosion of a hogshead of fire-cracker then a rush scream sound in they very face then a few rod behind a ringing vicious explosion they be in the very tooth of a mask battery the union skirmisher have be withdraw too soon the main line will be tear to piece for retreat be as fatal as advance lie down man the command ring out and be echo along the column the gun have the range and the enemy know the ground the caribee be directly in the sweep of the artillery and the command come to they by company to crawl backward expose themselves as little as may be presently two brass gun be bring up behind the caribee the gunner have note the point of the enemy 's fire the man point the big muzzle with intrepid equanimity firing over the prostrate blue coat for twenty minute perhaps half a hour this be keep up then there be silence on the hill beyond the column rise to its foot and at the command forward they start with a rush and a cheer five hundred yard onward and a solid mass of gray coat confront they a volley be fire and return the exult caribee with two line behind they give a loud cheer and in a instant the gray mass have disappear as if the earth have open the skirmish-line advance now pick up a half-dozen or more wounded rebel besides two or three who have become confuse in the hasty retreat and run toward the yankee instead of they own line jack 's comrade hold this conversation with one of the prisoner : i say reb what place be this mitchell 's ford much of you army here ` nuff to lick you un out of you boot i reckon what do they run across the ford for then oh you 'll see soon enough -- when we folk get ready who be in command here general bonham of south carolina how many man about well there be right smart on to a million i reckon they have to cut the tree down yonder to get room for 'em the man 's eye twinkle as he give this precise approximation but barney who have bring the humorist in whisper to the captain to let he have a moment 's speech with the man before he be send away the captain nod and barney say innocently : have anything to eat to-day not a mouthful the train be all take up with soldier come from richmond have a bit of beef -- and here be a cracker or two you can have some coffee if the guard will let you make it old longstreet himself would envy I now the rebel cry he mouth stuff with the cold meat and hard-tack almost as fresh and crisp as soda-cracker for the contractor have not yet learn the trick of make they out of sawdust white sand and other inexpensive substitute for flour longstreet barney say carelessly yes that be the commander of the right wing just below at blackburn 's ford blackburn 's ford yes that be a mile down and really behind you un for the run make a big elbow to the east i tell you what it be yank you 'll see snake right soon for we folk be behind you sure enough a crackle to the left confirm this and the captain who have listen to barney 's adroit cross-questioning send the man with a note to colonel sherman a few rod in the rear ten minute later the column fall into rank again and move off swiftly southeastward a march of a mile or so bring they to a bold ridge cut down almost aslant to the clear water of the run the skirmisher for some reason have not push ahead to explore the ground and the regiment march in close mass come out in a rather disorderly multitude on the ridged crest a hundred yard nearly below the water-course be fringe with thick copse of oak and the gently ascend slope on the western bank be completely hide from the union line a few gaunt almost limbless tree rise up spectrally on the ridge offer the compact mass neither shelter from the sun nor security from the enemy -- if there be a enemy near dick come up to jack out of breath with great news just as the caribee be align themselves to move forward general tyler just tell richardson -- a brigade commander -- that the rebel have retreat from manassa and he -lrb- tyler -rrb- be go to have the glory of occupy the work : that mcdowell think the army would have to fight a big battle to get -- glory the group shout near enough to hear and the delightful story run up and down the line by a telephone process that be much swifter than edison 's electric invention a roar of gratulatory triumph break -- a roar so loud and inspiring that for a moment the densely packed mass do not distinguish a ear-splitting outburst just in front of they but on the instant pierce shriek among the huddle cheerer -- cry of death and agony -- change the paean of triumph into wail of anguish and mortal pain a panic -- instant unreasoning irresistible -- fall upon the mass a breath before so confident a third of the regiment seem to wither away the color fall in the struggle group in the center hoarse shout indistinguishable and ominous could be vaguely hear from the staff and line direr still hideous clamor of mask cannon right in they very face add the horror of surprise to the disorder of attack and the thick blue line break in irrestrainable confusion the terror of the unknown seize officer and man alike in five minute the crest be clear and the ignoble vanity ignorance and self-sufficiency of one man have undo in a hour the splendid work of the commander-in-chief a _ mêlée _ of miserable disgraceful disorder ensue the rebel sharpshooter hurry to the flank pour in hurtle murderous volley fill the mind of the panic-stricken mob with the idea the most awful that can enter a soldier 's mind that he line be surround hundred throw away gun and everything that could impede flight other hundred fire wildly wherever they see move man and thus aid the rebel in kill they own comrade for it be into the support union force they direct they random shot the fire grow every instant more bewildering shot come in volley from every direction and the helpless horde dart wildly together -- sometimes toward instead of from the enemy have the rebel be as numerous as they be crafty the brigade could have be seize _ en masse _ but now sherman be at hand with fresh regiment other be at he heel and the contest take on some of the order of intelligent action the rebel too be re-enforced but the disposition make by the union chief bring the combat to equal term the clamor of cannon and musketry continue a hour though the line be now among the friendly undergrowth and the loss be not serious but the caribee with the regiment support they have be blot from the scene as a factor for hour the scattering group flee -- flee in ever-increasing panic and it be long after dark before the remnant of the regiment come into camp at centreville poor jack he give no heed to supper that dreadful night he throw himself on the ground too exhaust to think and too dishearten to talk he could not understand the shameful panic the caribee be not coward every man in the regiment have long for the battle when under fire at mitchell 's ford a hour earlier than the disaster at blackburn all have stand firmly in place fight with coolness and give no sign of fear the volume of fire when they break be not much greater than the mitchell 's ford volley during the night grandison come to camp and assemble the officer he express he sorrow at the sudden shadow that have fall on the fair fame of the regiment but since the panic have not be follow as such outbreak often be by the total destruction of the man there would be abundant chance to redeem the disgrace of the day he have himself beg the division commander to give the man another trial and he have stake he commission on they do such duty as would remove the tarnish of the afternoon from they banner the officer have be dispirited major mike have rage over the field through the wood a very angry man indeed belabor the flee man with he sword and implore those he could not reach to come to I here dress on I there be no call to be afeard we have more man than they have and we 'll soon wallop they but the resounding blow on the back of those near the officer do not give the encouraging emphasis to he appeal that captivate man whose reasoning faculty be almost go for the moment before daylight on the next morning -- Saturday the 20th -- the company be call together and little address be make to the man by the officer the substance of colonel grandison 's word be impart and the hope express that when in the course of that or the next day the regiment be again under fire they would show that the panic of yesterday have not be cowardice the man say nothing and every one be glad that the light be so dim that the officer could not look in they face though as a matter of fact the shoulder-strap have show as little fortitude as the musket in the dispersion all that day the force rest the caribee provide themselves with new arm and equipment or the two or three hundred who have fling they own away during the afternoon a incident happen in the division that lessen the mortification of the caribee a splendid regiment and a battery of bronze gun come into the highway from the extreme of the line that be expect to take part in the battle which all know would be open the next morning every one be surprise to see the man move without musket and the color wrap in they case where you bind for some one at the roadside yell curiously we time be out we be go home then a derisive howl follow the line as it pass through the mass of the army and remark of a acrid nature be make that be not gratify to the depart patriot : do not you want a guard to protect you do you mamma know you be out alone wait till to-morrow and we 'll send beauregard 's force to see you safe home the man and officer look very conscious and uncomfortable under the gamut of jeer for word go along the line and all along the route to the rear they pass through this clamor of contemptuous outcry well i think we have reach the eminent deadly pinnacle of disgrace barney say with a sigh as a group of company k watch the considerable number take out of mcdowell 's small army but this sight make I feel like the man on trial for murder who escape with a verdict of manslaughter chapter x blood and iron late at night dick come down to jack 's bivouac with a strange tale mcdowell have come to tyler 's quarter storm with rage he have accuse that officer of disobey order in force a fight on the ford of bull run where he have be tell to merely reconnoitre the staff believe that tyler would be cashier for he have not only wreck the general 's plan of battle but he have give the rebel the secret of the movement and demoralize one wing of the army by put raw soldier in front of mask battery that could have be detect by proper outpost work then one of the staff report a speech tyler have make when he troops rush over the empty rebel breastwork and fort around centreville he officer be discuss the probable force beauregard have behind the crooked stream beyond i believe we have get they on the run tyler say exultingly from what we see here i tell you the great man of this war be the man that plant the flag at manassa and i be go through to richmond to-night not much comfort in know we have get such a fool for a commander jack cry thinking of the disgrace of the day before and of the small chance the regiment have under such a chief to redeem its prestige on the morrow all personal grief everything but the pend battle be drive from the man 's mind as the sign of the momentous work of the morrow accumulate the hospital corps be up in force the yellow flag float from a immense tent near the roadway a great _ cortége _ of general officer ride away from mcdowell 's quarter about ten in the evening the haversack be fill with three day ' cook ration one hundred round of ammunition to a man be deal out to each company everything not absolutely necessary be order to the company wagon the talk in the camp that night be of home -- of anything and everything but the dreadful to-morrow so long look forward to with eager hope now regard with uncertainty that be not so much fear as the memory of the panic at blackburn 's ford jack be provide with a large atla map of virginium and with the bit of information give by dick he be able to conjecture the probable plan of the next day the crony of company k listen in delight to he exposition of the action here he say be the bull run it make two big elbow eastward toward we -- one about four mile to the northwest of we the other about eight mile to the southeast of that and about four mile from we right hand here the rebel we quiz yesterday say that there be five ford between the warrenton pike bridge -- that be just ahead of we yonder at the end of the road we be on -- the last one be mclean 's ford at the very knuckle of the elbow that be crooked toward we a mile west of where we be yesterday that be near the railway which it be beauregard 's business to fight for and we business to get for then he will have to fall back near richmond to feed he army now from the railway where it cross bull run near mitchell 's ford to the warrenton road which beauregard must also hold be about nine mile he must guard all these ford and we must fight for any one or two of they that we need to cross by the only problem be whether we general be go to strike with he right arm at mitchell 's ford he left arm at this very warrenton road we be on or whether he mean to butt the middle of the line of beauregard 's battle to break he into two piece what would frederick the great or napoleon do nick ask absorb in jack 's confident predication if frederick have equal force he would have a reserve just where we shall be in the morning -- there at that point marked ` stone ridge ' and move a heavy mass to the southwest below mclean 's ford there where you see the railway run along the run for a half-mile or more or he would send this body to the northeast over there where you see sudley spring mark in rather large letter and he would by either one of these movement turn the enemy 's flank -- that be get in behind he and force he to change front to fight something that be rarely do successfully in battle napoleon would on the contrary mass all he best troops at the stone bridge open the fight with every piece of artillery he could bring to bear and in the panic send division ten deep across the bridge which would be the better plan ah that no one can say the first be sure enough and less dangerous if the commander be not certain of he man because you notice that we feel excellent and confident all day so long as we be march forward and push the enemy from we path the trial in battle be to be keep stand under fire not sure where you enemy be and then you notice that we own gun behind we send shot and shell over we be just as try as the rebel ' only soldier of the very first class can be depend on in the napoleon tactic we be not soldier of the first class and you may be sure mcdowell who be many year in europe and who be a trained officer will make use of the maneuver best calculate to bring out whatever there be in he man as a matter of opinion i should say that in view of the miserable affair on the right yesterday he will strike out for sudley spring where we shall have the rebel just as you would have I if you be at my side hold my left arm behind I ready to break my back with you knee plant in it jack be sergeant of the guard that night and it be in the group of sentry await they relief every two hour re-enforce by he tent-mate of company k that these learn dissertation on war be carry on it be a never to be forget Saturday night to million yet live in washington the president and he cabinet sit far into the morning hour receive the dispatch from the weary and disappointed chief -- for if tyler have not make he miserable attempt to reach manassa the battle would have be fight that vital Saturday and the result would have be another story in history as the morning break red and murky the army be up and in line but without the usual noisy signal the artillery-horse begin to move first wherever it be possible the heavy gun be push forward on the sward to prevent the loud metallic clangor that penetrate the still air like clash anvil by half after six the advance brigade the caribee in they old place be within gunshot of the stone bridge ah ha jack it be the napoleonic plan barney cry as the artillery take place in front of the mass lie on the ground wait jack cry owlishly the battle be not fight always where the gun be loudest but the gun be now loud and quick the rebel behind a thick screen of tree take up the challenge and every sound be drown in the roar of the artillery a few far in the rear be wound -- those nearest the rebel be in the least danger whether because the gun could not be sufficiently depressed or because the gunner be poor hand could not be determine a breathless suspense a insatiate craving to see to move to fly forward or do anything devour the prostrate rank the firing have go on two hour or more which seem only so many minute when to the group near general tyler a courier panting and dusty ride in great excitement general tyler the major-general have just learn that the enemy have cross in force at blackburn 's ford below you you be at once to take measure to protect you left flank ah ha jack frederick 's on the other side eh barney say as standing near the group these word reach they ear perhaps there be two frederick at work look yonder hand he he glass as he speak thunder we whole army be march over there to the right and we sha 'n' t even see the battle they be four mile off why what a immense army we must have i think this be the bulk of it but we be not a brigade compare to that now barney i feel confident that be the grand movement look how they fly along the field be as good as road out there and if it be not for the artillery they could make five mile a hour now keep you ear open my lad : you 'll hear music off there to the northwest music that will make beauregard sick if that courier 's information be exact for do not you see as we be place here with that gully to we left and the thick wood in front we could hold this ground against six time we number company k be now send forward to the right to relieve a body of skirmisher that have be hide on the margin of bull run some distance to the westward of the stone bridge jack go forward with he glass notice a officer among the man but not catch sight of he face do not recognize he be that a rebel or one of we fellow one of the man say point to a horseman disappear in the wood four hundred yard to the right and in front of the company march in a straggle line two abreast by the flank as it be call jack take he glass to discover but the rider have disappear a instant after from a knoll jack glass at eye be examine eagerly the field on the other side of the river when a horseman suddenly shoot into view ride desperately by george it be the same man i wonder how he cross the stream there must be a bridge down there among those thick tree and bush jack say excitedly be you sure sergeant that be the same man that be in the wood to the right there five minute ago jack turn the officer be at he shoulder he salute respectfully recognize with a thrill of joy old red top as the company call sherman yes colonel it be the same man he be in he shirtsleeve and have a blue scarf tie about he arm there can be no mistake several of we see he quite plainly if that be true we have gain a half-day 's work in two minute he be look diligently through the glass as he speak and he eye brighten as he mark the man until he disappear he turn to a orderly that be follow at a distance lead a horse mount this lightly the colonel ride to the head of the company and say in a short decisive tone : come ahead man at a double-quick until you strike the stream he keep beside the man as they move in fifteen minute they be at the water 's edge then the company be deploy as skirmisher two third halt where they strike the water and the rest keep on up the bank of the river for a few hundred yard sherman be eye every inch of the bank until suddenly reach a break where fresh track of a horse be visible he direct he orderly to follow and plunge into the water it be not up to the horse ' knee from bank to bank ride back he face aglow the colonel order the captain to cross half he man and station they up and down on the bank where they would not be see by the rebel on the high ground above then address jack he say : sergeant select two or three trusty man follow the bank of the stream until you come to general hunter 's division which may be a mile perhaps more to the right yonder you can tell by the firing soon tell general hunter that we have discover a ford and shall not have to fight for the stone bridge we shall be across in no time and take the enemy in the rear if you can not find hunter give this intelligence to any officer in command stay he scribble a line on a sheet of he order-book say : this will be you authority it be better not to write the rest for fear you should be capture in case you be in danger tell each man with you what to say so that there will be more chance of get the information where it will do good and remember sergeant that this news in hunter 's hand will be almost equivalent to victory ah he pause again reverberate crash come from the high grounds up the river you will have no trouble in find he now those be hunter 's gun hurry glowing grateful big with the fate of the battle jack have barney nick and another whom he charge with the duty of historian detail for this duty of glory the group set off with a fervent godspeed from the company sheltered among the thick pine and oak now boy jack say every inch the captain we must spread out like skirmisher we chief danger will be from the leave as no one will be likely to be in the water but we own man and we must look as sharply for they as for the enemy i will take the center you barney the leave next to I and you nick four pace farther to the left jack look at he watch it be just 930 Sunday morning July 21 1861 the crash of musketry ahead now become one unbroken roar with a _ crescendo _ of artillery that fairly shake the ground the messenger be dart over for all be on a dead run the bush grow thick on the hillside and they branch be stubborn as crab thorn hell as barney afterward remark would have be cool in comparison to the heat as the adventurer tug and wrestle forward now gun be roar on every side save the river behind before to the leave the thunder play upon the parched land at the end of a half-hour the bullet and shell pass over the group as jack and he squad push along the hilly way twice command and even the clicking of what jack know must be rebel gun sound not twenty pace away but thanks to the thick bush the scout pass unseen and thanks to the noise of battle unheard but now the danger be from friend not enemy ball come hurtle through the tree across the stream and in a low voice jack bid barney summon nick then all slip down to the water 's edge and make they way painfully through the marshy swamp the cane-like rush that fill the narrow valley the run have be a fearful strain upon nick and at length he fall gasp in a clump of cat-tail what be it old fellow jack cry in alarm o jack i can not go a step farther you go on and leave I i shall follow when i get breath he be white and gasp barney fill he canteen from the run water and wet he handkerchief lay it on nick 's parboiled head and temple best a few minute jack say soothingly i will reconnoitre a bit strip off he accoutrements he clasp a tall sycamore grow at the crest of the ravine and when far up bring he glass to bear a third of a mile to the left and southward he could see a regiment with a flag bear a single star surround a small stone farm-house on the brow of a gentle hill they be firing to the west and toward the north where the black cloud obscure he view but the red gleam in the smoke tell of at least a dozen gun and he know that the main battle be there though the fury of it reach far to the east near the stone bridge which he have quit a hour before then through the veil of smoke long deep mass of blue emerge and make for the rebel front on the brow of the hill fairly at jack 's foot the enemy redouble the fire two gun at they left pour canister into the advance wall of blue it never waver but as a group fall to the earth the rest close together and the mass whirl on jack feel like fly oh the grandeur of it the fearlessness the intoxication he almost fall from the tree in he excitement but he take a last sweep of the belching hill hark loud cheer in the tree back of the rebel far to the southeast perhaps a mile and a half then the flaunt palmetto flag fly forward in the center of deep mass of gray which will reach the hill first he can not quit the deadly sight ah the blue line be press on now the cannon-shot pass over they head into the devoted line of gray desperately thin but cling to the key of the battle-field but great god perhaps he delay be aid the enemy he see the route now clear -- straight to the west -- and no rebel near enough to intervene he descend so fast that he hand and leg be blister but he be down look sharp boy you must follow I as best you can i know the route -- there be a forest path directly to we line and we shall be there in twenty minute -- i shall at least he do not stop to see whether he be follow or not but dash on and the rest after he he be far out of sight in a instant it be only by the crackling of the branch that the other keep he course the way be between steep precipitous hill which explain how they could be so near the battle and yet not in it nor harm by the missile fly sometimes very near they at a deep branch of the stream the three rearmost come in sight of jack up to he armpit in water and push for the shore while they be hail he exultantly he sink out of sight a awful anguish almost stop the other but barney fling he musket and impediment off as he run leap far into the stream and when the rest reach the spot he have jack by the hair drag he to the bank he be fairly worn out by the stress and the other loosen he coat stretch he on the brown sward and rub he hand he body it be ten minute it seem a hour before he be able to get up and the rest insist on carry he accoutrements then the wild race be begin again every instant bring they nearer the pandemonium of battle suddenly the sharp command of officer be hear in front and to the left be it the enemy or be it friend the group halt in a agony of doubt how can they find out barney take out he handkerchief and put it on he gun which he be careful to go back and recover when jack be on the bank a ray of bright red suddenly flit above the thick top of the scrub-oak yes god be praise there be the flag of star and there be blue uniform with a wild hurrah drown in the musketry to the leave they rush forward be halt by a picket guard exhibit sherman 's order and be direct to the commanding-officer that personage have no knowledge of general hunter 's whereabouts but colonel andrew porter be just beyond command the brigade to he jack make known sherman 's message and be direct farther to the southwest the union right now face nearly to the east in the execution of mcdowell 's admirable flank maneuver now among they own sherman 's courier run more peril than when skirt the edge of the battle for the shell be direct at the line they be pursue they push to the rear and continue southeastward where hunter 's headquarters be suppose to be but jack be easy on the score of he mission since the general who be nearest the stone bridge have be apprise and well know that the fire which have be come near he left flank be sherman 's until however he have execute he order literally jack will not be satisfied and plunge on the other follow nothing loath but it be a way of pain for the lad now every step they come upon the dead and die the air be fill with moan man whinnying horse the hurry movement of stretcher the solemn solicitude of the hospital corps the line of foremost battle be less terrifying less try than this inner way of golgotha and the four be well-nigh unnerved when they reach a group where the command officer have be point out general hunter jack say address a officer with a star my name be franklin general hunter be wound a hour ago what be the matter jack give he message and franklin say cheerfully : that be good news you be a very brave fellow go a few yard in the rear yonder and you 'll find general mcdowell he 'll enjoy you message on the hill they halt electrify thick copse of scrub-pine dot the gently slope sward here and there clump of tall pine stand in the bare brown sod as if to guard the young outshoot cluster about they in wanton dispersion cow-path mark only by the worn edge of the bush run in zigzag across the hillside and up to the plateau the remnant of rail fence strew the ground here and there the low roof of the farm-house can be see far back even from the depression where the line of blue be now rest a brief deadly half-hour the sun be now behind the halted line of blue the bayonet catch the light make a sea of liquid mirror-like rivulet hover in the air with the bushy branch of pine rise like green isle in the shimmering tide the man be fill they cartridge-box new regiment be glide into the gap where death have cut the widest swath from the wood cry groan command clash steel as the man hustle against each other in the rush into line prelude the vulcan clamor soon to begin man bent sometimes crawl with stretcher on they shoulder glide through the maim and shriek fragment of body pick out here and there those seem capable of carriage other man prone on they face hold canteen of tepid muddy water -- but ah a draught to the feverish lip which seem godlike nectar against the stout body of the tree armless man legless trunk the maim in every condition of death 's fantastic sport hold themselves limply erect to gain succor or save some of the vital stream pour from they gaping wound courier dash up to the impassive chief calm-eyed keen alert survey the line dispatch brief command receive report it be franklin with the air of a marshal on a civic pageant perplex only by some geometrical problem deny the possibility of two right line on the same plane he glance upward toward the brow of the plateau the four flag have be increase by half a dozen ah they have receive aid a tremendous crash come from the left that must be sherman he be on the rebel rear one strong pull and the two body will be unite he left arm reach sherman 's right the shine mirage of steel above the green isle sink the clash of hurtle accoutrements come up musically tranquilly from the low ground the blue mass first deliberately then in a quiet regular run pass like a move barricade up the sloping hillside then from one end of the long wall to the other white puff as of some monster breathing spasmodically the air be a blur of sulphurous blackness the bullet be as thick as if a swarm of leaden locust have be route from the foliage and take wing hillward then behind through the gap in the tree big whine screech swarm of another caliber shell fly over the wall of blue in a moment the ground of the plateau be tear the red clay fly far into the air but now the blue wall be girdle the very crest of the hill it stop shrivels long gap be cut in its broken surface the hillside be dot with sprawling figure the crest be a ragged edge of writhe body and struggle limb forward the wall be advance but shorter it be within reach of the shine gun -- spout flame and iron in the very face of the dauntless wall then there be a pause the smoke hide everything but the maim and quiver heap that strive to crawl backward back to the crest back to the deep that be not rest nor security the hillside be like a field cover with sheaved grain -- with a thousand mangled body that have be man then to these wrestle specter -- for in the dim smoke and tartarean atmosphere the action of load and aim take the shape of huge writhe convulse monstrous grappling -- come quick-moving line of help they rush through they over they the thirteen cannon behind the struggle hydra of gray seem one vortex -- sulphurous flaming spitting as from one vast mouth scorching fire huge mouthful of granite venom back -- back the gray mass break in sinuous definite slow-yielding disruption then a sudden inrush from the left of the broken gray where smoke and space play fantastic trick with the sunshine miraculously a dark mass be project on the shimmering spectrum and a ringing voice be hear : we be save we be re-enforced we will die here then high above the din in the exultant tumult of the deadly win ground the nearest in blue hear a stentorian voice -- grim deliberate exultant : look where jackson stand like a stone-wall at they man let we determine to die here and we will conquer die he do when the yell horde in the sudden outrush graze the edge of the union besom sweep over the plain in a rush of death then behind these spectral shape come other -- thousand -- with wild fierce shout the blue mass be thin to a single line man in command look anxiously to the rear where be burnside where be the twelve thousand man whom hunter and heintzelman deploy in these wood two hour since back slowly fiercely but backward the slender wall of blue be force not defeat but not victorious all this jack see and he turn heartsick from the sight when the straggle courier reach the point designate as mcdowell 's headquarters he have go to the eastward of the line and faithful to the command give he jack set out with barney leave the other to deliver the message in case he miss the general they emerge presently on the edge of a plateau whence nearly the whole battle could be see jack climb a tall oak to reconnoitre the ground for mcdowell but as he glass reveal the battle line he shout to barney to climb for a moment to impress the frightful yet grandiose spectacle upon he mind far off toward the stone bridge now a mile or more northeast of they they could see the union flag wave and mark the white puff of smoke that precede the booming of the cannon every instant the cloud of smoke come southward where the rebel line be conceal by the thick copse but they be break -- always break back anew in twenty minute more at the same rate the hill upon which the rebel line nearest the tree hold the union right at bay would be surround on two side this for the moment be a sulphurous crater the fire-belching demon invisible in the smoke through the glass jack could see the line clearly -- or the smoke arise above they the enemy have be push back nearly two mile since he have leave colonel sherman a few rod above the stone bridge the union force as mark by the veil of smoke curved about the foeman a vast crescent seven mile or more from tip to tip the body oppose be scatter like a gigantic staircase with the angle of the step confront each other step by step but now the union rank at jack 's foot rush forward a group of rider be come to the tree and jack descend hastily to meet the general he be again disappointed it be not mcdowell at a loss what to do he salute one of the officer and state he case recognize as he turn general franklin i do not see that you can do better than remain where you be or still better push to the brow of that hill yonder and act as a picket in case you see any force approach from this side which be not likely give warn we cavalry ought to be here but it be not if you be call to account when the battle be do give I as you authority i take it you brigade will be around here pretty soon if they make as rapid work all the way as they have make since eleven o'clock if the cavalry come you can report to the nearest officer for assignment chapter xi the legion of varus the two free lance set out now relieve of all responsibility and determine to watch the open field and wood to see that this part of the field be not surprise the hill to which the general have direct they be farther from the battle than they have yet be but the work go on to the northeast show that this would soon be the western edge of the combat if sherman continue advance they be soon on the hill and jack post himself in a tree with he glass there be a lull in the quarter they have just quit the smoke roll away and now he can see stream of gray-coat hurry to the edge of the plateau where two hour before he have encounter porter 's brigade can it be possible that porter 's troops do not see these on-rushing horde they be move on the right point of the crescent and unless the union commander be alert they will break in on the back of the point for jack without know it be virtually in the rebel line -- that be he be nearer the rebel leave flank the foot of the long bow-shaped staircase than he be to the tip of the union crescent but no the star and stripe fly forward they be on the very crest whence the defiant gun spit upon they but now the smoke cover everything then there be a calm the ground be clear again the gray mass be pour up to the crest in still greater number a large body of they march down the hill in the rear of the union line conceal by the wood they march right up to the rank where the red-barred flag be fly what can it mean neither side fire there must surely be some mistake hark now the blue line discover -- too late -- that the mass be the enemy and half the line withers in the point-blank discharge they be sweep from the ground jack be tremble -- demoniac the gray mass spring forward they have seize the gun -- four of they -- and turn they upon the disappear blue then a hoarse shout of delirious triumph the gun be lose the day be lose for now there be no blue-coat in sight but no a still wilder shout -- electrifying stentorian -- come across the plateau the blue mass reappear they come with a wild rush in well-ordered array they be the regular jack can tell by they movement it must be the famous rickett 's battery he see at centreville in the morning in five minute the tale be retell and the gun snatch from the worst gray-coat be safe in the hand of they master again the smoke obscure the picture again it clear away and now the gray be in greater force than before and the horseless battery be again the prize of this rapacious grapple swarm in from three side the gray again hold the contest piece the blue vanish into the thick bush another irruption another pall of smoke and jack 's heart bound in exultant joy for he see the new york flag in the van sherman have reach the point of dispute but alas the gun be run back and as the gray line sway rearward in billowy regular measure they retain the titanically contest trophy the sun be now far beyond the meridian the union line be close up compactly one more such grapple as the last and the broad plateau where the rebel artillery be mass point westward northward eastward will be win but a palsy seem to have settle on the line of blue they be motionless while they adversary be hurry man from some secret place where they seem to be inexhaustible the whole battle be now within the compass of a mile but where can these horde come from surely general mcdowell have never be mad enough to leave they disengage along the ford no they do not come from that direction they come at the very center of the rebel rear can it be that troops be arrive from richmond the southern line be longer than the northern but they have be since the first moment jack get a glimpse of they he could see too that they be thinner : that on the spur of the plateau in front of the mass rebel artillery a single brigade be hold the union mass at bay he can almost hear the rebel command as the re-enforcement pour in but now the thunder break out anew roll in vengeful fury around the western and northern base of the plateau the gray line stagger the fall man block the step of the living surely now mcdowell be go to do or die yes the iron game go on the blue line jostle and crush forward they be at the last wall of resistance but what be the sound at he very foot as jack look down in the narrow way between the hill he be on and the plateau on the very edge of the union line -- in fact behind it now for it have move forward since he take post -- a rush mass of gray-clad soldiery be move forward on the dead run in one instant the head of the column be where general franklin ride but a hour or two before he look for barney he can see he nowhere he climb down in haste and discover he comrade soundly sleep against the base of the tree barney the army be ruin be the battle over oh no no but it will be in a moment hark hear that a roar of musketry -- it seem at they very foot then a outbreak of yell so sharp so pierce so devilish the sound that the marrow freeze in they vein arise as if from the whole thicket about they be it too late to warn general franklin barney ask tremble ah barney we be as bad as traitor we ought to have see these rebel before they get near if we have do we duty this would never have happen perhaps it be not too late to get back let I go up and see where we can find a way without run into the enemy reach he perch again jack cast he despairing eye toward the fatal hill it be now clear of smoke and there be not a regiment leave on it he heart leap for a instant the next it be lead for the rank that have disappear be down on the brow of the hill -- in the valley -- rush forward unresisted the red and blue of the union mix with the star and bar of the rebellion but worse than all the rank of gray be sweeping in overwhelming mass quite behind the line of blue cut they down as a scythe when near the end of the furrow to the eastward sherman still cling desperately to the crest he have win but jack see with agony that slip between he and the river a great wedge of gray be hurry forward he last despairing glance catch a body of jet black horse gallop wildly into the disperse rank of blue he come down from the tree limp nerveless unmanned well barney ask it be all over -- we be ruin the army you mean ah yes the army and we too but what be go to become of we i do not much care what become of we -- at least i do not care what become of I but if we do not get back to we regiment they 'll think we be deserter good god yes i forget that i think i can find the way back but we 'll have to be careful the enemy be all around we i can hear they plainly very near follow I and do not speak above a whisper then with swift movement always as near the thick bush as they could push they flee faster and faster as fear fall more and more heavily upon they quicken fancy the thought of the repute of deserter lend they endurance or they must have break down before the weary shifting of that dreadful flight they be now near the spot where they have meet porter 's picket in the morning the sound of battle have die out at interval renew now and again by a outcry of cheer a quick fusillade then more cheer and then a ominous silence but now there be a continuous roll of musketry near the knoll back of the warrenton road the two wanderer breathless with torn uniform swollen face halt gasp to take they bearing they can see the turnpike far beyond the stone bridge half-way to centreville : they see crowd flee in zigzag line over the open field see horse plunge wildly laden down by two and even three man on they back they see vehicle overturn at the roadside whence the horse have be cut or kill by the rebel shell they see a army in every sense a mob swarm behind the desert rebel fort they see orderly rank of shine black horse this side the stone bridge charge the flee line of blue they see shell whirling like huge blackbird in the sky suddenly fall among the skurry thousand they see a shell finally burst on the bridge shiver a caisson to fragment and then all sign of organize flight come to a end but near they meanwhile a sullen fire reply with desperate promptitude to the rebel shot if we can get over to the man fight at the edge of the wood we may be kill or capture but we will not be disgrace jack cry again they make a wide circuit through the wood and now the firing be near at hand come slowly toward they they have only to wait and they will be among the forlorn hope ah with what fervent joy jack mark the union banner flap its twin streamer among the hurtle pine they be near it they be under it they own gun be no longer available hundred be lie at hand they seize they the line be firing in retreat it be a sadly deplete battalion of keye 's regular steadfast imperturbable devote a handful of they have be forget or misdirect the rebel uncertain whether it be not a trap to snare they move with caution while far to the leave a turn column be hurry to hem the union group in on every side there be hardly three hundred blue-coat in the mass but they volley be so swift so regular so steady that they make the impression of a thousand the enemy feel sure as be afterward learn that there be at least a regiment a young captain soil ragged he sleeve hang in ribbon the whole skirt of he coat go move alertly composedly in the center seize a gun when one come handy on the ground where there be plenty scatter steady man steady we shall be at the water 's edge soon and then we can give they hell never music sound sweeter in jack 's car than that jaunty epithet hell how inspiring how little of the ordinary association the word bring up now they be traverse slowly the very ground jack and he comrade have fly over in the morning still firing -- still work with all he heart in the deadly play jack sidle to the officer and cry out : captain i know a ford that will take we across above the stone bridge we discover it this morning shall i guide that way guide if you can but fire like seven devil above all the captain cry seize two or three pouch lie in a mass and empty the cartridge into he pocket there keep to the left sharp and we shall come to a deep gully where the water be only knee-deep jack cry also replenish he cartridge-box which have shrink under the rapid work of the last half-hour what regiment be you sergeant the captain cry look for a moment at the tattered recruit caribee of new york sherman 's brigade and how come you off here you brigade be near the right of the line at the stone budge the captain ask this with a shade of suspicion in he voice jack explain he mission and the officer who have be deal out the timely windfall of ammunition nod poor hunter be shoot early in the advance it would have be victory to we flag if the poor old follow have be wound before the action begin he lose three hour in the attack and give the rebel a chance to come up from winchester now jack understand the mysterious legion that seem to spring from the earth they be johnston 's army from the shenandoah keep up heart man : burnside and schenck be near we somewhere they be in reserve and they 'll give these devil a warm welcome if they push far enough after we then the steady volley grow swifter if that be possible the enemy move steadily after the slowly retire group but now there be a clear field to cross so wide that the smallness of the force must be detect the captain halt the line take he bearing divide the little army into two body order one to move at a double-quick directly across the open the rest be stretch out as skirmisher he retire with the first squad across the field direct the skirmisher to hold the ground until they hear three musket-shot from the wood behind the rebel can now be see closing in very near but the skirmish-line spreading over a wider front evidently perplex they and they halt the three shot be presently hear then the skirmish-line flee in group across the bare downs the vociferating yell of the gray-coat fairly drown the hideous clamor of the musket ah we be save a lieutenant cry wave he cap like a madman look there be man in the wood yonder to we right they be come this way jack turn he be near the captain and he mark with deadly panic a look of despair settle down on the heroic handsome face what could it mean do not he believe that there be man there jack hand he he own glass -- the captain have none by heaven we flag but what troops can they be in that quarter they must be surround like ourselves -- sergeant can you undertake a dangerous duty with all my heart jack cry heartily what be you name and company john sprague caribee company k slip around the edge of the skirt of bush you 'll be within a arm 's length of the enemy all the way reach the place where we see those man a moment since when you get there if they be friendly fire a shot here take this pistol fire that i shall recognize it from the musketry if they be the enemy fire all the barrel as fast as you can and retreat you run great danger you can only by a miracle escape capture but it be we only resource for the next charge we must surrender or die he add look wofully at the meager remnant of he company before the word have fairly end jack be off like a shot forget barney forget everything but the extrication of this grand young roman as he skurry along sometimes on hand and knee he blame himself for not learn the captain 's name he feel sure that a day will come when the world will know and admire it he have gain the other corner and in a moment he will be in the thick copse where the union flag have be see but as he make a dash through a clump of laurel he be confront by two man musket in hand a yank by the lord surrender you damned mudsill for answer jack raise the pistol in he hand and fire the man fall with a frightful yell the other level he musket fairly in jack 's face but before he could pull the trigger a report at he ear deafen jack and the second man stagger against the tree ah ha I boy the rear rank do the best work there barney cry as jack turn to see whence the timely aid have come a day after the fair 's better than the fair itself if the rain have keep the girl away and barney laugh good-humoredly well ` pon my soul barney it be a shameful thing to say but all thought of you have go from my mind i should not have let you come if you have propose it but now we be in for it ah -- as he speak the union flag he have see come forward but it be in the hand of a rebel bearer and be upside down in mockery the sight be enough he fire the shot as agree upon firing two at the group march heedlessly forward as the skirmish-line be far ahead or they suppose it be for the two man disable by jack and barney be the advance as it be not suppose that any but straggler be near at hand and the company be return to they regiment in a instant a fierce volley be return and barney who be fairly in the bush behind a huge tree hear a low groan he look where jack have be and see he lie on the ground stifle a agonized cry by hold he left arm over he mouth barney might have escape at least he might have delay capture but come from behind the tree he hold up he hand and fling himself on the ground beside he comrade take he head upon he knee and await the worst book ii _ the hostage _ chapter xii the aftermath there be not so many million of american in 1861 as there be to-day but they be more american then than they be now that be the old world have not send the million to we shore that now people the waste place of the west it be not until after the civil war that those prodigious host come -- enough to make the populace of such empire as fill the largest space in history that part of the land that love the flag cherish it with a fervor deeper than the half-alien race that first fling it to the breeze under washington they love the republic with something of that passionate idolatry that make the greek 's ideal joy -- death for the fatherland some of that burning zeal and godlike pride that make the earlier roman esteem he citizenship more precious than a foreign crown but until the battle on that awful 21st of July prove the war real -- with the add horror of civil hate -- secretary seward 's epigram of ninety day cling fast in the public mind up to bull run there be a vague feeling that we army in proper time would march down upon the rebel like the host of joshua and scatter they and the rebellion to uttermost destruction in one action it be upon this assumption that the journal of the north satirize abused vilify scott and clamored day by day for a advance upon richmond the damnation of public clamor and not the incompetency of the general set the inchoate army of scott upon that fatal adventure but that humiliating incredible and for year misunderstand Sunday on the plateau of manassa where after all blunder and imbecility bring disaster but not shame upon the devoted soldiery arouse the sense of the north to the reality of war as the overthrow at jemmape in 1793 convince the prussian oligarchy that the republic in france be a fact it be a dreadful Monday in the north when the first hideous bulletin be send broadcast through the city and carry by courier into every hamlet for hour -- sickening hour -- it be not believe we have awaken many a morning since 1861 to hear of throne overturn army vanquish dynasty obliterate to hear of great man go by sudden and cruel death : but the anger and despair when booth 's cruel work be know the shudder horror over garfield 's take off the amazement when the hand of nihilism lay a emperor dead the overthrow of austrium in a single day the extinction of the bonaparte -- these thing be hear and digest with something like repose compare to the bewildering outbreak that meet the destruction of we army at manassa it be not the daze panic-stricken panic anguish that follow fredericksburg or the second bull run it be not the indignant fretful wrath that rebuke official culpability for the destruction of the grand campaign on the peninsula it be a startled incredulous angry amazement in which blame afterward visit upon general or cabinet be humbly take on the people 's shoulder and echo in a moan _ mea culpa _ for day all the people be close kin in the street stranger talk to stranger the pulpit echo the inextinguishable wrath of the street the journal for a moment restrain into solemnity echo for once the real voice of a elevated humanity and not the drivel of partisanship nor the ulterior purpose of wealth and sham even schoolboy arrest in the merry-making of youth look in wonder at the sudden reversal of condition boy well remember in the school that Monday when the northern heaven be hang in black and grief wring its crystal tress in the air the master begin the work of the day with a brief pathetic review of the public agony and dismiss the class that he be too agitate to instruct there be no game on the greensward no swimming in the river no excursion to the malvern cherry grove the street be fill with blank face and whisper crowd unable to endure the restraint of routine or the ordinary calling of life party be obliterate or rather from the flux of this white heat come out in solidify unity that compact of party which for four year breathe the breath of the nation 's life speak the purpose of the republic and amid stupendous reverse and triumph hold the public conscience clear in its sublime duty the woe of bereavement be not wide-spread the kill at manassa be hardly more than we read of now in a disaster at sea or a catastrophe in the mine the whole army engage hardly outnumber the slaughter at antietam gettysburg or burnside 's butchery at st mary 's hill hence the marvel of the instant fusion the swift resolve of the northern mind the battle be the sudden grapple of aggressive weakness -- catch the half-contemptuous strong man unaware and rolling he in the dust bring to earth by this unlooked-for blow the north arise with renew force and the deathless determination that could have but one issue the people when the benumb force of the surprise be master fly together with one mind one voice one impulse the church the public hall the street corner move train and rush steamer be such hustings as the athenian improvise in the portico when she orator inflamed the heart of greece to repel the barbarian to die with leonida in the gorge of the thermopyla ah what a impose spectacle it be the blood of wrath leap fiercely in the chill vein of age the ardor of youth become the delirium of the crusader the lofty zeal of the puritan the chivalrous daring of rupert 's trooper and the dutch devotee of orange a half-million man have be call out a million be wait in passionate eagerness within a month two hundred and fifty million of money have be vote -- ten time that amount be offer in a day every interest in life become suddenly center in one duty -- war it touch the heart of the whole people and for the time they arise purify contrite as the army of mose under the chastening of the rod in acredale there be sore heart as the dreadful news become more and more definite for day the death list be mere guess-work but when the route force return to they camp in washington the awful gap in the rank be ascertain with certainty the caribee be nearly obliterate of the thousand man and over who have march from meridian hill only four hundred be find ten day after the battle elisha boone have hurry at once to washington charge by all the father mother brother and sister of the regiment to make swift report of the absent darling kate be besiege in the grand house with tearful watcher wait in agonizing impatience for the fatal finality olympium to spare she mother the distress of the vague response she telegram bring from washington spend most of the time at the boone ' where thanks to the father 's high standing with the administration the earliest most accurate information come finally he write he have see nick marsh who give the first coherent narrative of jack barney and dick perley they have be see -- the first two in the last desperate conflict a officer -lrb- the hero whom jack have so much admire and who turn out to be gouverneur k warren -rrb- have escape from the forlorn hope leave to dispute the rebel charge upon the fly column he give particulars that point with heart-breaking certainty to the death of the two boy young perley have be lose sight of since noon of the battle he have follow the path take by jack and he comrade across the flank of the enemy he have be see at heintzelman 's headquarters but after that no one could trace he wesley too have be leave near the stone bridge with a ball in either he arm or thigh the informant be not quite sure which as he fall in a charge of the line boone telegraph to kate that he be go through the line with a flag of truce so soon as the affair could be regulate and proffer he best office for the acredale victim everything have be prepare by olympium and she mother for a instant departure so soon as positive information come with they marcia perley go tremble and tearful and telemachus twigg to extricate he son from danger for it be uncertain what he status be in the force kate too join the melancholy pilgrimage that set out one morning follow to the station by weep kinsman implore the good office of these ambassador of woe the sleeping-car give the miserable company seclusion if not rest they be not the only one in quest of the miss for as yet there be no certainty as to the fate of those leave on the field of battle later report have be more encouraging for hundred who be set down as prisoner or miss begin to be hear from as far northward as the maryland line in the station at washington boone meet he daughter twigg hurry to he and ask : any further news mr boone we be all here -- about half acredale yes i see but there be no more news of the caribee we learn that the wound have be send to richmond and i shall set out for there to-morrow mr sprague with olympium and merry drive to the house of a friend she have know year before whose husband be a senator the boone -- or rather kate -- bid they a cordial adieu as they drive off to the national hotel then the most try part of the quest begin the war department be besiege with applicant mostly woman order have be issue to forbid all cross the line and the despairing kinsfolk of the lose be in a panic of impatient terror in vain olympium call upon eminent senator who have be friend of she father in vain she invoke the aid of the secretary of state who have be the family 's guest at acredale once she penetrate by the aid of strong letter to the secretary of war he be surround by a hurry throng of orderly officer and clerk and even after she have be admit to he office olympium be leave unnoticed on a settee wait some sign to approach the dreaded presence he imperious and abrupt manner he alternation of deferential concern for some and disdainful impatience for other give she small hope that he would heed she prayer she wait hour sit in the crowded room ill from the oppressive air the fix stare of the officer and the sobbing of other like herself wait a word with the autocrat at length late in the afternoon when the crowd have quite go she hear the secretary say in a undertone : send a orderly to those woman and see what they want each of the wait woman hand credentials to the young man and each in turn arise tremble and stand before the decisive official at the great paper-strewn desk there be no attempt to soften the refusal as he turn curtly from the pleader and olympium shrinking from the ordeal be about to step out of the room when a tall care-worn man shamble in glance pityingly at she as she arise half tremble recognize the president she step in front of he in a desperate impulse and throw up she veil cry piteously : o mr lincoln you be a father you have a tender heart you will listen to the bereaved he stop look at she kindly and put he left arm wearily on the desk by he side yes my poor girl i be a father and have a heart the more 's the pity for just now something else be need in its place i suppose you father be over yonder and he nod toward the virginium shore o mr lincoln my father be farther away than that my father be senator sprague -- you serve with he in congress -- i -- i -- think that perhaps you might take pity on he widow he daughter he son if the poor boy be still live and -- and -- send you across the line oh if god would put it in you heart it be in my heart fast enough my poor child but -- impossible mr president the enemy as it be can open a sabine campaign on we and tie we hand by stretch northern woman out in a line of battle between the rank it be the weary discouraging voice of the secretary imperiously imply that the executive must not interpose weakness and mercy where draconian rigor sit enthrone the president smile sadly ah mr secretary a sister -- a mother -- give a great deal for the country we can not err much in grant they prayer make out a order -- for whom olympia speechless with gratitude reverence could hardly articulate : my mother myself and miss marcium perley another mother she boy be not of age and run away to join my brother 's company she have a woman 's presence of mind to answer with this diplomatic evasion i be afraid you will only add to you distress my poor child but you shall go he incline he head benignantly and pass into the inner sanctuary behind the rail when olympium hear the secretary say grimly : i shall take measure to stop this sort of thing mr president hereafter you shall only come to this department at certain hour at all other time the door shall be guard a gray-haired man in undress uniform presently appear and as he hand olympium the large official envelope he say respectfully : you never hear of I miss sprague many year ago the senator you father do a kind turn for my brother -- a employé in the treasury if i can be of any aid to you in this painful business pray give I a chance to show a kindness to the family of a great and good man my name be charles bevan and it be sign to one of the papers in this letter within a hour all be ready but they could not set out until the next morning when by eight o'clock the three lady be _ en route _ there be a large company with they all under a flag of truce they pass through the long line of soldiery that lay intrench on the virginia side of the potomac and push on to annandale where the rebel outpost receive they olympium 's eye dwell on the wide-stretching land of pine and oak remember the picture jack have give in he letter of this very same route but there be few sign of war the clear place lay red and bake under the hot August sun the tree seem crisp and sapless at fairfax court-house where the first sign of real warlike tenure be see the visitor be take into a low frame house and each in turn ask to explain the object of she mission then the hospital report be search in half a dozen or more instance the sad-eyed mother be throw into tremulous hope by the tiding of they darling ' whereabouts but for olympium and aunt merry there be no clew no such name as sprague or perley be record in the fateful page of the hospital corps but there be several badly wound in the hospital at manassa where fuller particulars be accessible they be conduct very politely by a young lieutenant in a shabby gray uniform to a ambulance and drive four mile southward to fairfax station on the railway when after despair hour of wait they be take by train to manassa a orderly accompany they and as the train pass beyond union mill where the bull run river run along the railway a mile or more before cross under it the young soldier point out the distant plateau near the famous stone bridge and when the train cross the river the high bluff a half-mile to the northward where the action have begin at blackburn 's ford he be very respectful and gentle in allude to the battle and say ingenuously point to the plateau jut out from the bull run mountain : at two o'clock on Sunday we would have cry quit to mcdowell to hold he ground and let we alone but just as we be on we heel to turn joe johnston come pile in here right where you see that gully yonder with ten thousand fresh man and in twenty minute we be three to one and then you folk have the worst of it president davi get off the train at the junction yonder and as he ride across this field where we be now the wood yonder be full of we man fly from the henry house hill where sherman have cut general bee 's brigade to piece and be route jackson -- ` stonewall ' we call he now because general bonham when he bring up the reserve shout ` see there where jackson stand like a stone wall ' he be a college professor and very pious he make he man pray before fight and have ` meeting ' in the commissary tent twice a week do mr davis join in the battle olympium ask more to seem interested in the garrulous warrior 's narrative than because she really have she mind on the story oh dear no old johnston have finish the job before the president -lrb- olympium notice that all southerner dwell upon this title with complacent insistence -rrb- could reach the field he be barely in time to see the cavalry of ` jeb ' stuart charge the regular on the warrenton road the train come to a halt and the young man say cheerfully : here we be the hospital 's still right smart over yonder in the tree but you will go with we will you not olympia ask in alarm for it be wear toward night oh yes i be detail to remain with you until you have find out about you kinsfolk in the mellow sunset the three woman follow the orderly across the field strew with armament supplies and the rough depot paraphernalia of a army at rest the hospital consist of a large tent for the slightly hurt and a few old building and a barn for the more serious case the search be futile there be two or three of the caribee in the place but they know nothing of they miss comrade indeed jack 's detail by colonel sherman have effectually cut off all trace of he movement after the battle begin mr sprague 's tear be fall softly as the orderly lead they to the surgeon 's office they be there show the record of all who have be bury on the field many he inform they sympathetically have be bury where they fall in great ditch dig by the sapper in every case the garment have be strip from the body before burial so that there be absolutely no means of identification most of the wound have however be send to richmond with the prisoner it would not do he add kindly to give up all hope of the lose one until they have see the roster of the prisoner and the wound in the richmond prison and hospital quarter be give to they in a tent put at they disposal by the surgeon and in the long wakeful hour of the night olympium hear the guard pacing monotonously before the door the music of the bugle arouse they at sunrise -- a wan haggard group sad-eyed and silent the girl make desperate effort to cheer the wretched mother and even privily take merry to task for give way before what be as yet but a shadow ` twould be time enough for tear when they find evidence that the stout vigorous boy have be kill as they finish the very plain breakfast of half-baked bread pea-coffee and egg buy by the orderly at a exorbitant rate he say good-naturedly : the train do not come till about ten o'clock if you would like to see the battle-field i can get the ambulance and take you over olympium eagerly assent -- anything be preferable to this mute misery of she mother and merry 's sepulchral struggle to be conversational and tearless they drive through bewildering number of tent most of they olympium 's sharp eye note marked usa and she reflect almost angrily that the chief part of war after all be pillage the man look shabby and the uniform be as vary as a carnival though by no means so gay whenever they cross a stream which be not seldom group of man be stand in the water to they middle wash they clothing very much as olympium have see the washer-woman on the continent in europe they be very merry even boisterous in this unaccustomed work respond to rough jest by resounding slash of the tightly wring garment upon the head or back of the unwary wag why there must be a million man here merry cry as the tent stretch for mile as far as she could see no not quite a million i reckon the orderly say proudly but we shall have a million when we march on washington march on washington merry gasp as though it be a official order she have just hear promulgate but -- but we be not ready yet we -- then she halt in dismay be she give information to the enemy would they instantly make use of it ah she must at any cost undo this fatal treason big with disaster to the republic i mean we be not ready yet to put we many million man on the march the orderly laugh i reckon you many million will be ready as soon as we one million you know we have a big country to cover with they you folk have only washington to guard and richmond to take we have the mississippus and fifteen hundred mile of coast to guard now this corner be newmarket where johnston wait for he troops on Sunday and lead they right along the road we be on -- to the pine wood yonder -- just north of we we will not go through there because we be not make a flank movement and he laugh pleasantly they drive on at a rapid rate as they come upon the southern shelf of the manassa plateau this the orderly say point to a small stone building in a bare and ragged waste of tree shrub and ruin implement of war be the henry house -- what be leave of it -- the key of we position when jackson form he stone wall face toward the northwest over there where you folk very cleverly flank we and wait a hour or two heaven only know what for unless it be to give we time to bring up we re-enforcement you officer lay the blame on burnside and hunter who they declare just sit still half the day while sherman get in behind we and would have capture every man jack of we fellow if johnston have not come up where i show you in the very nick of time the woman be look eagerly at the field of death it be still as on the day of the battle save that instead of the thousand of beat heart the flaunting flag and roar gun there be countless ridge tear in the sod as if a plow have run through at random limb and tree tear down and whirl across each other broken wheel musket stock and barrel twist and stick gaunt and eloquent in the tough grassy fiber of the earth in this circle of a mile and a half fifty thousand man pelt each other from two o'clock that Sunday morning until four in the afternoon up to two o'clock we be on the defensive we be drive from the broad smooth road yonder that you see cut through the tree northward a mile from here jackson alone make a stand if it have not be for he we should have be prisoner in washington now i reckon you see those man at work they be pick up lead we reckon that it take a ton of lead to kill a man a ton of lead olympium repeat yes you would not believe that thousand of man can stand in front of each other a whole day and pour lead into each other 's face and not one in fifty be hit ah olympium comment think that after all jack might not have be hit these be the trench of the dead we dead be not here they be all take and send to friend there be five hundred of you dead here and near the stone bridge yonder we lose three hundred kill in the fight and be there no other mark than this plain board olympium point to a rough pine plank sticking loosely in the ground with the word paint in lampblack : 85 yank by the hospital corps bee 's brigade that be all they be all strip -- no means of identify they the sun be very hot the rain next day make the body rot and the man have to just shovel they in -- oh oh do not pray do not olympia cry as she mother totter against the ambulance i ask you pardon lady i forget that these be not thing for lady to hear he speak in sincere contrition to relieve he olympia smile sadly say will not you take we back please the ambulance drive on into the warrenton pike and if olympium have know it within a stone 's - throw of jack 's last effort where the cavalry picket come upon he it be noon when they reach the station the orderly return the ambulance to the hospital bring down the luggage and the three woman make a luncheon of fruit and dry bread decline the orderly 's invitation to eat at the hospital the train come on three hour late it be fill with military man most of they officer but so soon as the orderly enter the rear coach usher in he charge two or three young man with official insignia on they collar arise with alacrity and beg the lady to take the vacant place at bristow station many of the officer get out and a number of civilian enter from the coach ahead and take they place mr sprague wear out by the fatigue of the journey and the strain upon she mind quite break down in the hot ill-ventilated car there be no water to be have and olympium turn inquiringly to the person opposite she asking : could we possibly get any water -- my mother be very much overcome certainly madam there must be plenty of canteen on the train i will bring you some in a moment a officer who have be share the seat with merry arise on

as if in the security of acredale chapter xiii a comedy of terror when jack the day after the battle find himself able to take account of what be go on he close he eye again with a deep groan believe in a vague glimpse of peaceful rest that he last confused sensation be real -- that he be dead but there be no airy aid of languorous ease to perpetuate or encourage this delusion sharp pain rack he

and not a northern one he be in he try to raise he head to see he companion but he might as well have be nail to the cross so far as pain and helplessness go then he lose the thread of he thought he

blissfully fall into dream wherein home thing and warlike doings mingle in grotesque medley relapse into consciousness follow at he know not what interval thereafter he be conscious of cruel torment and a clumsy transfer into another vehicle confuse sound of groan curse wave light and the hissing of escape steam almost in he very ear then the anguish of thunder wheel until he crack brain reel and he be mercifully unconscious how long he eye open on a clean white wall flower hang from the window in plumy festoon bird sing in the yellow dazzling sunlight what could it mean be he at home surely there be nothing of war in these comfortable surroundings he left arm be free there be no one lie near to impede its movement so it be not a hospital he take vague note of all this before he try to

the mental faculty mercifully dead while the wound ligature knit themselves anew he right arm have be cut by a saber-stroke and a pistol-ball have enter above the shoulder-blade prompt attention would have give he recovery in a few day but the twenty-four hour in a cart and the car make he condition for a time serious but now he be visibly stronger and he nurse bring people into the room to see he they look at he with wonder and admiration while the good lady be all in a flutter of delight he hear himself speak of always as the lieutenant and hesitate to ask a explanation the physician come but seldom the lady explain that all the doctor in town be busy in the hospital the truth flash upon he one morning when he hostess come burst in to say : the provost guard have come to take you name i do not know it for when you be bring here my son only hear you call lieutenant my name be john sprague -- jack lift himself to he elbow in excitement and disregard of everything -- and my regiment be the

back she be go before he could recover he speech or enough coherence to say what be in he mind she inform the orderly that the ail man be john sprague a lieutenant in the first virginium volunteer for that be the regiment the hospital guard have name when on the night of the arrival the eager citizen swarm at the station to take the wound to they home the hospital be sadly unready jack instantly suspect the situation the conversation in the ambulance come back to he now distinctly what should he do he be in honor bind to undeceive the kind-hearted and unwitting accomplice of the fraud practice on herself as well as on he she come in presently with a officer jack be not familiar with the rebel insignia and could not discover he rank or service but he expect to hear himself denounce as a spy or anything odious we surgeon have be send to manassa and dr van ness be come to take care of you in he place the matron say as jack stare silent and quaver at the new-comer that gentleman examine the patient shake he head dubiously and declare high fever at work and order absolute quiet for at least twenty-four hour when if he could he would return continue the prescription you have now mr raine all he need be quiet the hospital steward will come to dress he wound as usual mr raine come in with tea and toast in the evening and as she spread the napkin on the bed she prattle cheerily i be so happy to-night i have just receive a letter from my son he be at manassa he be be promote to lieutenant from sergeant it be read at the head of the regiment -- for gallant service at the henry house where he capture part of a company of yankee with a squad of cavalry he be only twenty-two and if he live he may be a general -- if those cowardly yankee will only fight long enough but i be afraid they will not _ the whig _ say this morning that that beast lincoln have to keep himself guard by a regiment of negro as the northern people want to kill he i hope they will not for if they do then they might put some one in he place that have some sense and then the war would come to a end and we should be cheat in a settlement for the yankee be sharper than we big-hearted generous man no sir no you must not talk i have promise to keep you quiet so lie still i 'll read _ the whig _ to you she run over the meager dispatch make up of hearsay and speculation -- how the north have fall into a rage with the washington authority how lincoln 's life be not safe how the cabinet have all resign how the democrat have arise in congress and in the state legislature and demand negotiation with president davi how england be draw up a treaty with the new confederacy then she turn to the local page she run over a dozen paragraph recount the deed of well-known richmond hero but these make no impression upon the listener until she read : major vincent atterbury whose gallantry at the battle of the 21st richmond be a subject of pride to he friend be transfer to he country home on the jame yesterday he be still very low but the surgeon declare that home quiet and careful nursing will restore he to he duty in time for the autumn campaign -- if the yankee do not surrender before that time jack 's eye be so bright when mr raine look at he as she lower the sheet that she arise exclaim quickly : there i have bring the fever back you eye be glitter and you cheek be flush no do not speak she move precipitately from the room and jack sink back with a groan he danger if not he difficulty might be overcome now he would write to mr atterbury and through vincent arrange for a exchange but a still deeper trouble have be on he mind where be barney and nick and worse than all young dick perley if any mishap have befall that boy he would shrink from return to acredale and he mother what must she state of mind be how many day have pass since the battle he have no means of know ah yes the paper be there on the stand where mr raine have throw it he raise himself slowly and seize it heaven Saturday August 4th two week since that fatal Sunday and he mother oh he must find means to write to telegraph mr raine he call hoarsely mr raine she come run to he side in alarm oh what have happen you be worse i be very comfortable but my kind friend i must -- i must let my mother know that i be alive she will think I dead that be what i mean to ask you -- just as soon as you seem able to talk i would have gladly send she word and invite she to come here but i do not know the name nor the address you do not have a stitch of clothes when you come except you underwear the rest have be take off the man say because they be soil and bloody and there be not a clew of any sort to you identity except that you be a lieutenant in a virginium regiment i think we should find out when the provost come but they have send to manassa and no answer have come back yet the man who bring I here deceive you mr raine i do not belong to a virginium regiment i belong to a new york regiment and i be a -- a -- union soldier great father a yankee the poor woman sink on the nearest chair as some one who have be nurse a patient that suddenly turn out to have small-pox or leprosy yes mr raine : if you prefer that name i be a yankee -- but we call only new-englanders yankee he wait for she to speak but as she sit dumb helpless overcome he continue : i try to explain the mistake before but you kindness cut I off i can only say that though you have give I a mother 's care and a christian 's consideration under a misunderstanding i trust you will not blame I for willful deception nor regret the goodness you have show the stranger in you hand and those man that bring you here -- be they yankee too she ask she mind dwelling womanlike on the least essential factor of the problem in order to keep the grievous fact as far away as possible oh no they be you own people there be no collusion i assure you jack almost laugh now as the dialogue in the ambulance recur to he and the adroit use the man have make of they unconscious charge to secure a furlough no i be more amaze than i can say when i come to myself in this charming chamber -- a paradise it seem to I a home paradise -- when you kind face bent over my pillow it be a cruel disappointment she say rise and hold the back of the chair as she tilted it toward the bed we be so proud of you -- so proud to have any one that have fight for we dear state in we own house to nurse to bring back to life every one on the street have some one from the battle and oh what will be say of we when people know that we -- we -- but here the cruelty of the conclusion come too sharply to she mind and she walk to the window sob softly i can understand believe I mr raine and i be go to propose a means to you whereby i shall be take from here and you neighbor shall never know that you entertain a enemy unaware though god know i do not see why we should be enemy when the battle be over if you son be in my condition i should think very hard of my mother if she be not to he what you have be to I but i can not believe you be a yankee you be so gentle so patient in all the dreadful time when the surgeon be cut and hacking oh i can not believe it oh please say you be joke -- that you want to give I a fright and you have a mother she come over near the bed again and stand look at he dismally half in doubt half in perplexed wonder for yankee in she mind suggest some such monster as the greek conjure when the goth pour into the peninsula maim the man and debauch the woman i say sprague be not a virginia name she murmer plaintively in a last desperate attempt to fortify herself against the worst but there be no tell what name be in virginium now since norfolk have grow so big and folk come in that way from all over the world jack could scarcely keep a serious face as this humorous lament display the pride of the dominion and the unconscious boeotianism of the provincial now mr raine here be what i propose : major atterbury of whom you read to I be my nearest friend we have be college comrade he have pass week at my home and i have be ask to he and mean to come this autumn vacation if the war have not break out i will write to he mother and she will have I remove to she house and it need never be know that you give aid and comfort to the enemy but the atterbury will never receive you they be the first to favor secession when all the rest of we oppose it to tell you the truth mr sprague it be partly because we be abuse a good deal for hold back when the secession excitement be first start that i be so -- so anxious about the story get out that we entertain a yankee prisoner my husband be in the service of the government in norfolk and my son be in the army but you know what neighborhood gossip be so after a friendly talk in which the poor lady cry a great deal and besought jack 's good-will for she darling william if ever he be luckless enough to be capture the note be write and

ride on the train mr raine explain and we sha 'n' t hear from they until to-morrow jack say nothing he mind be on he mother and the misery she must be endure he turn restlessly on he pillow that night and wake feverish in the morning mr raine now take as much pain to keep people who call from see she hero as she have before put herself out to display the invalid even the doctor call about nine o'clock be send away on some pretext and the poor lady wait with a anxiety almost as poignant as jack 's own for the response to he note about noon it come mr raine go to the door herself not daring to trust the color girl who have lavish untold pain on jack 's linen and the manual part of he care jack hear low voice in the hallway then on the stair and he know some one have come here be miss

whence take on a primitive ferry they in a hour or more arrive at a long wooden pier extend into the river it be nearly six o'clock when the carriage enter a solemn aisle of pine end in a labyrinth of oleander and the tropic-like plant of the south then a old-fashioned porticoed mansion come into view and on signal from the driver a _ posse _ of color servant come troop out noisily to carry the invalid in mr atterbury be on the veranda and step down to the carriage to welcome the guest she greet he with the affectionate cordiality of a mother and ask : how have you bear the fatigue i hope

about they the shout grow louder and louder they rise and fall far far away right and leave everybody embrace everybody else man who have be limp and despondent before break into wild dance of joy everybody want to go toward the field of battle now but a provost guard file down the road presently and in a few minute i see a sight that make tear of rage and shame blind I whole regiment of blue-coat come at a quick-step through the dusty roadway the rebel guard prod they brutally with they bayonet the fellow near I who have be run from the fight set up insulting cheer and cat-call ` do you ` n leave a lock of you hair with old ma ' r lincoln ' ` come down to dixie to marry nigger have ye ' and score of taunt more insulting and obscene we man never answer they be worn and dusty they have no weapon of course for the first thing the rebel do be to search every man take he money watch stud even he coat and shoe when they be better than they own hundred of we man be in they stocking-foot or rather in they bare foot as they tramp wearily through the burning sand and twisted root i hear one of the rebel near I a officer say that the prisoner be all go to the junction to take the car president davi have order that they should be march through the street of richmond to show the people of the capital the extent of the victory then the thought flash into my head that if we army have be capture my best chance of find jack would be to follow to richmond and watch the blue-coat i easily slip among the prisoner come to the city and see every man that go to castle winder but no one that i know be among they and i make up my mind that jack have escape i see wesley boone 's father and sister at the spottswood house yesterday but i be too late to catch they and when i ask the clerk at the desk be say they have take quarter in the town -- he do not know where that be a fact olympium exclaim they leave washington before we i wonder if they find wesley i do not know dick continue the officer be bring in a gang by themselves and i do not see they well i hang about the town visit all the place i think it likely jack might be and then i join a cavalry company that

at he keeper at harrison 's landing there be a delay of several hour and the impatient party wander on the shore of the majestic jame -- glitter like a sylvan lake in its rich border of woodland the sun be too hot to permit of the excursion dick suggest and late in the afternoon the wheezy ferry carry they down the lake-like stream on every hand there be sign of peace -- not a fort not a breastwork give token that this be in a few month to be the shambles of mighty army the anchorage of that new wonder the iron battle-ship the scene of mcclellan 's miraculous victory at malvern of grant 's slaughter grappling with rebellion at bay of butler 's comic jousting and the last desperate onslaught of hancock 's legion the air temper by the faint flavor of salt in the water fill the traveler with a intoxicating vigor lend strength to they jaded force which while tense with expectation could not wholly resist the delicious aroma the lovely outline of primeval forest the melody of strange bird startle along the shore by the wheezy puffing of the ferry there be cry of admire delight as the carriage run from the long wooden pier into the dim arcade of sycamore and pine through which the road wound all the way to rosedale then they emerge into a gentle rolling upland where cultivate field spread far into the horizon and in the distance a dense grove which prove to be the park about the house the come of the carriage be a signal to a swarm of small black urchin to scramble grin and delighted to the wide lawn there be no need to sound the great knocker no need to explain when rosalind hurry to the door see olympium emerge from the vehicle they have not see each other in four year but they be in each other 's arm -- laughing sobbing -- exclaim : how do you know when do you come jack jack where be he how be he jack 's able to eat rosa cry dart down to embrace mr sprague and start with a little cry of wonder as aunt merry exclaimed timidly : we be all here you

attract to the place by the unwonted sound when presently the visitor be show into vincent 's room jack call out to they to come and see valor conquer by love and when they enter mamma be brushing she eye furtively while she still hold jack 's unwounded hand under the counterpane master dick excite the maternal alarm by throw himself rapturously on the wounded hero and give he the kiss he have deny rosalind indeed he shower kiss on the abashed hero whose eye be suspiciously sparkling at the evidence of the boy 's delight he establish himself in jack 's room and no urge prayer or reproof could induce he to quit he hero 's sight i lose he once he say doggedly and i be not go to lose he again where he go i be go where he stay i 'll stay -- sha 'n' t i jack you shall indeed my dauntless oreste

capricious humor hardly except mr sprague whom he tolerate with some impatience letter be dispatch northward to relieve the anxiety of pliny and phemie as well as the marsh but it hang heavily on jack 's heart that no trace of barney have be find advertisement be send to the richmond papers and he wait in restless impatience for some sign of the kind lad 's well-being well jack this be not much like the pomp and circumstance of glorious war olympium cry the next morning come in from a excursion about the plantation as she insist on call the estate attend by merry rosa and dick i never see such foliage the rose be as large as sunflower and there be whole field of they yes i believe the atterbury make merchandise of they but who buy they about here they seem to grow wild -- as fine in form and color as we hot-house variety surely they be not buy by the color people and there seem to be no one else -- no other inhabitant i mean oh no they be ship north in the season for they but i do not think the family have pay much attention to that branch of the business of late year they revenue come from tobacco and cotton they cotton-field be in south carolina and along the atlantic coast and be these color people all slave she voice sink to a whisper for vincent 's door be ajar yes every man jack of they do you ever see such merry rogue they laugh and sing half the night and

gentle i see tear in mr atterbury 's eye yesterday when mamma be sit here with you yes jack say unconsciously woman enjoy cry -- you insufferable braggart how dare you talk like that pray what do you know about woman 's likes and dislike oh i beg pardon polly i be sure i do not mean anything -- i be take the minor for the major all woman like baby baby pass most of they time cry therefore woman like cry well if that be the sum of you college training it be a good thing the war come -- what about the war no treason in rosedale remember vincent shout from the next room you pledge I that when you talk war you would talk in open assembly the voice near the open doorway as he speak the servant have move the invalid 's cot where vincent could look in on jack there be really no war talk vint except such war as woman always raise contention -- i object jack to you generalization olympium retort it be a habit of boyishness and immaturity -- he say a moment ago -lrb- she turn to vincent -rrb- that woman love cry and then sneak out by a very shallow evasion i 'll leave it to vint : all woman love baby baby do nothing but cry therefore woman love cry there could not be a syllogism more irrefutable unless it be that all woman love liar vincent venture jocosely how do you prove that all man be liar woman love man therefore -- oh pshaw you have to assume in that premise i do not in mine it be notorious that woman love baby while you have only the spiteful saying of a very uncertain old prophet for you major -- whose major rosa ask appear suddenly i 'll have you to know sir that this major be mamma 's and no one else can have hold or make eye at he it be the major in logic we be make free with jack mumble laugh i hope logic be not a heresy in you new confederacy as religion be in the french constitution of '93 rosa look at olympium a little perplexed and seat herself on the cot with vincent where she could caress he furtively say with piquant deliberation : i do not know about logic but we have get everything need to make we happy in the montgomery constitution have you read it jack ask innocently how insulting of course i have i read it the very first thing when it appear in the newspaper catch we northern woman do that jack interject loftily there be my learn sister she do not know the constitution from plato 's dialogue indeed i do not nor do i know plato 's dialogue olympium return quite at ease in this state of ignorance wherein do the montgomery constitution differ from the old one jack ask look at vincent i be bless if i know i have read neither i do read the declaration of independence once at a fourth-of-july barbecue i always think that be the constitution indeed every fellow about here do you know in the south the woman do all the think for the man rosa keep my political conscience well then lord high chancellor tell we the vital article in the montgomery document that have inspire you to arm mar for the conflict plunge million into strife and thousand into hade as socrate would have say employ he method jack continue derisively we constitution assure we the eternal right to own we own property slave yes no one deny you that right so far as the law go under the old it be only the justice the humanity that be question the right would have endure a hundred year perhaps forever if you have keep still -- come jack i will not listen to politics olympium cry with a warn look no the time for talk be past it be battle and god defend the right rosa say solemnly and you may be sure he will jack add softly as though to himself but we have get far away from the cry and the baby vincent begin when jack interrupted fervently : thank heaven you monster the two girl cry in a breath no i can not conceive a sillier paradox than ' a babe in the house be a well-spring of joy ' a woman must have write it first now my idea of perfect happiness for a house be to have two wounded warrior like vincent and I tractable amiable always ready to join in rational conversation and make love if necessary provide we be encouraged really olympia you northern man be not what i fancy rosa cry with a laugh what do you fancy they oh ever so different from this -- this saucy fellow -- modest timid shy need ever so much encouragement to -- to -- claim they due jack add slyly well there be one that do not require much encouragement to claim everything that come in he way rosa retort and olympium add : and to spare my feeling you will not name he now exactly say rosa how touching exclaimed vincent i leave all my blood to enrich you soil or i would blush reply jack oh no it will not enrich the soil it will bring out a crop of johnny jump-up a weed that we do not relish in the south retorted rosa ah jack you be hit there -- rosa i be proud of you this odious yankee need comb down he run over we so long at college that he be conceit in he own impudence and vincent explode in shout of laughter i fear you be not a botanist miss rosa it be ` jack in the pulpit ' that will spring from northern blood and they 'll preach such truth that the very herbage will bring the lesson of liberty and toleration to you what be this very serious discussion my child mr atterbury say beam sweetly upon the group i could not imagine what have start vincent in such boisterous laughter and now that i come mr jack be as serious as we be at school when madame clarice tell we of we sin jack be tell he mamma and that be still more serious than to hear one 's own vincent say grin at the moralist but to be serious a moment i have write to my old friend general robert lee of arlington about miss perley i know that he will grant she permission to take richard home with she and the question now be whether it be safe to let they go together alone mr atterbury address the question to olympia make no account of jack oh let we leave the decision until you get general lee 's answer if they get the message in acredale that dick be safe and sound i do not see why they need go back before we do i shall be able to travel in a few week if the road be not so rickety i would not be afraid to set out now jack answer impossible you can not leave for a month yet if then vincent proclaimed authoritatively i know what gunshot wound be : you think they be heal and begin fool about when you find yourself lay up worse than ever there be no hurry the campaign can not begin before October i be as anxious to be back as you be but i do not mean to stir before October perhaps you think it will be dull here just wait until you be strong enough to knock about a bit we shall have royal ride we 'll go to williamsburg and see the oldest college in the country we 'll go down the jame and you shall see some of the richest land in the world we 'll get a lot of fellow out from richmond and have we regular barbecue in September we wind up the season here every year with a grand dance and olympium shall lead the queen anne minuet with mamma 's kinsman general lee who be the president 's chief of staff this do not sound much like soldier jack say dreamily no when in the field let we fight when at home let we be merry a very proper sentiment young man we want you to be very merry for you must remember the time come when we can not be anything but sad -- when you be away and the night of doubt settle upon we weak woman 's heart it be mrs atterbury who speak and the sentence seem to bring silence upon the group meanwhile all the inquiry set on foot through the agency of the atterbury fail to bring any tiding of barney moore it suddenly occur to jack that the poor fellow be masquerade as a rebel in the bosom of some eager patriot like mr raine and he reluctantly consent to let dick go to richmond to investigate perhaps mr raine might know where the wound man be take that have come with he some of the straggler could at least be find the advertisement ask information concern a wounded man arrive in richmond with himself be keep in all the journal but merry would not consent to let dick go on the dangerous quest without she she would never dare face she sister if any mishap come to the lad and though vincent put he under the care of a experienced overseer and order the town-house to be open for he entertainment the timorous aunt be immovable you must go and call on the president miss merry he receive thursday at the state house then you 'll see a really great man in authority not the backwoods clown that have bring this country into ridicule -- such a man as virginium use to give the people for president rosa say in the tone a lady of loui xviii 's court might have use to a adherent of the bonaparte ah rosa we see a gentle tender-hearted man in washington -- the very ideal of a people 's father no one else can ever be president to I while he live olympium say seriously lincoln rosa ask a little disdainfully yes abraham lincoln we have all misunderstand he oh if you could have see he as i see he -- so patient so considerate : the sorrow of the nation in he heart and its burden on he shoulder but confident calm serene with the benignant humility of a man send by god olympium add almost reverently it be he who come to we aid and order the rule to be break that we mother might seek jack rosa be about to retort but a warning glance from vincent check she and she say nothing i say dick do not try to capture jeff davi or blow up the confederate congress or any other of the casual master stroke that may enter you wild head remember that we have give double hostage to the enemy we have accept they hospitality and we have make ourselves they guest jack say half seriously as the young hotspur wring he hand in a tearful embrace above all remember mr yankee that you be in a certain sense a civilian now you must not compromise we by free speech in richmond rosa add ah i know very well there be none of that in the south : you folk object to free speech they kill poor old brown for it that be what you make war for to silence free speech dick cry hotly while merry pinch he arm in terror dick begin he campaign in the morning with longheaded address he visit the prison under ample power from general lee -- procure though vincent 's mediation there be a score of the caribee in castle winder and to these the boy come as a good fairy in the tale for he distribute money tobacco and other thing which enable the unfortunate to beguile the tedious hour of confinement the prisoner be crowd like cattle in the immense warehouse in squad of a hundred or more they have blanket to stretch on the floor for bed a general basin to wash in and for some time amuse themselves watch through the bar window the crowd outside that flock to the place to see the yankee and when not check by the guard to revile and taunt they dick be enraged to see how contentedly the man bear the irksome confinement the meager food and harsh peremptoriness of the beardless boy set over they as guard most of the prisoner pass the time in card play for button trinket or what not that form they scanty possession dick learn that all the commission officer of the company with wesley boone have be wound or kill in the charge near the stone bridge wesley have be with the prisoner at first he have be strike on the head and be in a rage fever when he father and sister come to the prison to take he away no one could tell where he be now but dick know that he must be in the city since there be no exchange the confederate allow no one to leave the line except woman with the dead or those who come from the north on special permit then he visit the provost headquarters and be show the complete list of name record in the book there but barney 's be not among they at the spottswood hotel the day after he come he meet elisha boone haggard depress almost despairing dick have no love for the hard-headed plutocrat but he could not resist make himself known how d'ye do mr boone i hope wesley be come on well sir boone bring he wander eye down to the stripling in dull amazement why where on earth do you come from how be it you be free and allow in the street oh i be a privileged person sir i be look up company k you have not hear anything of young moore barney who live on the callao road south of acredale no my mind have be take up with my son he voice grow softer he be in a very bad way and the worst be there be no decent doctor to be get here for love or money all the capable one be in the army and those that be here refuse to take any interest in a yankee the father 's grief and the unhappy situation of he whilom enemy touch the lad forget jack 's and vincent 's warning dick say impulsively : oh i can get he a good doctor we have friend here he know the moment he have speak the word that he have be imprudent -- how imprudent the sudden suspicious gleam in boone 's eye at once admonish he friend here union man have no friend here there be man here with whom i have do business for year man that owe prosperity to I but when i call on they they almost insult I if you have friend you must have sympathy that they appreciate dick know what this mean to be a democrat have be in acredale to be charge with secret leaning to rebellion he restrain he wrath manfully and say simply : a old college friend of jack 's have be very kind to we we i take it you mean the sprague they be stop with jeff davi i suppose it be the least he could do for ally so steadfast you should not talk that way sir every man in the caribee except old oswald 's gang be a democrat but they be for the country before party yes yes it may be so -- but the north do not think that way well i be go to washington to see if i can not get my boy out of this infernal place where a man can not even get shave decently and miss kate mr boone where be she she be nurse wesley poor girl she be have a harder trial than any of we for these devilish woman fairly push into the sick-room to abuse the north and berate the soldier that fight at manassa i should like to call on wesley -- if you do not mind dick say hesitatingly i shall be only too glad and i 'll tell you what it be richard if you 'll make use of you friend here to get kate and wesley some comfort some consideration i 'll make it worth you while i 'll see that you do not have to wait long for a commission and i 'll pay you any reasonable sum so soon as you get back north dick restrained he anger under this insulting blow perceive even in the hotness of he wrath that the other be unconscious of the double ignominy imply in deal with soldier ' reward as personal bribe and proffer money for common brotherly office it be only when jack commend he astuteness afterward that dick realize the adroitness of he own diplomacy thank you mr boone i should not care for promotion that i do not win in war and as for money i shall have enough when i need it but any man in the caribee shall have my help under the flag every man be a friend true yes you be quite right kate will be very glad to see you they walk along neither disposed to talk after this narrow shave from a quarrel boone lead the way to the northern outskirts of the city until they reach a dull-brown frame building back some distance from the street a color woman with a flaming turban on she head open the door as she see they come up the trim walk line with shell and gay with poppy bergamot aster and heliotrope this woman be a slave she belong to the proprietor of the hotel who refuse to receive wesley it be a great concession to let he come here they tell I but the poor boy might as well be in a michigan log camp for all the care he can get but i be mighty glad i meet you i know you can help kate while i be go i hate to leave she but i can do nothing here and unless wesley be remove he will never leave this cussed town alive i sha 'n' t be go more than ten day kate have be call by the turbaned mistress and come into the room with a little shriek of pleasure o richard what a delightful surprise have you see you aunt ah i be so glad she must be so relieved and mr sprague -- have they find he dick retail as much of the story as he think safe but he have to say that the sprague be all with the atterbury in the country how providential ah if we poor wesley could find some such friend he be very low he recognize no one unless papa can get leave to take he north -- i be afraid of the worst indeed i doubt whether he could stand so long a journey you must stay the day with we i be so lonely and i dread be more lonely still when papa leave this evening dick remain until late in the afternoon send word to merry who come promptly to the aid of the afflict the next day dick leave he aunt at the cottage with kate and warn they that he should be go all day and perhaps not see they until the next morning he set off for rosedale where he tell jack kate 's plight vincent hear the story too and when it be end he say decisively : jack we must send for they it would never do to have the story tell in acredale that you have find friend in the south -- because you be a democrat and boone be thrust into negro quarter because he be a abolitionist it be the very think on jack 's mind and straightway the carriage be make ready with ample pillow and what not dick set out in great state fill with the importance of he mission and the glory of jack 's cordial praise he be to stop on the way through town and carry the atterbury 's family physician to direct the removal when he appear before kate with mr atterbury 's command that she and she brother should make rosedale they home until the invalid could be remove north the poor girl break down in the sudden sense of relief -- the certainty of salvation to the slowly die brother the physician spend many hour redress the wound gangrene have begin to eat away the flesh of the head above the temple and poor wesley be unrecognizable he be quite unconscious of the burning bromine and the clipping of flesh that the skillful hand of the practitioner carry on when the little group start on the long journey the invalid look more like himself than he have since kate find he the drive last many hour wesley be stretch in a ambulance kate sit on the seat with the driver the physician and dick follow in the carriage merry go back to the city house where she nephew be to return as soon as wesley have be deliver at rosedale she charge place in the hand of the kind hostess mr atterbury kate break down she have bear up while she head and heart alone stand between she brother and death but now relieve of the strain she fall into a alarming fever a williamsburg veteran who have practice in that ancient college town since the early day of the century take the richmond surgeon 's place and the gay summer house become for the time a hospital meanwhile the rebel provost-marshal have simplify dick 's task a good deal a order be issue that all house where wound or ail man be lie should signalize the fact by a yellow flag or ribbon attach to the front in a conspicuous place thus direct dick walk street after street ask to see the wound and the fourth day come to a residence rather handsomer than the other on the street not two block from mr raine jack 's samaritan he find a waste figure with bandaged head and unmeaning eye that he recognize as barney we have not be able to get any clew as to he name or regiment the guard at the station say he belong to the twelfth virginium but none of the member of that body in the city recognize he you know he yes he be of my regiment dick say neglect to mention the regiment i will send word to he friend at once and have he remove oh we be proud and happy to have he here we only anxiety be lest he should die and he family remain in ignorance but now that you identify he we hope that we may be permit to keep he until he recovery it be a stately matron who speak with such a manner as dick think must be the mark of nobility in other land he learn with surprise that the atterbury physician be minister to barney though there be nothing strange in that since the doctor be the favorite practitioner of the well-to-do in the city that night he write to jack ask instruction and the next day receive a note write by olympium advise that barney be leave with he present host until he recover consciousness that by that time vincent would be able to come up to town and explain matter to the deluded family the better to carry out this plan dick be bid to return to rosedale and thus six week after the battle and dispersion all we acredale personage by the strange chance of war be assemble within sight of the rebel capital and though in the hand of friend as absolutely cut off from they home and duty as if they have be capture in a combat with the indian chapter xvi a masque in arcady in the latter day of September the life at rosedale be but a faint reminder of the hospital it have seem in August the young man be able to take part in all the simple gayety devise by rosa to make the time pass agreeably wesley be still subject to dizziness if expose to the sun but jack and vincent be robust as lumberman mr sprague and merry sigh wearily in the seclusion of they chamber for the northern homeside but they banish all sign of discontent before they warm-hearted host there be as yet no exchange arrange between the hostile cabinet of richmond and washington even boone 's potent influence among the magnate of he party have not serve he to effect wesley 's release nor enable he to return to watch over the boy 's fortune there be no one at rosedale sorry for the latter calamity outside of wesley and kate i believe even she be secretly not heart-broken for she know that she father would be antipathetic to the outspoken lady of rosedale there have be a almost total suspension of military movement east and west both side be strain every resource to bring drill army into the field when the decisive blow fall in he drive and walk about the jame and williamsburg jack see that the country be strip of the white male population the negro carry on all the domestic concern of the land in these excursion too he mark with a keen military instinct the point of defense general magruder who command the department have leave untouched he wonder if the union arm would ever get as far down as this if they do and he be of the force he would like to have a cavalry regiment to lead vincent be to rejoin he command at manassa in October jack look forward to the event with the most dismal discontent to be tie up here far from he companion to seem to enjoy ease when he regiment be indurate itself by drill march and the rough life of the soldier for the great work it be to do maddened he i give you fair warning vint if a exchange be not arrange before you leave here i shall cut stick : the best way i can good how will you manage it be a long pull between here and we front at manassa how will you work it just as soon as you quit the shelter of rosedale you be a suspect even the negro will halt you if you should make for fortress monroe you have all of magruder 's army to get through you would surely be catch in the act and then i could do nothing for you you would be send to castle winder and that be not a very comfortable billet some hint of jack 's discontent or rather of he vague dream of flight come into dick 's busy head and when one day they be tramp down by the jame together he say owlishly : i say jack when vincent go let we clear out i say yes with all my heart but how can it be do we be more than forty mile from the nearest union line whole army be between we any white man find on the highway be question and if he can not give a clear account of himself be send to the provost prison you remember the other day when we leave the rest to go through the swamp road near williamsburg we be hail by a patrol and if vincent have not be within reach we would have be send to the provost prison even the negro act as guard do not be too sure of that i have be talk to some of they they be ` fraid as sin of the overseer but you notice they shut up all the negro in they own quarter at night do not you if they be all right why should they do that good heaven you have not be try to make a uprising among the rosedale servant dick do not you know that no end of ours could justify that these people have be like brother -- like we own family to we it would be infamous -- infamous without power in the language for comparison -- if we should requite they humanity by stir up servile strife i should be the first to take arm against the slave in such revolt and give my life rather than be instrumental in bring misery upon the atterbury oh keep you powder dry jack i never dream of stir 'em up what i mean be that they be all restless and uneasy they have a idea that ` massa linculm ' be come down with a big army to set they free many of they want to fly to meet this army many too would almost rather die than leave they mistress none of they -- but the very bad one -- could be induce under any circumstance to lift they hand against the family or its property i should hope not -- at least through we instrumentality the time must come when they will leave the family for the one call only and in one way that be by cut out slavery root and branch however that be for the politician to manage all we have to do be to stand by the color and fight i do not see much chance of standing by the color here dick retorted wrathfully if you 'll give I the word i 'll arrange a plan and as soon as vincent go -- we 'll be off i be not you master you young hornet i can not see what you be do all the time all i can do be to approve or reject such doings of yours as you bring I to decide on dick 's eye sparkle all right i 'll keep you post never fear they be a very jovial group that prattle about the long rosedale dining-table daily now since every one be able to come down the house be furnish in the easy unpretentiousness that prevail in the south in other day cool mat cover all the floor the hallway and bedchamber the dining-room open into a drawing-room where kate and olympium take turn at the big piano the day be divide english fashion into breakfast luncheon dinner and supper the latter as late as nine o'clock in the night jack be unprovided with regimental vincent wear civilian garb to spare the prisoner -lrb- as jack jocosely call himself -rrb- mortification gray be the only wear obtainable in richmond mr atterbury enjoy with gentle malice the rueful perplexity of she prisoner guest jack wesley and richard as they surround the board in this rebel attire i shall feel as uncertain of myself when i get back to blue as i do in chess after i have play a long while with the black change to white i maneuver for some time for the discard color jack say one evening oh you 'll hardly forget in this case rosa say saucily it be for the black you be manoeuvre constantly jack look up startled and glance swiftly at dick have that headstrong young marplot be detect in treason with the color people no dick meet he glance clear-eyed unconstrained the shot must have be a random one i think you do we injustice miss rosa wesley say i for one be not interested in the black all i want be the union after that i do not care a rush i protest against politics mr atterbury intervene gently when i be a girl the young people find much more interesting subject than politics rosa : crop mamma vincent : a mistress 's eyebrow dick : some other fellow 's sister olympium : some other girl 's brother mr sprague : giddy girl merry : bad boy well something about all of these mr atterbury resume laugh i do not think young people in these time be as attach to each other as we use to be in we day -- do you mr sprague i do not know how it be with you in the south but we no longer have young people in the north we child bring we up now -- we do not bring they up that account for the higher average of intelligence among parent note in the last census olympium interrupt she mother to say there do you see mr sprague continue with a smile and in a tone that have none of the asperity the word might imply no reverence no wait for the elder as we be teach it depend a good deal do it not whether the elder be lover vincent ask innocently oh do not look at I mr sprague for support or sympathy vincent be you handiwork he be form in the north he be one of you new school of youth he be southern only in loyalty to he state for a time i have painful apprehension that that too have be educate away it be he reason that keep he faithful there rosa venture and catch vincent drop he eye in confusion from the demure glance of olympium oh no pride a virginian be like a roman he be prouder to be a citizen in the dominion than a king in another country mr atterbury say with stately decision no matter where he heart may be and she glance casually at olympium he duty be to he state politics mamma politics remember you young day talk of king court romance madrigal -- but leave out politics rosa cry remonstratingly let 's turn to political economy how do you propose dispose of you tobacco and cotton this year jack ask gravely we be under contract to deliver ten thousand bale at wilmington to we agent vincent reply as for tobacco we expect to sell all we can raise to the yankee general we have already begin negotiation with some of you commander who be too good yankee to miss the main chance you be not in earnest jack cry aghast as earnest as a maid with she first love but who -- who -- be the miscreant that degrade he cause by such traffic oh if you wait until you learn from I you 'll never be a dangerous accuser i learn in letter from friend in the west that all the cotton crop have be contract for by man either in the northern army or high in the confidence of the administration you see jack we be not the arcadian simpleton you think we this war be to be pay for out of northern pocket any way you look at it we have get cotton and tobacco you must have both you have get money we must have that what we do not sell to you we 'll send to england all at the table have listen absorbedly to this strange revelation and jack rise from the table shocked and discourage olympium seat herself at the piano and slip out as he suppose unseen jack stroll off into the fragrant alley of oleander and laurel dick however be at he heel the two continue on in silence dick troll along switch the bug from the pink blossom that fill the air with a enervating odor i say jack i have find out something what have you find out you young conspirator wesley boone 's try to get the negro to help he off the devil he be yes last night i be down in the rose-field young clem aunt penelope 's boy be sit under a bush talk with a crony i hear he say ` de cap'n 'll take you too ef you doan say noffin ' he guv pompey ten gold dollar ' ` de lor ' will he take ev ` ybody ` long too clem ' ` good lor ' no he be goin ' to get he army and den he 'll come a ' fetch all de niggahs ' ` de lor '' try to get closer i make a rustling of the bush and the young imp shoot through they like weasle before i could lay hand on they now what do you think of that if it be only to escape all right but if it be a attempt to stir up insurrection i will stop wesley myself rather than let he carry it out would not it be the best thing to warn vincent it would be a dreadful thing to let he go and leave he poor mother and sister here unprotect let I think it over i will hit on some plan to keep wesley from make a ingrate of himself without bring danger on we benefactor kate be dawdle on the lawn as the two return to the house jack challenge she to a jaunt where shall it be she ask readily move toward he the garden of the god the garden of the goddess you mean if it be the rose-field that be true a god 's garden would be fill with thorn and warlike blossom i do not know a rose-garden grow the war of the house of york and lancaster do you remember the scene in shakespeare where bolingbroke and gaunt pluck the rose quite well there be always something pathetic to I in the fable historian invent to excuse or palliate or perhaps it would be juster to say make tolerable the stain page of the past it be bring doubly nearer and distinct by this miserable war and the strange fate that have fall upon we -- to be the guest of a family whose hope be fix upon what would make we miserable if it ever happen it never will that be the reason i listen with pity to the childish vaunting of these kind people they have you see no conception of the northern people -- no idea of the deep-seated purpose that move the state as one man to stifle this monstrous attempt they walk on in silence a few pace and kate continue : i do not know how you feel mr sprague but i be wretched here i feel like a traitor receive such kindness treat with such guileless confidence and yet my heart be fill with everything they abhor it be not so hard for you because you and vincent have be close friend he have make you house he home but i certainly feel that wesley and i should go elsewhere now that he be able to be about do wesley feel this -- this embarrassment passionately he say last night he feel like a sneak he would fly in a instant if he could see any possible way to we line pray miss boone tell he to be very circumspect i know the southern nature when they give you they heart they give entirely but the least sign of -- of -- distrust will turn they into something worse than indifference we may see we way out soon caution wesley against any act -- any act -- he emphasize the word -- that may lead these kind people to think that he do not trust they or that he would take advantage of servile insurrection to gain he liberty of course they know that we be all restive here that we shall be even more impatient when vincent go -- but they could not understand any surreptitious movement on we part to enable we to get away he hope that if she be in wesley 's confidence she would understand he meaning but she give no sign she assent with a affirmative movement of the head and they walk through the fragrant path pluck a rose now and then that seem more tempting than its fellow at the end of the field of rose a cherokee hedge grow so thick and high that it form a screen and rampart between the house land and a dense grove of pine which be itself border by a stream that here and there spread out into tiny lakelet on the larger of these there be rude dug-out make by the darky to cut off the long walk from they quarter to the tobacco and corn field be there ever a eden more perfect than this delicious place kate cry as the flaming sun send banner of gold mingle in a rainbow baldric with the bloom parterre of rose i do not know much about eden and the little i do know do not give I a sympathetic reminiscence of the place but i agree with you that rosedale be about as near a paradise as one can come to on this earth jack qualifiedly reply and yet we want to fly from it ah yes because the tree of we life the volume of we knowledge or in plain prose we heart be not here and scenic beauty be a poor substitute for that duty i be convinced be the key of the best life there be heart here noble one -- duty here inspiring one but they do not satisfy we : they be become a torment to I i feel like a soldier bring from duty a priest fall into the way of the flesh you rhapsody be like most fine-sounding thing more to the hope than the heart kate murmur gaze dreamily into the purple mass of color hover changefully over the opaque water at they foot you mean they do not reach you heart that you soul be far away as to what be here i think vincent and rosa would not agree that life have any more or narrower limitation here than we recognize at acredale let we go on the water he pull the rude shallop to she foot and they get in and go on jack not heed she gibe these brackish threatening deep remind I of all sort of weird and uncanny thing stygian pool -- lethe -- what not mystic and terrifying see the tiny wave that curl before we boat be like thin ink a thousand root and herb and who know what mysterious vegetable mixture color these dark deep i could fancy myself on a uncanny pilgrimage seek some demon delight there be but one oar in the boat which the negro use as a scull jack make a poor fist with this but there be no need of rowing kate catch a project limb from the thick bush on the margin send the little wabbling craft onward in noisless spasmodic plunge deep fringe of wild columbine fall in fluffy spray from the higher bank as the boat drift along the other side the thicket be musical with the chatter cat-bird and whip-poor-will mingle with a score of woodland melodist that jack 's limited woodcraft do not enable he to recognize who would think that we be within a half-mile of a completely appoint country house we be as isolate here from all vestige of civilization as we should be in a florida everglade kate say as the little craft swim along in a eddy it seem to I typical of the people -- this curiously wild transition from bloom well-kept garden to such still and solemn nature the place might be call primeval : look at those gnarled root like prodigious serpent see the shine bark of the larch -- i think it be larch -- i should call it ` slippery ' elm if it be at acredale but see the fantastic effect of the little lance of sunlight break through be not it the realization of all you ever read in ` uncle tom ' or ` dred ' kate glance into the weird deep of foliage where a bird flutter on the wing arouse strange echo ugh she say in a half-whisper i can imagine it the meeting-place of ` tam o ' shanter 's ' eldritch see this -- but all the same do you know it be fascinating beyond word to I should you mind go in a little farther -- i should like the sensation of awe the place suggest since there can be no danger -- while you be here he give she a quick glance but she eye be fasten on the dark recess beyond i should be delighted but i will not insure you gown nor -- nor half promise that we shall come out alive oh as to that i 'll take the risk i do not know the habit of southern snake but if they be as well-bred as ours they retire from the ken of wicked man at sundown so we need not fear they as the sun be too far down for the snake of tradition to see or molest we they step out of the boat at a green sedgy point extend from a labyrinth of flowering vine and creeper once inside the delicious odorous screen they find themselves in a archipelago of green islet connect by monster root or moss-covered trunk that seem lay by elfin hand for the penetration of this leafy jungle yes i be go to say jack continue this swift transposition from the cultivation of civilization to the handiwork of nature be whimsically illustrative of the people do you ever see or hear or read of such open-handed honest-hearted hospitality as theirs such refinement of manners such sincerity in speech and act contrast this with they fairly pagan creed as to the slave they intolerance of the northern people they clannish reverence for family but be not the inequality of the southern character due to they strange lack of education few of they be cultivate as we understand education do you notice that among the people we meet at williamsburg -- officer as well as civilian -- none of they be equal to even a very limited range of subject all who be educate have be in the north ah -- good heaven kate 's exclamation be due to a sudden sinking in the mossy causeway until she be almost bury in the tall fern jack help she out shiver a moment doubtingly as he exclaim : the sun be nearly down now though the air be transparent or would be if we be in the free play of daylight i think it would be better to go back but they make no haste such trophy of fern and lace-like moss be not to be pluck in every walk and they dawdle on and on skirmish with delighted hardihood against the pitfall of bog that cover morass and pitch-black mud when the impulse finally come to hasten back they be somewhat chagrined to discover that they have lose they own trail the point where they have quit the stream could not be find clamber plant burden with blossom fragrant as honeysuckle grow all along the bank and the bush that have attract they be no longer a landmark well jack say confidently the sun disappear over there that be southwest the house be in that direction -- northeast now if you will keep that big sycamore in you eye and follow I we shall be near the house as i calculate they push on in that direction but have only go a few yard when the ground become a perfect quagmire of black loam that look like coal ground to powder and be thin as mush this be a brilliant stroke on my part i must say jack cry face kate ruefully we must go back and examine the ground as indian do and find we entrance trail in that way i will watch the ground and you keep a eye on the shrub wherever you see havoc among they you may be sure my manly foot have fall there suddenly they be conscious of a indescribable change in the place neither know what it be it have come on in the excitement of they march into the morass -- or it have come the instant they both become conscious of it what be it kate turn and look into jack 's blank face i be bless if i know what it be but it seem as if something have suddenly go out of the order of thing what be it do you feel it do you notice it feel it -- see it -- why it be as palpable or rather to speak accurately it be as clearly absent as the color from a oil-painting leave mere black and white outline how besotted i be jack cry why i know the sun have wholly go and the bird and live thing have cease to sing and move that be it could you believe that it would make such a change why i think when we come in the place be a temple of silence but it be a mad world compare to this yes and we must hurry and get out while we have daylight to help we i take it you would not care to swim the lagoon let we call it lagoon for this place make the name appropriate call it whatever you like but do not ask I to swim it kate cry push on ah i have we trail jack cry in triumph by george it be wide enough he add bend over where the thick grass be crushed and broken see the advantage of large foot now if you have be alone ` twould have be as hard as to trace a bird 's track be that a implication that i have chinese foot no too literal young woman it be mean to show you that i be very much relieved for ` pon my soul i be afraid we be in a very disagreeable scrape and you be now quite sure we be not quite sure do not you want to take my arm oh no thank you i be not at all tired i be use to longer walk than this longer possibly but not over such try ground oh yes i have go with wesley and he friend to the lake in the north wood ah i have never be there be they as bad travel as this infinitely worse -- why what be that it sound very like the report of a pistol both stop kate come quite close to the young man who be bent over with he hand to he ear trumpet-fashion do you -- he make a warning gesture with he hand and motion she to stoop among the fern a halloo be hear in the distance then a response just ahead of where the two crouch in the breast-high fern through which the path make by they recent footstep lead when the echo halloo die away a bird in the distance seem to catch up the refrain and dwell upon the note with a exquisite painful melody why it be the throat interlude in the magic flute how lovely it be kate whisper if you be my knight i should put on you the task of cage that lovely sound for I the distant bird-note cease and then suddenly from the bush just ahead of they it be catch up and answer note for note in a wild pibroch strain harsher but inexpressibly move jack turn to kate he face quite pale and whisper : it in not a bird they be negro i have read of these sound they be maraud slave and we must not let they see we we must get to those thick clump of bush do you think you can remain bent until we reach they if not we will rest every few pace go on i can try the pibroch strain still continue rise into a mournful wail then sink info the soft cry of the whip-poor-will in a few minute the perplexed fugitive be deep in a clump of wild hawberry invisible to any one who should pass the strain have cease as suddenly as they begin then a faint hallo-o-o sound be answer in the bush as it seem just in front of where jack and he companion stand voice soon become audible farther along ten or more pace motion to kate jack creep along noiselessly and fancy he could distinguish form through the thick screen of bush a voice not a negro 's say : i go to the cove for you -- what be the matter i have the devil 's work to get through the post for some reason or other they be get mighty sharp i must be back before twelve what be be do well the moke consent to go but they will not touch the ranch you 'll have to bring up a few hand the fewer the better if they damned feather-bed sojer be not there we could do the job ourselves when do the boss get out next week i do not know what day they would pay high for he both way no we can not nibble there the cap'n 'll pay well that be square we can not afford to try the other now at any rate be the skiff here yes well get in there be a plash and the-receding sound of voice jack dart through the screen of branch but he could not distinguish the figure for it be grow every instant dimmer twilight he turn to kate she be at he side who be they -- what be they planning be they soldier she ask never mind they now we must find a way out of this we boat can not be far off we must follow this line of bush until we come to the spot we leave i know i can recognize it for there be a enormous tree fall a few step from the sedge bank we land on it be a very toilsome journey now oblige as they be to hug the obstinate growth of haw wild alder and dog rose which tear flesh and garment in the hurry flight they come to the dead tree finally and jack almost shout in grateful relief : you be a true prophet miss boone you give utterance to some druid-like remark as we cross the stygian pool the worst you fancy paint could not equal what we have see and hear i have see nothing dreadful and i can not say that i understand very much of what we hear there be some ` caper ' go on to give these cut-throat a chance to get booty or something of the sort they be probably rebel soldier plan to sack the commissary they be in the boat now and jack be send it forward by lusty lunge against every protrude object he could get a stroke at when these fail he manage to scull after a fashion they find the household in consternation when they get back but jack give a picturesque narrative of they escapade omit the encounter with the negro which he have charge kate to say nothing about as it would only alarm mr atterbury the garment of the explorer tell the tale of they mishap and when they have clothe themselves anew supper be announce the feast be of the lightest sort : sherbet or tea for those who like it fruit and cracker honey or marmalade -- a triumph in the cultivation of dyspepsia jack say when he first begin the eating but it be observe that the disease have no terror for he for he sit at the table as long as he could get any one to remain with he and do he share in test all the dish he outsat everybody that night except dick who never get tire of any place that bring he near he idol i be go up-stair in a moment towhead come up after I dick nod a gleam of delightful expectation in he eye he be just in the ardent period when boy love to make mystery of very ordinary thing and jack 's _ sotto voce _ command be like the hero 's voice in the play meet I by the ruin well when midnight strike he follow jack up the wide staircase and into he own room for greater security as no one would think of look for they there now tell I all you have find out jack command as he shut the door have you be among the darky i have find out this much the old negro be oppose to go away or in any shape annoy they master the young buck and the woman be very eager to fly it seem that some one have spread the story among they that lincoln have send butler to fort monroe to receive all the negro on the peninsula they have be assure that they be to have ` they freedom one hundred acre of land and a ox-team ' where the report come from i can not find out but there be some communication between here and the union line i be positive have wesley be with the negro again no i have keep a eye on he all day where do he go at night the doctor have forbid he to be in the night air for the present well you keep a eye on wesley and then jack narrate the strange scene in the swamp the mysterious call and the conversation dick listen in awe mingle with rapture oh why be not i there just my blame luck i would have follow they and then we should have know what they be up to do you know that a company of cavalry have go into camp just below the grove no -- when this evening vincent be down there now well you may be sure they suspect something i wonder if it would not be better to speak to vincent of course not what have we to tell he simply my suspicion and clem 's chatter the little moke may have be lie i can not see that any of they do much else the worst of it be these southerner be very sensitive about any allusion to the negro they would pooh-pooh anything we might say that be not back by proof it be a mighty uncomfortable fix to be in dick my boy though ` pon my soul i believe you enjoy it dick grin deprecating i think you do you unfledged guy fawke i know nothing would give you greater joy than to put on a mask grasp a dagger in you hand and go to wesley cry ` villain you secret or you life ' dick you be a stage hero you be a thing of sawdust and tinsel come to the parlor and hear kate play the divine song of mendelssohn perhaps night-eyed conspirator to whirl polly or miss rosa in the delirium of the ' _ blaue donau _ ' come but there be neither dance nor music when they reach the drawing-room everybody be there vincent have just come and the first word jack and dick hear glue they to they place yes all the negro on the lawless ' skinner 's and loma 's plantation have go butler have declare they contraband of war and a lot of yankee speculator have be sneak through the plantation fill they ignorant mind with promise of freedom a farm and a share of they master ' property they real purpose be to get the negro and hold they until the two government come to term and then they will get reward for every nigger they hold oh these yankee can see way of make money through a stone-wall and vincent laugh lightly as though the incident in no way concerned he captain cram who be in camp just below in the oak clearing be order to scour the river-bank to the enemy 's line near hampton so we need have no fear of these enterprising apostle of freedom interfere with we nigger i do not think one of they could be induce to leave we if offer all we farm mr atterbury say a little proudly there be not one of they that i have not bring through sickness or trouble of one sort or another and there be not one that would not take my command before the gold of a stranger i do not know mr atterbury mr sprague venture mildly gold be a mighty weight in a argument i have know it to change the conviction of a lifetime in a moment i have know it to make a man renounce he father dishonor he name belie he whole life deny he family when a fortune beyond reasonable dream be place upon the head of charle stuart for whom we ancestor fight and beggar themselves he secret be in the keep of score of peasant and the blood-money lay idle i could cite hundred of similar proof that gold be not god everywhere i mean no offense but you will agree with I that you northern people be give up to the get and worship of money it be not so with we perhaps because we have it and with it something that make it secondary -- birth i have no fear of the infidelity of any of my people i would as soon doubt rosa or vincent we the smallest black on my estate she speak with mild high-bred dignity not a particle of assertion or captious intolerance but as a prelate might assert the majesty of the word on the altar neither look for dissent nor dream that the spirit of it could exist i be glad to hear you mother express such confidence vint jack say as they walk out on the veranda to take a good-night smoke but just let I give you a maxim of my own the lock 's not sure unless the key be in you pocket sententious my boy but vague my mother be perfectly right we nigger be fidelity itself but since we be so near the butler line where he agent can sneak up on the river and kidnap the new sort of contraband i think it better to take some precaution hereafter general magruder will have a picket post within two mile of we between here and the creek which offer a convenient point for smuggling i be heartily relieve to hear it jack cry give something too much fervor to he relief for vincent turn and look at he in surprise but it be too dark in the shadow of the clemati to see he face and after a silence vincent say : mamma have tell you that the president be come to williamsburg to review magruder 's troops no she have not mention it be he yes he will be there Thursday afternoon and we shall have the ball the same evening he will be here with general lee he chief of staff and remain all night so that you will be able to say when you go back north -- something that few yankee will be able to say during the war -- that you have break bread with the first president of the confederacy i will strive to bear my honor with humility jack say it befit the conquer to be humble if i have not come in time you two would have be in a squabble -- own it and rosa draw a chair between they as a peacemaker chapter xvii treason and stratagem rosedale be indeed eden in the most orthodox sense to the group so strangely billet in its lovely tranquillity no sooner be the anguish concern the invalid off kate 's olympium 's and rosa 's mind than new perplexity beset they rosa be barely eighteen kate and olympium older by three or four year but the younger girl be in many essential thing quite as mature as she northern comrade but jack could not comprehend this and quite innocently do and say thing to arouse the young girl 's dream i think i have say that jack be a very comely fellow he be big and brawny and tireless in good-humor and the attractive little gallantry that woman adore he look as sentimentally sincere utter a paradox as another vow eternal fidelity he give every woman the impression that he mind be lose wonder how he should exist until she give he the right to call she he own though as a matter of fact it be the man who be the woman 's own -- when the final word come rosa be not long in discover vincent 's happy tumult in olympium 's presence and she secretly misunderstand jack the more that he be so lavish and open in he adulation if he ride he exhaust eulogy in describe she pose she daring she skill if they dance as they do nearly every night until poor merry 's finger ache from drum the unholy strain of faust strauss and what not in the old-fashioned waltz -- he pantingly declare that she make the music seem a celestial choir by she lightness in long walk in the rose-field he exhaust a not very laborious store of botanical conceit to make she cheek resemble the rose this assurance this recklessness this _ aplomb _ quite bewilder the girl who pose in richmond for a pass mistress of flirt she have unless rumor be badly at fault jilt a appalling list of the stripling who believe that beard-growing and love-making be conventionally contemporaneous event but they have moon about she and make themselves absurd in vain while this unconscious adoni calmly walk talk and act as if she could know nothing else than love he and one day she start in delicious misery to find that she do -- that be she think she might if -- if but there she dream become nebulous -- they be rosy in outline however and she be content to rest there the morning after the come of the cavalry-troop wesley be discuss the never-ending theme of how he be go to get home -- with kate busy arrange the fern she have bring from the swamp really wesley just now you ought to be content there be no likelihood of any movement besides philosophy be as much a merit in a soldier as valor -- it be valor it be endurance you complain of you unhappy fate house here with a lot of woman and idler how would you bear up in libby prison there be as good man as you there my dear shall i say better or older soldier brutus you may take you choice and ` count on a sister 's blind partiality to justify you ' oh do not always talk nonsense kate you be worse than jack sprague he do not seem to have a serious thought in he head from daylight till bedtime perhaps he keep all he sober thought for the night to give they good company no but do say what i ought to do you ought to study to make yourself tolerable to you sister dear and agreeable to the other fellow ' sister i have remark that the young man who do that keep out of despondency and other uncomfortable condition that too much brood on a empty head bring about i would like to know what heart i can have to make myself agreeable to other fellow ' sister when you be always lampoon I you delight in make I think i be nobody do not fear my dear if that be my delight i should die a old maid never have know delight for it would need more force than i can muster to make wesley boone captain usa anything else than he be -- he father 's pride and he sister 's joy no dear my delight be to see you gay and open and frank and manly self-dependent grateful for the consideration show you and recognizant of the constant admonition of you sagacious sister you talk exactly like the woman in george sand 's stupid story they always remind I of man in petticoat that be a weak and strained comparison not however unworthy a soldier we always compare in speech to strengthen assertion or adorn it and when we do we compare what be equivocal or vague with what be well know and usual now i do not remember any man in petticoat unless you mean the oriental who wear a sort of skirt and the scot who use to wear kilt -- but strictly speak -- do kate for heaven 's sake be serious for a moment i have a chance to escape no matter how but i can make my way to we line without run any great risk now be it or be it not dishonorable for I to do it seriously wesley just now it would be while vincent be here for he be in a sense pledge for you to he superior further there be no need to hurry you be barely recover if you be north you would be in acredale if you be there be no immediate want of you presence in

particulars regard dick 's theory and say vaguely you have color enough here to theorize on i be sure yes we have have very satisfactory experiment dick assented naïvely steal a glance at rosa but quite inconclusive she rejoin move onward the two young man follow in the penumbra of she wide hat chapter xviii a campaign of plot meanwhile there be curious event pass and come to pass on the seven hill upon which the proud young capital of the proud young confederacy stand rome in she most imperial day never dream of the scenic glory that richmond like a spoil beauty be hardly conscious of hold as she dower indeed such be the necromantic mastery of the passion of the beautiful that once stand on the glorious hill that command the jame for twenty mile -- twenty mile of such varied loveliness of color configuration and _ mis en scène _ that the purple distance of naple seem common to it -- stand there i say one day when the sword have long be rusting in the scabbard and the memory of those who raise it in revolt have fade from all mind save those who want office -- this historian think that have it be he lot to be bear in that lovely spot he too would have fight for state caprice -- just as a gallant man will take up the quarrel of beauty right or wrong thought of this sort fill barney moore 's mind too that delicious September afternoon as he stand gaze dreamily down the river toward that vague morning-land of the sun 's rise where he mind see the long line of blue he eye ache to rest on barney have leave the kindly roof where he have be nurse back to vigor he have quit it in a fashion that leave a rankle sorrow in he grateful heart vincent have represent to jack the inconvenience it would be the peril rather for he to assume the guardianship of so many enemy of the confederacy score of the old family of the city be under the ban simply because they have plead for deliberation before decide on the secession ordinance the atterbury have they enemy too it be point out that vincent and rosa have be educate in the north that mr atterbury have spend many of she recent summer there they devotion to the confederacy must be show by deed it be true they have give twenty thousand dollar to the cause but what be that to threefold millionaire general lee they kinsman have shake he socratic head solemnly when rosa at the war department tell he as a excellent joke the strange chance that have bring vincent 's college chum and he family under the kind rosedale roof richard perley be therefore deputize to rescue barney from he false position and give he a chance for exchange when the time come he journey up to richmond and one day lay these fact before barney who instantly see he friend 's dilemma and at once set about invent a _ ruse _ that should extricate he without mortify the kind people who have befriend he when he be able to be about he feign a desire to go to he friend in arrowfield county south of the jame and be bid hearty godspeed then with fund supply by jack he gain admittance to a modest house far out on main street where the city merge into the country they be simple people and he thrilling tale of be a refugee from harper 's ferry be plausible enough to be accept by more skeptical people than the gannat day after day barney skirt furtively about the uncompromising wall of libby and castle thunder where once or twice he have go with he host to make a mental diagram of the place for future use little by little he become familiar with richmond which like a new bride give the visitor welcome to admire she splendid spouse the confederate government he learn all the plot of the prison and become the confidant of letitium lanview know to every exile in richmond as the friend of the suffering -- st veronica she be call -- after a poem dedicate to she by a young harvard graduate rescue by she perseverance from death in libby prison with this lady he drive all about the environs of richmond and several time far out toward the meditate route of flight in order that he might be able to lead the bewildered refugee he get the whole landscape by heart and could have lead a battalion over it in the dark then he pass day wander over the libby hill down in the bed of the rocket as the bed of the jame be know in those day he learn the ground to the very beat of the patrol that guard the wretched prisoner in the towering shambles one whole night too he spend in mark the course of the guard as they change in two-hour relief with he fact well collect he visit mr lanview and at last he be confront by butler 's agent this agent be a middle-aged man who have evidently once be very handsome but dissipation have leave pitiable trace upon he fine feature and he once large open eye that perplexingly suggest some one barney try in vain to recall -- vainly the man do not say much in the lady 's presence but when the two be in the open air face toward the center of the town he divulge a good deal that surprise barney you be from acredale young man i live there when i be younger than i be now my name people call I a good many name i do not mind at all so that i have rum enough and a bed and a bite to eat no man can have more than that my boy i be plain dick jone now it be a easy name and plenty of the same in the land and if i should die suddenly there would be lot o ' folk to feel sorry eh but as you be from acredale i do not mind tell you that it be elisha boone that foot the bill butler be a friend of boone 's and he have give I authority to summon all the troops within reach to my aid my business be to carry young we boone to fort monroe butler do not know that he think i be spy jeff davi and piping for the prisoner he do not say that he want I to kill davi but if we could carry he to fort monroe my boy there would be about a million dollar swag to divide how do that strike you it do not strike I at all i think it be for the interest of the union that davi should be where he be he be vain arrogant silly and dull he will alone wreck the rebel cause if he be give time there could not be a greater misfortune for the north than to have davi displace by some one of real ability such as stephen lee benjamin mason breckenridge or in fact any of the man identify with secession you surprise I my son still admit all you say the man who should surprise the north some fine morning with a present of jeff davi on they breakfast-plate would not be without honor to say nothing of promotion and profit oh if we can carry jeff off without compromise the safety of the prisoner i 'll join you heartily but first of all we must rescue they unquestionably now here be the program : butler 's force will be within gunshot of magruder 's line on warwick creek Thursday -- that be three day from now the prisoner will be out of the sewer Wednesday after midnight you know the road eastward you will lead they to the swamp near williamsburg there we will have boat to take part down the river the rest will make through the swamp under my lead i have be spy out the land for a week at a place call rosedale we pick up young boone who be really the object of my journey i could not find he for week and inquire of all the prisoner mr lanview finally put I on the track and i see we boone as i come up here he think the chance be better with a big party than alone i see he again yesterday and he tell I that davi and lee he chief of staff be to be at a party in the rosedale house on Thursday next now we can pick up davi just as well as boone there be the whole plan oh that be a different matter davi will not be near the city and he keep will not add to we danger i see no reason why we should not grab he heaven what a sensation it will make we shall be the wonder of the north -- we shall he like the man that discover andré and arnold -- paulding and -- and -- but here barney 's historical fact come to a end -- we shall be famous for -- forever for a week my son wonder do not live long in these fast day for a week the north will glorify we then if they find that we vote for dougla as i do they will say we have some sinister design in bring davi north and likely send we to fort lafayette barney stop dead they have come under a gas-lamp between grace and franklin street he look at the man he be quite sober he eye answer the young man 's indignant protest glance openly unshrinkingly humorously i should be sorry to think that mr jone well wait when you get north you will see a mighty change in thing sentiment my boy follow the main chance it be money my boy money enough money would have make juda respectable he be fool enough to put he price too low ugh -- you almost make I hate the north who can have heart to fight for such heartless trafficker the north do not ask you heart it have count the cost and find that it can pay a million of man thirteen dollar a month for three year and still make a good thing out of it -- that be about the breadth of it here be a oasis in the desert of darkness come and have a drink but barney -- not care for a drink the cynic -- give he he address and dreadfully cast down in spirit the eager partisan mope up the long hill homeward the next day mr lanview give he the detail of the meditate escape there be only sixty or a hundred in position to avail themselves of the subterranean way that have be toilsomely dig by a few devoted spirit with tool casually drop among they by the guileless veronica during she daily visit the plotter count on at least six hour ' start before discovery the guard be not to be disturbed and the evasion would not be know until eight o'clock when the miserable breakfast ration be distribute of that amazing-exploit the digging through twenty solid foot of earth and stone i do not propose to tell it be to be find in the journal of the day : it be contain in the hundred pathetic narrative of the man who take part it have nothing to do with this history beyond the use make of it to mislead the ingenious barney and in the end complicate the career of those in whom we be interested suffice it therefore to say that in the dim morning mist as arrange a shadowy host emerge on the river-bottom now dry and footable that each man as he crawl from the pit be direct into the thick willow border the bank that when six score or more have clamber out they obey a whisper command for which veronica have prepare they and noiselessly in shadowy single file they follow the bed of the stream even where the water flow deep and dangerous until they come to the gentle slope of church hill then under guidance of barney those who be wise follow swiftly down the river-road until daylight when they hide in the dim recess of the white-oak swamp where they lay conceal many hour as night fall they face hopefully forward down the williamsburg road until a flaming wave in the air admonish they to strike to the right and they plunge into the pathless swamp of the chickahominy here they be secure no force able to cope with they could enter no force at the command of magruder could surround they but barney 's guide hand be now replace by another jone have appear and with he man bear butler 's commission the prisoner of libby set up a defiant cheer they be once more under the flag father abraham be again they commander there be sedate fatherly man among these rescue band there be man with gray hair and sober behavior man who could bow meekly under the chastening rod but the antic of the juvenile group in which we be mainly interested be grave and decorous compare with the abandon delirious joy of these grave man as they reach the recess of a swamp that deny admission to all save practice explorer why here they could subsist for week the rebel might spy they might surround they but they need not starve -- the bud be food the bush refreshment the pellucid pool drink and life barney stare in speechless amazement at the unseemly gambol of the motley mass delirium it be a mild term for the embrace the prance the carmagnole-like ecstasy of the half-clad madman run amuck in the almost unendurable joy of liberation barney know that this condition of thing would never do all who bear commission in the army be select from the man the highest in rank who prove to be a colonel be invest with the command barney serve as adjutant and jone as guide the rabble have make a good meal from the spoil of a sweet-potato patch push forward through the fretwork of fern rank morass and verdure toward security but the march be a snail 's pace as may be imagine the man wear to skeleton by month of captivity insufficient food and stint exercise be force to halt often for rest in such toilsome march as the half-aquatic surface of the swamp involve by Thursday noon they be still far from the river forager be detail to procure food and pend they return the wearied band sink to the earth to rest in less than two hour the predatory platoon return with a sybaritic store -- chicken young lamb green corn onion only the stern command of the colonel suppress a mighty cheer when the march be resume the colonel lead the main column south by east jone with barney and a dozen man strike due east in answer to barney 's surprised question jone inform he they be to pick up we boone by take that route difficult as the way have be heretofore it now become laborious in the extreme for this smaller band the bottom be all under water and before they have proceed a mile half the group be drench in many case a imprudent plunger be compel to call a halt to rescue he shoe -- that be those who be lucky enough to have shoe -- from the deep mud hide by a fair green surface of moss or tendril it be a wondrous journey to barney the page of sindbad alone seem to have a parallel for the awful mystery of that long long flight through jungle of towering timber whose leaf and bark be as unfamiliar as brazilian growth to the troops of pizarro or the congo vegetation to the french pioneer jone and he comrade see nothing but the hardship of the march and the delay of the painful _ détours _ in the solemn glade the direction be keep by compass many of the man have be supply with a miniature instrument by the prudent foresight of mr lanview who be niggard of neither time nor money in the cause she have at heart in spite of every effort a march so swift that it would have exhaust cavalry jone 's rank do not reach the rendezvous until midnight at about that hour the exhaust fugitive come suddenly upon a wide open plain and far below they in the valley a vision of light and life shone through the dark there boy we be at the end of we first stage unless i be much mistaken that bit of merry-making yonder will cost the confederacy a chief but be it certain that davi be there ask the man jone call moon who seem to be he intimate ah that we will learn so soon as nasmyd report we will give the signal when we reach that fringe of wood yonder it be back of the grounds separate from they by a hard piece of swamp and water -- man you must follow now in single file and when we get in the swamp mind a single step out of line will cost you you life for suck into that morass wild horse can not pull you out then as they plunge anew in the gloomy deep of swamp and brake the friendly light be lose and the depressed wayfarer struggle on with something of the feeling of a crew cast away at sea who throw upon the crest of a rise billow catch a near glimpse of a great ship light and taut ride serenely havenward to lose it the next in the dire waste presently the melancholy bird-note that have puzzle jack in the same vicinity day before break out just in front of barney who be clamber along the third man from the head of the little column again after a long pause the sweet plaintive note be re-echoed from a distance ah all be well he hear jone ejaculate triumphantly we be in time and we be wait for -- now man put all the heart that be in you to the next half-hour 's work no danger but just cool head and strong arm this good news be convey from man to man and the toilsome movement briskly accelerate under the inspiring watchword shortly afterward the larger growth -- cypress and oak -- diminish as the band straggle into the open starry night at the margin of what they could tell be water by the croaking of frog and plashing of night bird and reptile then the train be halt jone leave nasmyd in command and plunge into a thick skirt of bush now barney hot and dirty from the march have shoot ahead when he hear the ripple of the water he have take off he shoe to bathe he blistered and swollen foot and sit quite still and restful under the leafy spray of a odorous bush that even in the dark he know to be honeysuckle well he hear jone cry in a exultant whisper we have do it the woman be a trump there be a hundred nearly of the prisoner go to the boat now we be ready for boone be davi here yes he come over from williamsburg at eight o'clock they be feast when clem come away a three or more ago any cavalry at the house a squadron but they be order to be in saddle for they quarter at midnight there be the bugle for boot and saddle now yes by the eternal what luck davi will sleep there so clem say the state chamber have be prepare for he all the rest except lee go back to williamsburg we could not have arrange it better if we have be give the order of it be all the boat here yes and the negro -- how many have you i can not say they have be drop across in two and three since ten o'clock the curious thing be that the woman be more take with the idea of fight than the man we shall have enough -- too many i fear we 'll make they we safety jim my boy we 'll divide they up and in case of pursuit send they in different direction to confuse the troops how many man be you go to take to the house six with you and I it will be unsafe to take more as the boat be small i will go back and select the man you get the boat ready barney hurry on he shoe crawl through the bush and be in he place when jone presently appear the man dead tire be dispose about on the ground asleep not mind the damp grass or the heavy dew that make the air fairly misty wake four of the man jone whisper and when they be arouse he say to a tall reel shadow idly wait order : we 'll be back in a half-hour or a hour at the farthest let the man sleep they need it sleep yourself if you want to moon or i will come to rouse you and we will bring you plenty of bacon and hominy have no fear if you hear movement just beyond you there be a couple of contraband here who go with we here be a ration of tobacco for the man when they wake and a gallon of whisky which you must serve out gradually revive by this stimulate news quite as much as by the whisky barney and he three comrade follow jone to the boat there be four -- the dug-out we see jack manoeuvring in the same water a few night before a negro sit silent shadowy in each and when jone give the word let drive the bark shoot through the water propel by the single scull as swiftly as a indian canoe in a few moment all debark on the grassy knoll behind the black line of hedge jone make straight for the high doorway and insert a key it be noiselessly open man he whisper no name must be use in any case i be number one jim here be number two moore number three and so on each one remember he number clem will remain here with number six to guard the gate all the rest follow I two negro join the party that steal forward through the rose-field to the negro quarter all be silent as they reach the great kitchen behind the house and connect with it by a trellised pavilion only a occasional light could be see in the house all be apparently there the ball have end leave barney in charge of the rest jone and number two creep along the trellis toward the house and soon disappear around the southern corner jone presently return and say exultingly : the cavalry be go we have nothing to fear -- plato you go with number two to the stable and bring the horse out hold six and send the rest scattering in the field so that in case of anybody 's be in the mind to follow hell have to use he leg and we can beat they at that game where be the rope he ask the black man leave in the group in de kitchen massa get they must i go alone massa that be a fact -- there moore you go with the boy -- do not be a minute barney follow the sable marauder through the grounds to the rear of the trellis and creep with he through a window which stand open the kitchen be dark but the negro seem perfectly familiar with the place he make directly for a dark panel in the northern wall open a cupboard-door knelt down and begin to grope among bottle box and what not that housewife gather in such receptacle oh de lor ' dey be not no rope it be do go have you a match barney ask no massa but dey be some yondah find they the boy creep cautiously in the direction of the passage lead into the house he fumble about a age as it seem to the impatient barney and at last utter a exclamation : get 'em no massa but ise suah dey kep dar take my hand and lead I it be molasses massa and ise all stickem the voice in the dark whisper delightedly and barney could see a double row of glisten white ivory in the dim light that come through the window he come nearer the clumsy wight and see that it be a pan of batter the cook have leave on the table probably the morning griddle-cake the negro be a mass of white pasty glue and knelt on the floor lick he hand passively where be the match under de clock in a tin safe massa -- right da barney grope angrily about the table on the clock-shelf knock down a tin dish that fall with the clatter of a burst magazine in the dense stillness of the night both draw back in shadow wait with heart-beat that sound in they ear like tramp horse on thick sward the clamor of rush steed in the lane suddenly drown this a loud joyous whinny sound in the very kitchen it seem and there be a rush houseward past the pantry as of a troop of cavalry then a blood-curdling outcry of voice then shot barney leave the negro writhe in convulsion under the table dart to the window -- to the rendezvous it be desert chapter xix he either fear he fate too much when vincent visit the stable on the morning of that eagerly-looked-for Thursday he find three of the horse clammy with perspiration and give every sign of have be ride the awkward and evasive answer of the stableman would not have be enough for any other than a man preoccupy by love when rosa go to the kitchen if she head have not be take up with the love in she heart she must certainly have remark that the store of food prepare for the household be curiously diminish and the kitchen girl unwontedly reserve indeed in any other condition than that in which the family now find themselves they must have remark a singular change in the black brigade in kitchen and garden but preocupy each with a different interest as well as the preparation for the president 's _ fête _ the atterbury remark nothing sinister in the distract conduct of they servant and have only a vague feeling that the great event have in some sort paralyze they wont noisy activity and repress they usual chatter kate 's uneasiness and restless vagary she disjointed talk and half-guilty evasion would have be remark by she prepossessed host while wesley 's shift and moody silence would have warn he comrade that he be suffer the pang of a evil do or meditate precursive sign like these -- and much more which need not be dwell on -- the kind host of rosedale make no note of but when vincent open the mail-bag -- bring by a orderly from williamsburg every morning the first surprise and shock of the day be feel -- though in vary degree by all the diverse inmate of the house hah glory to the lord of host the exultant reader cry as he pass to he mother a large official envelope at the breakfast-table i be order to the field he cry as jack look inquiringly i be to set out to-night and report for duty with general johnston to-morrow at manassa no more loitering in my lady 's bower jack my boy the carpet will be clear for you knightly prank after to-night if it be aladdin 's magic rug i should caper nimbly enough i warrant you what would you wish -- if it be under you foot with its slave at you command i should whisk you all off -- north -- instanter ingrate -- plunge we into the chilly blast of the north in return for we glorious southern sun fie jack i be surprised at such selfish ingratitude we expect better thing of we prisoner mr atterbury murmur and affect a reprove frown at the culprit as she hand she son back the order with a still sigh the sun of the south be not the sun of york to we you know all the cloud that lower on we house be doubly darken by this southern sun even the warmth of rosedale heart can not make up for we eclipsed northern star jack say sadly with a wistful look at the rival warrior reading with sparkling eye the instruction accompany the order to march since vincent be go so far northward i think it will be a good time for we to go home mr sprague begin tentatively oh -- no -- no oh we could never think of such a thing rosa cry -- could we mamma why should you go mr atterbury ask until jack be exchange you have certainly no duty in the north so important as watch over this headstrong fellow we can not think of you go -- unless you be weary of we o mr atterbury pray do not put it in that way you know better we visit here have be perfect but you can understand my anxiety to be at home to be where i can aid my son 's release i have be anxious for some time to broach the subject but i see that we go would be a trouble to you now since fortune offer this chance we must seize it -- that be those of we who feel it a duty to go and she look meaningly at merry and she daughter nonsense you be hostage for vincent in case he be capture as long as you be here i can not let you go -- under the law of war -- i can not can i vincent vincent look at jack solemnly but make no answer mamma be quite right while you be with we no harm can come to vincent for if he should be take prisoner we can threaten the yankee government to put you to torture unless he be well treat rosa interrupted reassuringly we should be far more aid and comfort to vincent if we be in the north than we could be here if he be take prisoner and wound we could return he the kindness we have receive here in any event we could lessen the hardship of prison life oh you would have to minister to a mind diseased if such a fate should befall I vincent cry sentimentally with a glance into olympium 's eye which meet he at the moment both blush and olympium to relieve the embarrassment say decisively : mamma be right jack must have he family on the ground to watch over he interest i be sure there be some underhand work responsible for this long delay in he case for i saw by _ the whig _ last week that exchange of prisoner have be make i think that -- but suddenly remember the presence of kate and wesley she do not finish the thought which imply a belief in the intervention of the elder boone -- to jack 's detriment in the end -- when the two mother talk the matter over -- mr sprague carry the point she convince mr atterbury that there be danger to jack in a longer stay of he family in the confederate line vague report have already reach they from acredale of the suspicious hostility in which the democrat be hold after bull run the northern papers which come through the line quite regularly leave no doubt that democratic leaning be universally interpret in the north as evidence of rebel sympathy if not partisanship such a charge as thing stand would be fatal to jack and the mother 's duty be plain she have friend in washington once powerful who could stand between she son and calumny -- perhaps more serious danger -- when she be present in person to explain he conduct if she could not at once secure he exchange she could save he from compromise in the present inflammable and capricious state of the public mind understand this and the enmity of boone mr atterbury not only make no further objection but acknowledge the urgent necessity of the mother 's presence in the north the idle life of rosedale have grow unbearably irksome to merry too i feel as if i be a rebel she confide to mr sprague in the evening talk when the piano sound and the young people be make the hour pass in gayety it be a sin for we to laugh and be contented here when we friend be bear the burden of war i shall be ashamed to show my face in acredale oh i wish i could carry a musket you might carry a canteen my dear i believe the regiment take out _ vivandières _ -- there would be a outlet for you warlike emotion mr sprague say with the purpose of cheer the unhappy spinster ah no i must not give encouragement to that dreadful richard but we shall go now thank heaven and it will comfort my sister to have the boy back on northern soil even if he persist in be a soldier she have a long talk with jack on the subject that tempest-tossed knight convince she that it would only incite the boy to more unruliness to persist in he quit the army or to urge he northward now before a exchange be properly arrange indeed he be a prisoner -- take in battle -- though he name do not appear on the list so vincent 's sudden going be welcome as a stroke of good fortune the atterbury understand the natural feeling of the family make only perfunctory opposition olympium and kate be to remain until they brother ' fate be decide vincent who have be for week wildly impatient to return to the field be divide in mind now -- by joy and despair he have put off and put off a last appeal to olympium he have not have a opportunity or rather have too much opportunity -- and have from day to day defer the longed-for yet dreaded decision when ready to speak prudence whisper that it would be better to leave the question open until it should come up of itself she would learn every day to know he better in he own home where all the artificiality of life be strip from a man by the concurrent abrasion of family love and domestic _ devoir _ she would see that however unworthy of she love he might have seem in the old boyish day at acredale now he could be a man when manliness be demand that he could be patient reticent humble in the trial she caprice or coquetry put upon he she have it seem to he deepen and broaden the current of he love during these blissful week of wait she very reserve under the new condition surround she have make more luminous the beauty of she heart and mind she be no longer the airy capricious olympium of he college day the pensive gravity of misfortune and premature responsibility have ennoble and make more tangible the trait that have win he in she northern home she have not avoid he during these week of purify probation as he fear she would of late -- jack 's state be secure -- she have revive much of the old vivacity and deepen the thrall that hold he but now the merry-making season which have open before they be at a end the madrigal that well up in he soft heart must sing themselves in the silence of the night in the camp yonder with no ear to comprehend no heart to melt to they he should probably not get a chance to see she again during the conflict how long perhaps a year -- for it would take two campaign as the rebel leader reckon to convince the north that the confederacy be unconquerable and what might not happen during those momentous month perhaps jack 's death -- and then they would be divide as by fire -- or if the conflict result victoriously for the south as he know it must he foresee that the soldier of the conquer army would not be receive as a wooer in the family of the defeat he know she so well she would in the very pride of outraged patriotism give she love to one of the defeat rather than add to the triumph of the hate south she have strong conviction on the war she hate slavery and she could not be make to see that the south be war for liberty not to sustain slavery these thought run through vincent 's troubled mind as he mother direct the preparation for the _ fête _ of the president kate jack and dick be press into the service of decorate the apartment olympium leave the room with she mother to advise and assist in make ready for the journey north and vincent aid he mother with a sadly divide mind keep furtive watch on the hallway she hold he hour in suspense he think almost wrathfully of deliberate purpose for she must have read in he eye that he want to talk with she the artless dick finally give he a chance i say vint get polly to show you the rose need for the table i 'll be with you by-and-by to cut the fern do you think you could make yourself of that much use you be not worth a straw here send for miss polly and i 'll do my best vincent say with a gulp to conceal he joy she appear presently and as they be pass out of the door rosa cry imperiously : oh yes vint we need ever so much honeysuckle you know where it hang thickest -- in the owl 's glen olympium will like to see that -- the haunt of she favorite bird and the busy little maid laugh cheerily like a disorder goddess intoxicate by the exhale odor of the floral chaos _ en route _ for roumelium then vincent cry in military cadence as the florist set out roumelium be the name jack have give the rose-land near the stream in fanciful allusion to the turkish province of flower halt at the gardener 's cottage vincent procure a immense pair of shears like a double rapier in size and bidding the man follow to gather the blossom he push into the bloom vineyard with such a instrument i should say it be the golden fleece you be after olympium cry as he reach she side though i believe jason do not do the shear no the power of air work for he and he find he quest ready to he hand i be sure the power of air have not deny you look at those radiant rank of blossom bend to be gather ah yes beauty stoop sometimes to welcome the tremble hand of the suitor you hand be rather unsteady -- infirm of purpose give I the blade she take they laughingly and snip the green stem rapidly and dexterously yes i believe man be infirm in moral purpose as compare to woman it be only in the brutality of life that man be decisive do you mean that woman approach the trial of life less thinkingly and act less rationally than man yes and no the daring too much be always before a man the daring too little be i think the only trouble a woman have oh that be a large question involve too much mental strain in a garden of rose where the sens sleep and one be content with mere breath and the faintest motion there be enough rose now we will go for the wild smilax and honeysuckle perhaps the cool air of the pool will restore you mental activity they leave the dismembered rose scatter in fragrant heap on the shaded path and walk slowly toward the dense hedge what a perfect fortress this green wall make of the garden olympium say glance around the great square where the solid green wall could be see run up much higher than they head yes as i say the other day it would take hard work for a invade force to get at the house unless traitor within give up the gate this one he add unlock a massive oak door cross with thick plank and stud with iron bolt alone admit from the creek and swamp it be lock all the time no one have the key except the gardener who deliver it to mamma every night a feudal demesne it take one back to the so-called day of chivalry why do you say ` so-called ' to I they be the delight of the past -- when man go to battle for the smile of the woman they love when knight ride the world over in search of adventure and my lady in she donjon listen with pleasure to the lover 's roundelay ah it be a perfect life a enchanting time we be live in a coarse brutal age chivalry be the creed of civilization the knight the priesthood of the higher life there be the southerner through and through in that sentimentality to I chivalry means all that be narrow cruel and rapacious in man the philander knight be sensual booby the simpering dame soulless wanton life mean simply the rule of the strong the slaughter of the weak servitude be its law and robbery its method have you ever travel in out-of-the-way place in germany austrium or italy no i have never be abroad you would know better what i mean if you have see the monstrous relic of the age you admire the few rule the many the knight be simply a brotherhood of blood and rapine man be slave woman be worse the bravest be as unlettered as you body-servant the most beautiful dame as termagant as penelope the cook at the table man and woman eat from a common dish without fork or spoon man guzzle gallon of unfermented wine a bath be unknown cleanliness be as unpracticed as islamism in new york ugh anything but chivalry for I but surely the great lord be not what you represent they be gentle bear gentle breed they could not be robber they live from great estate they be the ` knight of st nichola ' which in the slang of the middle age mean what they call in the west road agent indeed plain highwayman they be call in england in bacon 's day vincent bent over discomfited and hold the little shallop until olympium be seat and then push off into the murky stream do you see those streamer of loveliness wave welcome to you fair damsel -- nature know its kind that be one word for I and one for yourself she cry seize the dainty pink spray that now trail over she head and shoulder as the boat glide along the fringe of hush support the clinging vine oh no olympium i can not speak even one word for myself i have be tremble to do it this six week but you eye have none of the invitation these starry blossom offer we i be go to say now olympia what i have to say -- for after to-day there will be no chance what have be on my mind you have long know you know that i love you how much i love you how impossible it be to think of life without you i dare not venture to say to you for you distrust we southern exaggeration but i do love you ah my god all the world else -- my mother my sister my duty seem nothing compare to the one passionate hope in my breast do you believe I olympia -- do you doubt I far from it vincent -- dear vincent -- no -- no -- sit where you be and listen to I -- she be deeply move and the lover in he heart curse the luckless veil of blossom that she apparently without design draw before she face i do believe all you say i know it before you say it but you remember we go over this very same ground before since then it be true you have be the means of save we much misery how much i hardly dare think of when i look back to that dreadful day when mamma lay in the fever of come disease and the hopelessness of despair all i can say dear dear vincent be what i say before wait until thine and mine be no longer at war wait until one flag cover we -- but that can never be wait i have faith that it will be if one flag should cover we -- my flag -- would you -- would you -- ah vincent do not ask I do not force I to say something thing that will make you unhappy since i do not know my own mind well enough yet to answer as you wish I to answer -- but you can tell I now whether you love I or at least whether there be any one you love more i do not think i love you i know however that i think no more of any one else than i think of you pray let that suffice but how cruel that be olympia it be as much as to say that you will not wait and see whether you may meet some one that you can be surer of than you be of I i must distress you whatever i say vincent frankly i do not think you can decide just now whether you heart be really engage i think you do not know I as a man should know the woman he make he wife i be certain i do not know you if you have be bear and breed in the north i should have no difficulty in decide but you way be so different here : woman be accord so much before marriage and make so little of a man 's life after marriage that i shrink from a promise which if lightly or inconsiderately give would bring the last misery a woman can confront what olympium you think southern man do not hold marriage to be sacred i think that the southern man have a good deal of the knight you speak of in he and like the frenchman marry inconsiderately and do penance in infidelity at least to the form if not the fact of the relation o olympium where do you get such repulsive idea of we who have be traduce we to you i judge from the southern man i have see north pardon I vincent i do not see how it can be otherwise in a society base upon human servitude to live on the labor of a helot people blunt the finer sensibility of man and woman alike when you can look unshrinkingly at the separation of husband and wife on the auction-block when you can see innocent child take from they mother and sell into eternal separation i think it be not unnatural in I to fear that a woman with my conviction would not be happy mate with a southerner all this be cruel i fear you will think but it would be crueller for I to encourage a love that under present circumstance would bring misery to both of we you be a abolitionist yes every right-thinking person in the north be a abolitionist to this extent we want the south to take the remedy into its own hand to free its slave voluntarily the radical abolitionist prefer a violent means that i do not seek or do not but now vincent it be bind to come and if it should come what would you answer to my question here be a white rose : i pick it with my hand and you see a drop of my blood be on it when you can give I a rose with a drop of you blood on it as free from taint as the stain mine make i shall have a answer that will not be unworthy you wait for unworthy i do not understand you surely you do not think I a profligate when the time come that no human be acknowledge you ownership perhaps you may receive a voluntary bond-maid bind to you by stronger tie than the chattel of the slave but you love I then olympia i can not love where i do not reverence but it be not my fault that slave be my inheritance it will be you fault if they be you support when you be you own master you love a idea better than you love a man who would die for you i love manliness and the sense of right which be call duty better than i love a man who be blind to the first impulse of real manhood -- would you ask a jew to give up he synagogue to gain you hand the synagogue be the temple of a creed as divine as my own and the faith of the man i loved would never swerve I in accept or refuse he we of the south believe slavery a divine institution -- that be first establish by the father the tribe in the fijus island believe man-eat a ordinance of the god well this sort of discussion lead to nothing vincent say ruefully the world be well lose for the woman one love when i come to you shear of my world ah then vincent you will find another he draw she hand from the clinging vine and kiss it i be very happy i shall lose my world with a very light heart the world be a very tough brier we sometimes bring it closer when its thorn prick we more painfully in the struggle to cast it off then i 'll cut the bramble and not risk tear my flesh that be the soldier 's way -- the heroic way but wait for the future i be young and you be not old vincent 's gayety when they return to the drawing-room attract the observant dick and he slyly whisper to the warrior be practice the roman strategy with the sabine no i have be at the temple of minerva and take a pledge to hold my tongue ah the goddess of the owl but as they see light only in darkness i fear you grope in blackness the whole household be to meet president davi and he party in williamsburg assist at the review and get back with the distinguished guest in time for a state dinner merry and mr sprague be reluctant to go but they fear a refusal would be misunderstand poor merry be very tearful and disconsolate at the thought of leave dick but she strive heroically to hide she grief when the cavalcade set out the elder lady drive the young people mount the ancient capital of virginium be aflame with the new rebel bunting president davi with general lee and magruder be in place on the pretty green before the old colonial college edifice when the rosedale people come up davi salute mr atterbury with cordial urbanity but as the troops be already in column there be only time for hasty presentation of the stranger jack watch the rather piebald pageant with absorb interest the infantry march wretchedly the arm be as vary as the uniform and the artillery seem a relic of jackson 's time but the cavalry be superb never have he see such splendid rank such noble horse at sight of the tall elegant figure of the president the troops break into the peculiar shrill cheer that afterward become a sound of wonder almost terror to unaccustomed northern ear it be a mingling of the boyish treble of college cry and the menacing shriek of the wild-cat jack be secretly very much delighted with the review more than half the rank and file be mere boy and he could see that they be unruly almost to point-blank disregard of they officer command or the prescription of the manual it would take short work for the disciplined host the new northern general be train to sweep such chaff from the field of war vincent see something of this in he comrade 's eye and a good deal nettle himself by the slovenly march and humorous abandon of the man he say : you must remember jack we army be make up of gentleman 's son the gentry of the south be all in arm and we can not at once reduce they to the mere machine a more heterogeneous soldiery can be make the man who win manassa pass in review a day or two before the battle and they make the same impression upon I -- upon beauregard himself -- that i see these man have make on you depend upon it in a fight they will be good soldier let I have the poor comfort of underrate my enemy the thing above all other that a wise man shun and a fool indulge oh on that theory revile they if you like no indeed i be far from revile they the cavalry be magnificent i do not think we have a regiment in we army that can compare with that brigade who command it jeb stuart -- the murat of the south vincent say proudly i be go to tell the president what you say of the brigade you know he be passionately fond of the army and really want to be the commander-in-chief when they make he president at montgomery at sunset the president and general lee enter the carriage with mr atterbury and mr sprague merry drive in a phaeton with kate who do not enjoy so long a ride on the horse i be glad we have get such important hostage as yourself and son davi say gallantly to mr sprague as the carriage pass out of the clamor of acclamation the crowd set up i know the senator you husband intimately if he have live i doubt whether we should have be drive out of the union he be in my mind one of the most prudent statesman that come from the north to congress he certainly never would have consent to break up the union mr sprague say in embarrassment nor should i madam if there have be any further security in it the truth be there be nothing leave for we but to go out or be kick out the leader of the abolition party long ago proclaim that however war settle all such problem when it be settle by the sword we shall be satisfied mr atterbury change the conversation by ask how mr davi like richmond oh she have be treat royally by the people there i declare richmond be as southern a city as charleston i have be agreeably surprise by the absolute unanimity of gentle and simple in the cause my wife receive a clothes-basketful of letter every morning from the mother of the confederacy proffer time money and service wherever she can suggest anything for they to do i propose later on establish a order something like the golden fleece which shall confer a certain social precedence upon the wearer i have thousand of letter on the subject and as the society of the south be as a matter of fact a society of gentle-folk -- for the most part lineally descend from the nobility of older country -- i think it proper and right that lineage should have certain acknowledge advantage in the new commonwealth but i propose to go further and institute a order of something like nobility for woman -- who have thus far give we great help and encouragement indeed there be many in the congress -- a dozen senator i could name -- who think that we ought to make we regime entirely different from the north and that we should adopt a monarchical form -- i be sure i think we should mr atterbury exclaim delightedly we be really as unlike the northern people as the french or the german the strongest argument for declare the confederacy a empire be the one that weigh with napoleon i we should at one stroke secure the alliance of all the monarchy they have never look with favor on the experiment of a powerful republic over here and it be almost certain they would befriend we for transform this mighty infant state into a empire however that be for future action we agent abroad have send we full report on the matter i doubt the wisdom of ever hint such a thing general lee say gravely we must show that we be able to act independently in select we form of government i doubt very much whether the mass would listen favorably to a empire establish by foreign aid possibly general possibly as i say before there will be time enough for that when like napoleon we have make we army the master of this continent then with boundary embrace mexico canada and the western state -- for they can never exist independent of we -- we can choose empire republic or a venetian oligarchy as they come in sight of rosedale davi stand up in the carriage to get a better view of the landscape which show swift alternation of dense thicket and wood and roll acre of rich crop what a state virginium be he exclaim with enthusiasm it have the climate and soil to support half of europe mother of president in the past it will be the granary and magazine of the confederacy in ten year my own state mississippus be rich in land but the climate be hard for the stranger it enervate the european at first but we be a agricultural people or rather we give we energy to we staple cotton that be to be the chief treasure of the confederacy dinner be ready for the table when the guest come from they room davi excuse he lack of ceremonial dress say pleasantly : i be something of a soldier you know and travel with a light train lee there have the advantage of I a soldier 's uniform be court costume the world over but you be the commander-in-chief mr president do not you have a uniform no i be commander-in-chief only in law congress be really the commander-in-chief the man that assume those duty can attend to they alone he be of course subject to the executive but only in general plan rarely in detail davi be place at mr atterbury 's right mr sprague at she left general lee sit at vincent 's right _ vis-à-vi _ to jack who be lose in prodigious admiration of the socratic-like chieftain -- lee be as yet unknown to all but a discriminate few in the confederacy he be as tall as davi fully six foot -- but more round and symmetrical he speak with great gravity but seem to enjoy the jest that the young people find opportunity to indulge in when it be see that the president devote he talk exclusively to the hostess or mr sprague davi be a good talker and charm the company with reminiscence of old time in congress i do not remember lincoln distinctly he say conclude a reminiscence but i think he be the man that use to be so popular in the house cloak-room tell story which be say to be extremely droll mr lincoln be in some sort kin to mr davis be not she mr atterbury ask i have read it somewhere very distant mr lincoln be of the kentucky tod and they be in some way kin of my wife 's family the howell not enough to put on mourning if mr lincoln should become a widow be it true mr president that a society in the north have offer a million dollar for you capture -- abduction i hear it in williamsburg and see a allusion to it in _ the examiner _ the other day oh i be sure i can not say if the offer be authenticate i should be tempt to go and get the reward myself with a million dollar i could do a good deal more for the cause in the north than i can here make brigadier and settle question of precedence between cabinet minister judge and senator mr president give I a exchange north and i will ascertain the fact in the million-dollar offer and write you faithfully how to set about get the money jack say very soberly from he end of the table ah the yankee speak there -- nothing if not a bargain sir you deserve you clearance papers but i be too good a friend of mr atterbury and she daughter to bring about the loss of company that i be sure must be agreeable then too there be no tell the miracle of conversion that may be bring about by such minister as miss rosa there rosa blush jack feel foolish and everybody laugh except dick who look unutterable thing at he adored and boldly enter the list against the great personage by ask in a quiver treble : do not the bible say that the wife shall cleave to the husband that he people shall be she people he god she god where he go she go it be so say in the bible sir but it be a woman that utter it and she be in love when you know more of the sex you will understand that woman in love be like poet they say much that they do not mean and more that they do not understand but mr president what the one woman say in the bible all woman practice you never know a woman that do not believe she husband 's belief hate he hate love he love davi smile and he eye twinkle kindly on he boyish inquisitor i know only one woman that be as much as a man can speak for she do not hate my hate love my love or enter unprotestingly into all my way indeed i may say that be a peaceful man i want to remain in washington for i believe that seward be sincere in plead for a compromise but the woman i speak of have she own opinion convinced I that she be right and i come to my own people at this moment there be a diversion a soldier boot and spur enter the room walk to the head of the table and bend deferentially to the president say i be order to deliver this message wherever you may be find he hand davi a large envelope and retreat respectfully two or three pace backward everybody affect to resume conversation as the president break the seal say pardon I a moment madam but he have no sooner run over the line than he turn to the courier cry in visible discomfiture : when do you leave the war office at five o'clock sir general we must return instantly to richmond a hundred or more of the prisoner have break out of libby it be report that a column of the enemy with gunboat have pass up the jame -- madam this be one of the exigency of a time of war i need not say to a atterbury that everything must give way to public business he call lee aside speak rapidly to he and the latter beckoning vincent leave the room he return in ten minute announce that everything be in readiness to set out the carriage with mr sprague 's and merry 's small luggage be ready when the cavalcade set out davi ride with they and the cavalry company from below divide into squadron before and behind the carriage it be eleven o'clock as the last dark line of the troop disappear olympium and jack stand at the great gate in mournful silence the swiftness of the parting have lessen the pain but they mind be full of the sorrow that follow the inevitable mr sprague have herself decline to postpone the ordeal when mr atterbury point out the untimely hour no it be better to suffer this slight inconvenience to have vincent 's protect presence all the way to the union line and jack acknowledge this do not say a word to dissuade she vincent 's last act be to call jack to he room i want to tell you jack what a great joy it have be to I -- it have be to all of we -- to have you in we home at this try time i can not tell you how much comfort it have be to I now but some time you shall know vincent stammer and begin to open a drawer in the bureau here be something i want you to accept as a keepsake from I he draw forth a pistol-case and open it it will be a melancholy pleasure for I to feel in the dark day to come that these weapon may prove you friend in battle where i must be you enemy by george they be beauty jack cry take the weapon out yes they be buy last year and i have have j cut on one and va on the other i mean they for you christmas last year but they be mislay what a kind fellow you be vint i do not think i ought to take these why not i have other i shall feel easier know that you have they you can stow they about you easily they be so small but it be against the law of war for a prisoner to be arm that be just the reason i have not ask you to take they before you can leave they here in my room until you be exchange and then you can carry they with impunity the household assemble at the gate lead into the roadway as the cavalcade take up the march there be sad sob farewell speak -- the kindly night cover the tear and the loud neighing of the horse drown the sob the northern group remain in the roadway strain they eye to catch the last glimpse of the wanderer as they disappear in the misty foliage far up the roadway the horizon to the zenith be full of shimmering star-point olympium with jack turn slowly toward the house silent and not wholly sad dick in a low treble could be hear just behind they quote melancholy verse to rosa and the brother and sister return slowly up the dewy odorous path at the porch rosa exclaim in surprise : i wonder where pizarro be i have not see he while we have be out it can not be possible he have follow vincent what shall we do if he have make dick take he place a terrier be sometimes as faithful as a mastiff jack say quickly oh miss atterbury want something with a bite rather than a bark and a terrier would not do the boy answer i want pizarro i shall never sleep a wink all night if he be not here rosa say in consternation he be better than a regiment of soldier for he will not let a human be come near the house after the door be close not even the servant a expedition call upon pizarro in many key set out and wander through the grounds back to the quarter to the gate lead to the rose-field to the stable but pizarro be not to be find light be burn in the hall only when the four re-enter and with a very grave face rosa bid the rest good-night chapter xx a catastrophe rosedale have be a bed of thorn to wesley boone since he recovery he feel that he be a incongruous visitor among the rest as a hawk might feel in a dove-cote he would have willingly return to richmond -- even at the risk of re-enter the prison -- if kate have not be on he hand the life of the place the constant necessity of mask he aversion to the sprague he detestation of dick the simple merry-making and intimate amenity of such close quarter task he small art of dissimulation beyond even the most practiced power the garment of duplicity be gossamer he feel after all in such atmosphere of loyalty and trust as surround he at rosedale he know that in the daily attrition and conventional intimacy of the table the drawing-room or the promenade the cloak cover he resentful antipathy he moral perversity he thinly veil impatience be worn to such thin shred that eye keen as jack 's must see and know he as he be what be hatefulest and most unendurable of all be the bondage of truce in which the atterbury hold he wesley be no coward and he ache to meet jack face to face arm to arm and settle with that thoughtless insubordinate a rankle list of grief heap up in moment of over-vivacious frankness he would make jack smart for he arrogance he insolence he cursed condescension so soon as they be back among the caribee but meanwhile here daily tortured by harmless thing -- tortured by he soul 's imagining -- wesley be become a burden to kate who see too plainly that he be in misery and realize that it be largely through he own inherent weakness and insincerity he have all the coarse fiber of he father without the same force in its texture with merely superficial good manners he be never certain whether the punctilious nicety observe toward he by the sprague and atterbury be not a species of study satire vincent who have never show he the slightest consideration in acredale treat he here with the chivalrous decorum that the code of the south demand in those day to a guest wesley ground he tooth under the burden not quite sure whether it be mockery or malevolence he watch with malignant attentiveness the imperceptible change of tone and manner that mark the family 's treatment of the sprague there be none of the grave ceremoniousness he resent in the atterbury ' behavior with they jack be a hobbledehoy son of the house almost as much as vincent kate too be he feel certain treat with a reserve not show to mr sprague or merry brooding on this brooding on the unhappiness of he own disposition which deny he the privilege of enjoy the best at the moment indifferent to what might be behind wesley have come to hate the atterbury for the burden of a obligation that he could never lift he hate mr atterbury for she high-bred easy ignore of all condition save those that she exact he hate rosa for she gayety she absorption in the young scamp dick he hate vincent because he seem to think there be no one in the north but the sprague worthy of a moment 's consideration it be in hate as in love -- what we seek we find every innocent word and sign that pass in the group in which he do not seek to make himself one wesley construe as a gird at he or he family constantly on the watch for slight or disparagement the most thoughtless act of the two group be take by the tormented egotist as in some sense a disparagement to he own good repute or he family standing nor be the marked affection and confidence show kate by everybody in the house a mitigation of this malign fabric of humiliation jack 's fondness for kate have not escape the observant eye of dick who have confide the secret to rosa who have likewise unravel it to mamma and as she keep nothing from vincent the atterbury have that sort of interest in kate that intimate spectator always show in love affair where there be no clashing interest involve it be a moot question however between the three when after week of observation mr atterbury declare that jack be not in love with miss boone he can not be she declare he do not seek she alone he do not make up to she in the evening half the time when they come together it be by dick 's arrangement _ he _ seem to be in love with kate how absurd rosa cry with a laugh a boy like he why he would be in school if there be no war well rosa i fancy that dick have not find war very much different from school so far he seem to recite a good deal to the mistress and occupy the dunce 's block quite regularly vincent retort with a provoke significance that set mamma in a brown study and suspend the comment on kate 's and jack 's probable sentiment mr sprague and wesley be the only people in the house who have no suspicion of a deeper feeling than mere pass goodfellowship between jack and kate both be blind by the same confidence the mother could never conceive a son of the house of sprague make such a breach on the family tradition as a union with a boone wesley could not conceive a sister of he give she heart to the son of a family that have insolently refuse to concede social equality to she father something of wesley 's miserable inner unrest could not fail to be visible to the atterbury but the less congenial he become the more watchfully considerate they make they treatment of he he be they guest with all the sacred rights and immunity that quality imply in the exaggerated code of the southern host kate be the single power that wesley have bent he headstrong will before ever since he be a boy he father he obey while in he presence trust to wheedle to make he peace in the event of disobedience but kate he could not wheedle she be relentless in she scorn for he meanness and folly and though he do not always heed she counsel he prove they justness by find he own course wrong kate however hesitate about remonstrate with he on he deepen moodiness for she be not quite sure whether it be mad jealousy of dick 's favor in rosa 's eye or a secret purpose to attempt to fly from the gentle bondage of rosedale wesley with rosa it be remark by kate be or seem to be he better self or rather better than the self with which other identify he it be however she fear more to torment dick than because she find wesley to she liking that the little maid often carry the moody captain off into the garden pretend to teach he the varied flora of that bloom domain dick remark these excursion with grow impatience and visit he anger upon rosa in protest so pungent and woe-begone that she be force to own to he that she only pretend a interest in the captain so that he might not think he be shut out of the confidence of the circle and who care if he do think he be shut out i should like to know he be a sneak and i do not like to have you talk with he alone dick cry quite in the tone of the benedict who have pass the marriage-portal and feel safe to make he will know i should like to know what right you have to order what i shall or shall not do rosa protest half angry half laugh why you talk like a grown man -- like a husband how dare you dick pause confused and look guiltily about at this ah if you put it that way i have no right except this : my whole heart be yours you know that you may not have give I all yours -lrb- protest shrug from rosa 's shoulder -rrb- well all the same if my heart be all you own you have a duty in the case you ought to spare you own property from pain -lrb- rosa laugh softly -rrb- of course you be right you be always right how could such a beautiful be be wrong the artful rogue slip he arm about she waist at this and after a feeble struggle he be permit to hold this outwork unprotested and rosa if i speak like a man it be because i be a man be not it the part of maid in the old time to inspire the arm of they sweetheart to make they constant in danger brave in battle and patient in defeat be you less than any of the damsel we read of in chivalry be i not a man when i look in you dear eye and see nothing worldlier than love nothing earthlier than truth there what a blarney you be i must really get vint to send you away or he will have a yankee brother-in-law and the perley will have a rebel at the head of the house now this silly prattle have be carry on in the arbor near the library and wesley sit under the curtain have hear every word of it neither the word

the party to williamsburg and though distraught in the conversation be keenly alert to all he see rally upon he reticence he have snub kate and turn disdainfully from jack 's polite proffer to guide he through the review he have study davis all through the maneuver with a furtive fascinate attention which mr atterbury remark with complacency attribute it to awe at the dinner-table seat between kate and merry he have never take he eye from the chief of the confederacy twice the president courteously address he he have blush guiltily and drop he gaze before the dinner be half over he plead a severe headache and bidding he hostess good-night hurry from the room the wide hall be desert the moon throw broad swath of light on the cool matting and he halt for a instant breathing rapidly something lie on the rug at the door move languidly wesley look carefully about move swiftly to the spot and stop pizarro raise he head whine amicably and as wesley bent over to pat he wag he tail with a spasmodic thud against the floor in sign of goodfellowship come pizarro come with I wesley say coaxingly but the dog redouble the tattoo with he tail remain obstinately at he post wesley steal to the end of the hall and listen then hear the busy clamor of the servant move from the kitchen to the dining-room he retrace he step to the stair bound lightly up and in three minute reappear and keep he eye on the half-closed door slip softly to pizarro the dog sniff excitedly and as wesley take a thick parcel from he coat-pocket the beast leap up and attempt to seize it follow I pizarro and

if construe the by-play into a challenge and frisking in all sort of fantastic shape to win the savory prize the door of wesley 's room be open and as the dog come abreast of it he fling a piece into the apartment pizarro lower he sniff nose look at the tempting bit sidewise and then wag he tail in modest deprecation of he boldness make a start inward it be swallow in a instant and then as wesley enter the door be close pizarro by the humility of he manner the lowered head and sidelong glance ask pardon for intrude upon the privacy of a guest but argue with he ear and by short yelp in extenuation that such a feast as a bit of meat -- after a active day when the servant have forget to feed he -- no dog with a healthy appetite could resist no matter how perfect he breeding he be ready for the larger ration wesley hold in he hand wesley hold the temptation in he hand until he have lure the dog into a large closet communicate with the bedroom by a lock door once in the door be

further favor of be permit to go to he post he wag tail explain how necessary it be that a dog intrust with such important duty as the guardianship of the household can not suffer the casual claim of friendlessness or the comity of surreptitious feeding to lure he into infidelity the tail prove ineffectual in argument pizarro supplement its eloquence by sharp admonitory yelp temper by a sharp _ crescendo _ whining of which he seem rather proud as a accomplishment damn the brute he will ruin everything i must kill he but how he have no weapon he look about the room in gasp terror -- the dog accept the move as a sign that the eloquence of the tail argument have prove overpower supplement this by a explosion of ecstatic yelp of a deep bass volume that murder the deep silence of the night

appearance of jack and dick in the crisis of the plot come about in this way : dick on return from jack 's room have remark with quicken suspicion a gleam of light under wesley 's door perhaps he be ill the boy think compunctiously if he be he -lrb- dick -rrb- ought to offer he service he start to carry this kind think into effect when he hear suspicious sound in the room some one be move he wait

interfere with a mere escape on wesley 's part unless it seem to involve depredation upon the atterbury then he hear the faint sound of the scuffle when wesley throttle the compromise mastiff should

southern people be deeply agitate by butler 's attempt to arouse the negro we have be weaken rob by the abduction of hundred right here on the peninsula the gang that moore come here with be lead by this scoundrel jone who be butler 's agent a very vigorous example must be make of these wretch or the country-side will be desert and the government will be without produce we must inspire confidence in the owner of plantation or the soldier in the army will have to come back to guard they home jack see the futility of further plead the officer be unquestionably right such scene as rosedale have witness would end in the desertion of the rural region of the confederacy at mr atterbury 's urgent intercession kate be permit to leave the line with she dead she be conduct to the rebel outpost in the atterbury carriage and under a flag of truce enter the union line near hampton olympium accompany she in the carriage jack ride with the escort kate refuse every suggestion to see jack refuse he own prayerful message and sternly solemnly with she dead pass from the scene of she sorrow youth and something else stronger than medicine more tenacious than any other motive that keep the life-current brisk and vigorous make dick 's recovery swift and sure rosa have no torment for he now the blood-red rise have prove a magician 's amulet to confirm she mind in the sweet teaching of she heart but the patrician mother be with difficulty bring to listen to the tie of this love-knot she have look forward to a grand alliance for the heiress of rosedale -- a alliance that should bring the family high up in the dominant hierarchy of the south she listen silently to the young girl 's plead prattle of the boy 's bravery he wit he manliness she do not say no but she hope to find a way to distract she daughter from a _ mésalliance _ which would not only diminish she child 's rank but compromise the family politically such a sacrifice could not be fortunately both be mere child and the knot would unravel itself without perplexity that maturer love would have involve so the mother smile on the happy girl kiss dick tenderly morning and night for he have be a hero in they defense and she be too kindly of heart too loyal to obligation to permit dick 's attitude of suitor to lessen she fondness and admiration for the bright handsome lad olympium be the confidante of both the lover listen with she usual good-humor to the boy 's rapture and the girl 's panegyric and soon come to share jack 's high place in the happy lover ' devotion chapter xxii a carpet-knight jack meanwhile

kate fasten upon he he must fly or he must die in this abhor guilt-haunted atmosphere olympium see this mr atterbury see it and the first week in November rosedale be turn over to the military and the household re-establish in the stately house in the official quarter of richmond where the bustle and movement of new condition give jack 's mind another direction or rather take it from the bitter brooding that threaten madness when the sun accept the wind 's challenge to contest for the traveler 's cloak i dare say all the spectator of the novel highway robbery -- the moon the star the tree bird and beast and other that the fable do not mention -- take odds that the wind would snatch off the wayfarer 's garment in triumph however the wind whip and thrash the poor man in vain the stronger it blow and the more it wallop the cloak 's fold the tighter and more determinedly the traveler hold on to it as he plod wearily over the hillside but when the sun come caressingly inspiring gentle

wayside and the sun come off victor youth be despoil of the garment of grief in this sort congenial warmth the sunshine of friendliness soon relax the mantle of woe and the path that look wintry and hard become a way of light and gayety it be by mingle -- at first perfunctorily -- in the gayety of the confederate capital that jack lose the melancholy in which the tragedy at rosedale have clothe he spirit at worst the calamity be over he have be a guiltless vengeance in the punishment of wesley 's treason so he take bond in hope of better thing to come with a stout heart strong limb a plowman 's appetite and a natural bent to joyousness a youth of twenty-two or three be not apt to mistake he memory for he hope and hang the horizon in black when the sun be shine in he eye richmond always the center of a fascinating society be at that time exuberant in she young metropolitan glory it be the gayest capital in the western hemisphere to resist its seduction would have task the self-denial of a more constant anchorite than we dash jack ever aspire to be in the lowest stage of he martial vicissitude there be nothing of the garishness of the parvenu in the capital 's display the patrician

cultivate taste among its woman richmond in 1861 be the ideal of a political military and social rendezvous of a young nation the raw legion have be victorious in the first pitched battle of the war on the plain of manassa and what might not be reasonably hope from they under the training of such muster-mind as johnston beauregard jackson and lee be not it the common talk among diplomat the concurrent opinion of the french and english press the despairing admission of the half-hearted and panic-stricken north that one more such decisive victory would bring the south peace and independence be not it indeed well know among the favored junta that those sagacious diplomat senator mason and slidell have delay they journey to europe in order to aid the president in the treaty of peace that the victorious legion of johnston be to exact in washington jack be amaze and dishearten at what he see and hear the activity resource gayety and confidence of the authority and people recall to he mind oxford the jocund capital of charle ii and the royalist while the commonwealth leader be drill they army but instead of the chaos of rapine the wanton excess the pillage of church and college that mark the tenure of the miserable charle richmond be as orderly serene the congress as deliberate and the people as content as the rome of the conquest of persium or france after jemmape the army be hot for battle and as confident of the result as the guard at austerlitz or mcclellan at malvern the work do and the way of its do show that the populace as well as the ruler be convince of the destiny of the city to be henceforth mistress of herself the preordained metropolis of half the continent -- perhaps the whole continent -- for would the north be able to resist join state with a destiny so glorious -- a regal republic where birth and rank be tacitly enthrone the city 's greatness be take by the mass as a matter of course -- like a heir in chancery who have win all but the final decree in the suit or like a great nobleman who have come to he inheritance though it be the first week of November when the atterbury find home affair go on smoothly in the town-house summer still dispute with winter the short lovely day of fall as jack describe the linger may-day mildness of this seductive southern autumn it be the first season he have ever spend south of new york and like most american he realize with wonder that the wind which bring ice and snow to new york visit lower virginium with only a sharp evening and morning reminder that summer be go the balm and beauty of the climate come with something of healing to the hurt he heart and hope have suffer at rosedale if anything could have mitigate the pang of a young warrior perplex in love and hold in leash in war it be such a existence as the atterbury inveigle he into lead the part of carpet-knight be not difficult to learn and the awkwardness of it be to some extent atone for when the service be constrain at least jack take this philosophical view of it and soon give himself up to the merry social life of he surroundings with a animation that lead he host to hope that he might be win over to the confederate cause very young man do not sorrow long or deeply and jack be young he be neither reckless nor trifling but i be sure that none of the adulating group that make much of the handsome yankee in richmond that season would have suspect that the young man look in he mirror night and morning frown darkly at the reflect image he see there and say solemnly you be a murderer it be by no mean a tragic accent in which this thrilling apostrophe be speak it be very much in the tone that a woman employ when she look hastily in the mirror and utter a soft what a fright i be apparently receive comforting contradiction enough from the mirror to make the remark worth frequent repetition as a matter of fact however jack be not insensible to the awkward complication of he predicament grief as a mantle be difficult to adjust to the shoulder of the young it be melt by the ardor of companionship as swiftly as it be spin by the loom of adversity he interest in the strange scene that the war bring to pass he association with people -- intimate in a sense with the lead force of rebellion the air of incipient grandeur these raw instrument of government give themselves -- all these thing engross the observant faculty of the young man who look out upon the serio-comic harlequinade play about he as a hostage of the roundhead might have take part in the showy festivity of the cavalier in the year when the chance of battle have not go over wholly to the puritan not that the figure illustrate the contrasting condition adequately for if the south prided itself at all -- and the south do pride itself vauntingly clamorously and incessantly -- it make its chief boast the point that its people be the gentry of the land and that under the rebel banner the host of chivalry have assemble anew to make all manner of fine thing the rule of life jack write and talk of he few month ' experience dwelt with wonder upon the curious ignorance of the two people respect each other mason and dixon 's line separate two civilization as markedly unlike as the people that confront each other on either side the vistulum or the baltic sea the hierarchy not only seem to love war for war 's sake they possess that feudal facalty so incomprehensible in the middle age the power of make those who suffer most by it believe in it too and sacrifice themselves for it the people -- jack sagaciously remark in discuss the topic with olympium -- seem make for such a climate rather than make by it they would have be out of place in the bleak autumn blast and wan colorless season of acredale where the sun bleary and dim furtively skirt the low horizon from November until April as if ashamed to be identify with the glorious courser that ride the radiant summer sky here the sun come up of a morning -- a little tardy ` tis true but quite in the manner of the people -- warm and engaging and when he go down in the afternoon he cover the western sky with a roseate mantle that fairly keep out the chill of the northern night no wonder jack say to he sister watch this daily spectacle -- no wonder these people be warm impulsive and even energetic here be a italian climate without the enervating languor of that sensuous sunshine the atterbury house be the gayest in richmond mr atterbury though the mother of a son in the army and a daughter with a coterie of she own in society insist on maintain the leadership she have long hold among the social force of the capital all richmond and that mean a good deal in a city whose woman have be adore for beauty and wit on two continent receive mr atterbury 's bidding to she drawing-room with proud alacrity never have she tea she _ musicale _ she reception and _ fêtes _ be merrier or more convivial than during this memorable autumn that jack and olympium pass as prisoner of war it be generally believe that the brother and sister be occult agent of the federal power negotiate with the davi cabinet and jack 's whimsical sobriety of speech and manner contrast with he former high animal spirit carry out the notion of he be a secret ambassador it be at a reception give to the cabinet by mr atterbury that the rumor of this accredited function come to jack 's ear all richmond be among the guest olympium in spite of she abhorrence of the cause could not resist a glow of sympathetic admiration of the woman who in dress in speech in tact in all the artifice which make feminine diplomacy so potent a agency in statecraft bent every faculty to inspire confidence in the new administration mr davi herself be not the least of the factor that make the president 's policy the creed of the land there be no elaboration of costume -- no obtrusive jewel the most richly dress dame in the company be a madame gannat the deity of the most charming drawing-room at the capital at she house society be always sure to meet the european nobleman travel in the country the _ quasus _ official agent of france england and austrium accredit to the new confederacy the general of the southern army on leave in the city and the political leader able to snatch a evening 's relaxation for some reason this potential personage let olympium and jack see that she be deeply interested in they she take the young man 's arm late in the evening and whisper find a place where we can have a little talk accompany he to a small apartment join a conservatory where mr atterbury transact business with she agent you must take down a book so that in case the curious remark we we _ tête-à-tête _ may not be regard as conspiracy no one would be apt to associate you with such a thing jack say vaguely i do not know like all conspiracy this confederate comedy be suspicious comedy mr gannat why i never see people so earnest i can not imagine the surroundings of cromwell more methodic ah yes those who have all to lose by the crash when it come be bend every energy to impress the north that we be all of one mind down here we be not i be talk frankly with you because my friend mr lanview have make I fully acquaint with you circumstance i have ask you for a talk here because i dare not have you at my house no one suspect my loyalty to this davi masquerade but there be many of we who be do and shall do all the better work for the union cause you be just the man need for a great work here you be believe to be secretly in favor of the confederate cause -- a ambassador in short now the special purpose of this talk be this : the man catch at rosedale three week ago be to be try before a military court if you and this young man perley could escape before the event it would be impossible to convict they mrs lanview tell I that you be very closely ally to the younger prisoner moore and that for he sake you will do all in you power to avoid testify i will cut out my tongue before a syllable from I shall bring danger to that noble fellow exactly i expect as much now can you not manage to inspire perley with the same sentiment if you can we feel confident that the court will be unable to secure evidence sufficient to convict i leave the detail to you own ingenuity you absence would deprive the judge-advocate of the vital witness but you refusal to testify would only bring you into danger and prolong the proceedings and with time we hope to effect a escape sh as i say mr sprague the heart of the south beat with one impulse the triumph of the noblest inspiration of a great people the warning and sudden change in topic be cause by the apparition of a dame who come rustling in a vision of youthful charm and vivaciousness mr didier rodney -- mr sprague mr gannat say cordially you be send by inspiration for i be do my poor best to convince this obdurate yankee to turn from evil course and do a duty by the country that will in future make he name illustrious and i have no doubt you have shake he obstinacy if there be any left mr rodney murmur study jack attentively i have just be dine at the executive mansion and mr davi hear you name lament that woman be not eligible to office if they be he declare that mistress gannat should be appoint ambassadress to france and that within ten day of she reception at the tuilery there would be a treaty of alliance sign between france and the confederacy i take that as rather a admission of weakness on you president 's part jack say as the lady glance inquiringly at he since it be a poor cause that require the strongest advocate ah a southern man would never have say a thing so uncivil as that mr rodney cry reproachfully you pay mr gannat a compliment at the cost of the confederacy and mr davi pay I a compliment at the expense of the truth so the account be square the elder lady say serenely well mr davi be here himself by this time and you shall talk it out with he mr rodney retort as a rustle at the door announce new-comer a half-dozen lady come troop in among they mr davi and several of the cabinet lady we hear you be here madame gannat the president 's wife murmur graciously and since you would not come to we we have come to you mr gannat arise to receive the great lady and when she have exchange salutation with the rest she present jack ah the hero of the rosedale affair and as mr davis say this she look keenly at the young man she be he own a extremely graceful woman of a mature beauty admirable manner and as she talk he remark keen intelligence with a occasional evidence of read if not high education she be dress in simpler taste than she court as it be the fashion then to style the cabinet group a few jewel be half hide in the rare lace that cover she bodice but she be ungloved and in no sense in the full-dress understand in the north at a gathering of the sort the talk become general jack not know the personage simply listen there be animated discussion as to whether mistress judge this and mistress general that or mistress senator the other would be in the capital in time for the opening of the new congress in December mr davi be very anxious to have the occasion make a grand one and i reckon that every one of account in the confederacy will he here mr davis say with conviction the scene will be worthy of a great painting like the long parliament or the meeting of the three estate at versaille mr rodney add in a glow of anticipation this amusing pedantry rather tax the historical knowledge of most of the lady and to divert the talk mr monteith a cabinet lady say : who have read the account in the yankee papers of lincoln and he wife at a reception of the diplomatic corps it be too funny the lincoln woman be a southerner she have some good blood and ought to know better she be dress like a dowdy and when the minister bow she give they she hand and say ` how d'ye do ' it will really be a liberal education to the north to have a capital like ours near they where they public man can learn manners and where northern lady can see how to conduct themselves in public mr rodney break in laugh it be not often a great people go to war for a idea but we be take up the gage of battle to teach we inferior manners we teach they how to run at manassa mr starlow a senator 's dame remark i be afraid they have learn the lesson so well that we shall never teach they how to stand mr davi add gayly ah friend we be teach each other how to die -- let we not forget that mr gannat murmur gently and there be a sudden hush in the exchange of vivacity before the strain could he renew mr atterbury enter hastily cry : the gentleman be all distract we be go to have a old-time minuet such as my mother use to dance with justice marshall and tom mayo the president be go to lead with mistress wendolph and all the rest of you be assign by command of the executive humph a military despotism ask mr renfrew a young bride of the executive mansion whose husband be confidential adviser of the president i do not think i shall obey i shall show the honesty of my rebel blood by select my own partner unless some one ask I very humbly shall i go on my knee mr renfrew -- i know no humbler attitude jack say hastily present himself oh yes sir there be something humbler than the knee yes what pray repentance deny you name no longer be a montague -- that be a yankee give I the hand of a rebel then i shall believe you i be a rebel ah you have be convert i never be pervert you have be with we all the time i have be here a long time and you be a rebel oh i must tell mr davis he know it i think oh no he can not for it be only a few moment since that he say to mr atterbury that the son of senator sprague the friend of calhoun and the comrade of hayne should be in the rank of the young nobility uphold we sacred cause i be however a rebel -- a rebel to all these fascination i see about I a rebel to you beauty a rebel to all you desire pah you odious yankee i feel certain that you have not come to you sens i do not think i ever lose they -- though i never have enough to make such a spirit as yours lament they loss the rest of the lady have pass out and as this repartee go on jack lead he petulant companion into the large drawing-room where he instantly recognize the president with mr wendolph on he arm he tower above the mass of the dancer eye the admiring group with attentive scrutiny he be in evening dress but unlike the larger number of the eminent partisan in the room have no insignia military or otherwise to denote exalted rank as the president be to lead off to keep up the character of a court minuet the middle of the large room be leave uncrowded the music begin what jack think at first be a funeral march but with the first bar the tall slender figure of the president bent almost double while the lady seem fairly seat on the floor she bent down and back so far she have adjust a prodigious silken train which sweep and swirl in many bewildering fold as she slowly turn courtesied trip forward and retreat with such bend and twist as would turn a ballet-master mad with envy in all the movement of the overture the two dancer merely touch the tip of each other 's finger and when the solemn measure come to a close the president slide across the floor in one graceful immense pirouette hand the lady who confront he bent nearly to the ground into she seat there be a outburst of applause and then the assembly take place repeat in as far as the mass would permit the stately evolution of the leader later a virginium reel follow dance with old-time _ verve _ some of the more accomplished dancer bound over the floor in pigeon-wing such as be cut by the nimble a hundred year ago when richmond dance in honor of washington and lafayette there be no end of drinking among the man and as soon as the dancing seem at its height the matron begin to gather into group and send out signal to the younger lady the feast end in drinking-bout between dispersed body who seem to know the name of all the servant and order as liberally as if in they own house in the _ mêlée _ of separation jack feel a hand on he shoulder remember every moment be precious many life perhaps a great campaign depend upon you discretion promptitude and loyalty be ready when the signal reach you and remember you do not know I beyond the civility of a presentation and do not like I jack have hardly turn as these word be whisper in he ear and he give the kind lady 's hand a warm pressure as she move away unremarked in the throng jack confide mr gannat 's disclosure to olympium be elate by he sister 's enthusiasm and be strengthen in he conviction that he be do right by she approval but you know polly that -- i -- i too must be of the party i must fly to the union line of course you will i should be ashamed of you be you to let such a chance pass it be the only thing to do it be you duty as a soldier to be with you flag any means to get to it be justified the atterbury will feel hurt perhaps outraged but i can soon convince they that you have only do what vincent would do and whatever he would do they will soon see be right for you to do even though it may bring they into temporary disgrace with the authority of late i have begin to suspect that the atterbury be to blame for you detention what do you mean to blame surely they can not hasten the slow business of negotiation no but i be convinced that they have give out hope that you can be seduce into a soldier of secession it be common talk in the drawing-room i have visit where i be not always recognize as you sister the silly tale have anger I but for prudence sake i keep silent i have hear in a score of place that the atterbury be detain you until another reverse to the union arm should convince you of the uselessness of remain in the service of the abolitionist o polly it must be a joke they little know I who could suspect I of such dishonor surely the atterbury can not think I so base as that what have i ever do to justify such a stigma you wrong they there they hold that you be want in loyalty to we father 's memory in espouse the cause of man who be he enemy -- man who strive to ruin he political life it be in be a soldier of the union that they look upon you as recreant to the tradition of you family and you party well i shall make a hard struggle for escape if i fail they will at least see that i be in earnest -- that i put country before family or party or anything else that man hold dear heaven to think of be hold in such bondage i could stand it with more patience if i be in prison share the hard line of the fellow but to be here to be hand in glove with these boast audacious coxcomb and force to listen to they callow banter of we and we army it make I feel like a sneak and a traitor and i be glad that i see the end but do you see the end prudence be one of the wisest counselor in war you be very rash and you must take all you measure carefully it will not do to rush into a trap as you do at manassa and o jack what be to become of dick he be not in the list he have no standing here and be at the mercy of any one who choose to accuse he of be a spy by george you be right i have not think of that he must go with I i have think it better to leave he he be so happy with rosa that i fancied he would remain contentedly until the war end but he be in constant danger he be forever tantalize the people that visit the house who make slighting allusion to the northern army and very likely some rebel patriot will take the trouble to inquire about he but even if this be not a peril he would never consent to remain here if you be go i think he would give up rosa rather than be separate from you yes the impulsive little beggar i believe he would jack say he eye glisten that will compel we to take he into the secret in fact i do not see how it can be manage without he and then he testimony would convict the prisoner i have not think of that but now polly about yourself what be to become of you i have my plan lay mr myrason the wife of one of johnston 's general be go to the front next week i shall insist to-night on accompany she as some of we physician be go to be send through the line at the same time there be really no reason for my remain here now that you be well i have already broach the subject to mr atterbury and i shall inform she at once that i be decide she will not suspect anything as she know i be half-tempted to go north when mamma go the important thing for you now be to give you whole mind to the rescue and have no fear for I if you can convince dick to go with you all will be well if he prove obstinate hand he over to I jack laugh polly you should have be the first-born of the house of sprague you have twice the sense that i have it be not sense that win in war it be daring and resolution and you have all that when jack have cautiously lay the situation before he young patroclus that precocious warrior at once justified the confidence repose in he rosa have promise to marry I as soon as the war be over she can not expect I to hang around here like a peg-top on a string besides i would not stay where you be not jacko even if i lose my sweetheart for good and all there be a piteous quaver in the treble voice and forget that he be no longer a school-boy he brush he eye furtively with he coat-sleeve as jack pretend preoccupation with he shoe-string you be a brick dick i think i have confide that to you before -- but you be a brick make of the best straw in the field of life and you shall be a general one of these day -- you shrill voice shall let slip the dog of war and cry havoc to the enemy you shall return to acredale -- proud acredale -- you brow bind with victorious wreath and all the small boy perch on the spreading oak to salute you i think i have hear something like that before my blarneying plantagenet you shall be the percy of the north and command the great battle you shall meet and vanquish fifty harry and cry ` god for union liberty and the law ' bravo you know you shakespeare if you do not know prudence however we be plotter now and you must take on you wisest humor you must not breathe a word to rosa love be a freebooter in confidence it have no conscience as it have no law it be a immense friction on the sober relation of life it be cousin to the god of lie -- mercury so be warn that while you heart be rosa 's you reason 's you country 's you friend ' and you have a chance now to employ it to the profit of both you must be ready to evade rosa 's infinite question with innocent plausibility for you must bear in mind that however much she may love you she like you love she cause she people -- more in fact for you have see that these passionate southerner have make a religion of the war and like all enthusiast they will go any length deny all tie glory faith in personal sacrifice and heart-wrenching to make the south triumph so without be false to you love you must deceive to be true to you country for to lull love 's suspicion a man must regulate the two current of he life the heart and brain keep the heart in check and let the brain rule in such affair as we have on hand phew jack you talk like a college professor you be deeper than a well and what be the other thing mercutio say ah mercutio say so much that shakespeare get frightened and let tybalt kill he so beware of say too much that be you great danger dick you tongue be terrible -- mostly to you friend be it indeed i have a friend who do not think so no because she consider you tongue part of herself now i do not see why she should she have

gossip agog in the dear old village mind broaden swiftly in war that one dreadful day at bull run enlarged my faculty or train they rather as much as a course in college something very serious come into my life that day it have its effect on you too it fairly revolutionize vint we may not have exactly put away boyishness and boyish thing -- please god i hope to be a boy many a year yet -- but we have be make to think as man act as man and realize that there be consequence and responsibility in life such as we could not have realize in ten year in time of peace dick listen during this solemn comedy of immature doctrinal induction he eye dilate with wonder and admiration jack in the _ rôle _ of sage delighted he and he straightway confide to rosa that he could not understand how any girl could love another man while jack be to be have he be so clever so brave so manly he know so much and yet never take the trouble to let any one see it ah rosa i wish i be like jack i think jack 's very nice but i know somebody that be much nicer rosa reply busy with a rough material that be plainly intend for the southern warrior ah but if you really know all about jack you would not look at anybody else dick cry pensively tangle he long leg in the young girl 's work there you clumsy fellow you have ruin this seam and i must get this work do before noon we be all go to the provost prison

the shape of the atterbury keep we from of course you be we could not think of go without you there my work be do we 'll have lunch and then start rosa say rise and direct dick to fill the large wicker basket with the garment fashion and idleness make strange pastime the recreation to which jack and dick be bid be a visit to the melancholy shambles where the heterogeneous mass of unclassified prisoner be detain it be a long gabled building on the brink of the river from whose low grated window the culprit could catch glimpse of the jame tumble over its sedgy sometimes rocky bed a few yard from it arise the grim wall of what have be a tobacco-factory now the never-to-be forget libby prison it be a animated and curious group that make up jack 's party they be pilot by a young aide on the staff of general lee and as he entire mind be engross in make he court to rosa the pilgrim be give the widest latitude for investigation on the lower tier he point out the cell of the rosedale prisoner where as you may imagine jack and dick without give a sign keep they wit alert jone -- the most desperate of the conspirator against the president the special agent of butler -- be in a cell by himself constantly guard by a sentinel this sprague say the young aide lower he voice as he come abreast of jone 's cell be the man the government have the strongest proof against he be prove to have come into we line from the warwick river to have manage to escape from castle thunder and to have lead the miscreant to rosedale you own and young perley 's testimony after that will swing he higher than a spy be ever swing before these word begin in a low tone be make clearer and louder by the sudden cessation of chatter among the visit group jone who seem to have come to he grate when the suppress laughter sound in the dark corridor hear every word of the official 's speech he be no longer the bearded desperado jack have see in the _ mêlée _ at rosedale -- there be a certain distinction in the poise of the head a inborn gentility in the impassive contemplation with which he meet the furtive scrutiny of the curious visitor jack he eye with something of surprise but when dick push suddenly in front of the timorous group of young woman he start change color and avert he face then as if suddenly recall himself turn and devour the lad with a strange yearning tenderness dick meet the gaze with he habitual easy gayety and turn to jack say impulsively : i should never recognize this man as the bandit who fire the shot that night -- be you really the jone that choke and wound I at rosedale dick advance quite close to the wicked as he ask this and who may you be if i be permit to ask a question the prisoner reply vaguely all the time devour the boy with he dilate eye i be richard perley of acredale a soldier of the union and a friend of all who suffer in its cause dick murmur the last word so low that the group of visitor do not catch they and add to they a emphasis of the eye that the prisoner seem too agitate to notice he continue as jack push nearer this be certainly not the man we see at rosedale but i have see you somewhere tell I have i not i can tell you nothing -- i -- i as he say this jone back against the wall the guard spring forward in alarm the woman of course cry out in many key most of they skurry away toward the staircase water jack cry guard have you no water handy no sir the canteen be break and there be none nearer than the guard-room run and get some i will see that the prisoner do not get out run the aide have gallantly go forward in the passage to reassure the lady and jack seize the chance for which the prisoner seem to be prepared whisper : here be a auger a chisel and a knife secrete they work straight out under you window we shall be ready for you by Wednesday night do not fail to give a signal if anything happen that prevent you cut through there be only a old stone wall between you and the river you must take precaution against the water if it be high enough to reach you cut jone play he part admirably he remain limp and stolid in the support arm of jack while dick hover in the doorway keep the prying remnant of the visitor eager to witness the scene at a safe distance when the water come jack yield he place to the guard and the party move on here we have a real yankee a regular nutmeg the young aide cry as the party come to a room not far from jone 's this youngster be one of the chief devil in the attack on rosedale the judge-advocate have try every mean to coax a confession from he but without result he be as gay as a bridegroom and answer all threat with a joke ah the old barney under all jack say half sadly do you know he mr sprague like a brother he be from my town ah perhaps you can convince he that he best course be open confession no i fear not he be very headstrong and would rather have he joke on the gibbet than own himself in the wrong but mr jack if you should talk to he show he the wickedness of conspire against a peaceful family incite a servile race to murder i be sure you could move he and it would be such a comfort to have the criminal themselves expose the atrocious plot this be say by miss delmayne a niece of mr gannat jack catch she eye as she speak and instantly realize the covert meaning how stupid he have be of course barney must be apprise of the

absolve guilt this be say for the benefit of the guard who have approach as jack arise to take he leave chapter xxiii all 's fair in love and war opportunity be a instinct to the man who dare to he the law of the impossible have no meaning to he there be no such thing as the unexpected what he want come to pass because he can not see danger difficulty nor any of the obstacle that daunt the prudent and the temporize it be therefore the impossible that be fulfil in many of the crisis of life by the same token it be the foolhardy and preposterous thing that be most readily do in determinate conjuncture we guard against the possible but we take little note of the enterprise that involve foolhardiness or desperation daring have safeguard of its own that be understand only when mad venture have come to successful issue helpless and hopeless as jack 's situation seem the very poverty of he resource help the daring scheme of escape that fill he mind night and day during these apparently indolent week of pleasure in the rank of he enemy then too the arrogant self-confidence of he captor be a inestimable aid military discipline and provost vigilance be at they slackest stage in the rebel line at this triumphant epoch in the fortune of the confederacy the easily win combat at bull run have fill the authority -- as well as the rank and file -- with overween contempt for the resource of the north or the enterprise of its soldier it be not until long after the time i be now write about that the prisoner be closely guard and access refuse to the idle and curious but as a matter of fact nothing in the fortune of we friend equal the truth of the thrilling and desperate chance take by northern captive to escape the linger death of prison in the south since the war volume have be write of personal experience amply attest that would in romance receive the derisive mark of the critic danger daily meet become a commonplace to man of resolution thing which appall we when we read they become a simple part of we purpose when we live in a atmosphere of peril and put we hope only in end the ordeal the incident i be narrate be the work of many hand mr gannat have from the first give she heart to the union cause a woman of high standing in society well know throughout the state for she mind she manners and she benevolence it be not difficult for she by adroit management to aid such prisoner as fall into rebel hand during the early year of the war before richmond become a mart in the modern sense the gannat mansion set far back among the tree of a noble grove be a shrine to the tradition loving citizen for beyond any southern city save perhaps new orlean richmond folk cherish the memory of aristocratic and semi-regal ancestor there be those still live when the war begin who have hear they father and mother talk of the last royal governor and the splendid state of the great nobleman who have flock to the city of powhatan when virginium be the gem of england 's colonial coronet the patrician caste of the city still hold its own aid by the helot hand of slavery among the most reverently consider in this sanctified group mr gannat be if not first the concede equal she be the dowager of the ancient noblesse the young virginian receive in she drawing-room carry away a distinction which be recognize throughout the state the dame admit to mr gannat 's semi-literary _ leveés _ be accept as all that society demand of its votary in other year this great lady have be the admire center of the court circle in washington there she have know very intimately senator -- then congressman -- sprague jack remember vaguely the gossip of a engagement between he father and a famous southern beauty and when the lady in the course of the conspire say as they talk my son i might have be you mother he know that this gentle-voiced kindly-eyed matron be the woman he father have love and lose i do not propose to rehearse the ingenuity of the complicated plan whereby the group we be interested in be to be deliver mr gannat 's perfect knowledge of the city she intimacy with the president cabinet and lead man she vogue with the official all tend to make very simple and easy that which would seem in the tell hare-brained and impossible jack 's unique position and dick 's attitude of the half-acknowledged _ fiancé _ of a atterbury break down bar that even mr gannat 's far-reaching sagacity might not have be able to cope with in certainty the night choose for the escape be fatefully propitious the president be entertain the newly arrive french delegate and the minister mason and slidell just appoint to the court of st jame and the tuilery everybody that be anybody be of the splendid company jack however be tortured by a doubt of dick 's constancy when it come to a abrupt quit of he sweetheart poor lad he fight the battle bravely make no sign and when rosa the picture of demure loveliness in she girlish finery ask he maliciously as the carriage drive toward the executive mansion -- do not you feel like a traitor you sly yankee dick give a great groan and say : o rosa rosa i can not go i do feel like a traitor i be a traitor jack luckily be sit beside he and bring he heel down on the lad 's toe with such emphasis that he utter a cry of pain rosa be all solicitude at this what be it richard have i wound you do not mind my chatter i only do it to tease you he shall be a yankee he shall make nutmeg he shall abuse the chivalrous south he shall be what he like he sha 'n' t be tease -- and she wind she bare arm about he neck quite indifferent to the reprove nudge of mamma and the sad mirthfulness of jack dick find means in the noise of the chariot and the crush they presently come into for say something that seem to lessen the self-reproachful tone of the penitent and when they enter the modest portal of the presidency rosa be radiant and dick equable but not in he usual chatter volubility you be sure you do not repent you can stay if you choose jack say as they enter the dressing-room where you go i go what you say be right i know be right and i will do it dick look away confusedly as he say this they be surround by young officer all of whom the two young man know ah ha mr perley i have steal a march on you i have secure the first waltz from miss rosa a young man at the mirror cry as dick adjust he glove then captain warrick i be likely to be a wall-flower for the second third and fourth be promise yesterday fortune of war my dear fellow -- fortune of war you must lay siege to another fortress dick jack whisper it be a omen it will give we time to slip out and change we garment without the danger of excuse for though nothing be suspect any incautious phrase may destroy we do not fear for I i shall be prudent as a confessor we can not go however just yet i must have a little talk with rosa i may never see she again if you be in love and go from the light of she eye perhaps never to see she again you would not be so cool we must anyway take the lady to the host and hostess for presentation then a few word and i be ready dick be tremble visibly and blush like a school-girl at first face a class-day crowd jack 's heart go out to the lad and he think the chance about even that when the moment of trial come the boy 's resolution would give way the lady be wait for they when they emerge into the corridor -- rosa begin prettily to rally dick on he tardiness it take time to thread the constantly increase crowd in the hallway the corridor and on the stair but they finally reach the group in which mr davi be receive the confused salutation of the throng at the drawing-room door as soon as this formality be end rosa whisk dick in one direction while mr atterbury ask jack to take she to the library here by a happy chance she come upon a group of dowager -- friend of she youth from other town -- bring to the capital by the event or they husband ' official duty in the new government jack bow low as he relinquish the good lady 's arm feeling as if he be embark on some odious treason in view of she persistent and generous treatment of he and he now that you be among the friend of you youth i will leave you who know whether i shall see you again he falter as she turn a affectionate glance upon he oh you need not think that you can take _ congé _ for good jack i may want to dance during the night if i do i shall certainly lay my command upon you you may devote yourself to the young people now but i warn you i be not to be throw over so easily besides i want to present you to a dozen friend that you have not yet meet at my house you will always know where to find I but i be not so sure that i shall be as able as i be willing to come to you jack say tremble at the double meaning of he word oh i know you be die to get to the dancer i can go to no one that it will give I more happiness to please than you indeed i be go into danger when i quit you give I you blessing as if it be vincent go to the war she have turn from the throng of lady who be discuss a political secret and she eye melt tenderly as vincent 's name pass jack 's lip she touch he bow head gently say : why how serious you be one would think beauty a battery and you on the way to charge you be right it be a murderous ambush well if you regard it so seriously -- god bless you in it she gentle eye rest tenderly on he he seize the kind hand and raise it to he lip in the gallant southern fashion turn and hurry away among the guest ah mr atterbury conquest at you age from hand to lip there be but short interval and the president hold up a warning finger as he come closer to the lady oh no age make a long route between hand and lip -- thirty year ago you kiss my hand and you never reach the lip it be not my fault that i do not nor you misfortune either and mr atterbury glance archly at she rival mr davi the mature beauty of the scene dick meanwhile not so dexterous in expedient or ready in speech as he mentor become wedge in a eddy just outside the main stream pour drawing-room ward so that return to the spot where they have separate jack do not for the moment discover he rosa 's gayety and delight deepen the depression that make dick so unlike himself at first in the exuberance of the scene the girl do not heed this she know everybody and though in daily contact with most of they there be no end of whisper confidence to exchange and tender reassurance in ratification of some new compact then there be solemn note of comparison as to the fit and form of gown or the fit of a furbelow exhaustively discuss perhaps that very afternoon keen eye merry and tantalizing be lift to dick 's sulky face during this pretty by-play but all the gayety of the comedy be lose to he when he could contain himself no longer with another bevy of crony in sight come down the stair he cry out desperately : for heaven 's sake rosa do not wait here like the statue in st peter 's to be kiss by everybody on the way to the pope it be simply sicken to stand here like a shrine to be slop by girl that you see every day come away i want to say something to you rosa turn she astonished eye upon the railer and with a comic movement of immense dignity draw she arm from he shelter elbow and in tone of freezing _ hauteur _ retort : and since when sir be you master of my conduct i be my own mistress i believe i shall kiss whom i please o rosa rosa i do not mean that i do not know what i mean i -- o rosa do not be fretful with I now i can not bear it i be ill -- i mean i be tired come and sit with I several on the outer edge of the flow current turn curiously as this sharp cry of boyish plead rise above the noisy clamor it be impossible however to push backward but in a instant the lover be sheltered in a alcove near the doorway rosa have take he reject arm again in a panic of guilty repentance and look at he half-suffused eye cry piteously : oh forgive I richard forgive I -- i do not mean it i forget you be ill ah please please forgive I you know -- i -- i -- but dick now conscious that inquire eye be fasten upon they curious ear listen seize she arm and by main force reach the hall doorway now nearly desert rosa i be not well -- that be i have a headache or heartache -- it be the same thing i do not mean to tell you for i do not want to destroy you pleasure and you have look forward so long to this but i -- i -- can not dance jack and i be go to walk a little while and then we -- we shall be more ourselves poor dick have only the slightest idea what he be say and rosa listen with wide-open eye and little appealing caress not quite certain what the distract lover do mean all you dance be take up young warrick just tell I he have the first you give gayo brotherton two yesterday so you will have no need of I for hour yet but i will cut they if you say so only you know that it be we way here to give the first who ask yes yes that be right i -- i could not dance now i shall be all right presently if -- if i see you happy ah rosa if -- if i should die -- if i should be carry away would you always love I would you always believe in I why dick you be really ill let I feel you wrist rosa seize dick 's hand and begin a convulsive squeeze yes you certainly have a fever you must go home i shall go with you it be you wound it have break out again -- i know it have you shall go home this instant i will send for the carriage come straight up-stairs you wicked boy to let I come here when you be so ill i shall never forgive myself -- never a large vow for a small maid mr jack -- for the voice be jack 's -- dick be very ill and he must go home at once will you not get the carriage and take we i will not take you i be very experience in dick 's ailment and i have already summon a physician who be wait for we but he can not attend he patient if you be present yes rosa jack be right i will leave you now and when you see I again you will see that i be not ill -- that i -- i -- i will stop for you at the door dick you know the physician can not be keep wait so make you parting brief short shrift be the easiest in love and war a doctor be as dreadful to I as a battle rosa kiss I as if i be go to the field dick whisper as jack 's back be turn a minute later he have join he mentor and the two hurry through the square and down toward the river i can not do it jack dick suddenly break out as they hurry through the dark street i must leave rosa a line tell she my motive what will she think of I sneak away like this without a word now you go on to blake 's cabin and change you clothes i will get a old suit of vint 's it will really make no difference in the time and it will be safer for we to reach the prison separately than together no dick be a man every line you write will add to we peril she will of course show it to she mother we night will be know in the morning mr atterbury be too loyal to the confederacy to conceal anything you will thus give the authority the very clew they need no dick you must be guide by I in this besides you can send rosa letter through vincent at headquarters as soon as we reach washington i can not help it i know you be right but i must do it i will be with you in less than a hour i be off listen -- good god he be go jack ejaculate as dick take advantage of a cross-street shot off into the darkness jack halt to call would be dangerous to run after he excite comment perhaps pursuit and discovery there be nothing to be do but wait at the rendezvous he would come back -- jack try to make himself believe that he could depend on that when after a circuitous walk of half a hour he reach the cabin of blake the color agent of mr gannat he find a note from he patroness warn he that the prison authority have become alert a rumor of a plot to escape have penetrate the war department and order have be give to increase the precaution of the guard the reception at the president 's be a stroke of good fortune for the prisoner as all the higher official would be detain there until morning perhaps in view of the chance it would be better to anticipate the hour of flight as unfortunately the horse that have be get together for the fugitive be in use for the davi guest and on such short notice other could not be provide without exciting suspicion or point to the agency by which the liberation have be bring about ah if dick be only here jack groan we could go to the square and lead away enough staff or orderly horse to serve the purpose the little wretch it would serve he properly to leave he here moon over he sweetheart then he heart take up a little tremor of protest he sigh gently he too have loiter when he heart plead why should dick be firmer than he it be after midnight when he reach the shelter broken ground along the river the provost prison front the water it have be a tobacco warehouse build long before and hastily transform into its present military purpose it be set in what be call a cut in the heavy clay bank thus bring the lower window below the level of the surrounding land there be sentry station in front and rear who walk at regular interval from corner to corner the sentinel on the high level to the rear could not see the ground along the wall and it be this fact which jack calculate upon to enable he to help the prisoner to remove the _ débris _ of the wall through which they be to presently emerge the night be pitchy dark this have be take into consideration long before heavy cloud hang over the river throw the prison and its environs into still more security for jack 's purpose he reconnoitr every available point search every corner of possible danger and as the time pass he begin to rage with impatience against dick whose delay be now perile the success of the enterprise it be twelve o'clock and after he dare wait no longer dick must shift for himself perhaps he have lose he way in any event it be safer to set the general prisoner free as they be only carelessly guard lamp glimmer fitfully in the guard-room throw fantastic banner of light almost to the water 's edge he make a final tour about the broken ground but there be no sound or suspicion of dick he know every inch of the ground dick and he have survey and resurvey it for day the coast be clear no one be on guard at the vital point but still he linger he breath come and go painfully as a break in the cloud cast a move shape over the undulating ground should he give the boy another half-hour 's grace he make a circuit in the direction dick must approach by and wait he will count a hundred very slowly then wait no longer he count up to fifty hear a coming step and wait alertly no -- it pass on he begin again -- count one hundred two hundred no sign pah it be madness to delay for he the young poltroon have lose he resolution in he lovesick fever very likely he have be unable to run the risk of rosa 's anger -- she mother 's indignation -- the possibility of never see the girl again well he have give he ample grace he have endanger he own and other life to humor a boyish whim now he must act and swiftly the plan be too far go in execution to be change he must carry out the final measure alone now one of these detail require some one to slip down on the ground and crawl to the point between the window where the prisoner be work and aid they to remove the thin shell of brick if it fall outward the guard at the corner would hear the noise and might come down to see what it be that make it the removal of this wall release all confine in the main prison these he see steal out in group of ten or more they have guide wait on the bank of the river jack give they final order the most difficult work be the get out jone and barney for they have special cell jack be to guard jone 's exit and dick barney 's but now all the work would devolve upon he it be two o'clock and he dare wait no longer raise himself from the low wall where he have be crouch he start toward the corner of the prison farthest from the guard-room at the wall of the building he drop flat on he face and begin to crawl forward sheltered by the low ground that form a sort of dry ditch about the basement of the prison he have barely stretch himself at full length when a bright light be flash on he from a deep doorway just beyond he and a voice mocking and triumphant exclaimed this be a bad place to swim my friend there be not enough water to drown you but if you stir you 'll run against a bullet jack lay quite still and raise he eye above he stand a trooper with a revolver level at and within ten foot of he figure to yourself any predicament in life in which vital stake hang on the issue figure to yourself the shipwrecked seize ice where he have hope for timber the condemn criminal walk into the jailer 's toil where he have laboriously dig through solid wall the captain of a army leave the field victor to find he legion rush upon he in rout figure any monstrous overturn in well-laid scheme and you have but a faint reflex of poor jack 's heart-breaking anguish when this jocular fate stand above he with the five gaping barrel point at he miserable head oh if dick have only be there he quick eye and keen activity would have discover this lurk devil perhaps between they they would have avert the disaster where could dick be book iii _ the deserter _ chapter xxiv between the line on quit jack dick have but one thought in mind -- to make he departure less abrupt for rosa if he leave she without a word what would she think then with a officer 's uniform he could be of much more help to jack and the party than in the rough civilian homespun furnish at the cabin besides he know of certain blank headquarter pass lie on vincent 's desk he would get a few of these they might extricate the party in the event of a surprise he tear over the solemn roadway under the spectral foliage and in twenty minute he be in he room in the atterbury ' vincent 's old uniform he have often notice in a spare closet adjoining he own sleeping-room in a instant he be in it and though it be not a fit he soon put it in order to pass casual inspection the line for rosa be the next delay what should he say he have have he mind full for day of the most tender sentiment and prettily turn phrase but the turmoil of the last hour the vital value of every moment to jack 's plan leave he no time to compose the poem he have meditate so long rosa 's own pretty desk be open and on a sheet of she own paper he write in a scrawl school-boy hand : darling rosa : you have often say that you would disown vincent if he be not true to the south think of vincent in my place -- dawdle in acredale or washington while battle be go on you would not hold he less contemptible that he be in love that he let he love or he life for you be both to I stand as a barrier to he duty you can not love where you can not honor and you can not hate where you know conscience rule i go to my duty that in the end i may come to you without shame i ask no pledge other than come to you heart when you read this but whatever you may say whatever you may decide i be now and always shall be you devoted richard he sigh cast a woe-begone glance into the mirror dimly conscious that he be a very heroic young person he kiss various object dear to the little maid and then in lugubrious unrest sally out and mount again under the calm sky -- again the fleet limb of the horse almost keep time to he own inward impatience he hold to the soft unpaved outlying street that he pace may not attract remark he pass horseman like himself spur fleetly in the darkness he be near the river at last -- dismount and reconnoitre he easily find a place to tie the horse and familiar with every inch of the outlying ground about the prison crawl close to the wall listen intently he can hear no sound save the weary clank of the sentry on the wooden walk he reach the wall where the prisoner jone and barney be to emerge there be no sign of a break where can jack be some disaster must have overtake he for it be past the hour set and soon it will be dawn and then all action will be impossible perhaps jack have be catch reconnoitr perhaps he have go with the main body not venture to try for jone and dick without help no that be not like jack this be he special part in the plan -- if it be not do jack be still about he can find out readily -- thanks to the countersign he steal back over the low hillock mount the horse and by a _ détour _ reach the sentry guard the river front of the prison he be challenge but possess of the countersign find no difficulty in ride up to the guard-room doorway have lieutenant hawkin be here within a hour sentry he ask in apparent haste no sir i think he have be send for -- leastwise the sergeant go away about a hour ago to report the taking of a deserter find prowl about the side of the prison a deserter yes sir he have a brand-new uniform on and no company mark nor no equipment what have be do with he dick ask breathlessly dismount i wonder if he be not one of my company from fort lee he go off on a drunk yesterday though he be send here on a commissary errand i dunno sir he be in the lockup there he be very violent and the sergeant bind he with strap i will go in and examine he he may be one of my man and as we brigade move in the morning i should like to know very well sir the officer of the day be asleep in the room beyond the first door one of the man will call he oh no need to disturb he until i have see the prisoner -- here my man -- address a soldier asleep on a settee -- show I to the deserter bring in to-night yes sir the man cry start up with confused alacrity then notice the insignia of major on dick 's gray collar he salute respectfully and point to a double doorway wait for he superior to lead the way dick who have be in the prison before know he whereabouts very well and it be not until the soldier reach the room in which the deserter be detain that he seem to remember that there be no light here be the man 's quarter sir but i be out of match if you 'll wait a minute i 'll bring a candle all right dick respond in a loud voice i 'll stand here until you come back the quest of the candle would take the guide to the closet in the guard-room and risk little to learn much dick strike a match and peer into the stuffy little room more like a corn-crib than a prison-cell hist jack be it you he call there be a exclamation from the farther end of the room and then a fervent -- heaven dick be it really you sh -- sh -- the soldier 's return footfall sound in the passage-way but as he re-enter the hall where dick stand shade the flicker light he could not see the hastily extinguish match in dick 's hand as the man come slowly along the wind passage-way dick whisper : you be a recruit in rickett 's legion you be drunk and lose you way and i be you major you be station at fort lee near mechanicsville and you belong to company g jack pretend to be sound asleep when the soldier and dick enter he rub he eye sleepily and look up in a vacant tipsy way leering knowingly at the soldier who have catch he by the shoulder what be you do here tarpey why be not you with you company you 'll get ball and chain for this lark or my name 's not jame braine but major it -- it be not my fault my cousin joe tarpey come down from staunton with a barrel of so ` gum whisky and -- and -- you drink too much and be catch where you have no business to be however dick add sternly the regiment march in the morning -- you must get out of here soldier show I to captain payne 's quarter say to he that major braine of rickett 's legion desire to speak with he a moment but he have no sooner say this than he realize the danger he be run the captain might know braine and then how could he extricate himself from the dilemma luckily the captain be not in he quarter and dick with calm effrontery sit down and write out a statement of the case where he be to be find and he reason for carry the prisoner away the sergeant have read this make no objection to release the alleged deserter since there have be no order concern he and without more ado jack walk away with he captain the picture of abashed valor and repentant tipsiness now dick there be no time to ask the meaning of you miraculous doings we have still time to let we friend out and get away before daylight but we must not lose a second sh stand still what be that trooper good heaven they can not have find out you trick so soon ah no they be flounder about look for quarter he add in immeasurable relief as the voice of the rider sound through the darkness cursing luck the road and everything else o dick if we only have the countersign i could play a brilliant trick on these greenhorn perhaps i can as it be i have the countersign how do you suppose i could have manage to get to you if i have not it be ` lafayette ' glory now make all the clatter you can after i challenge they have by this time reach a row of tumble-down stable directly in the rear of the prison and shut out from the open ground by a decrepit fence break here and there by negro too lazy to pass out into the street to reach the river the horseman have turn into this lane-like highway -- evidently misdirect when within a few foot jack give a sudden whack on the board and cry sternly : halt who come there there be a sudden clash of steel as the group halt in a heap and then a weary voice reply : we have no countersign we should have be at we destination long before sundown but be misdirect ten mile out of we course on the manchester pike very well dismount and come forward one man at a time jack answer briefly this the spokesman do with some alacrity as he come up dick take the precaution of get between he and he three companion and then jack say : i suppose you be all right but my order be to arrest all mount man detain they horse here in these the provost stable and jack point to dick 's horse dimly outline against the sky i will give you a receipt for he and you can get he back in the morning when you state you case to the provost marshal -- stephen he turn to dick take that horse and put he with the other he then make out a receipt hand it to the astonished trooper and direct he where to go carry out the same short shrift with the other three the trooper be glad enough to be relieve of they beast this they do not attempt to deny for they have see a public-house in the street below where they could procure much-needed refreshment relieve as they now be from the necessity of report to they commander whose whereabouts be far down the rocett road by george jack what a crafty plotter you be now we have a mount for the party and i need not take poor warick 's crack stallion yes we have double the chance of escape by this little stratagem but we have lose time come have you tie the horse yes lead on over the turfy hillside now moist and sticky with the heavy dew they steal half crouching half crawl until they be on a level with the prison basement the sentry in front be no longer pacing he beat and there be no sign of the man in the rear in a few minute the two crawl figure be at the preconcerted place in the wall in response to they light tap a square of brick-work large enough to leave a space for a man to crawl through crumble upon jack and dick who hold they body closely press against the _ débris _ to prevent too loud a noise there be no time to wait probability of discovery and a instant later barney and jone emerge panting and half smother i think it be all up with I hope as glory mcnab say when she sweetheart run away with the cobbler 's daughter barney whisper hug jack rapturously sh -- down on you stomach move that way until you see I rise come and jack squirm ahead as if he have be accustom to the locomotion of snake all he life in ten minute they be in the improvise stable dick have take the precaution to place the horse where they could feed on a heap of fodder stack in the yard and when they mount the beast appear refresh as well as rested dick loose warick 's horse so that he might make he way back to he master the fugitive ride cautiously out of the lane into the open field and though it be not they shortest way push along the river road to mislead pursuit jack 's stratagem have result in better luck even than the possession of the horse it not only secure a mount for the four but what be equally and perhaps in view of unforeseen contingency more important disguise for the two prisoner they find a extra coat strap to each saddle and with these barney and jone be easily transform into something like confederate soldier both jack and jone know every inch of the suburb have make the topography a study they strike for the less travel thoroughfare until they reach the northeastern limit then follow the old cold harbor road they push decisively toward the williamsburg pike but instead of follow it they traverse on by lane and bridle-path during the day this be to divide pursuit as the larger party have take the river route where butler 's troops be wait in boat for they the saddle-bag prove a windfall for in they be order to proceed to yorktown and report to general magruder with these jack feel no difficulty in pass several awkward point where there be no escape the cavalry patrol owe to mile of swamp and impenetrable forest they keep clear however of such place as the telegraph reach though at one point they find a post in a great state of excitement over news bring from a neighbor wire announce the escape of two prisoner who have be trace to the york road but with such papers as jack present and the number of the party double that describe in the dispatch the adventurer easily evade suspicion the great danger however be in quit the confederate line to pass into butler 's they choose the night for this as the camp-fire would warn they of the vicinity of outpost union or rebel they have purposely avoid highway and habitation and as a result be limit in food to such corn-crib as they find far from human abode or the autumn aftermath of vegetable sometimes find in the shadow of the wood all be good shot however and a fat rabbit and partridge be cook by dick with such address that the party be eager to take more time in halt since they need not starve no matter how long the journey last jack by tacit consent be consider commander of the squad barney remark humorously that they would not ask to see he commission until they be in a country where a title mean authority the commander order he small army very judiciously they be to ride as far apart as the road or wood or natural obstruction would admit they thus move forward in the shape of a triangle the apex to the rear exchange of position be make every six hour they be at the end of the second day toward sunset approach what they suppose be warrick creek nearly half-way to fort monroe when they suddenly emerge on a open plateau from which they could see a mile or two before they a tranquil waste of crimson water why this can not be the creek exclaim jone excitedly the creek be not half a mile at its broadest what can it be jack ask who have be the right wing to jone 's leave it be certainly not the jame for the sun be set at we back blest if i can tell it look very much like the chesapeake only the chesapeake be wider by this time barney and dick have ride up and begin to admire the expanse of water spreading from the land before they to a green wilderness in the distance i be afraid we be in a fix jone say resignedly if i be not very much mistaken the red line yonder that look like a roadway be a breastwork and behind that what look like a plow field be earthworks my boy we be before yorktown and farther from we line than we be yesterday the nigger that show we the way in the wood be either ignorant or deceive we we be now inside the outpost of the rebel and we shall have to crawl on we hand and knee to escape they i do not see what better off we 'll be on we hand and knee than we be in we saddle barney cry guilelessly sure we can go faster on the baste than we can on we hand and as for I knee ` tis only in prayer that i ever use they not in love barney dick ask innocently no I darlin ' the gurl i love think more of I arm than I knee and i do all of I pleadin ' with I lip i should think they could hold they own jone remark dryly indeed they can that and a good deal more as I best gurl 'll tell you if she 'll tell the truth and no fear of she do that i 'll go bail fie barney if she will not tell the truth you should have none of she dick cry in stage tone indeed it be little i have of she for she be that set on teddy redmund that she leave I to she mother when teddy come to the porch of a evening well friend you love be no doubt adorable and it be a pleasant thing to talk over but just now what we want be a way out of this trap and jack say this slip from he horse and lead he into the shelter of a thick growth of scrub-pine the rest follow he example they tie they animal and hold a council of war it be resolve that jack and jone should make a reconnaissance to find out the route toward the warrick that dick and barney should secrete and guard the horse and do what they could to obtain some food this decision be barely agree upon when the shrill call of a bugle sound almost among the refugee and they spring to they horse wait in silence the next demonstration other bugle sound farther away a great cloud of dust arise in the direction of the water and then jack whisper : remain here i will climb one of these tree and see what it mean he be in the leafy bough of a spreading pine in a few minute and could descry a broad plain with tent scatter here and there still farther on the broad upland frame building with a red and white flag float to the wind could be see back of all this he could make out a broad expanse of water and a few ungainly craft lazily move to the current in the yorktown roadstead yes this certainly must be yorktown why have they such a force here no one be threaten it jack murmur he eye arrest by a long line of cavalry in undress lead they horse up a circuitous and hitherto conceal road to the plateau ha they go down there for water let I see that be to the southeastward that be we point of direction i think we may venture to push on now he hastily descend from he survey and make know what he have see add : we must proceed with the greatest caution there be no time to think of food until we get away from this dangerous neighborhood we must keep well spread out and move only over turfy ground or in the deep shade of the wood in case of disaster the cry of the night owl as agree upon will be a warn the four have practice the melancholy cry of the owl as hear in the southern wood both day and night and they could all imitate it sufficiently well to pass muster if the hearer be not on guard against the trick and yet so clever a imitation that none of the four could mistake it so soon as they quit the plateau seek a way east by south they plunge immediately into a dreary swamp where progress be slow and difficult the mosquito beset they in swarm plague even the poor animal with they lusty sting hour after hour until the wood become a hideous chaos of darkness and unseemly sound the four panting fugitive push on faint with hunger wear out by the incessant battle with the cord foliage the dense marsh and quagmire through which they path to safety lay but at midnight jone gasp and give up the fight go on leave I here i be of no use at best i should only be a drag on you perhaps you may find some darkey and send he back to give I a mouthful to eat that would pick I up nothing else can the four gather together for counsel the horse fare better than they master for they find abundance to allay hunger in the lush dank grass of the morass be corral in a clump of white ash and the jaded man grope about clamber upon the gnarled root of the tree to catch breath they have be battle steadily for five hour against all the force of nature they clothes be tear they flesh abrade they strength exhaust they could have sleep but the ground offer no place for wherever the foot rest a instant the weight of the body push it down into the oozy soil until water gush in over the shoe-tops jone have find the struggle hardest because he have not the youth of the other nor they light frame the stripling be spare many of he hardship and be still able to endure the ordeal if the end be sure relief jack strike a match and with this light a pine knot he survey the gloomy brake carefully and at last find a mound where a thick growth of underbrush give assurance of less treacherous soil he call to barney to aid he the little hillock be make into a couch by means of the saddle and the groan veteran carefully lay upon the by no means uncomfortable refuge as jack hold the light above he jone 's eye close and he sink into a lethargic sleep he will be in a high fever when he awake jack say look at barney we must see that he have food or the fever will be he death here be what i propose : you and i shall sally out from here blaze the path as we go we must find some sign of life within a circuit of five mile that will take we say till daylight to go and come we will leave dick here to guard jone and if we do not return by noon to-morrow dick will know that he must shift for himself you command jack dear what you say i 'll do as molly meginniss say to the priest when he tell she to repent of she sin dick my boy do you think you be equal to a vigil you must stay here with jone if he wake and want water press the moisture of these leaf to he lip it be sassafras and stay -- here be a sort of plantain fill with little globule of dew pour these into he mouth and at a pinch give he a handful from the pool in case of great danger fire two shot but if any one should come toward you or discover you it will be better to surrender in that event you can make up a story to suit the case which may enable you to finally escape this man 's life be in you hand remember that it be as glorious a deed as fight in line keep up a stout heart we will soon be back or you may take it for grant all be up with we ah jack jack to start so well and end so miserably i can not bear it -- i can not stay here you stay and let I go no dick it can not be you be already so worn out that we should have be oblige to halt for you if jone have not break down it can not be that you would think of leave a fellow-soldier in such extremity as this dick i know you better but i do not know he i have no interest in he with you i 'll face any danger -- i 'll die without a word but to stay here in this awful place with the black pool of water like great dead eye glare in they hideous light -lrb- the pine-torch flare in the wind fill the glade with vast ogreish shadow as the clustering bush be sway in the night air -rrb- and these hideous night-cry -- o jack i can not -- i can not -- i must go but the horse and the need of some one that can come back in case anything befall I i be disappoint in you dick i be shock you be not the man of courage and honor i think you o my god go -- go -- i will stay but jack if you find I dead tell -- tell -- rosa -- that -- that -- he gasp and sink down sob against the gnarled tree that cross the mound above jone 's head i will tell rosa that you be the man she believe you be when the trial come and with this jack and barney with a flaming torch set forward hastily through the fantastic curtain of foliage and night which shut in the glimmering vista of specter dark sinister and menacing chapter xxv phantasmagoria to say that night be a time of terror be a commonplace night be not terrible of itself it be like the ocean -- peace and repose if there be no storm but of all terror there be none outside a guilty mind so benumbing as night in the unknown it do not lessen the horror of darkness that fear make use of the imagination for its agency fancy intuition and the train that follow the inner vision these make of night a phantasmagoria compare to which milton 's inferno be a place of comparative repose if you would realize the wondrous necromancy of the sun pass a night in some primeval forest untouched by the hand of man until he stand in the awful silence of the midnight wood or upon some vast waste of nature no man can figure to himself the varied shape the mind can give to terror base upon the mysterious noise of nature and the goblin motion of inanimate thing the lover thinking of he lass welcome the night and the rapturous walk among well-known scene and kindly object with glimmer lamp in the foliage and the not distant sound of daily life even the wood have nothing fearful to the meditative or the distraught but in flight with fear as a garment that can not be lay aside the somber form of the forest be more terrible than a army with banner as a haunt house be a more unnerving dread than burglar or any form of night marauder it be at night that the mutinous sailor of columbus break into decisive revolt it be at night that the iron band of corte lose heart and be route on the lake of mexico it be at night that the resolution of brutus fail before the disaster at philippus that two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage which be the secret of soldierly success come only from companionship the night-wood be a world by itself fill with its own atmosphere as oppressive to valor as the electric reef that draw the nail from the ship of sindbad among familiar scene and well-known shape it be all the delight the poet sing -- so tranquillizing inspiring fecund that in comparison the thought of day bring up garish hue flaunt figure -- the hardness harshness and unlovely in life but night in the goblin-land where dick find himself suddenly desert with fantastic form sway in the lazy wind would have have terror for the most constant mind terror such as fill the soul of macbeth when birnam wood come march to dunsinane in a instant as it seem to dick 's exalt and painfully impressionable sense every separate leaf branch brier copse and jungle be endowed with a voice of its own -- hateful irritating mock swarm of peer eye hover in the air glowering uncanny menace into the boy 's wild dilate vision brave even to recklessness dick be as you have see but no sooner have the glimmer of jack 's torch flicker and flutter into the black distance make place for the monstrous shape the lure shadow and threatening form encompass he than dick throw himself with a wail shriek into the morass in a wild attempt to follow in a instant he be up to he middle in mud and water he seize the prickly branch coil about and above he he gasp in prayerful plead the home teaching still strong in he but there be no answer save the croon night-bird and the croak frog slimy thing touch he torn flesh whir bird shoot past he disturb in they night perch the deadly odor pungent and nauseous of a thousand exhale herb fill he nostril the darkness grow instinct with threatening form he gasp struggle and in a fervent outburst of thanksgive regain the dank mound ah there be life on that human life jone sleep the stertorous sleep of delirium he murmur brokenly dick be too terrify to distinguish what he say the blaze of the pine knot flare from side to side as the sigh breeze arise from the brackish pool protest the vitality of even this moribund hade ah if he could but lie down and bury he face the horse they be feed tranquilly yonder stand up to they knee in moss and water the line that tie they be long they could move about this be some comfort they be more human than the dreadful specter that fill the place ah the bless bless light that flame out from the merry pine-torch he do not wonder that half the eastern world worship fire he adore it -- bless bless fire -- the sign of god the beacon of the human hark what half-human -- or rather wholly inhuman -- sound be these that alternate in unearthly measure surely animal nature have no voice so strident vengeful odious can it be animal of prey no the virginium forest be dangerous only in snake snake ah yes he shrink into shadow against the oak at this suggestion snake the deadly moccasin that prowl as well by night as day ugh what be this at he foot -- soft clammy shine in the flare light he leap upon the smooth tree-trunk grow slantwise instead of perpendicular what if the torch and the odor of flesh should draw the snake to the sleeper the flame flare in wide lurid curve reveal the outline of the sleep man heaven what a terrible face he move in spasmodic contortion he be smother the vein of he neck will break if he be not awaken o my god my god have mercy dick bury he face in he hand as he cling desperately to the smooth white-oak trunk a strange wild strain like a detach chord of a vesper melody sound above he it be the whippoorwill -- steadily continuously entrancingly the dulcet measure be take up and echo until the slough of despond seem transform into a vary diapason of melancholy minstrelsy he dare not raise he head it will vanish if he move he crouch pant almost exultant in the sense of recover faculty or rather the suspension of numbing fear how long will it last he must move he limb be cramped and ache he raise he head mortal power the torch be flicker into ash another instant and he will be in the dark dare he move dare he seek the distant pine between he and which the black surface of the murky sheet shine dot with uncanny growth and reptilian thing yes anything be better than the hideous darkness of this hideous place the horse he ride have break he leash and come to he with a gentle whinny as if ask why the delay in such a place bless bless god that make a beast so human he caress it he cling to its neck and call to it piteously ah yes the die light he must renew it he slip down upon the bare back and urge the patient beast across the brackish morass ah this be life again he be not alone this noble beast be human it crop the tender leave confidingly and swing its head as much as to say : do not fear dick fin here i 'll stand by you i do not forget the pain you take to get I water and that particularly toothsome measure of oats you crib in the rebel barn near williamsburg but the pine knot that will burn be not so easily find dick be force to go a long way before he come upon the resinous sort he bring back a supply have take the precaution to provide match in order to secure he way back the quest have to some extent lessen the morbid or supernatural form of he terror they all return however when have dismount he forget to tie the horse and it wander off in search of herbage he call but the beast make no sign of return alone again alone in the night spectral form about he the sleep man add to the ghostliness of the scene by he incoherent muttering he hideous gulp breath he ghastly blood-curdling outcry then through the gloom the shine outline of the white oak like shred of shroud hang on funeral foliage ah he would go mad -- he must break the brutish sleep of the sick man mr jone he wail -- and he own voice -- the comically commonplace name mr jone even in the agony of he terror the humor of the conjuncture glimmer in the boy 's crazed intelligence and he laugh a wild maniacal laugh but the laugh die out in a pulseless horror the sick man uprose on he elbow dick above he on the white-oak trunk could see he very eye bloodshot and wander he uprise almost sit he pass he hand over he stare eye and begin to murmur : do you bring I here to do murder elisha boone you have buy my body but you never buy my soul no no i will not i say i will not do you hear i will not he glare wildly then he eye meet the full flame of the torch he laugh a dreadful marrow-freezing laugh and break out again in clearer tone : i be yours elisha boone but my boy be not yours he be bear in my shape but he have he mother 's soul he will be a man he will be you vengeance he will undo all he father have do you have rob I you have make I rob other but if you touch if you look at my boy my first-born you might as well hold a pistol at you head i be no longer mad you must treat with he ah yes i 'll do you bidding with the other i 'll make young jack as much trouble as you ask but you must make a path of gold for my boy you must give he what you have rob from I felon i be no felon it be you who plot it it be you that put the means in mad hand i can face my family i have no shame but that i be a coward my son he be no coward he be a soldier he be the pride of the caribee he be the beloved of -- of -- the gibbering maniac exhaust in body still incoherently rave sink back in piteous collapse a terrifying gurgle break from he throat while he tongue absolutely protrude from he jaw dick he terror all forget in a new and overmastering horror bethought he of jack 's admonition about the water he slip down from the tree gather the large moist leaf that cluster near the pool and hold they to the burning lip jone swallow the drop with a hideous gurgling avidity clutch the boy 's hand ravenously to secure a more copious flow there be a tin cup in the holster under the invalid 's head take this dick dip up water from the black pool between the green leave the hot lip suck it in at one dreadful gulp more more for god 's sake more dick fill it again and again it be empty more -- more -- i be burn -- more the boy be cruelly perplexed he remember vaguely hear that fever should be starve that the thing crave be the dangerous thing and he move away in a sort of compunctious terror more -- more oh in the name of god more the word come gaspingly dick thought of the death-rattle he have hear in acredale when old man nagle the madman die he dare not give more water but he gather leave from the aromatic bush and press they to the fevered lip before he could withdraw they the eager jaw close upon the balsamic shrub they answer the purpose better than the most scientific remedy in the pharmacopoeia for the patient call for no further drink and presently fall into profound and undisturbed sleep again the boy be alone with the daunting force of the dark in its grimmest and most terrifying mood alone no he mind be now take from all thought of self he be with a fellow-townsman the man have mention boone have refer to deed that he have hear all he life associate with the father he have never see a wild thought flash upon he be the collapsed body at he foot he father 's he could not see any resemblance in the dark handsome face to the portrait at home though all through the flight from richmond something in the man 's manner have seem like a memory he strive to recall the image he young mind have cherish the personality he have hear whisper about in the gossip group of acredale this be not the gay the brilliant the fascinating _ bon viveur _ who have be the life of society from warchester to bucephalo from pentica to new york ah what be the mystic terror of the night what the oppressive surroundings of this charnel-house of nature to the awful spectacle of this unmanned mind this delirious echo of past guilt past cowardice past shame to lessen the somber gloom dick have light many torch and set they about the high mound where the sleeper lay in a huddle take little heed of where he set they some of they as the wind arise flare out until they flame lick the decayed branch of the fall white oak as the boy crouch pensive and distraught he be suddenly arouse by a vivacious crack he look up line of fire be dart thither and yon where dry wood the _ débris _ of year of decay have be catch in the thick clump of underbrush and among the limb of the tree the fire have push briskly and the uncanny glade be now a amphitheatre of crawl flame stretch in many-colored banner in a vast circle about the point of refuge dick gaze fascinate with no thought of danger he spirit rise it be something like life -- this gorgeous decoration of fire how beautiful it be how it bring out the shine line of the white oak the glistening green of the cypress why have not he think of this before then as the curl wave of fire push farther and farther up the stein of the tree and farther and farther endlessly into the undergrowth a unearthly outcry and stir begin bird blind by the light whirred and flutter into the open space above the water fall helplessly so near dick that he could have catch and kill a score to surprise jack with a game breakfast when he return then -- ugh -- horror -- great coiling mass detach themselves from the tuft of sward and splash noisily into the putrid water wriggle and convulse the invalid still sleep -- but dreadful sight the coil monster upheave themselves from the water glide dull eyed and sluggish upon the mossy island about the unconscious figure dick fascinate and inert watch the snaky mass squirm in hideous fold almost on the recumbent body then arouse to the horror of they nearness he seize a torch and make at the slimy heap the fire conquer they they slide off the ground with fork tongue dart out in impotent malice but other squirm through the water wriggle up and the boy madden by the danger stand he ground torch in hand defend the sleeper but now the fire have widen its path and be envelop the tiny island the serpent hedge in from the outer line uproar in blood-curdling mass they dull eye gleam and they tongue phosphorescent dart out in they agony dick do not mind they now for he have for the first time begin to realize that he illumination have destruction as the sequel of its delight great cloud of smoke settle a moment on the water and then rise impel by the cold surface even the green verdure begin to roll back where the crackling flame play into the more compact wall of incombustible timber the sleeper murmur in he dream dick cast about despairingly he hear the horse -- they have break they tether -- he can hear they whinnying upbraidingly far off wherever he cast he eye volume of fire dart and sway always come inward first scorch the green limb then fasten on the tender stem and turn they to glowing line of cordage only the great sheet of water inky terrible and threaten a few hour before protect he and he charge the hiss snake have sink into it bevy of bird supernaturally keen of sight have drop upon the twig that lie on the glitter bosom of the water dick in all the agonized uncertainty of that night of peril think with wonder on the mysterious resource nature provide its helpless outcast the hideous shallows black glisten be now a belt of safety not only for himself and the sleeper but a refuge for all manner of whir bird and crawl thing intimidate and harmless in the stifle breath of the fire the flame leap from sedge to sedge from trunk to trunk seem to seek with a human instinct and more than human pertinacity food for its ravening hunger far upward where festoon of moss hang from the sycamore in the day airy banner of starry spark sway coil and flame among the branch but dick be soon remind that the scene be not for enjoyment however fantastically fascinating the smoke at first rise from the burning brake lodge among the tree-top then meet the humid night-air in the matted leaf descend slowly dick find himself nearly smother when he have partly recover from the spell-bound wonder of the demoniac _ fête _ the ground under he foot feel gratefully cool he bent down and shudderingly lave he burning face in the inky water the sick man have sleep more peacefully during the last half-hour he no longer breathe in gasp effort he sleep be unbroken by mutter or outcry but now he must be arouse he must be take out of the circle of fire for sooner or later the curl wave would lick downward from the dry vine above and scorch the mound how to get away the horse be long since go they might be mile from the spot dick touch the sleep man fill with a new suspense he breathe so softly or do he breathe at all for god 's sake mr jone wake up we must go from here the swamp be burn eh -- who be it where be i be -- i dream i think my boy be with I and we be in the old home at acredale he lay quite still stare upward with unseeing eye dick 's heart give a great throb of grateful devout thanksgive the madness and fever be go you remember you be too worn out to go on and jack have go to get food but the swamp have catch fire and we must move away jone have rise to he elbow then with a exclamation that sound like a oath to he foot gaze on the flaming specter rise and fall enlarge and shrink among the black tracery of limb and trunk you ought to have wake I before jone say when he have sweep the scene with sane realization in he eye i be afraid we can never break through the fire it reach a mile or more all about we and i -- i be in no condition to move i feel as if i have be down month with illness but if you could eat something you would be able to move dick venture cruelly hurt at the imply delinquency eat jone hold up one of the luckless torch that dirk have light in a circle about the mound and begin to examine the ground what be there to eat stay by heaven i have it the bush be fill with flutter game there see that and that and that as he speak he have thrust the burning torch into a thick clump of bush dense and glistening as laurel that look like wild huckleberry the branch be laden with bird and in a moment be have seize three or four partridge what better do we need we have salt water and fire i 'll prepare they do you keep you face well bath and heap up ember at the foot of that ash sure enough sometimes hide by billow of smoke rise lazily among the burning bush jone strip the bird spit they on he bayonet and hold they in the hot coal soon present a well-browned portion to he companion i have have a good deal worse fare than this my young friend i have be in the west when fire indian and hunger besiege we at the same time but we should have a poor chance here if it be not for the wet grass and the everlasting water if we can manage to keep clear of the smoke we shall be all right but the smoke seem to grow denser where can it come from great heaven do you hear that shot -- one -- two that be jack 's signal he -- he be near he be in danger i must go to he dick cry listen more shot no that can not be the signal there do you hear that a volley the rebel be after they or we be near the outpost and the two army be skirmish yes the shot now sound more frequently but they seem to be fire not far away it be jack i know it be jack and he be in peril i must go to he i can not stay here surely there be no danger in push toward the firing there be every danger in the first place the smoke will smother we then suppose we reach the spot we might be nearer the rebel than we friend they know where we be if they be not take they will come back for we if they be take we must do we best to get to we line and send out a scout party be guide by I youngster i be a older hand in business of this sort than you be the boy stand irresolute both listen intently the firing have stop a great sough of rise storm come from the northwest carry a hot blind mass of smoke and flame into the little retreat they fling themselves on the damp fern to keep they breath still the breeze rise until it become a wind -- a spasm of hurricane it be madness to linger for the flame now lick the ground drive down anew by the blast then jone speak decisively : strap a pine torch to you body i will do the same take all you can carry and follow in my wake jone as he speak seize a torch extinguish it and hand it to dick equip as he have direct they set out half crawl half swimming to avoid the volume of smoke hover in the thick cactus-like leaf of the wild laurel presently they emerge after toil and misery that excitement alone enable the boy to support into what seem a clear space but as soon as they eye could distinguish clearly they find themselves on the edge of a wide pond the fire be now behind they they could stand erect and breathe the pure cool air ah now we be in luck jone whisper we will walk to the right on the edge of this lake and keep it between we and the fire we have get out of that purgatory now if we could only signal we friend hist whisper dick i hear some one move behind we they crouch down in the thick reed and wait the sky above be darkly overcast a occasional burst of lightning reveal the dimension of the pond and they could see high ground on the eastern shore cover by enormous pine if we can only reach the pine we shall be all right there the ground will be dry and soft and you can get some rest i be afraid my boy it will go hard with you if you do not i do not mind what happen if we can only come up with jack there do you hear that yes both could plainly hear voice ahead of they on the margin of the pond they be talk in low tone and the word be undistinguishable we must crawl back toward the bush and get as near those folk as we can jone whisper they make they way easily into the high bush and steal forward in the direction of the voice but as they have to guard against break twig or hurtle branch which would have betray they they advance be slow when they reach the vicinity where they have fancy the voice to be all be silent sound the call perhaps that will lead to something jone whisper in dick 's ear but unnerved by the try experience of the night or wear out by fatigue dick 's call be far from the significant signal he have practice with jack he repeat it several time but there be no response there be however something more startling a few rod beyond they a flame suddenly shoot up light a group of cavalry patrol stand beside a fire just kindle rebel jone whisper now we must be slippery as snake if they have no dog we be all right if you hear the whimper of a hound follow I like lightning and plunge into the water that 'll break the trail stay here and let I reconnoitre a bit have no fear i 'll go in no danger jone creep away leave dick by no means easy in he mind but he no longer feel the terror that numb he in the deep wood here there be companionship by push the branch aside he could see the figure lounge about the fire he could see the dark vault of the sky and be not oppress by the hideous shape and shadow of the dense jungle jone meanwhile have push within earshot of the group he flatten he body against a friendly pine and listen i reckon they be not the westover nigger for they be trace to the

swimmer very well throw away everything -- no stay -- that would betray we when we reach the water bury all you can not carry in the sand and then follow I they be force to retrace they painful way through the bush to reach a place as distant from the point of pursuit as possible a half-mile or more from they starting-place they find themselves in a run stream jone examine it in both direction and bid dick enter it and follow in the water push upward in the bed waist-deep a hundred yard then climb to the bank he grope about until he find a slender white oak climb this as high as he could get he slowly swing off and the tree bend down to the very stream he drop back into the water and rejoin dick both wade in the middle of the stream until they reach the pond and then strike out toward the pine clump the lightning have reveal a little while before there be no need of swimming and find it possible to wade jone decide to retain the pistol and ammunition which he have at first resolve to bury as impede the flight the bottom appear to be hard sand a condition often find in southern pond near the inflow of the sea they have go a mile or more keep just far enough from the bank to remain undistinguishable when the appalling baying of a hound sound from the farther end of the pond where the patrol fire gleam faintly among the tree now youngster we must keep all we wit at work the dog will push on to where we hide they will follow to the stream and i think i have give they the slip there then they will beat about and follow we trail into the cypress swamp there the horse will mislead they and if you can only hold out so soon as daylight come we can strike into the pine and make for the union line i -- i -- think i can -- ah -- dick reel helplessly and would have sink under the water if jone have not catch he courage my boy courage do not give up now just as we be near rescue but dick be unconscious the strain of the early part of the night the desperate fight through the brake all have tell on the slight frame and jone stand up to he middle in the dark water hold the faint boy chapter xxvi in the union line if there be reason as well as rhyme in the old song that danger 's a soldier 's delight and a storm the sailor 's joy jack and he comrade be in for all the delight that ever gladden soldier or sailor boy when they leave dick and jone the eager courier tear through the marshy lowland the stubbly thicket and treacherous quagmire poor barney panting and groan in he docile desire to keep up with he leader as he have do often in boyish bravado there 'll not be a rag on I body nor a whole bone in I skin when we get out of this he gasp as they reach high ground between two spread deep of mingled weed and water the sight of we would frighten the whole rebel army if we do not come on they aisy loike as the fox say when he whisk into the hen-house he be a very considerate fox barney most of the personage you select to illustrate you notion

penance until he head be clear and there be no whisky in the jar they have be push on rapidly -- noiselessly during this whisper dispute and now find themselves at the reedy margin of a wide inlet where from the swift motion of the water and the musical gurgle they could tell they be by the side of a main channel we must push on southward and see if there be a cross if we come to one that will tell we where we be for it will be guard you may be sure say jack buoyantly yes but i would rather find a hill of potato and a drop than all the soldier in the two army you be not logical barney if we find soldier we 'll find ration though i have my doubt about the sort of ` drop ' you 'll be apt to find down here there be enough corn in the field beyant to keep a still at work for a winter barney

hill of potato all eye could not see we in such darkness as this for dense cloud have swiftly come up from the west cover the horizon after careful reconnoitring require a circuit of the clearing jack venture to make directly for the dark outline of the cabin war have obviously not visit the place for as they pass a low outhouse the startled cackle of chicken sound toothsomely and barney come to a delighted halt sure we would better get a bite to eat while we may as th ' ass say when he pass th ' market car for who know what 'll happen if we stop to ask by you lave for answer jack give he a sharp push and the discomfited plunderer hurry on with a good-humored grunt all be silent in the cabin the window be slatt without glass and the door be unfastened jack push in boldly leave barney to guard the rear peaceful snore come from one corner and jack shade a light match with he hand look about he in the hurry glimpse he catch sight of a old negro on a husk mattress and the head of young boy just beyond they be sleep so soundly that the striking of the match never arouse they jack have to shake the man violently before the profound sleep be break i say wake up or can you wake what dat who be dar -- you gabe what you ` bout the old man shuffle to a sit posture and jack renew he match hold it in the negro 's blinking eye have you any food we be yankee and want something for companion

freedom bestow upon these guileless friend might not for a time at least be more of a hardship than they happy-go-lucky servitude meanwhile in the expansion of renew hope and full stomach no watch have be keep on the outside a tallow dip have be light and the whole party busy in get together such necessaries as could be carry one of the boy pass the door utter a stifled cry : somebody comin ' from de road where can we hide do not put out the light that will look suspicion jack whisper make for the window in the rear be there a cellar or can we get on the roof but the dark group be too terrify to speak they run in a mob to the doorway luckily the most adroit maneuver they could hit upon for with the dip flare in the current of air the room be leave in darkness jack and barney slip through the low lattice and by means of a narrow shed reach the low roof they could hear the tramp of horse how many they could not judge and then a gruff voice demand : you rafe what ye up to what ye get a light burnin ' this time o ' night fo ' ` deed marsa it be nuffin ' -- fo ' god marsa i be gittin ' de stomach bottle fo ' gabe -- he eat some jelly root fo ' supper and he be be powerful sick

you heah there be the sound of a sharp stroke then a howl of pain and a boisterous laugh you keep a eye on the rear and i will see how many horse there be jack 's lip murmur in barney 's ear he slide cautiously down the slanting roof until he come to the corner where he see the dark group of horse there be three -- tie to the peach-tree he make he way back to barney and whisper : there be but three horse if you be up to a adventure i think we can make this turn to we profit i be up to anything as the cat say when biddy hik 's plug run she up the crab-tree very well come after I the sorghum meanwhile have be hand to the raider in the cabin and the man could be hear make merry you gabe go out and mind the horse see that they do not twist the bridle about they leg gabe sally out and one of he brother with he as they near the horse jack come upon they and take the elder gabe in the shadow of the house he whisper : have the soldier ' pistol yes sah where be they de put dem on de stool neah de doah good how many free have they sword yes sah where be they on de stool too that will do keep with the horse and do not be frighten if you hear anything we 'll give you freedom yet if you 'll be prudent he could hear the man grumble because the food be not enough to go around the liquor have begin to work in they system drink so lavishly and without nourishment to absorb its fiery quality jack let enough time pass to give this ally full play in disable the trooper then take barney to the rear of the cabin whisper : i will dash in at the door seize the weapon and demand surrender you make a great ado here give command as if there be a squad the boy will make a loud clatter with the horse and we shall bag the game without a blow now be prudent barney and we will go into the union line in triumph inside the man be laugh uproariously mingle account of love and war in a confused medley -- how a sweetheart in petersburg be only wait for the star on she lover 's collar to make he happy how the yankee would be wipe out of the peninsula as soon as jack magruder get he nail pare for fight how three yankee have be gobble that day and how other be in the net to be take in the morning the bacchanal be at its highest when jack dash into the open doorway place himself between the drinker and they arm and cry sternly as he point he pistol at the group : surrender man you be surround close up there keep you gun on a line with the window do not fire till i give the order barney could be hear at the window in suppress tone as he too cover the maudlin company gabe and he brother add to the effect of number by clatter the stirrup of the horse so that the clearing seem alive with armed man the trooper sober and astonish half rise and then as these sound of superior force emphasize the menace of jack 's pistol in front and barney be in the rear they sink back in they seat the spokesman say tipsily : i do not see as we have much choice no you have no choice -- sergeant bring in the cord jack order barney at this come in with a clothes-line jack have prepare from the negro ' post the arm of the three man be bind behind they and then jack retire with he aide to hold a council of war without the negro they could never retrace they way to dick but how could they carry the prisoner with they manifestly it could not be do it be then agree that barney should take the prisoner the horse and the old man with the younger boy and make for the union line not a mile distant jack meanwhile with little gabe would go to the rescue of dick if firing be hear later barney would understand that he friend be in peril and if the union outpost be in sufficient strength they could come to the rescue and perhaps add to the capture of the night barney be now serious enough he be remind of no joke by the present dilemma and remain very solemn as jack enlarged on the glory of the propose campaign how all acredale would applaud the intrepidity of its townsman snatch glory from peril barney consent to leave he with reluctance suggest that the ould nagur could take the prisoner beyant gabe have show sense and courage and i shall be much more likely to reach dick and extricate he and jone alone than if i have this cavalcade at my heel jack and barney be force to laugh at the big-eyed wonder in old rafe 's eye when he be inform of the impose part he be to play in the warlike comedy to be guard over white folk to dare to look they in the face without fear of a blow in all he sixty year rafael hinton have never dream such a mission for a man of color the trooper too tipsy and subdue to remark the sudden paucity of the force that have overcome they be tie upon they own steed barney in front of the leader and rafe and he son in charge of the two other rafe lead the way in tremble triumph he know the ford indeed every foot of the country and have no misgiving about reach the union line jack watch the squad until it disappear in the fringe of tree and then turn to the tearful gabe say encouragingly : now we must do as well when we go among the union soldier you know the point in the swamp i have tell about how long will it take we to reach that the shortest way ef we have dad 's dugout we could save right smart you mean we could get there by water yes sah we ken go all froo de swamp in a boat then i be afraid it be not the place i mean for we find as much land as water dey be not no odder swamp neah heah sah well we 'll try my route first if that mislead we we shall try the boat can you find it suah where be it ober neah the blockhouse de soger do tuk it to fish ah yes the blockhouse i must look into that now we must hurry skirt the edge of the water and make no noise this be a needless warning to the boy who barefoot and scantily clad give jack as much as he could do to keep up with he they have leave the cabin a mile or more behind they to the southeastward and be somewhere near the spot jack have emerge from the cypress swamp when both be bring to a halt by shift cloud of smoke pour out from the underwood where do that come from jack ask throw himself flat to catch he breath dunno sah most likely de sojers sot de brush on fiah when jack be able to look again he see far in among the tree a move wave of light now and then as the heavy curtain of smoke be lift by the wind good heaven he ejaculate it be in there i leave my friend can we get to they no sah der be not no crick dah then jack thought have i sacrifice dick and jone in my zeal to be adventurous ten minute sooner and we could have go in and bring they out but i will find a way in if i have to clamber over the tree-top the noise of whir wing the rush of startled animal now drown all other sound until through the tumult from the copse far in front of they they hear the clatter of sword and then gigantic figure break toward they along the edge of the pond down down hug the ground jack cry push the boy down into the reed almost as they sink a group of trooper dash by talk excitedly fire at random man that will force they into cover if we can keep they in ambush till daylight the dog will be here and we shall nab they jack hear a voice say as the man ride past how could they have hear of the affair so quickly for jack take it for grant that it be he exploit that the trooper be afoot to balk still another group pass and they be talk of the dog that be expect you may depend upon it they be in the swamp they be make off that way and hope to mislead we by firing the place we must keep we eye peel on the swamp the creek will stop they down yonder and we must watch this break in the brush as soon as the dog come we shall have no trouble they 'll run 'em down in no time jack have hear enough to warn he that it be useless to try to penetrate the swamp with half of he usual wit dick would have be _ en route _ long before this for the fiery glow in the wood show that the flame have be rage some time unless jone 's illness have handicap he dick would be on he way follow jack 's route as closely as the darkness would permit but now he must seek means to evade the dog this could be do only by reach the water and get into it far from the point where they propose to leave it can you find the boat he ask gabe who chatter between he tooth i think so sah very well we must find a small stream run into the pond and then lead I to the boat moccasin brook be close yonder sah shall i go dah yes like lightning in a few minute they be in a sluggish current running between mass of reed and spread lily-leaf into the pond here jack repeat jone 's maneuver except that he be not wise enough in woodcraft to make use of a tree to get into the water and thus leave the dog at the end of the trail at a point far remove from he real entrance into it when they have reach the pond jack bid the boy head to the boat this they find moor under a bluff and gabe point upward say the blockhouse be there very well you stay here in the boat and wait for I do not stir do not speak no matter what you see or hear will you do this oh yes sah ` deed ` deed i will sah jack crawl up the bank keep in the shadow of the uneven ground until he reach a point whence he could make out the blockhouse it be a half-finished structure of rough log and from the stake and other sign of engineering preliminary he see that it be intend as the guard-house of a fortification he could hear the drawl of languid half-sleepy voice and as he push farther to the eastward see a group of trooper lounge about a die fire a sentry sit before the doorway which have no door he be doze on he post though now and then he arouse himself to listen to the comment of the man at the fire while jack wait irresolute what to do a volley sound across the pond evidently the fellow whom he have see keep up the fusilade to distract the fugitive they have waste enough lead to fight a battle he hear one of the man say scornfully well that be what lead 's for a philosopher remark stir the ember so it do not get under my skin i do not care a cuss what they do with it oh you skin 's safe enough ned you may adorn a gallows yet if i do you 'll be at one end of the string -- and i be not a-saying which end neither the other retorted take a square segment of what look like bark but be really tobacco and worry out a circle with he tooth until he have detach a large mouthful this afford he jaw all the present occupation they seem capable of undertake the other resume when the haw-haw that meet the sally have subside : yes it take two to make a hangin ' just like it take two to make a weddin ' and you can not allus say just sartin which one have the lucky end this facetious epigram be duly relish and the sage be turn he toast side from the fire to present the other when the clatter of a horse come up the hillside send the group scour toward they gun stack near the unfinished wall sergeant bland the captain order you to take four man and station they along the north shore of the pond the rascal be in the cypress swamp and be make they way out toward moccasin creek one man can watch the block-house and the rest come with I -- guard we shall be within a hundred yard of you a shot will bring a dozen man to you assistance but it be not likely a enemy can reach this point the whole regiment be deploy in the wood this be say to the sentry as the group detail for moccasin creek file off at a double-quick down the hill in a few moment the blockhouse be desert save by the sentry who have now rise and be vigorously pacing before the doorway now be jack 's time if ever if he could only whisper to one of the prisoner to call the sentry but how he have nothing to fear in approach the rear and in a few moment he have examine the wall there be no opening where he could get speech with those inside what could he do to boldly fall upon the sentry be risky for the slightest noise would bring rescue from the front of the bluff at the base of the wall where the log-joist rest upon a huge bowlder he quick eye detect a air-hole he examine it hurriedly it be evidently below the flooring so much the better put he mouth to this he call out in a piteous tone : for god 's sake sentry give I some water i be choke -- oh -- oh water water he wait to see if the sentry would heed the call he know that the man inside could not betray he for if they be not asleep they could not be sure that the voice be not from among themselves sure enough the sentry 's step cease be he near the door jack creep to the corner yes he have halt at the aperture would he enter jack step back to he post as the guard call out : where be you which of you want water sing out here jack cry here then dart back to the corner he be just in time to see the man lean he gun against the door-post and disappear in the hut in a instant the gun be in jack 's possession and he be behind the samaritan in quest of the suffering victim it be dark as a tunnel jack 's victim still give he the aid he need for as he grope along the wall he say good-humoredly : sing out again my friend i have not get cat 's eye jack 's grasp be on he throat and jack 's mouth be at he ear one sound one word and this knife go to the hilt in you heart the astounded man half reel at this awful apparition in the black darkness and he limply yield to he captor under the impression that the prisoner be loose and upon he jack tie the man 's unresisting hand with he own canteen-strap then seat he near the wall and light a match four man undisturbed by this swift and noiseless coup be stretch on the board floor breathe the heavy deep sleep of exhaustion jack arouse they with the greatest difficulty and find it still harder to make they understand that with courage and resolution they would be back in they own line by daylight when this become clear to they they be as eager and energetic as they rescuer the man be to remain near the blockhouse but not in it until jack return for the negro and then under the lad 's guidance they could find they way to the union outpost just as this be decide a blood-curdling baying of bloodhound echo across the pond from the distant cabin jack tremble he mind at once on dick so near and yet so far from he now in this new danger there be not a moment to be lose perhaps even now all the night 's hard-won victory be to be turn to worse than defeat -- prison death for the liberation of slave be at that time punishable by hang in the rebel military code courage he say to himself grimly courage a dog 's no worse than a man we have overcome they to-night we ought to be able to tackle the dog this new danger change he plan slightly instead of leave all the man he take one of the rescue four tom denby by name with he and set out for the water but here another check meet he he suddenly recall that the guard at the blockhouse have be scatter along the shore to watch the debouch from the swamp this enforce a wide _ détour _ bring he out in the rear of the boat and nearer the point where moccasin creek empty into the pond they reach it finally and skirt along the shore keep a keen eye on the water for the boat they have skurry along half-way back toward the bluff listen for a sound on the water and peer into the black surface when denby suddenly touch jack 's arm there be a horse or cow standing in the water yonder i have see it move there look yes outline against the low horizon a monstrous shape could be plainly see the yelp of the hound suddenly break through the air back of they toward the creek the monstrous figure start move heavily forward then seem as if come toward they both wait wonder curious terrify it be within a rod of they staggering gasp oh god help we i can go no farther better be take than both drown together jack could hardly repress a cry : jone -- dick be it you but whoever it be or whatever it be have no speech to answer this eager inquiry they would have sink in the shallow water if jack and denby have not catch they jack have food with he and better than all the bottle of sorghum whisky with this restorative both be soon able to sit upon the ground and eat jack leave denby to feed they while he go in search of the boat he find it just where he have leave it and in a few minute at the head of he little band he be back at the blockhouse the food and jack 's hastily tell news have restore dick to something like he old friskiness jericho he cry as the release prisoner have hold back warily until the color of the new-comer be know run forward the whole army be here i feel as if i be in the union line well you be not by a long shot denby cry we have get a good hour 's march and if you be wise captain sprague you will not waste time for any frill no time shall be waste -- jone you and dick take the rear i with denby will skirmish and you corporal kane shall command the center no firing remember unless superior force assail we -- gabe stick to the waterside as closely as you can but make the shortest cut to the bridge gabe be the most delighted darkey in all virginium for the next hour he lead they swiftly and surely and why should not he he have pass all he life in the vicinity and with the first beam of the sun he point to a narrow wooden bridge dar 's whar de picket fire across as they pass the bridge a loud sound of rush horse could be hear in the distance dick you take two man and hurry down the road to assure we picket that we be friend we 'll take up the plank to give they time jack shout and dick with two of the rescue prisoner dash away many hand and high hope make short work of the light timber as the pursue cavalry turn the bend in the road in sight of the bridge jack 's squad give they a volley and then dash into cover the fire be return dick come back at a run with a dozen dismount man hear the bullet whistle over he head and see jack 's _ posse _ disperse to the right and leave in the bush all be force into the wood as the rebel command the highway where be jack dick ask rush among the man no one have notice he in the panic he be not in the huddle that cower in the reed to escape the ball still hurtle viciously over the open with a cry of rage and despair dick fly into the road and there not a hundred yard from the bridge he see the well-known figure prone on the red earth motionless -- dead heedless of the warning cry of the other dick tear madly to the body and with a wild cry fall upon the lifeless figure weltering in blood chapter xxvii the absent be always in the wrong under vincent 's ardent escort mr sprague and merry travel from richmond northward in something like haste and with as much comfort as be possible to the limited means of transportation at the command of the confederate commissary even in those early day of the war the railway system of the south be wear out and inadequate such a luxury as a parlor car be unknown the train be fill with military personage on they way to the field mr sprague and merry be the only woman in the car in which they pass from richmond to fredericksburg the route bring they through a land cover with hamlet of camp drill squadron and the panoply of war while the elder lady give a divide mind to the strange panorama merry watch everything eagerly amuse and interested by this spectacle of preparation such soldier as she could see distinctly look like farmer in holiday homespun the cavalry like nondescript company of backwoods hunter there seem to be no uniformity in infantry equipment or cavalry accoutrements and the discipline strike she as in keep with this diversity of dress and ornament the man could be see hurry in boyish glee toward the train as it draw near the temporary station where mail-bag be throw out and sometimes supplies of food or munitions of war jocular remark be pass between the soldiery at the window when the wistful group gather along the railway line i say north cal ` ina you 'n' s goin ' straight through to yankee land a man in the throng shout to some one on the train straight send we a lock o ' lincoln 's hair to poison blind adder will you no -- promise he scalp to my sweetheart to cover the rocking-chair then as the laugh that meet this sally die away another humorist pipe out : tell uncle joe johnston we be just rustin ' down here for a fight ef he do not hurry up we 'll go ahead ourselves we be drill down so fine now that we can not think ` cept by the rule o ' tactic jest you never mind boy uncle joe 'll do enough thinkin ' fur ye when he get ready to tackle the yank hurrah for uncle joe and as the cheery cry swell farther and farther the train draw out everybody look from the window as the patient soldiery straggle back campward you soldier seem very gay vincent one would think that war the dreadful uncertainty of they movement absence of friend and lack of good food would sadden they mr sprague say wistfully at one of the station when raillery like this have be even more pointed and boisterous a wise commander will do all he can to keep he man gay if they be not jovial they would go mad think of it day after day week after week who know but year after year the wearisome monotony of camp and march where the man be educate or at least reader they make better soldier because they brood less brooding sap the best fiber of the army you northern man ought to have a advantage there for education be more general with you than it be with we it be not bravery that make a man eager for the campaign it be unrest as a rule the best soldier in action be those who have a mortal dread of battle that surprise I it be true i always distrust man that clamor to be lead on they be the first to break when the brush come jack will tell you that for we be agree on it jack himself be eager for battle mr sprague say sigh no jack be eager for the field when the battle come he meet it coolly but he have no hunger for it nor have i general johnston be as brave a man as ever head a army yet he have often tell we that he blood freeze when the gun open i be sure no one would ever suspect it for he be as calm and confident as if he be in a quadrille when he ride to the field we in the north have hear more of beauregard than johnston yet i never hear you mention he be not it he who command at bull run yes and no general beauregard be a superb soldier he be it have be agree among we better for a desperate charge or some sudden inspiration in a emergency than the complicated strategy that half win a battle before it be begin for example at manassa he would have be defeat we whole army capture if fortune have not expose general mcdowell 's plan before they be complete as it be we should have be drive from the field if general johnston have not come up in time and rearrange the confederate lily yes jack have describe that battle after all be decide by luck and genius luck win waterloo partly but genius too for wellington and blücher practice one of napoleon 's most perfect maxim and win because he despise they both so much that he do not dream they capable of even imitate he nor leave to themselves would they have be equal to it but renegade frenchman teach under napoleon 's eye prompt they general johnston be very considerate to we when we come down i wish you would make he know how grateful we be oh he could not be anything else he be the ideal of a chivalrous knight yes i believe you claim chivalry as you strong point in the south and accuse we of be a race of sordid money-getter i do not for i know better but we people do they will learn better in time man who fight as you army fight at manassa must be more than mere sordid huckster and yet it be curious mr sprague continue musingly it be we who be war for a idea and you be war for property how do you mean vincent say quickly you be fight to continue slavery to extend it we to abolish it or limit it but even i can see that slavery be doom no northern party would ever venture to give it toleration after this but if we succeed it will exist in we union at least ah vincent can not you see that such a people as ours may be check beat even but they will never give up the union why much as i love jack i would never let he leave the color while there be a army in the field do not you know every northern mother have the same feeling and every southern mother too yes i believe that but there be this difference : you southern mother be count on what do not exist -- a higher physical courage -- a prowess in battle i may call it that you must know the southern soldier have not as distinguish from the northern as time go on and the war do not end as we army become discipline the confidence that support you side will die and then the struggle though it may be prolong will end in we triumph i do not think it i can not think it but do not let we talk about it we at least be as much friend as though jack and i be under one flag and if it depend on I it shall be always so if it depend on we it shall never be otherwise she give the young man a kind scrutinize glance which make he heart beat joyously and he handsome cheek mount color at fairfax court-house they say farewell the lady continue the journey in a ambulance under federal guard they pass over the long bridge three day after the famous night at rosedale of whose exciting sequel they be profoundly ignorant in she husband 's time mr sprague have live in hotel in the capital as the session be short she have never remain in the city when the warm weather set in no matter how long the term last but on she arrival at the old hotel now she be a good deal disturb to learn that she could not be accommodate in she former quarter the military crowded not only this but every hotel in the city and it be only after long search that a habitable apartment be find in georgetown on the whole the necessity that drive she thither be not a unmitigated adversity for georgetown then be far more desirable for residence than washington nothing could be more depressing than the city at that epoch every visible object in the vast circumference of its spreading limit be then naked unkempt even the tree that range themselves irregularly in the straggle square and wide street area stretch out a draggled and piebald plumage as if uncertain whether beauty or ugliness be they function in the _ ensemble _ the photographic realism of the later newspaper correspondent have not come into play in these earlier year of the war and as a consequence the thousand who pour down to the army of the potomac behold the city with something of the incredulous scorn with which the effeminate byzantine regard the capital of the goth when the corrupt descendant of constantine make the savage dacian he ally rather than fight they patriotism however not pride mark the common mold of the man of the civil war it may have be that many a honest plowman march through the muddy quagmire of pennsylvanium avenue bethought himself that such a capital be hardly worth while march so far to protect -- more emphatically so when the enemy be really to be find on line far north of it sentiment be the heart and soul of war if it be not there would be no war for war never gain as much as it lose never settle as much as it unsettle never leave victor or vanquish better when the last gun be fire in old time the capture of a nation 's capital mean the end of the war but we have see capital capture and the war not modify a bit by it washington be seize and burn by the british in 1814 and the war go on pari be hold by the german for half a year and the war go on we civil war would have be three campaign shorter -- burnside 's hooker 's and the stupid massacre of pope -- to say nothing of the saving of untold treasure have the political authority abandon a capital which must be defend for a secure seat like new york or philadelphium the sagacious lincoln whose action in army matter be paralyze by clique in the end see through sham with a inspired clarity of vision and propose the measure but the backwoods mazarin seward prepare such voluminous consideration in opposition that the good-natured president withdraw he suggestion and as a consequence the dismal ilium on the potomac become the bone of a four year ' contention whose vicissitude exceed the incident of the iliad great army create by a inspired commander be waste upon the defense of a capital that no one would have lament have it be again burn and of which to-day there be scarcely a remnant save in the public building and the topographical chart a new race enter the sleepy city the astute far-seeing yankee divine the possibility of the future where the indolent sentimental southerner have never take thought of a nation 's growth and a people 's pride the thrifty and shifty patriot send from the north at once take a stake in the city and thenceforward there be growth if not grace in the capital lincoln 's washington be to the capital of to-day what the rome of numa be to the imperial city of augustus never in its best day more impose than a wild western metropolis of to-day the sudden inrush of army and the wherewithal to supply and house they soon give the vast space lay out for the capital the uncouthness and incompleteness of a exaggerated mining town or series of town contrast even with its rival on the jame washington be raw chaotic squalid long tenure of estate and little change in the people have give richmond the venerableness we associate with age many of she picturesque seven hill be transform into bloom field or umbrageous grove under which vast villa-like edifice cluster in grecian repose save in the bustling main street none of the edifice be new or raw or wholly unlovely in design or fabric in washington nothing of this could be see stare brick wall building of unequal height and fatiguingly ugly design uprose here and there in morass of mud that be mean for street disproportionate outline sharp conjuncture of affluence and squalor accent the disheartening hideousness of the scene but upon this uncouth stage a great drama be go on great figure be in action momentous event be hourly take form and consequence man and woman at they best and worst be work out the awful end of fate in the large mansion yonder the wisest greatest simplest of mankind -- by time diogene and cromwell lafayette and robespierre be in jest and joke mirth and sadness work out he own and a people 's sublime destiny it be to this curiously unequal personage that mr sprague after fruitless plead with she husband 's friend come finally to secure action on behalf of she son there be little of the ceremonial need to gain access to the chief magistrate which be now the fashion she find a care-worn man deeply harass standing in the low-ceiled room in which the cabinet have meet a few moment before a sweet wan smile -- the instinctive inborn sensitiveness of a noble nature-flickered over the rugged line of the face as the usher retire say : mr president this be mrs sprague whom you order to be admit i be both glad and sorry to meet you madam i know you husband the senator in other and happier time i wish that it be in my power to do for he or he what he be always do for the unhappy or distressed ah how kind you be how -- she be go to say different from what she expect but bethought herself of the ungraciousness of this form since at that time mr lincoln be the object of almost universal misreport and caricature how can i say what a mother should say while she speak he begin pacing the apartment each time as he come to the double window near which she sit peer out with a yearning far-away look toward the river and the red line of the hill beyond it then turn back he stride the length of the long baize-covered table sometimes absently pick up a document until face she again as she narrate the story of jack 's misfortune he would fling it hastily on the scatter heap and fix he mild eye upon she i know all this already dear madam it have come to I from the boy 's friend and -- he hesitate a second -- and from he -- or from those who be not he friend not he

well-arranged plan to capture the rebel chief davi not only this but he endanger the escape of a number of sorely-worn prisoner who have succeed in reach the rosedale place and halt only to make davi 's capture certain my son shot wesley oh no no it can not be or if he do it be because he own life be in peril ah no no mr president do not believe this i know my son i know the misery he endure in wesley 's company endure like a hero endure like a sprague he must have be in peril of he life dear madam i feel for you i feel with you but these fact be all in the possession of the secretary of war mr boone will no doubt give you all the detail if it can be make to seem as you say have no fear that i will wink at mere revenge or make the machinery of justice a instrument of family feud get you lawyer have the matter investigate and rely upon I for every proper clemency and aid in you hard lot she have arise long before and recognize this as a dismissal she bow unable to speak and with blinded eye stagger toward the two step lead upward from the room she would have fall have the ready arm of the president not be near to support she in the anteroom he say huskily : captain send a orderly to accompany this lady to she carriage merry be in the carriage one glance at mr sprague 's face tell that dire news have be hear she do not ask a question but embrace and support the sob mother await patiently for the dreaded revelation when at length the miserable story come in gasping and sob the spinster exhibit a unexpected firmness i do not believe a word of it if jack shot wesley it be because he be in some sort of treacherous business you may depend upon it that when we get the true story jack 's part will prove he in the right i be go this instant to boone to learn he source of information he can have nothing but rumor i will go it be better for I to see mr boone he will not venture to misrepresent to I at willard where boone be stop the lady be oblige to wait a long time and in the end it be kate who appear before they in deep black with a half-yearning half-defiant expression in the sadly worn face they would never have recognize she and as it be merry start with a slight scream as the dark figure stop before they papa beg to be excuse he suppose that you want to hear the particulars of the -- the affair at rosedale and bid I tell you o kate kate it be not true it can not be true oh you who know jack so well you know that he never could have -- have -- kate have seize a chair and draw it before the two who sit on one of the long sofa that fill without adorn the vast hotel parlor dim even at noonday in its semi-subterranean light yes mr sprague you son shot wesley deliberately shoot he as deliberately as if i should draw a pistol and take you life now and here and -- and kill he he never speak again he -- he -- ah i can not i can not we bring he here he body be in the cemetery wait the military formality but tell we how it happen kate merry sob entreatingly we know nothing but what you have tell we tell we all it be so startling so awful that we can not comprehend such a thing happen where we leave everybody in the most friendly spirit kate struggle with she tear tell the story so far as she know it but of course she know little beyond the mere fact that wesley have come to he death in mr atterbury 's room that jack stand over he with the smoking pistol and own that he have fire in the darkness she tell the tale as gently as might be she own heart secretly plead for everything of extenuation that might lessen jack 's guilt but she have insensibly take the darker view she father have instantly adopt that jack 's enmity have lead he to seize the chance to rid himself of a rival and enemy under cover of defend the atterbury she do not hint this to the mother but merry know boone at once see what the president 's word mean boone have charge jack with deliberate murder dread the realization of this by mr sprague at this time merry make a sign to kate who comprehend at once arise and beg to go back to she father who be in need of she oh if olympium be here she have so much self-control she would advise so well what should he do the mother moan as she pass down through the long barrack-like parlor but dear mr sprague olympium be just where she good sense be most need she be near jack he need comfort and counsel you can have you lawyer and you shall see the case be not so bad as we have hear you must remember that the boone be not likely to take a impartial view it be only human nature that they should think the worst of the -- the death of son and brother wait till we hear jack 's story and you will see that it put a different face on the matter but it be jack 's disgrace and death they want that be what the president mean i do not understand it then : i do understand it now they shall not murder he i shall command he to remain in richmond i shall command he to join vincent the north be unworthy of such man as my son he be too pure too innocent too high-minded to be understand by the coarse nature that have come to power in the country i shall not let this odious boone destroy he as he ruin you brother o mr sprague think what you be say think how fatal such word would be if jack be bring to trial you see every day in the press how all be suspect of treason who be democrat in the old day i know very well that you do not mean this much as i love jack i would rather see he in he grave with the union flag over he than in the rebel line a soldier of that bad cause as to my poor brother boone be only a accident in he ruin if it have not be boone it would have be some one else put the whole matter in the hand of simon brodie he be almost a sprague he will see that the son of he old patron have justice simon brodie of warchester be the chief advocate of the three county he have study law with the late senator sprague and at he death from partner succeed to he lucrative law practice he come at once to washington at mr sprague 's summons and set about learn the status of the case the affair be no easy matter to trace but after inconceivable delay and persistent misleading he find that jack be in the military archive charge with desertion murder and treason : desertion in quit he company and regiment without order treason in consort with armed rebel and murder in join with the enemy of the country to take the life of he command officer meanwhile mr sprague and merry have return to acredale and the lawyer send letter to richmond setting forth the case to jack -- letter which by some mysterious jugglery never reach they address as we have see nothing could be do until jack be either exchange or until he advocate have make out a documentary case that could be present to the military authority as he surmise every one in authority have be prejudice against jack the congressman from warchester dare not work against boone who be potent as a cabinet minister in the council of the government one of senator sprague 's old friend still in the senate advise brodie to let jack remain at richmond till the peace come for say he no democrat nor any one identify with that party can hope for impartial justice here but what be i to do i can get no assistance here every bureau contain document bear on the poor boy 's case be either close to I or the official so hostile that i can not work with or through they you must go about the affair as if it be a state matter you must go to mcclellan he be a young man of the most spotless honor the most generous sympathy he be as rigid as a prussian in discipline but he method be enlighten and above board he be the only man in authority that have any real conception of the magnitude of the struggle the north have enter upon he be however miserably hamper the new ruler have come down to washington very much in the spirit of the goth when they capture rome every one be on the make the contract system be something beyond the wildest excess i ever read of in pillage and chicanery shoe by the million have be accept that melt as soon as they be wet garment be stack mountain-high in the storehouse that blow into rag so soon as the air go through they food moldy filthy be accumulate on the wharf of washington baltimore and alexandrium that would be forbid as infectious in any carefully guard port in the world contract for vessel have be sign where steamship be call for and the contractor send canal-boat line of ship be pay for to run to port not know in navigation and the chief man in the great department share the money with the ring -- but why do not you expose it expose it a word in the senate against these villainy be set down as disloyalty all that a rascal need to gain any scope he please be to say ` rebel sympathizer ' and fort warren or lafayette be hold up as a menace among the confidential aide of mcclellan brodie know intimately a young officer the son of a distinguished lady whose writings delighted cultivate people fifty year ago this young man captain churchland have often be a guest at the sprague and to he brodie go for advice inherit a great deal of he mother 's intellect with a droll sense of humor not then so well understand as the lighter school of writer have since make it churchland be the delight of the headquarters he listen to the melancholy story of jack 's compromise plight it be a bad fix -- no mistake he say gravely but i suggest that you fiery young friend come home and shoot the father marry the daughter and as a wife can not testify against the husband you client be secure ah captain it be not a matter for joke think of he wretched mother that be just what i do think of -- murder 's no joke though it be more of a fine art than it be when de quincey write i be perfectly serious i would shoot the scoundrel boone why do you know the man have clear a million dollar on rotten blanket since he come here mcclellan order a report make out show he rascality a few week ago it be disapprove at the war office and the condemn blanket have go to halleck 's army do not that deserve shooting napoleon direct all the army contractor to be hang i say shoot they for every one put out of the way a thousand soldier ' life will be save well well let boone go it be sprague i be interested in so be i it be sprague that boone seem to be interested in too for he have fill the new secretary with what he himself would call righteous wrath against the poor boy and he friend but make you mind easy the exchange of prisoner will soon begin sprague 's turn will come among the first and then i will keep track of the affair beyond that i can promise nothing you may be sure so far as purely military man have to do with the business there will be impartial justice when the politician take hold i can give no assurance and with this cold comfort the disheartened lawyer betook himself to acredale where he report guardedly give bring no very strong hope to the anxious mother chapter xxviii the world go very ill then acredale be not the sleepy sylvan scene we first see it when mr sprague and merry drive through the wide main street from the station four month after they have quit it in search of they soldier boy the stately elm still arch the highway to warchester but here and there rough gap be see in the trim hedge-row stare new edifice jut through these break upon the grassy walk and building material lay heap in confusion all along the graveled walk merry rail at these evidence of commercial invasion wonder who have come to the village to transform it into city hideousness mr sprague do not give much heed to she companion 's speculation she mind be far away on the jame wonder where she boy be it be very hard to settle down to the commonplace of home life but even in all she distraction mr sprague saw that a change have come upon the people as well as the place with the war and its desolating sight fresh in she memory she see with sorrow and aversion that social life be gayer than it have ever be that the rush for wealth have become a fever and that the simple way and homely joy of the past be now remit to the very elderly the story of dick 's mad pursuit of jack and the caribee after the disaster at bull run be soon know in every home in the county friend come from far and near to hear the exciting adventure and the younger boy who have be the lad 's classmate in the academy at once make up a company of youngster adorn by the name of the perley ranger to be in readiness for the hero 's command when he should return the feud between the adherent of the house of sprague and boone have become acrimoniously embittered by the point of view from which each side see the conduct of jack among the boone feudatory he be set down as a traitor a spy a murderer the first malignant rumor that reach the village after the battle be still maintain stoutly by the boone lictor jack have ingloriously shirk he part in the battle with the caribee he have skulk in the bush until the issue be decide and then have follow the sympathy of he secession family he have go to the atterbury well know for they hatred to the north it be to prove he sincerity in the southern cause that he have worm himself into the confidence of wesley boone 's comrade and in order that he might be chief agent in the frustration of the plan of escape he have win high regard in the confederacy by save davi from capture he have with he own hand shot wesley boone when the plan of capture be on the verge of success could anything be clearer than he odious treason have not he of all the unfortunate of the battle find favor and luxurious quarter in richmond have not he cunningly cajole the boone into the visit to the rebel household in order to wrest the secret of the union rescue from they it be in vain that the perley and other set forth the real case very likely indeed the boone side cry that rebel like the atterbury would receive true unionist into they house and treat they as friend a real unionist would have refuse hospitality from the enemy of he country there be talk among the more zealous patriot of have the sprague family expel from acredale loyal zealot look up the law on expatriation and attainder and complain bitterly that no applicable provision be find in the statute stir address be send to the member from warchester implore he to have law enact that would enable the patriot to deal summarily with covert treason it be true that the sprague have contribute many thousand dollar toward the equipment of the caribee have endow twenty bed in one of the city hospital for the wound -- but this be when jack expect high command in the regiment fail in that ignoble self-seeking he have go where he heart be while the family to retain they property remain among the loyal to insult they woe and gloat over they misfortune at a great war meeting in the town-hall over which boone preside one thrilling orator hint that fire if not the law could relieve a loyal community of the copperhead 's nest it be a insult as well as a menace to have the patrician palace of disloyalty flaunt its grandeur among a people loyal and devoted whose son and brother be battle for the union every rebel sympathizer drive from the north would strengthen the union cause ash and salt sow on the ground they insolent home have desecrate would be a holy reminder to the loyal a warn to the secret foe of the union there be loud expression of approval and a solemn aman to this intrepid plan of campaign lawyer brodie who be present arise under a thunder of discordant note -- copperhead traitor dough-face we do not want to hear from rebel sympathizer out with he and other more opprobrious taunt now brodie be boone 's counsel and have be identify with he in some very difficult litigation it would not do to have he discredit the chairman rap loudly for order i can vouch my friend for mr brodie 's patriotism he be a democrat it be true but he love the union i know that to be a fact you can do the union no better service than listen to what he have to say brodie who have hold he place calmly smile as boone sit down and survey the audience from side to side begin : free speech be one of the cry that arouse the north in the late campaign i believe in free speech i have do my share toward secure it but i never be refuse it before i look among the man here and see among you neighbor whom i have know since boyhood neighbor who have know I since boyhood and when i arise here to take a citizen 's part in a meeting call to aid and comfort the cause of the union i be permit to speak only by the personal request of one man if that be you idea of free speech if that be you notion of aid the union cause and strengthen the hand of the administration i do not need to be in the confidence of the rebel authority to tell you that they could ask no more powerful ally than you -lrb- sensation -rrb- there be three hundred man in this hall the light be good and my eyesight be not impaired but i can not see a man among you who be not a democrat a year or two ago there be not fifty man among you that vote for abraham lincoln -lrb- murmur -rrb- be the two hundred and fifty then traitor be they rebel sympathizer be they copperhead one thousand man march under the caribee flag not a man of they vote for lincoln be they copperhead this township by its vote at the last election be five to one democratic be this a copperhead community nearly a half million dollar have be subscribe for bounty and war measure the tax-payer almost to a man be democrat be it possible then that the copperhead be supply the money to carry on the war you propose to burn the mansion of my old partner senator sprague why because he estate have give more to the union cause than any other family in the township the son have go over to the rebel a voice cry thank you there -- i be glad you have give I the chance to crush that cowardly calumny -- the invention of some envious malefactor jack sprague have go over to the rebel just as anderson and he man go over at sumter just as fifteen hundred of he comrade go over at bull run just as some of we son and brother here in acredale go over just as my friend boone 's son go over -- because he be surround and wound stop a moment if you please friend brodie i protest against you make anything in common between my son and this young man the matter be to be investigate and then we can tell better boone speak in great excitement and the audience now feverishly work up urge the lawyer to say he say out he continue in the trained impassive tone of the advocate : every one in this room know the two young man it would be waste of time for I to strive to make anything in common between john sprague and wesley boone here where they both grow up that be quite unnecessary i -- i -- refer to they conduct as soldier boone cry hoarsely my son lose he life in the service of he country i can not have he name couple with a -- murderer 's -- with a traitor 's ah my friend when hate draw you portrait it be bind to be black when prejudice hold the pen you virtue stand in the shade of vice i will tell john sprague 's story from the day he quit acredale to the unhappy hour he comrade be kill in the dark in the sleeping-room of the mother and daughter who have nurse he from the very jaw of death he be in that house by he father 's urgent request though it would have need none to open its door to any one in want of succor nor he add significantly can it be tell who kill wesley boone until all the shot fire in mr atterbury 's chamber be account for then he narrate rapidly but tellingly the substance of what have be already set down in this history -- the fact take from jack 's letter and attest by the corroboration of barney dick and the company 's officer there be a visible revulsion in the larger part of the audience as the tale go on and when the lawyer wind up with the story of mr sprague 's baffled effort in washington to have she boy bring north there be a outburst of applause and a faint cheer from the younger man for glorious old jack the faction shift a good deal after this official rendering of the affair there be no longer any talk of burn the sprague property and opinion be about evenly divide as to jack 's conduct December have come and the township be busy packing box to send to the army no news have come north from richmond active movement be look for every day and in the momentous expectation such lesser incident as exchange be forget or ignore the daily journal be fill with detail of contemplated expedition and one morning mr sprague read with beat heart this paragraph in the _ herald _ : a score or more of the man who escape from the richmond prison a few week ago arrive at washington to-day from fort monroe the party endure untold privation in the swamp between williamsburg and we line on the warwick but all come in safely except two man who die from the result of they wound the expedition be plan and carry out by a agent of general butler who have be in virginium since the unfortunate attempt to rescue captain boone of the ` caribee ' regiment at the moment the party reach the union outpost one of the most daring of the union man sergeant jacque of the caribee be it be think

escape man some of they must have see jack if there be caribee among they you may be sure they have message from we boy i think i shall set out for washington or ask mr brodie to go that be better mr brodie can get at the man and you could not i shall be in a fever until we have hear from they brodie agree with the lady when later they discuss the matter with he and that evening he set out for washington mrs sprague at the tea-table with merry who make it a point to give the lonely mother as much of she time as she could spare be still ponder the paragraph when the sound of carriage-wheel come in through the closed curtain then the front door open without knock and there be a rustle in the hallway and then with a simultaneous scream three agitate female to wit mr sprague merry and olympium in a confused mass o my child my child mamma dearest dearest olympium merry splutter wildly embrace both oh how delightful to be here to see you mamma as peaceful and serene as in the old day i think i should never get home i leave richmond three week ago i be hold at fredericksburg for ten day then i have to turn back when we get to manassa through some red tape lack there but here i be

the journal on she knee she mind be in a whirl in richmond the escape have be announce then the news that the party have be surround in the swamp then day by day detail of the taking of straggle negro and one or two soldier but no name that even resemble jack 's the atterbury after the first painful sensation have give they approval of jack 's go and use all means in they power to get such fact as would comfort olympium they assure she that jack have reach the union line and then she have set out northward expect to find he at home or in communication with he family no word from dick no word from jack they be dead and she -- she have urge they to the mad adventure she have give jack no peace have fire dick to the fatal enterprise she dare not look in the tearless eye of she mother she dare not face the ghastly question in merry 's meek eye brodie have go down to see the escape man perhaps he would discover something this be the small comfort leave the three when near midnight they end the woful conference the next day olympium be visit by a representative of the _ crossbow _ the chief journal of warchester and urge to write a narrative of she adventure in the rebel capital until she friend make she see how much effect it would have in clear jack 's reputation she shrink from the publicity but with that end in view -- jack 's honor -- she write and write with strength and clearness the move incident of she brother 's capture captivity and escape -- or he bold effort to escape this she tell so simply so directly so vividly that the truth of it at once strike the most prejudiced reader who have no cause to continue in he prepossession after the publication in the warchester paper score who have side with the boone faction either call or write to confess they error even the acredale _ monitor _ a weekly sheet notoriously in the interest of boone feel constrain to copy part of the account and publish with it a shambling retraction of previous criticism base on imperfect knowledge that it have print concern sergeant sprague death it declare have obliterate all feeling that exist against we young townsman whose conduct though open to grievous doubt in the early part of he military career have be amply atone for in the intrepid enterprise in which he seem to have lose he life chapter xxix a woman 's reason the still small voice that make itself a force in the heart which the poet call we mentor and the moralist conscience have be painfully garrulous in kate boone 's breast since the angry parting with jack at rosedale at first in the wild grief of wesley 's death she have hug hatred of jack to she heart as a sublime revenge for the murder but with the hot partisanship allay in the long week of reflection precede the rumor of jack 's own death she begin dimly to admit of palliation in she lover 's fatal act she father the boone faction all who have access to she hold the shooting to be a craftily plan murder calculate to bring advantage to the assassin to check the sacrilegious love she feel in she heart she too have be force to believe to admit the worst but when the image of jack come to she mind as it do day and night it be as the gay frank chivalrous hotspur as unlike a murderer as golgotha to hesperide she have never dare to confide to she father that vow have be exchange between they -- that they be in fact affianced lover he never suspect talk with she day after day of the signal vengeance in store for the miscreant how he have enlist the aid of the most powerful in washington how he have instruct the emissary send to richmond to effect wesley 's release to direct all they energy to entrap the murderer into the rank of the escape prisoner she have often be startle by she father 's far-seeing malignantly plan vengeance and now that the rumor of jack 's death begin to settle into belief she be appal by a sudden sense of complicity in a murderous plot not that she believe she father capable of murder or its procuration but know he potency with the authority she see that there be many way in which jack might be sacrifice in the natural course of military duty she have hear thing of the sort discuss -- how inconvenient man have be send into pitfall and never hear of again she begin dimly to see that at worst jack 's act be not the calculate murder she father hold it to be in she own tortured mind there have be at first but one clear process of reasoning that process whenever she begin to gather the shred have lead she mind straight to the conviction that jack 's shot have be premeditate that the chance have be prearrange with the enemy of she brother at first she only distinct thought be that the hapless wesley have be lure to he death the hand of the man she love have send the fatal shot into the poor boy 's body have it be in self-defense -- even in the heat of uncontrollable anger -- she could have find mitigation for jack but there be neither the justification of self-defense nor the plausible pretext of anger one word of warning which jack could have speak would have save wesley from the rash the dastardly attempt upon the rosedale household the plot in all its detail must have be know to jack or dick else how explain they presence in the chamber armed and ready for the murder it have be a conspiracy of delusive kindness from the day wesley enter rosedale the frankness and kindliness of the atterbury have be assume to lure he to he fatal adventure boone himself believe that jack 's ignoble ambition and envy have be the main motive in the murder to this kate from the first oppose a resolute incredulity you do not know the fellow i tell you boone doggedly argue he be as like he father as two snake in a hole old man sprague never let a man stand in he way jack 's the same he think we ' keep he from the shoulder-strap and he get he out of the way be not he always snoop ` round in the regiment try to undermine you brother be not he always try to be popular ah i know the sprague but i 'll give they a wrench that 'll twist they damned pride out of they i 'll have that cold-blooded young villain shot in a hollow square and i 'll have it do in this very district that the whole county may know the disgrace of the high and mighty sprague no father kate have hear all this before but she for the first time resolve upon set she father right no jack have not a particle of the feeling you ascribe to he i do not think he like poor wesley they be totally unlike in nature and i think that jack feel deeply that he have be wrong by wesley 's appointment but it be not in he nature to seek revenge he would have fight wesley openly but he would never be one of a gang of murderer i think i can see how jack be lead into the part he play it do not lessen the guilt but it relieve he of the odious suspicion i first feel then boone in irritable impatience remind she of she own earlier utterance how from he first come wesley have be treat with study distrust how he have be deny the boyish intimacy that exist between jack and dick how he be insensibly make to feel that he be in the house under a different cartel from that of jack and dick that he be a prisoner on parole and he word be doubt nothing could make he believe he declare get up moodily but that the whole lot of they have set out to drive wesley into a corner and then kill he as they have do kate sigh wearily as she father leave the room if she could only be as well assure as she strong word imply ah if she could fetch back she lover by get at the truth how willingly she would fly to rosedale and learn all but she dare not question lest question should confirm where she now at least have the miserable solace of doubt could it be true could jack be the base schemer she father depict he then she mind run back to rosedale she live again all the enchanting day of that earthly paradise she see wesley 's furtive start he strange disappearance he grow melancholy he moody reticence when she question he ah if he have but confide to she if she have but dream of the desperate purpose bear of the loneliness he live in if jack have be loyal to he loyal to she wesley would have be warn that eager eye be upon he ready wit read he purpose and revengeful hatred ready to slaughter he when the news come that jack have lose he life in the very enterprise wesley have contemplate kate collapse under the shock now when it be too late she convince herself that he be innocent if she could have recall he to life she cry in self-reproach she would not ask whether he be all she first impulse have paint he she have bear up with something like composure when wesley 's death come upon she but now tortured by a sense of responsibility in jack 's fate she give way to the grief she have so long repress if she have not upbraid he if she have not accuse he in so many word of murder he would never have embark on the mad plot of escape she have drive he to he death she have sit silent while acredale ring with calumny against he it be not too late yet to make reparation she would proclaim publicly that she brother have rashly court he own death that jack have unknowingly shoot he down as many a man do in battle shoot he best friend she resolve on the instant to go to the stricken family and make such expiation there as be in she power but be there any certainty that the report of jack 's death be true grievous mistake of the same sort have be make repeatedly in the public journal she be not able to formulate any plan at first she father be more morose than ever he seem in he way to deplore the young man 's death but not in pity as she soon learn death have rob he of a cruelly meditate revenge she wisely make no comment when this brutal feeling betray itself but for the first time in she life the girl shudder at the sight of she father the vague rumor of year that have be whisper about he -- rumor which of old have fire she soul with hot indignation come back insidiously she shudder be she to lose all -- brother lover father -- in this unnatural strife she have be so loyal to she father she have be so proud of he when other revile she have feel so serenely confident of the nobleness of he heart the generosity of he impulse she have always be able to mold he as she think could it be possible that he be human to she inhuman to the rest of the world then she mind tortured by newly awaken doubt run back over the event lead to the rupture with the sprague she groan at the retrospect it be injustice that have displace jack in the command of the company it be injustice that have mark she father 's conduct in the perley feud grief be a logician of very direct method its clarify process work like light in darkness kate see the past in she father 's conduct with terrifying vividness she realize that it be she father 's harsh purpose that have array acredale against he it be he pride and arrogant obstinacy that have bring about the loss of all she love the fate have immolate the helpless be the fate prepare a still bitterer expiation life have very little left for she now but she resolve that she would no longer be isolate by she father 's enmity the great house have be gloomy enough for father and daughter during the last miserable month but he still flee to she for comfort it be one evening when he come in apparently in better spirit than he have show since wesley 's death that she tell he what have be fill she mind since jack 's death o father i think i see that we life have be unworthy if not altogether wrong surely such neighbor as ours could not all take side against you if you be in the right in all the feud that have divide we as a family from the people of acredale then in a almost implore tone of reproach she retrace the harsh episode in the father 's dealings with the perley with the community and finally the quarrel with the sprague involve in it the life of wesley and jack she voice soften into tremulousness she arise and in she old plead way pull the shaggy head down on she breast press she lip on the high bare forehead dear father all this be unchristian you have in reality be wage war against woman and child jack be a mere boy richard be a boy i do not go into other enmity where you have use the enormous power of wealth to crush the helpless if you have not alienate the sprague and encourage wesley in overbearing jack my brother would be alive to-day my sweetheart -- yes jack be dearer than all the world to I -- he would not be dead to-day ah father father what good come of anger -- what joy of revenge you have bring about the death of these two boy be it not time to look at life with a new heart -- with clear-seeing eye elisha boone sit quite still he have listen at first with a flush of anger which deepen as the girl plead until it die away and leave he face very pale he push himself away from the clinging figure as if the better to see she face then he head droop he sigh heavily rise and without a word leave the room kate hear he ascend the stair then the sound of he room door softly close have the hateful fire of vengeance be quench it be she father 's way when resolutely oppose to quit the scene and without confess himself in the wrong do as kate urge the next morning he be go before she reach the breakfast-table there be a note on she plate in he handwriting she read with a sink heart : my daughter : if what you say last night be true you can not be the daughter to I that you have be i be go to washington and when i come back you will know that you brother be deliberately murder and that he murderer even in the grave be hold guilty before all man of the crime the servant confirm the tiding she father have arise early and depart on the first train what could it mean have he some evidence that she have not hear have jack leave papers incriminate he ah why carry the hideous feud further why blast the melancholy repose of the living by fasten this stain upon the dead but they could not she know it she could herself refute any proof bring forward she would tell all she would reveal they tender relationship and surely then any one know the young man 's nature would scout the assertion of he willfully shooting wesley but surely olympium and mr sprague must be able to tell and tell decisively the circumstance in the tragedy she would go to they she owe this to the living she owe it still more imperatively to the dead she have not see olympium since she return mr sprague have be too infirm to see she when she call but she would not heed rebuff now in such a cause on such a mission she would have stand at the sprague door a suppliant until even the obstinacy of she father would have relent on she way across the square she see merry come from the post she turn out of she way and hurry to the near-sighted spinster hold out she hand say softly : ah miss merry i be so glad to see you i have be mean to call on you ever since i hear of you return but what with sorrow and illness i have put it off and now i want you to take I home with you will you not the plead tone the caress clasp of the hand the sadly change face the somber

know there be no time to lose i shall come and see you all soon she squeeze the astonished merry 's hand convulsively and shoot off leave the bewildered lady quite speechless so speechless that when she reach the stately presence of aunt pliny she forget the commission she have be send to execute and be at once revile by the parrot as a no-account dawdler meanwhile kate with wild throb hope in she heart that kindle color in she pale cheek and light in she weary eye speed away to the sprague there be no tremor in the hand that raise the dragon-headed knocker nor hesitancy in the voice that bid the servant say that miss boone request a few moment ' conversation with miss sprague olympium come presently into the reception-room and the girl meet with a warm embrace ah olympia i have be make so -- so -- glad by what merry tell I you -- do -- not believe that you brother be dead she voice falter and olympium gaze at she fixedly say : no i shall not believe jack be dead until i see he body poor mother who believe the worst whenever we be out of she sight have give up all but the faintest hope i shall not i know jack so well i know that it would take a good deal to kill he young and strong as he be besides that i know that the atterbury would find means to let we know if there be any certainty as to he fate poor jack it would be a unendurable calamity if he be to die before the monstrous calumny that have be publish about he be proved lie dear olympia that be one reason of my come in my horror at rosedale i too believe that john have be in a plot to entrap wesley but i -- i

hand in hand and olympium tell the tale as it have be set down in these page kate be sob when the story end she fling she arm about olympium 's neck and for a time the two sit silent tearful oh why do not he tell I this at the time it be not jack 's bullet that enter poor wesley 's body jack be at he right at the side of the bed wesley 's wound be on the left side and the shot must have come from jone 's pistol i remember that but jack 's remorse put all thought of everything else out of my head i recall perfectly that the wound be in wesley 's left side oh if i could only get that word to jack i if -- i 'll get it to he if he be alive i or mine have be he undoing i shall make amends ah olympia i -- i be ashamed to feel so full of joy -- forgive I it be not you fault dear that you do not know jack as we do olympium say tenderly what be you plan kate ask presently mother insist upon go to the peninsula and examine the ground question all who take part in the pursuit and see with she own eye every wounded man in the neighborhood i do not know whether we can get pass but we shall set out at once and do we best o olympium i must -- i must go with you i shall die if i remain here do nothing -- helpless let I go i can aid you much i can surely get all the passport require i can do many thing that you could not do for my father -- she stop and color she father what be she rashly promise for he dead he be bent on jack 's dishonor living he would never rest until jack 's life be condemn ah yes -- that be true you father be potent at headquarters i can answer for mamma we shall be delighted and comfort to have you i shall need you as much as mamma need I we be only wait for mr brodie 's report i do not expect much from he research it be only a woman 's heart that uphold one in such trial as this search mean the plan be agree upon at once and the two girl separate knit together by the same bond in more sens than one for while olympium set out to rescue she brother she secretly hope that the search would bring she near some one else and so as soon as kate have go she sit down and write vincent of jack 's disappearance ask he aid in find such trace as might be in the rebel line she merely allude to they project plan add in a postscript that she would write he as soon as the party approach the outpost kate write at once to she father at he washington address narrate she visit to the sprague tell he of the new hope that have come to she and beseech he to lend he whole heart to the distressed mother and sister he should see she in washington within a few day and she count on he sympathy with she to help to restore the lost son and brother if alive to co-operate in give the body honorable burial if he be dead these letter dispatch the party wait only to hear from brodie he come a day or two later but he could give they no hope he have be repel from all source of information insult in the war office and deny access to the president he be convince that there be secret influence at work to obscure the true fact in the case of the escape prisoner but what the agency be he could not guess when olympium tell this to kate she be surprise at she look and response i know the influence i think and i can discover the agency take comfort i believe jack be alive i promise you that i shall never rest until he be find alive or dead o kate what a impulsive ally we have gain i wish jack could have hear that speech it would have put power in he arm as poor barney use to say twenty-four hour later the three woman be in washington kate remain with she friend instead of join she father at willard 's chapter xxx a game of chance it be the end of January 1862 when olympium and she mother find themselves in washington for the second time in quest of the miss soldier they take lodgings in the same quiet house not far from lafayette square -- kate with they kate count upon she father 's aid active or passive but when she messenger return from willard 's with word that mr boone have go from the hotel several day before she be numb with a dreadful foreboding he be avoid she deliberately she drive at once to the hotel the clerk summon to she aid could only inform she that she father have give up he room and have leave the hotel late at night she could get no further clew she telegraph at once to acredale and return to the sprague not daring to breathe she apprehension yes she father be plainly keep away from she he mean to persist in he savage vengeance what have he learn be jack indeed dead and be he good name the object of she father 's hatred whither should she turn why have she not think of this -- she father passivity or even opposition how could she reveal she terror to the mother and sister how make know to they the unworthy side of she father 's character if in the morning no telegram come from acredale it would be proof that she father be bent implacably in he purpose to undo jack living or dead when she reach the lodging olympium be dress for the street you be just in time i have mature my plan first we must find out at the proper quarter the name of all the wound bring here from fort monroe then we must trace the report in the _ herald _ down to its origin then we must visit every hospital in and near washington to find out from actual sight of each man whether jack or dick or any one we know be in the city as we go on we shall learn a good deal which may modify this plan or perhaps make the search less difficult olympium say this with composure and a certain confidence in herself that strike kate with admiration she feel ashamed of herself here be olympium unconscious of jack 's real peril if live the menace to he reputation if dead planning as composedly as if it be a every-day thing to have a brother lose in the appalling maze of war and she have be weakly depend upon she father jack 's most persevere enemy she recoil from herself in a shiver of self-reproach as she say : olympia you have the good sense of a man in a emergency i be ashamed of myself i who ought to do the thinking for you be as helpless as a kitchen-maid set to play lady in the parlor i can at least help you i can make my body follow you if i have not sense enough to suggest dear kate it be not sense or insight or any fine quality of mind that be need here all i ask be that you will not get dispirited or if you do do not let mamma see you be poor mamma she be as easily influence as a baby jack be she darling remember all the world be a small affair to she compare with we poor boy i fancy if we be as much wrap up in he as she be we should make poor pioneer in the wilderness before we but kate could stand no more of this with a choke sob she turn and flee up the stairway cry as she disappear : wait -- wait a moment i must get my purse when she reappear the heavy mourning-veil be draw down and olympium with a reassure glance open the door you must affect confidence if you have it not -- even gayety i warn you not to be shock at my conduct i must keep up mamma 's spirit and to do it i must play indifference or confidence and you must be careful to say nothing to do nothing to excite she suspicion kate 's cab have drive off and the two girl walk through lafayette square into pennsylvanium avenue to get another the wide street be fill as of old with skurry orderly group of lounging officer and lumber army wagon but even the untrained eye of olympium soon take account of the better discipline the more businesslike celerity of the man on duty as well as the fly courier the white house be gay with hunting and salute from the distant fort be signalize the news that have just come of union success at mill spring and roanoke island the girl procure a hack be drive to the provost-general 's office here after a interminable delay they be admit to the presence of a complacent young coxcomb in spotless regimental who so soon as he see olympium 's face and bearing throw off the listlessness of routine and rise deferentially ask she pleasure she tell she story simply and ask he advice as to the course to be follow when the extract from the _ herald _ be show to he he examine a enormous folio and then ring a bell it be more than likely that these name be wrong this happen constantly the operator be raw and some of they can barely read the name be give hurriedly and if not write plainly they make wretched work of they the newspaper make many a fool famous while neglect many a hero who deserve fame simply through the blundering or carelessness of the writer or operator here be a orderly who will take you to the surgeon-general you will find in he book the name of all the wound in hospital in the eastern army but if you brother be wound or bring in wound at fort monroe he name will be on the book of the army of the potomac or the department of eastern virginium they be treat with the same deferential gallantry at the surgeon-general 's office the young doctor indeed become almost obtrusive in they eagerness to spare the young woman the drudgery of scrutinize the long list of invalid but after two day ' careful search no name resemble sprague or perley could be find i wonder who this can be kate say return to a entry make a month before : jone warchester caribee regiment i know no one of that name olympium say but perhaps he might know something of jack let we go to he it will do no harm to find out who he be the surgeon 's clerk readily give they jone 's address remind they that the hospital be in georgetown and that they would be too late to obtain entrance to the patient that day next morning mr sprague be too ill to rise from she bed and olympium could not leave she alone kate undertake the investigation into the jone affair alone when she reach the hospital there be some delay before she could see the personage intrust with the admission of guest she be show into a office on the ground-floor and give a seat as she sit distraught and eager she hear she own name in the next room the door of which stand open : it be at boone 's risk he would have he move and the surgeon-general give he _ carte blanche _ with the patient well it will cost the man he life i 'll stake my diploma on that why the journey to warchester alone be enough to down the most vigorous convalescent kate tremble what do this mean what be she hear boone -- warchester whom have she father be take from the hospital -- jack she heart give a wild leap yes -- jack who else do she father know in the army she arise tremble faint but resolute she reach the open door but try for a moment in vain to ask : if you please tell I tell I -- but she could say no more the occupant of the room in undress uniform turn upon she at first in hostile surprise but as she throw she veil farther back in alarm the elder of the two say : pray madam what be it be you ill no may i sit down please thank you i be come to to -- what should she say how expose the doubt of she father how find out for certain who have be remove to warchester -- abducted be the word she agitate thought shape oh if olympium intrepid self-possessed be only with she -- but no not olympia no one must ever know the unutterable crime she suspect she father of she must be brave she must be resolute oh where be she art now when she most need they she try to speak a hoarse gasp come in she throat and die there ah -- ah -- some water -- i -- i be faint in a instant a goblet of cool water be at she lip she drink slowly deliberate all the time to recover she sens the surgeon -- both young man mere lad -- wait respectfully infer much from the melancholy robe the water cool she head and she begin to be able to think coherently i have the surgeon-general 's permit to visit a patient in you fever ward -- jone the name be can i see he pray let I see the permit madam he glance at it look significantly at he comrade and say : this man be remove three day ago whereto warchester ah kate 's veil by a imperceptible gesture fall over part of she face a great tremble come upon she again the young surgeon exchange glance who -- who -- do -- who ask for he removal a mr boone also of warchester thank you -- i be too late -- i want to -- to ask this mr jone some question concern a dear friend in he regiment but i can write if you will kindly give I the address i be very sorry -- beyond warchester we have no record here of he whereabouts if he have be officially transfer to another government hospital we should have all the fact but the removal be a personal favor to mr boone he be well know both here and in warchester and you can have no difficulty in communicate with he ah true i have forget that if we can be of any service to you miss sprague the young man say hand kate back the permit make out in olympium 's name which kate have never think of you can always reach we through the surgeon-general 's office he hand she a card with he own and he comrade 's name in pencil thank the young man with as much self-possession as she could summon kate reach the carriage in a whirl of wild imagining more terrifying as she strive to reduce they to definite shape who be this jone why remove he to warchester if it be not jack what interest could she father have in he removal but first what could she say to olympia she could say she do not know jone but olympium would surely ask what question she have put to he what should she say that he have be take away from the hospital she know olympia well enough to know that this vague story would only incite she to further inquiry she would find out the father 's handiwork in the affair and she too would be set on the rack of suspicion when the carriage reach the door kate dare not enter she dismiss the man and set out toward the green field below the round slope of meridian hill here she could breathe freely i can think clearly now she pant with a gush of warm tear if she could only remain calm she could look into the black abyss with the eye of reason rather than terror calmness come soothingly as she walk and she begin at the beginning weigh probability all seem dark and hopeless until she come back to the record in the surgeon-general 's office jone send from hampton hospital December 13th this be about the time jack have reach the union line he have leave richmond late in November all brodie 's inquiry at fort monroe have be fruitless in find the whereabouts of the fugitive that come through the line at that time dick have be one of they if jone be not jack himself he must have be one of the group that escape with jack it all lead back to the first frightful conjecture she father be abduct a witness who could divulge jack 's whereabouts or he be secrete jack until be could work he harm the walk begin to revive kate 's courage as well as she faculty she must act with energy the hardest part of the problem be to get clear of olympium for kate at once make up she mind to quit washington that very night for home she must evade olympium 's inquiry as best she could and make some excuse for journey thither when she reach home fortune have intervene to save she conscience from the falsehood she fear she would have to employ the landlady meet she in the hallway with a white face o miss boone mr sprague be take very bad the doctor 's with she now i think it be typhoid fever

the search you propose can lead to nothing all that can be do have be do by he friend they have find no trace of he woman can not hope to succeed where so keen a man as brodie have fail i have every confidence that in good time the matter will be clear up but you must remember that the government and its agent have all they can do to manage and keep track of the million of soldier in the field and they can not be expect to take much interest in the fate of the wound or dead always affectionately you father all doubt of she father 's sinister intervention in jack 's disappearance now take the form of certainty in the girl 's mind when olympium come back a few moment later kate say tenderly : i have news from home i must go back at once it be less of a grief to I since i should be banish from you if i be here i shall not be go long i shall certainly be back as soon as you can receive I in the mean while do not despair i have be put on a new trail that i can not explain to you

have dismiss all thought of jack and be immerse in he own affair she sit stare and helpless a cold horror creep into she heart and a nameless terror take outline in she sens hideous alternative to be coherent she must suspect nay accuse she father of a dreadful duplicity he be deceive she else why no mention of he mission to washington -- he abduction of jone jone who be he oh blind and senseless that she have be why have she not ask the young man at georgetown to describe jone that would have reveal all she need to know be it too late to write they yes but could she throw suspicion upon she father by write to stranger and of necessity expose the sinister secrecy of she father 's action but she could hurry back to washington and without let the young man know get a descriptive list this she resolve to do twenty-four hour later she be in washington the journey be throw away the descriptive list have be send by the hospital steward with the invalid he could be find in the military hospital in warchester he name be leander elkin this be something gain two day later she be at the hospital in warchester the steward elkin come to she in the wait room he be a young giant in stature with light flaxen hair a merry blue eye and so bashful in the presence of a woman that he color rosily as kate ask he if he be the person she have send for yes be i be lee elkin he stammer very much perplexed to find ease for he large hand and ample foot be you -- be mr jone who come from the georgetown hospital in you case kate have think out she course in advance and have decide that the direct way be the best unless the man have be charge to conceal fact a apparent knowledge of jone 's movement would be the surest way of elicit he whereabouts oh no miss jone wa ` nt bring here he be take to a private place i do not rightly know where but i calculate i ken find eout of ye want to know yes i should like very much to know i be deeply interested in he do you have charge of he i can not say i

natural involve no conspiracy or bribe of menial do you think you could find out for I where mr jone be wall i reckon it could be do it may take some day as i must trust to the luck of run upon old dofunny again kate start old dofunny -- the unsuspecting humorist mean she father by this jocular _ nom de guerre _ and she dare not resent it how should she gain she end and yet save herself from the humiliation of seem to spy upon she father it would not do for elkin to go to he for he would at once suspect inquire and learn that she have come upon he track if she could only see he face to face she would be spare all this odious complotting but she dare not reject the means providence have put in she hand and yet how use they and avoid throw suspicion upon she father in caution elkin not to approach he she be not equal to the invention of a plan on the moment and say in a doubt reflective way : never mind i may be able to learn from some of he friend where he be the gentleman you speak of do not live in this city and you would hardly be able to find he if i could find he i could find mr jone ah yes je ' so wall i think i can find he in another way i remember the carriage that take he from the station i can find out from the driver ` t ` wa not no mystery i reckon kate look into the innocent blue eye as the young fellow scratch he tow head wonder whether he be as simple-minded as he seem he stand the scrutiny with blush restiveness in which there be nothing of the malign and she resolve that he be to be trust very well she say indifferently that do seem the shortest way to find out the poor fellow 's whereabouts get the fact and you shall be well pay for you trouble ` tai not no trouble miss if it be a service to you it would make I powerful glad to do anything for a

expense here be money to pay -- spare no expense the big eye open in wonder as kate hand he three new ten-dollar greenback just then something of a novelty to soldier especially who get they pay infrequently it be a bold stroke to intrust she name to this unconscious agent of she father for if he be really play a part he first act would be to reveal she visit and thus set she father on he guard but she trust he implicitly he wide-open blue eye the artless admiration mingle with he bashful diffidence all be proof that he could not be deceive she she take room at the alburn house which be not the chief hotel as be better adapt for she purpose of seclusion at the big hotel she be know and if she father be in town she would be under he espionage without the solace of write he late in the evening she agent come in radiant he have find the man easy as roll off a log the hackman have take he to the house where jone be lie it be on the outskirts of the city toward acredale he describe

rest set out early in the morning she go first to acredale where she could get she own equipage and driver the tenant of the house do not know she she ring boldly at the door and when a maid answer quite take aback by the girlish figure in deep black kate ask confidently : i want to see the sick man mr jone yes be come right in this way please ma'am the girl lead the way up a flight of stair but if she have be part of the balustrade kate could not have be more immovable whom be she about to see jack wan emaciate on the verge of the grave they have say in washington that the journey would kill he be it to that end she relentless father have persist in the removal be she about to see the die bring to death 's door by she own flesh and blood she reel against the stair-post and bring she veil over she face the girl have turn above and be wait in wonder with a desperate gathering together of she relax force she mount the stairway in the corridor the girl turn to a closed doorway and knock lightly there be no sound within but the door swing open and elisha boone stand on the threshold he do not in the dim light observe the figure in black but look at the maid say softly : what be wanted sarah a young lady to see mr jone sir and step slightly aside for kate to enter the father recognize the visitor you here kate what do this mean with a great throb of joy she fling herself into he arm too happy too relieved to take into consideration the defeat of she purpose involve in the meeting for a instant she lose all thought of anything but that she estrange parent be in she arm that she

retreat to a safe distance where she lurk in covert to make report of the extraordinary going on impossible kate you must not be here i will not have it you must go he voice grow stern you must go i say kate you must go down-stair this instant come boone i say this be not fair let the lady come in if she want to see valor lay low boone who have be insensibly move kate from the open doorway catch she eye fix on the room and look over he shoulder at these jocular word he see jone lean against the post a wan smile on he face boone turn almost fling kate from he and fairly lift the invalid carry he back into the room this be madness you be in no condition to rise i will not be responsible for you life if you persist in this course so much trouble off you hand old man i 'll be more use to you dead than live better let I blow my own flame out it will not burn long at best or worst in the overwhelming revulsion of feeling bring about by the actual sight of jone kate stand interdict in the corridor uncertain what to do she hear the man 's word and shudder at the banter levity with which he speak of he own death who could it be it be not jack as she have fear and hope but he must know something of jack she must speak with he how it would not do to irritate she father she catch boone 's almost whisper word : i tell you jone you shall be bring about but you know the danger of see any acredale people my daughter know you -- know the perley i should think that would be reason enough why you should not be see by she oh i do not mind the sight of a pretty girl be the best medicine i know of i would risk all acredale for that kate turn softly and wait at the foot of the stair for she father he come presently look worried and embarrassed now do not go to imagine mystery here this be a man who have be on my hand a good many year he be a irreclaimable spendthrift he be in other day a man of repute and station i be interested in he through old tie since the day we be boy the carriage be here papa will not you come home with I yes you get into the carriage he reappear presently the face of a strange woman that kate have not see peer over he shoulder into the carriage as he come down the step kate instantly divine that he have be warn the landlady against admit stranger to the sick man 's room during the drive home kate strive to reassert she old dominion over the moody figure at she side it be useless as the carriage stop at the door he turn toward she and say not unkindly : daughter there be some thing i know better how to manage than you do you have be spy on you father this be another count in the long score of grudge i owe the sprague tribe and they scoundrel son understand I clearly my child you must not speak of this matter again the whole business will soon be at a end that end be in my hand and no power this side the grave can alter a fact in the outcome you be very dear to I you be all i have leave in the world you must trust I and you must believe that i be do everything for the best try to think that the world be not come to a end because i insist on have my own way for once nothing but the sense of have give hostage to good behavior rather than honor uphold kate in the line she have mark out for herself she be not in the modern sense of the word a strong-minded young woman this sorely beset champion of the overborne she have not even the perversity of the sex in love chivalrously as she love the lose soldier she love she father with that old-fashioned veneration which make she see all that he do with the moral indistinctness without which there could not be the perfect filial devotion that make the family a union in good report and evil she have not even that by no means repellent secondary egoism which uphold we in do ungrateful thing that abstract good may follow opposition which become delightful when we can call it persecution have no charm for she if she father have suddenly adopt the _ rôle _ of the stern parent in novel and order she to she chamber kate would have regard it as a joke and feel rather relieve that she could thus escape the pledge give to the sprague but as it be she feel morally bind by she promise to olympium and though she realize dimly that she instrumentality be slowly involve she father in a coil of unloveliness she resolutely brace herself for the worst in spite of herself she have believe in conquer she father 's severity and change he mind she have rescue he from revenge quite as dear to he as this at least so far as she understand it forget that she father believe himself to be pursue the deliberate murderer of he son when we have achieve a victory over we own less noble impulse and put the sophistry that mislead we behind we it be impossible to realize that other have not the same vision the same mind as we own kate have accuse jack of cold-blooded murder she have reason herself out of that hateful spirit and forget that she father have not the vital force of love to act as a fulcrum she could not quite comprehend how difficult it be to shift the wrathful burden in he mind she have go too far to recede now with honor olympium have trust she have indeed give over into she hand the active work of find the strangely lose clew of jack 's whereabouts perhaps for she father 's sake it be better that she should be the instrument she might be able to dissemble he intervention shield he from obloquy -- if as she fear he be responsible for anything doubtful she know she father too well to suppose that he would flinch from any measure he have propose to himself she know that she need not count any further upon she accustomed power of persuasion he own word be final on that score if she could only learn he intention if she could be sure that he be ulteriorly shaping event against jack -- be acquaint with he whereabouts -- she would have know exactly what to do but pillory in doubt shackle by the dread of expose he in some hateful malevolence which would forever disgrace he in the community she hardly dare stir though she feel that every hour 's delay be a new peril to jack in some way the more she think of the scene of the morning the surer she feel that jone -- or mr dick as she father sometimes call he -- be in some way a instrument in the paternal scheme if she could but see jone ten minute she father she well know have guard against that whom could she send in she place ah there be the double check she could not expose she father to a stranger yet if she apprehension be ground on anything more substantial than fear stranger must in time know all could merry be make use of no -- that would not do the libertine tone of the invalid he impudent allusion to herself convinced kate that a man must be she agent if any one be to be but what man do she know if she send any of the servant she father would recognize they and the attempt fail she have trust elkin he seem a honest incurious lad just the one to be trust in the business she could invent a fable which would satisfy he ready credulity without compromise she father it be plain that he be the only resource she dress at once and return to the alburn thence she dispatch a note to elkin beg he to call at he earliest leisure while wait he return she write a letter to be hand to jone this be a work of no little ingenuity force as she be to avoid all allusion to she father and the scene of the morning when complete this stroke of the conspiracy run : dear sir : a mother and sister who have exhaust all official source in vain to get trace of a lost son and brother john sprague of the caribee have reason to believe that you can give they a clew to he whereabouts will you therefore kindly confide in the bearer of this letter give he by word of mouth such fact as will enable john sprague 's relative to work intelligently in the search for he live or dead very truly yours katherine boone it be hardly write when elkin himself appear radiant with satisfaction and blush like a peony under lamplight yeour note come just in th ' nick o ' time i have leave of absence for twenty-four hour and be just goin ' inter teown if you can spare I the day i have a very important matter i think you can attend to for I i want you to go to the sick man jone you must see before enter whether he be alone or not i do not know how you can find out but you can invent some way if you see the man who bring he from washington you be not to enter but if you find that he be not in the house ask boldly for jone and when you reach he hand he this note he will give you a answer and you must be careful not to lose a word for life depend on the accuracy of you report i fancy that you regimental and hospital badge can gain you admission if as i have reason to believe there be order to refuse stranger admission i depend on you to overcome any difficulty you may meet if you know how much depend upon it i be sure you would not be baffle by anything less than force the big blue eye be fairly bulge like two monster morning-glory as elkin put the note carefully in he jacket pocket say softly : ef i do not get thet ` ere letter into jone 's hand you may have I drum out o ' camp by the mule-driver i believe you and trust you i shall be here to-morrow morning early and shall hope to hear something from you good-by good-by miss just you make up you mind i be

those who only tell the truth what do that mean it be simple enough -- a home-made epigram people who tell nothing but the truth be easiest make to believe a lie the sprague have hear of you as ignorant and believe it you can not blame they for that i do not blame they because it be a lie i blame they because it be the truth i do not care a straw how many lie be tell about I -- it be the ill-natured truth i object to i be afraid that you will have a hard time in life if you like lie better than the truth i do not say that then i do not understand english you do not understand I ah yes

wrath stop where you be the dead can not be avenge that be a barbarous code remember in all the petty irritation of the past when you have be hurt by you neighbor you be never so triumphant as when you surprise those who injure you by a magnanimous return -- there i make a agreement with you that we should not speak of these thing i mean it i find that you take advantage of I i shall be banish from the house if you do not keep to you bargain kate sigh she have hope that the early banter be pave the way for a reconciliation she take up some work and try to busy she hand suppose you read I something you have not read in a age what shall it be oh something from dickens -- anything you like very well i shall show you a counterfeit presentment of yourself and with a arch-smile she begin to

neighbor ' girl to keep you company if you be lonesome oh i shall not be lonesome i shall have too much to do -- too much to think about he laugh you be enough like you father my girl to pass for he

breathlessly i see he she seize the blush lad 's two hand ah you splendid follow and then -- he write this note for you and he hand she a envelope with she own name write on it in a uneven uncertain scrawl she tear it open and read : dear madam : i can not understand why there should be any difficulty in find what become of sprague and he party we all reach the line together but as i be hit by a bullet in the head at the moment of rescue i know nothing of they movement after reach the union line i too be interested in the young man i should like to see you or some of he friend at once as i

chapter xxxii the lose caribee meanwhile war in one of its grim humor have prepare a comedy when the stage be set in tragic trappings in the withdrawal of johnston 's army from manassa -- signalize in history as the quaker campaign because we army find wooden gun in the desert work -- that ardent young hotspur vincent atterbury run upon a disagreeable end to a very charming adventure in chivalric bravado to emphasize the fact that the withdrawal of the confederate be merely strategic not force the young man with a lively company of horseman hunger for excitement form themselves into a defiant rear-guard the union outpost never suspect that johnston 's army be not behind the enterprising cavalry withdraw prudently to the main force then when they be convince that the little band be merely on a audacious lark force be send out on either flank while the main body feign the disorder of retreat the result be that vincent 's squadron be handsomely entrap and in the savage contest that ensue the intrepid major be hustle from he horse with a dislocate shoulder and broken wrist he be bring with a half-dozen more of he dare-devil comrade into the union line and in the course of time find himself in the hideous shambles allotted rebel prisoner at point lookout maryland too weak at first or too confuse to bethink himself of he northern friend vincent share the hard usage of he companion and resign himself patiently to the slow procedure of exchange which be now go on regularly since the union victory in the west and south have give the northern authority ten prisoner to the southerner ' one the prospect of he own release be under these circumstance rather distant as without special intervention he would have to await he turn the rule be that those first capture be first exchange he know that he family 's influence and he own intimacy with general johnston would probably hasten the release but he could not count upon a immediate return to he duty and in view of this he be not very reluctant to undergo convalescence in the north jack 's influence he count would soon relieve he from the hardship of confinement and then he should see olympium -- that at least be recompense for he misfortune he mother and rosa would immediately learn of he capture and he might count upon hearing from they as very generous latitude be allow in such case by the authority on both side he cause a letter to be write to jack address it to he regiment in care of the war department and wait patiently the response he disappointment and anxiety as day pass and he get no answer begin to tell on he health already weaken by he wound thus one day when a young lady be show to he bedside -- who fall upon he with a glad cry and hold he head to she breast -- he be too far go in delirium to distinguish he sister my darling o olympium i know you would come he murmur and rosa terrify but compose soothe the fevered lover as best she might he grow worse in spite of all she devotion the physician burden with patient far in excess of they power assure she that she brother would require the most patient care and enlighten nursing that medicine would do he but slight good and that she must make up she mind to a prolonged illness rosa be alone in the vast hospital save for the presence of she maid linda who have come through the line with she and be of course under the northern law free worse than all she be poorly provide with money and this need rather than vincent 's love-lorn babble about olympium remind rosa to call upon the sprague for help she write at once to olympium tell the distressing story and then set about better vincent 's surroundings point lookout have be select for its natural prison-like safeguard a rank bog surround the place on three side and thus but few troops be need to guard the great mass of rebel prisoner lodge in wooden barracks and long line of tent vincent 's case seem to have grow stationary after she come he sleep a fitful troubled sleep half the day at night he grow delirious and restless rosa and linda divide the hour into watch and administer the draught prepare by the steward through the humanity of the physician in charge the invalid have be transfer to a a tent where rosa could remain day and night unmolested with she maid vincent thus care for rosa begin to think of the other poor fellow in she brother 's squadron and set about a systematic search for they many of they she find in the general ward of the hospital it be on this kindly mission one day that she hear she brother 's name mention by a civilian who be talk with a official in uniform major atterbury oh yes he be remove to division d you will find he in a separate tent he have a woman nurse i will send a orderly with you rosa do not recognize the

to the outpost on the warrick there he have learn that jack and dick have be wound fatally the story go in the final volley fire by the pursuer they have be carry to the hospital at hampton but there all trace have be lose the steward who receive they and the surgeon who have take they descriptive list have be transfer to st loui there be however no record of they death and upon that he base the hope that they be either in hospital or have be through some strange confusion assign among rebel wound a thing that have frequently happen in the hurry of transport large number of wounded man and do mrs sprague know all this rosa cry understand now why vincent 's letter and she own have not bring a response partly i think mr sprague and she daughter be in washington in the state of mind you may imagine and exhausting bale of red tape to reach the lose boy poor rosa she have think she grief and terror too much to endure before now how trivial vincent 's fever in comparison with this appalling disappearance of dick and jack she walk on over the sparse herbage over she shoe in the soft sand when linda come run from the tent in joyous excitement de good lord miss rosa she be here she be do come who be here -- who be come rosa cry impatiently not mamma ` deed no miss rosa miss limpy what yes indeedy and oh bress de lord massa vint know she and be talkin ' like a sweet dive it be true

crescendo _ of exclamation not very intelligible to jone and linda who discreetly remain near the door on the outside vincent 's eye be fix on olympium for the first time in ten day they shine with the light of reason he smile softly at the scene and murmur lightly to himself warn not to tax the feeble power of the invalid rosa and jone withdraw leave olympium to recover from the fatigue of she

into you line she explain all the effort that have be make -- how brodie have be baffle and how letter have be send to the commanding officer at fort monroe we have begin to think that jack have be recapture but surely if he be you would have know of it of course i should then that confines the search to we own line i can not make myself believe that jack be dead though mamma have nearly make up she mind to it the mysterious part of the affair be that we can not find one of the man who escape with jack though it be announce in the papers week ago that a party of they have arrive at fort monroe and young ` perley ' he too we can get no trace of good heaven i be glad rosa do not know that she would be in every camp and hospital in the north until she have find she sweetheart that sound

-- that she bent over near he face to smooth he disorder bandage when she withdraw she be blush very prettily and vincent be smile in triumph on these term the smile seem to say i will be mute for a age what a adroit ally war be to love here be the self-contained olympium -- so confident of herself -- fond and yield as rosa when war rush in infirmity come to the rescue of vincent 's despairing passion meanwhile jone begin a systematic search among the prisoner for the miss caribee rosa join with impatient ardor there be three thousand inmate of the improvise city but no one resemble jack or

small-pox have for the african once within the long marqueé however rosa be relieve to find that the casual spectacle be not different from that of the other seriously sick-ward a melancholy silence seem to signalize the despair of the twoscore patient each occupy a cot screen from the rest by thin canvas curtain double line of sentry guard each opening of the marqueé so that no one could pass in or out without the rigidly _ viséd _ order of the surgeon-in-chief brazier of charcoal burn at the foot of each bed while the atmosphere be heavy with a strong solution of carbolic acid then just begin to be recognize as a sovereign preventive of malarious vapor and a antiseptic against the germ of disease rosa inquire for the _ protégés _ she be seek they be point out on one side of the tent the steward accompany she to each cot all have the small-pox she inquire shudder as she glance at the white screen behind which a occasional plaintive groan could be hear oh no there be some here that

across the bed when rosa with a shriek fall upon the body of number seven cry : o my darling my darling i have find you it would have require the eye of maternal love of rosa 's to recognize we jaunty dick in the emaciated fleshless face that lay imbed in the disarray of the cot dick 's blue eye be sunken and dim he lip chalky and parched he make no sign of recognition when rosa draw back with she arm under he head to scrutinize the disease-worn face sometimes miss he be in he right mind -- but he go off again like this be the other man he brother they seem to understand each other when they be

a uncertain step quit the chamber olympium explain to the physician that kate have hear painful news from a unexpected quarter and that she illness be more nervous than physical i do not know about that the doctor say decisively he feel she pulse then with a quick start of surprise raise she head and examine the tongue and lining of the palate a still graver look settle on he face as he test the breath and action of the heart when he have apparently satisfied himself he turn to olympia with a perturb air and beckon she into the dressing-room say : miss sprague this be no place for you miss boone have every symptom of typhoid fever she have evidently be expose to a malarial air she complaint may be even worse than typhoid -- i can not quite make out certain whitish blotch on she skin i

turn into the library he see that the host be alone close the door he say : mr boone you daughter have be expose to a great danger we may be able to save she but it will require great patience danger doctor what do you mean you daughter have catch the most hideous of all disease -- small-pox elisha boone start to he foot great god where could she catch small-pox she catch it nurse young sprague i think you know of that and the doctor regard the incredulous terror-stricken face of the father with bewildered fixity well he might the first rod of the moral law have just strike he the vengeance he have so subtly plan have turn into retributive justice he have refuse kate 's prayer he have drive she to this mad search and the contagion now perile she life or if it be spare leave she a hideous

be settle that boone should take up he quarter in warchester come out late every night for news meanwhile acredale have read with amazement first of the finding of jack sprague among the rebel at point lookout then the extraordinary story of the court-martial and death-sentence every one call at the sprague mansion but it be in the hand of the servant olympium and she guest have return to washington so soon as the story of she brother 's peril reach she dick too have fly to he adored jack and acredale confound by the swift alternation in the young soldier 's fortune settle down to wait the outcome with a tender sorrow for the bright young life eclipse in disgrace so awful death so ignominious we have look on while most of the people in this history work through night to light in the moral perplexity beset they we have see warrior in love and danger gallantly extricate themselves and pluck the bloom of safety from the dragon path of danger we have see a moral combat in the mind of most of the people who have have to do with we luckless jack but all herein set down have be the merest November melancholy compare to the charnel-house of dead hope and baffle purpose that tortured elisha boone unlovely as boone have seem to we he have one of the prime condition of human goodness -- he love he have love very fondly he son wesley he love very tenderly he daughter kate with this love come the sanctification that must abide where love be i do not think he have much of what may be call the second condition of human goodness -- reverence if he have we should never have see he push revenge to the verge of crime richard perley it be true accuse he of a turpitude that make a man shudder and abhor but allowance must be make for the exaggeration of a careless spendthrift -- a good fellow than whom i can conceive of nothing so useless and mischievous in the human economy for my part i think i could endure the frank heartlessness of a man like boone more philosophically than the false good-nature of the creature man call a good fellow obviously boone do not take dick perley 's estimate of he very seriously he too could have tell a tale not without its strong feature of a shiftless set constantly borrow constantly squander constantly provoke the thrifty to accumulate unguarded property all this however have fade from the old man 's mind now he have avenge himself upon the life-long scorner of he name and fame but the blow that shatter they pride have send a dart to he own heart he beautiful kate he big-hearted high-spirited man-witted girl -- she would bear a leper-taint for life and he hand have put the virus on she perfect flesh in a few day the black in he hair wither to a ashen white he flesh fall away he could neither eat nor sleep he shamble through the obscure street of warchester or linger wistfully in the beech wood behind he own palatial home in acredale stare at the window of he daughter 's chamber the week pass in such mental torture as try the strong when confront by the major force of conscience then the doctor tell he that he have balk the plague that kate be recover from varioloid that beyond a transparency of skin which would add to she beauty rather than impair it there would be no sign of the attack elisha boone sleep in he own home that night and for the first time in forty year he fall upon he knee -- upon he knee indeed the doctor find he so at midnight when he come with a request from he daughter to come to she room the doctor with a word of warn against agitate the sufferer wisely retire from the solemn reconciliation which without know the circumstance he know be to take place between father and child she be prop up upon pillow whose texture she flesh rival in whiteness she open she arm as the specter of what have be she father fly to she with a stifled cry o father we have both be wicked we have both be punish help I to do my part help I to bear my burden it be hope mercy and peace the meeting bring the next day elisha boone bid kate a tender farewell she do not ask he where he be go she know and the light in she eye shone brighter as he ride in the darkness over the bare field and through the sleep town to the capital where jack 's fate be hang in the balance with boone 's influence to aid they jack 's friend find a surprising change in the demeanor of the official hitherto captious and indifferent boone himself lay the case before the president omit certain detail not essential to the showing of the monstrous injustice do a brave soldier the president listen attentively and with the expression half sad and half droll with which he soften the asperity of official life say humorously : i wish by such simple means as courts-martial we could find out more such soldier as this we need all of that sort we can get he touch a bell and when a clerk appear in response he say ask general mcclellan to come in for a moment before he leave what need to go into the detail the court reconvene and traverse the charge which be disprove or withdraw john sprague be pronounced guiltless on every specification and on general mcclellan 's recommendation be promote to a captaincy and assign to the headquarters staff i might go on and tell of jack 's daring on the peninsula and he immeasurable usefulness to mcclellan in the williamsburg contest and the final wondrous change of base from the chickahominy to the jame how he service be recognize by promotion to a colonelcy on the battle-field of malvern and how when mcclellan be wrong by stanton and remove from the army jack break he sword
