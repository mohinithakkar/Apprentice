the five year precede the war have be remarkable all thinker see that the course of human civilization be be change deeply radically but the change be be accomplish so successfully that man hope that the old brutal age of military destruction be at a end and that we be to progress henceforth by the peaceful method of evolution rather than the hysterical excitement and volcanic upheaval of revolution yet even in the peaceful progress of the half-decade just before 1914 there be sign of approach disaster symptom of hysteria this period display the astonishing spectacle of a english parliament once the high example for dignity and the model for self-control among govern body turn suddenly into a howling shriek mob it behold the japanese supposedly the most extravagantly loyal among devotee of monarchy unearthing among themselves a conspiracy of anarchist so wide-spread so dangerous that the government hold they trial in secret and have never dare reveal all that be discover it behold the woman of persium burst from the secrecy of they harem and with modern revolver force they own democratic leader to stand firm in patriotic resistance to russian tyranny it behold the english suffragette yet the movement toward universal democracy which lay behind all these extravagance be upon the whole a movement bear along by calm conviction not by burn hatred or ecstatic devotions a profound sense of the inevitable trend of the world 's evolution seem to have take possession of the mind of the mass of man they feel the uselessness of opposition to this universal progress and they show themselves ready sometimes eager to aid and direct its trend as best they might if then we seek to give a name to this particular five year let we call it the period of humanitarianism of man 's really awaken kindliness toward he brother of other nationality the universal peace movement which be a child in 1910 have by 1914 become a far-reaching force to be reckon with seriously in world politics any observer who study the attitude of the great american people in 1898 on the eve of they war with spain and again in 1914 during the trouble with mexico must have clearly recognize the change there be so much deeper sense of the tragedy of war so much clearer appreciation of the gap between aggressive assault and necessary self-defense so definite a recognition of the fact that murder remain murder even though it be misnamed glory and commit by wholesale and that any one who do not strive to stop it become a party to the crime while the sense of brotherhood be thus be deepen among the people of all the world the associate cause of democracy also advance the earlier year of the century have see the awakening of this mighty force in the east these later year see its sudden decisive renewal of advance in the west the center of world-progress once more shift back from asia to america and to england the center of resistance to that progress continue as it have be before in eastern europe progress of democracy in america let we note first the forward movement in the united state the conservation of natural resource that striking step in the new patriotism which have be begin in the precede decade be carry forward during these year with increase knowledge a new idea develop from it that of establish a closer harmony among the state by means of a new piece of governmental machinery the house of governor -lrb- 1 -rrb- this be form in 1910 -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ the united state house of governor _ page 1 -rrb- to a nation breed as the american have be in a almost superstitious reverence for a particular form of government this change or any change whatever become a matter of great moment it be they final recognition that the present can not be mold to fit the machinery of the past the nearer a constitution come to perfection in fitting the need of one century the more wholly it be likely to fail in fitting the need of the next the united state government be not at its begin a genuine democracy though approach it more nearly than do any other great nation of the day put aside the obvious point that the american constitution deliberately protect slavery which be the primal foe of all democracy the broader fact remain that the entire trend of the constitution be intend to keep the educate and aristocratic class in control and to protect they from the danger of ignorance and rascally demagoguery the weapon of self-defense thus reserve by the thoughtful leader be in the course of generation seize upon as the readiest tool of a shrewd plutocracy which entrench itself in power rebellion against that plutocracy long seem almost hopeless but at last in the year 1912 the fight be carry to a successful issue in both the great political party the progressive spirit dominate the old party line be violently disrupt and president wilson be elect as the leader of a new era seek new ideal of universal equality -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ the new democracy _ page 323 -rrb- nor must we give to the president 's party alone the credit of have recognize the new spirit of the people even before he election he predecessor mr taft have lead the republican party in its effort to make two amendment to the constitution one allow a income tax the other command the election of senator by direct vote of the people both of these be assault upon entrenched privilege the constitution have not be amend by peaceful means for over a century yet both of these amendment be now put through easily -lrb- 1 -rrb- this revolt against two of the most undemocratic of the feature of the ancient and honor constitution be almost like a second declaration of american independence -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ the income tax in america _ page 338 -rrb- perhaps too the change in the senate may prove a help to the cause of universal peace the government of both taft and wilson be persistent in they effort to establish arbitration treaty with other nation and the senate jealous of its own treaty-making authority have be a frequent stumbling-block in they path yet despite the senate 's conservatism arbitration treaty of ever-increasing importance have be make year after year a war between the united state and england or france or indeed almost any self-ruling nation have become practically impossible -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ a step toward world peace _ page 259 -rrb- in she dealing with she spanish-american neighbor the united state have be less fortunate she have indeed achieve a labor of world-wide value by complete the big ditch between the ocean -lrb- 3 -rrb- yet she method of acquire the panama territory from colombium have be arbitrary and have make all she southern neighbor jealous of she power and suspicious of she purpose into the midst of this era of unfriendliness be inject the mexican trouble diaz who have rule mexico with a iron hand for a generation be overthrow -lrb- 4 -rrb- president madero who conquer he be support by the united state and spanish america begin to suspect the western colossus of plan a protectorate over mexico -lrb- footnote 3 : see _ opening of the panama canal _ page 374 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : see _ the fall of diaz _ page 96 -rrb- then come a counter-revolution madero be betray and slay and the savage and bloody indian general huerta seize the power -lrb- 1 -rrb- the antagonism of the united state government against huerta be so marked that at length the anxious south american power urge that they be allow to mediate between the two and the united state readily accept this happy method of prove she real devotion to arbitration and of reestablish the harmony of the america -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ mexico plunge into anarchy _ page 300 -rrb- in itself the entire mexican movement may be regard as another great though confused step in the world-wide progress of democracy the upheaval have be repeatedly compare to the french revolution the rule of diaz be really like that of king loui xvi in france a government by a narrow and wealthy aristocracy who have reduce the ignorant mexican peasant or peon to a state of slavery the bloody battle of all the recent warfare have be fight by these peon in a blind groping for freedom they have disgrace they cause by excess as barbarous as those perpetrate by the french peasantry but they have also fight for they ideal with a heroism unsurpassed by that of any french revolutionist democracy in the world equally notable as form part of this unceasing march of democracy be the progress of both socialism and woman suffrage but with these two movement we must look beyond america for they advance be not limit to any single country it become world-wide when woman suffrage be first establish in new zealand and australia the fact make little impression upon the rest of the globe but when northern europe accept the idea and finland and norway grant woman full suffrage and sweden and denmark give they almost as much the movement be everywhere recognize as important in asia woman take a active and heroic part in the struggle for liberty both in persium and in china in england the militant suffragist have force parliament to deal with they problem seriously amid much embarrassment in the united state the movement regard rather humorously at first become a matter of national weight and seriousness when in 1910 the great state of californium enfranchise its woman half a million of they woman suffrage now dominate the western state of america and be slowly move eastward -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ woman suffrage _ page 156 -rrb- socialism also though some may call it a mistaken and confused dream be yet a manifestation of democracy and as such will have its voice along with other form of the great world-spirit it have make considerable advance in america where there have recently be socialist mayor in some city and even socialist congressman but its main progress have be in europe there it can no longer be discuss as a economic theory it have become a stupendous and unevadable fact it be the labor man 's protest against the tyranny of that militarism which terrorize europe -lrb- 2 -rrb- and since military tyranny be heaviest in germany socialism have there rise to its greatest strength the increase of the socialist vote in german election become perhaps the most impressive political phenomenon of the past twenty year in 1912 this vote be more than one-third of the total vote of the empire and the socialist be the largest single party in germany the socialist of france be almost equally strong and so be those in italy when war recently threaten europe over the morocco dispute the socialist in each of these country make solemn protest to the world declare that labor man be brother everywhere and have no will to fight over any governmental problem many extremist among the brotherhood even go so far as to defy they government openly declare that if force to take up arm they would turn they against they tyrannous oppressor rather than against they helpless brother of another nation thus the burden of militarism do by its own oppressive weight rouse the oppose force of socialism to curb it -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ militarism _ page 186 -rrb- in italy the socialist be grow so powerful politically that it be largely as a political move against they that the government in 1911 suddenly declare war against turkey thus be start the series of outbreak which recently convulse southeastern europe -lrb- 1 -rrb- seldom have a war be so unjustifiable so obviously force upon a weaker nation for the sake of aggrandizement as that of italy against the young turk who be struggle to reform they land the italian seize the last of turkey 's african possession with scarce a shadow of excuse this increase of territory appeal to the pride and so-called patriotism of the italian people the easy victory in africa gratify they love of display and many of the ignorant poor who have be childish in they attachment to the romantic ideal of socialism now turn with equal childishness to applaud and support they glorious government yet even here democracy make its gain for under shelter of this popularity the government grant a demand it have long withhold male suffrage previously very limit in italy be make universal -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ the turkish-italian war _ page 140 -rrb- the humiliation of turkey in this italian war lead to another and far larger contest and to that practical elimination of turkey from european affair which have be anticipate for over a century the balkan people half free from turkey in 1876 take advantage of she weakness to form a sudden alliance and attack she all together -lrb- 2 -rrb- this also be a democratic movement a people 's war against they oppressor the bulgar most recently free of the victim of turkish tyranny hate they opponent with almost a madman 's frenzy the servian wish to free they brother serb and to strengthen themselves against the persistent encroachment of austrium the greek defeat by the turk in 1897 be eager for revenge hopeful of draw all they race into a single united state never be a war conduct with greater dash and desperation or more complete success the turk be sweep out of all they european possession except for constantinople itself and they yield to a peace which leave they nothing of europe except the mere shore line where the continent come together -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ the overthrow of turkey _ page 282 -rrb- but then there follow what most of the watcher have expect a division among the victorious ally most of these be still half savage victim of century of barbarity in they moment of triumph they turn upon one another snarl like wild beast over the spoil bulgarium the largest fiercest and most savage of the little state try to fight greece and servium together she fail in a strife quite as bloody as that against turkey the neighboring state of roumanium also take part against the bulgar so do the turk who see the helplessness of they late tigerish opponent begin snatch back the land they have cede to bulgarium -lrb- 1 -rrb- the exhaust bulgar defeat upon every side yield to they many foe -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ the second balkan war _ page 350 -rrb- thus we face to-day a new balkan peninsula consist of half a dozen little independent nation all thoroughly democratic except turkey and even turkey we should remember have make a long stride toward democracy by substitute for the autocracy of the sultan the constitutional rule of the young turk these still retain they political control though sorely shake in power by the calamity they country have undergo under they brief régime from this semi-barbarity of southeastern europe let we turn to note the more peaceful progress which seem promise the west little portugal suddenly declare herself a republic in 1910 -lrb- 2 -rrb- she have be have much anarchistic trouble before killing of king and hurl of bomb now there be a brief almost bloodless uprising and the young new king flee prophet freely predict that the unpractical and unpractised republic could not last but instead of destroy itself in petty quarrel the new government have seem to grow more able and assure with each pass year -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ portugal become a republic _ page 28 -rrb- in spain also the party favor a republic grow so strong that its leader declare openly that they could overturn the monarchy any time they wish but they say the time be not ripe they must wait until the people have become more educate politically and have learn more about self-government before they venture to attempt it here therefore we have democracy take a new and important step to man 's claim of the right of self-government be subjoin the recognition of the fact that until he reach a certain level of intelligence he be unfit to exercise that right and with it he be likely to bring himself more harm than happiness perhaps even more impressive be the struggle toward democracy in england here from the year 1905 onward a liberal government in nominal power be oppose at every turn persistently desperately sometimes hysterically by a conservative opposition the liberal after year of worsted effort see that they could make no possible progress unless they break the power of the always conservative house of lord they accomplish this in 1911 amid the weep and wail of all britain 's aristocracy who be thoroughly commit to the doctrine of the mighty teacher carlyle that man should find out they great leader and then follow these with reverent obedience of course the doctrine have in the mind of the british aristocracy the very natural addendum that _ they _ be the great leader -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ fall of the english house of lord _ page 133 -rrb- with the power of the noble thus sweep aside the british liberal go on to that long-demanded extension of democracy the grant of home rule to ireland here too england 's conservative fight the liberal desperately and here there be a subtler issue to give the conservative justification the great majority of irish be of the roman catholic faith and so would naturally set up a catholic government but a part of northern ireland be protestant and bitterly oppose to catholic domination these protestant or ulsterite demand that if the rest of ireland get home rule they must get it also and be allow to rule themselves by a separate parliament of they own the conservative accept this democratic demand as a ally of they conservative clinging to the good old law they encourage the ulsterite even to the point of open rebellion but despite every obstacle the liberal continue they effort until the home rule bill be assure in 1914 let we look now beyond europe england deserve credit for the big forward step take by she colony in south africa all of these join in 1910 in a union intend to be as indissoluble as that of the united state thus to the mighty english-speaking nation develop in a unite australium and a unite canada there be now add a third the nation of south africa -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ union of south africa _ page 17 -rrb- in asia too there be a most surprising and notable democratic step china declare itself a republic considerable fighting precede this change warfare of a character rather vague and purposeless for china be so huge that a harmony of understanding among she hundred of million be not easily attain yet on the whole with surprisingly little conflict and confusion the change be make the oldest nation in the world join hand with the youngest in adopt this modern form of government by the people -lrb- 2 -rrb- the world be still watch however to see whether the chinese have pass the level of political wisdom await by the spanish republican and can successfully exercise the dangerous right they have assume -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ the chinese revolution _ page 238 -rrb- turn back for a moment to review all the wonderful advance in popular government these brief five year accomplish : in the united state a political revolution with change of the constitution and of the machinery of government in britain similar change of government even more radical in the direction of democracy two wholly new republic add to the list one be china the oldest and most populous country in the world the other little portugal long account the most spiritless and unprogressive nation in europe a shift from autocratic british rule toward democratic home rule through all the vast region of south africa a similar shift in much-troubled ireland socialism reach out toward power through all central europe woman suffrage take possession of northern europe and western america and stride on from country to country from state to state a bloody and desperate people 's revolution in mexico and a similar one of the balkan people against turkey individual may possibly feel that some one or other of these step be reckless even perhaps that some may ultimately have to be retrace in the world 's progress but of they general glorious trend no man can doubt be there no reactionary movement to warn we of the terrible reassertion of autocratic power so soon to deluge earth with horror yes though there be few democratic defeat to measure against the splendid record of advance russium stand as she have so long stand the dragon of repression in the day of danger from she own people which have follow the disastrous japanese war russium have court she subject nation by grant they every species of favor now with she return strength she recommence she unyielding purpose of russianize they finland be deprive of the last spark of independence so that she own chief champion say of she sadly in 1910 so end finland -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ the crush of finland _ page 47 -rrb- in southern russium the persecution of the jew be recommence with charge of ritual murder and other incitement of the ignorant peasantry to massacre in asia russium reach out beyond she actual territory to strangle the new-found voice of liberty in persium russium covet the persian territory persium have establish a constitutional government a few year before this government with american help seem likely to grow strong and assure in its independence so russium in the old medieval lawlessness of power reach out and crush the persian government -lrb- 2 -rrb- at this open exertion of tyranny the world look on disapprove but not resist england in particular be almost force into a attitude of partnership with russium 's crime but she submit sooner than precipitate that universal war the menace of which come so grimly close during the strain of the outbreak around turkey the millennium of universal peace and brotherhood be obviously still far away not yet could the burden of fleet and armament be cast aside though every crisis thus overpass without the world war increase we hope of ultimately evade its unspeakable horror -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ persium 's loss of liberty _ page 199 -rrb- man 's advance in knowledge meanwhile in the calm enduring realm of scientific knowledge there be progress as there be always progress no matter what man 's cruelty to he fellow he have still he curiosity hence he continue forever gather more and more fact explain he environment he continue also molding that environment to he desire imagination make he a magician most surprising of he recent step in this exploration of he surroundings be the attainment of the south pole in 1911 -lrb- 1 -rrb- this come so swiftly upon the conquest of the north pole that it catch the world unprepared it be a unexpected triumph yet it mark the closing of a era earth 's surface have no more secret conceal from man for half a century past the only remain space of complete mystery of utter blankness on we map be the two pole and now both have be attain the gaze of man 's insatiable wonderment must hereafter be turn upon the distant star -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ discovery of the south pole _ page 218 -rrb- but man do not merely explore he environment he alter it most widespread and important of we recent remodeling of we surroundings have be the universal adoption of the automobile this machine have so increase in popularity and in practical utility that we may well call ours the automobile age the change be not merely that one form of vehicle be supersede another on we road and in we street we face a impressive theme for meditation in the fact that up to the present generation man be still as regard he individual personal transit in the same position as the roman of two thousand year ago dependent upon the horse as he swiftest mode of progress with the automobile we have suddenly double quadruple the size of we neighborhood the space which a man may cover alone at will for a ramble or a call as for speed we seem to have succumb to a actual mania for ever-increasing motion the automobile be at present the champion speed-maker the fastest means of propel himself man have yet invent but the aeroplane and the hydroplane be not far behind and even the electric locomotive have a thrill of promise for the speed maniac -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ man 's fastest mile _ page 73 -rrb- in thus develop he mastery over nature man sometimes forget he danger overstep the narrow margin of safety he have leave between himself and the baffled force of he ancient tyrant fire and water earth and air then indeed in he moment of weakness the primordial force turn upon he and he become subject to tragic and terrific punishment of such character be the most prominent disaster of these year the sinking of the ocean steamer _ titanic _ the best talent of england and america have unite to produce this monster ship which be hail as the last the biggest the most perfect thing man could do in shipbuilding it be pronounced unsinkable its captain be reckless in he confidence and nature reach down in menace from the region of northern ice and the ship perish -lrb- 1 -rrb- since then another great ship have sink under almost similar condition and with almost equal loss of life -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ tragedy of the titanic _ page 265 -rrb- oddly enough at the very moment when we have thus have reimpress upon we the uncertainty of we outward mechanical defens against the element we have be make a curious addition to we knowledge of inner means of defense the science of medicine have take several impressive stride in recent year but none more suggestive of future possibility of prolong human life than the recent work do in preserve man 's internal organ and tissue to a life of they own outside the body -lrb- 2 -rrb- already it be possible to transfer healthy tissue thus preserve or even some of the simpler organ from one body to another man begin to talk of the probability of rejuvenate the entire physical form thus science may yet bring we to encounter as actual fact the deep philosophic thought of old the thought that regard man as merely a will and a brain and the body as but the outward clothing of these mere drapery capable of be change as the spirit will there be no visible limit to this wondrous drama in which man 's patient mastering of he immediate environment be gradually teach he to mold to he purpose all the potent force of the universe -lrb- footnote 2 : see _ we progress knowledge of life surgery _ page 273 -rrb- in this assurance of ultimate success let we find such consolation as we may though world-war may continue its devastation though its increase horror may shake we civilization to the deepest depths though its wanton destruction may rob we of the hoard wealth of generation and the art treasure of all the past though its beastlike massacre may reduce the number of man fit to bear onward the torch of progress until of they million only a mere pitiable handful survive yet the step which science have already win can not be lose knowledge survive and a happier generation than ours stand some day secure against the monster of militarism shall continue to uplift man 's understanding till he dwell habitually on height as yet undreamed the united state house of governor a new machinery add to the federal form of government ad 1910 william g jordan the governor the formal establishment of the house of governor which take place in January of 1910 mark the climax of a definite movement which have sweep onward through the entire history of the united state when in 1775 the thirteen american colony make they first effort toward unite action they be in truth thirteen different nation each possess of differ tradition and a separate history and each suspicious and jealous of all the other they widely diverge interest make concerted action almost impossible during the revolutionary war and when necessity ultimately drive they to join in the close bond of the present united state they constitution be plan less for union than for the protection of each suspicious state against the aggression of the other gradually the spread of intercourse among the state have worn away they more marked differential point of character and purpose step by step the course of history have force we people into closer harmony and union to-day the forty-eight state look to one another in true brotherhood and as the final bond of that brotherhood they have establish a new organization the house of governor this constitute the only definite change make in the united state machinery of government since the begin the house of governor spring first from the suggestion of william george jordan who be afterward appropriately select as its permanent secretary hence we give here mr jordan 's own account of the movement as be its clearest possible elucidation then we give a series of brief estimate of the importance of the new step from the pen of those governor who themselves take part in the gathering in they ringing utterance you hear the voice of north and south illinois and florida of east and west massachusett and oregon and of the great central mississippus valley all announce the fraternize influence of the new step governor willson of kentucky chairman of the committee which arrange the gathering in a earnest speech to its member declare that if this conference of governor have be in existence as a institution in 1860 there would never have be a war between the state the issue of the day would have be settle by argument adjustment and compromise it would be hard to find stronger word for measure the possible importance of the new institution william g jordan the conference of the governor at washington this month mark the beginning of a new epoch in the political history of the nation it be the first meeting ever hold of the state executive as a body seek by they united influence to secure uniform law on vital subject for the welfare of the entire country it should not be confuse with the roosevelt conference of may and December 1908 it be in no sense a continuation of they it be essentially different in aim method and basis and be larger broader and more far-reaching in its possibility the nation to-day be face a grave crisis in its history vital problem affect the welfare of the whole country remain unsolved through the year have at last reach a acute stage where they _ demand _ solution this solution must come now in some form -- either in harmony with the constitution or in defiance of it the federal government have be and still be absolutely powerless to act because of constitutional limitation the state government have the sole power but heretofore no way have be provide for they to exercise that power senator elihu root point out fairly squarely and relentlessly the two great danger confront the republic : the danger of the national government break down in its effective machinery through the burden that threaten to be cast upon it and the danger that the local self-government of the state may through disuse become inefficient the house of governor plan seem to have in it possibility of master both of these evil at one stroke there be three basic weakness in the american system of government as we know it to-day there be three insidious evil that be creep like a blood-poison through the body politic threaten the very life of the republic they be kill the soul of self-government though perhaps not its form destroy its essence though perhaps not its name these three evil so intertwine as to be practically one be : the grow centralization at washington the shift undignified uncertain status of state rights and the lack of uniform law it be to propose a possible cure for these three evil that the writer send in February 1907 to president roosevelt and to the governor of the country a pamphlet on a new idea in american politics it be the institution of a new house a new representation of the people and of the state to secure uniform legislation on those question wherein the federal government could not act because of constitutional limitation the plan propose so simple that it would require no constitutional amendment to put it into effect be the organization of the house of governor more than thirty governor respond in cordial approval of the plan eight month later October 1907 president roosevelt invite the state executive to a conference at washington in may 1908 the writer point out at that time what seem a intrinsic weakness of the convention that it could have little practical result because it would be after all only a conference where the federal government by its limitation be powerless to carry the finding of the conference into effect and the governor act not as a co-operative body but as individual would be equally powerless in effect uniform legislation it be a conference of conflict power the governor be then urge to meet upon they own initiative as a body of peer work out by united state action those problem where united state action have for more than a century prove powerless at the close of the roosevelt conference the governor at a adjourn meeting appoint a committee to arrange time and place for a session of the governor in a body of they own independently of the president this movement differentiate the propose meeting absolutely from that with the president in every fundamental it essentially become more than a conference it mean a deliberative body of the governor unite to initiate to inspire and to influence uniform law the committee then name consist of three member later increase to five set the date January 18 19 and 20 1910 for the first session of the governor as a separate body william g jordan -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reproduce from _ the craftsman _ of October 1910 by permission of gustav stickley -rrb- when a new idea or a new institution confront the world it must answer all challenge show its credentials specify its claim for usefulness and prove its promise by its performance as a idea the house of governor have win the cordial approval of the american press and public as a institution it must now justify this confidence to grasp fully its power and possibility require a clear definite understanding of its spirit scope plan and purpose and its attitude toward the federal government the house of governor be a union of the governor of all the state meet annually in conference as a deliberative body -lrb- with no lawmaking power -rrb- for initiative influence and inspiration toward a better higher and more unified statehood its organization will be simple and practical avoid red-tape unnecessary formality and elaborate rule and regulation it will adopt the few fundamental expression of its principle of action and the least number of rule that be absolutely essential to enunciate its plan and scope to transmute its united wisdom into united action and to guarantee the coherence continuity and permanence of the organization despite the frequent change in its membership due to the short term of the executive in many of the state with the house of governor rest the power of secure through the cooperative action of the state legislature uniform law on vital question demand by the whole country almost since the dawn of we history but heretofore impossible of enactment the federal government be powerless to pass these law for many decade tight hold by the cramp bond of constitutional limitation it have strain and struggle like samson in the temple to find some weak spot at which it could free itself and endanger the very supporting column of the edifice of the republic it be bind in its lawmaking power to the limitation of eighteen specific phrase beyond which all power remain with the state and the people in the matter of enact uniform law the state have be equally powerless for though they constitutional right to make they be absolute and unquestioned no way have be provide by which they could exercise that right the state as individual pass they own law without consider they relation or harmony with the law of other state bring about a condition of confusion and conflict law that from they very nature should be common to all of the state in the best interest of all be now divergent different and antagonistic we have to-day the strange anomaly of forty-six state unite in a union as integral part of a single nation yet have many law of fundamental importance as different as though the state be forty-six distinct country or nationality face the duality of incapacity -- that of the government because it be not permit to act and the state because they do not know how to exercise the power they possess -- the federal government seek new power for new need through constitutional amendment this effort prove fruitless and despair for with more than two thousand attempt make in over a century only three amendment be secure and these be merely to wind up the civil war the whole fifteen amendment take together have not add the weight of a hair of permanent new power to the federal government the people and the state often sleep serenely on they rights but they never willingly surrender they yet the surrender of a right be often the brave recognition of a higher duty the fine assumption of a higher privilege in many phase the need grow urgent something have to be do by ingeniously tap the constitution to find a weak place and hammer it thin by decision by interpretation by liberal reading by technical evasion and other method need law be pass in the interest of the people and the state many of these law would not stand the rigid scrutiny of the supreme court to many of they the government 's title may now be valid by a kind of squatter 's sovereignty in legislation -- merely so many year of undisputed possession this be not the work of one administration it run with intermittent ebb and flow through many administration then the slumbering state turn restlessly in they complacency at last awake and raise a mighty cry of centralization they claim that the government be take away they rights which may be correct in essence but hardly just in form they have lose they rights primarily not through usurpation but through abrogation the government have act because of the default of the state it have practically be force to exercise power limit to the state because the state lapse through neglect and inaction then the government discover the vulnerable spot in we great charter the achille heel of the constitution it be just six innocent-looking word in section eight empower congress to regulate commerce between the several state it be a rubber phrase capable of infinite stretch it be draw out so as to cover antitrust legislation control and taxation of corporation water-power railroad rate etc pure-food law white-slave traffic and a host of other but even with the most generous extension of this phrase which though it may be necessary be surely not the original intent of the constitution the greatest number of the big problem affect the welfare of the people be still outside the province of the government and be up to the state for solution it be to meet this situation wherein the government and the state as individual could not act that the simple self-evident plan of the house of governor be propose it require no constitutional amendment or a single new law pass in any state to create it or to continue it it can not make law it would be unwise for it to make they even be it possible its sole power be as a mighty moral influence as a focus point for public opinion and as a body equal to its opportunity of transform public opinion into public sentiment and inspiring legislature to crystallize this sentiment into need law it will live only as it represent the people as it have they sympathy support and cooperation as it seek to make the will of the people prevail but this mean a longer stronger finer life than any mere legal authority could give it the house of governor have the dignity of simplicity it mean merely the conference of the state executive the highest officer and truest representative of the state on problem that be state and interstate and concerted action in recommendation to they legislature the fullest freedom would prevail at all meeting no majority vote would control the minority there would have to be a quorum decide upon as the number requisite for a initial impulse toward uniform legislation if the number approve fall below the quorum the subject would be show as not yet ripe for action and be shelve member would be absolutely free to accept or reject to do exactly as they please so no unwilling legislation could be force on any state but if a sufficient number agree these governor would recommend the passage of the desire law to they legislature in they next message the united effort would give it a greater importance a larger dynamic force and a stronger moral influence with each it would be back by the influence of the governor the power of public sentiment the leverage of the press so that the passage of the law should come easily and naturally with a few state pass it other would fall in line it would be keep a live issue and follow up and in a few year we would have legislation national in scope but not in genesis the house of governor in its attitude toward the federal government be one of right and dignified non-interference it will not use its influence with the government memorialize congress or pass resolution on national matter what the governor do or say individually be of course they right and privilege but as a body it take its stand squarely and positively at its first conference which meet in washington in January of this year as one of secure greater uniformity of state action and better state government governor hughe express it in these word : we be here in we own right as state executive we be not here to accelerate or to develop opinion with regard to matter which have be commit to federal power the state in they relation to the federal government have all need representation in they senator and congressman the attitude of the governor in they conference be one of concentration on state and interstate problem which be outside of the domain and constitutional rights of the federal government to solve there can be no interference when each confines itself to its own duty in keep the time of the nation the federal government represent the hour-hand the state unite the minute-hand there will be correct time only as each hand confines itself strictly to its own business neither attempt to jog the other but work in accord with the natural harmony wrap up in the mechanism we need to-day to draw the sharpest clear-cut line of demarcation between federal and state power this be in no spirit of antagonism but in the truest harmony for the best interest of both it mean a illumination which will show that the twilight zone so call do not exist this dark continent of legislation belong absolutely to the state and to the people in the unmistakable term of the tenth amendment : the power not delegate to the united state by the constitution or prohibit by it to the state be reserve to the state respectively and to the people this buffer territory of legislation the domain of need uniform law belong to the state and through the house of governor they may enter in and possess they own the federal government and the state be part of one great organization each have its specific duty power and responsibility and between they should be no conflict no inharmony let the federal government through congress make law up to the very maximum of its rights and duty under the constitution let the state take up they neglect duty and privilege relieve the government of those care and responsibility force upon it by the inactivity of the state and which it should never have have to assume with the burden thus equitably readjust with the dignity of the two power of government work out they individual problem in the harmony of a fuller understanding let we face the result if it then seem in the light of changed condition from those of the time of the writing of the constitution that certain control now hold by the state can not properly be exercise by they that in final decision of the best wisdom of the people this power should be vest in the federal government let the state not churlishly hold on to the casket of a dead right but surrender the living body of a responsibility and a duty to the power best able to be its guardian there be few if any of they neglect power of legislation that the state and the people act in cooperation through the house of governor will not be able to handle some of the subject upon which free discussion tend toward uniform law seem desirable be : marriage and divorce rights of married woman corporation and trust insurance child labor capital punishment direct primary convict labor and labor in general prison reform automobile regulation contract bank conveyance inheritance tax income tax mortgage initiative referendum and recall election reform tax adjustment and similar topic in great question like conservation the federal government have distinct problem it must carry out alone there be some problem that must be solve by the state alone some that may require to be work out in cooperation but the greatest part of the need conservation be that which belong to the state and which they can manage better more thoroughly more judiciously with stronger appeal to state pride upbuilding and prosperity with less conflict and clearer recognition of local need and condition and harmony with they than can the federal government four-fifth of the timber standing in the country to-day be own not by the state or the government but by private interest the house of governor will not seek uniformity merely for the sake of uniformity there be many question whereon uniform law would be unnecessary and other where it would be not only unwise but inconceivably foolish many state have purely individual problem that do not concern the other state and do not come in conflict with they but even in these the governor may gain a occasional incidental sidelight of illumination from the informal discussion in a conference that may make think clearer and action wiser the spirit that should inspire the state be the fullest freedom in purely state problem and the largest unity in law that affect important question in interstate relation while uniform law be a important element in the thought of the conference it be far from be the only one the frank easy interchange of view opinion and experience bring the governor closely together in the fine fellowship of a common purpose and a common ideal they be broaden stimulate and inspire to a keener clearer vision on a wider outlook the most significant vital and inspiring phase of these conference those which really count for most and be the strongest guaranty of the permanence and power of this movement must however remain intangible this fact be manifest in every moment of that first conference last January the fading of sectional prejudice in the glow of sympathetic understanding be clearly evident some of the western governor in they speech say that they people of the west have feel that they be isolate misrepresent misunderstand and misjudge but now these governor could go back to they state and they people with message of good will and tell they of the identity of interest the communion of purpose the kinship of common citizenship and the closer knowledge that bind they more firmly to the east to the south and to the north other governor speak of the facilitate of official business between the state because of these meeting they would no longer in correspondence write to a state executive as a mere name without personality but they letter would carry with they the memory of close contact and cordial association with those whom they have learn to know there be no faintest tinge of state jealousy or rivalry the governor talk frankly freely earnestly of they state and for they but it be ever with the honest pride of trusteeship never the petty vanity of proprietorship patriotism seem to throw down the wall of political party and partizanship and in the three day ' session the word republican or democrat be never once speak the governor show themselves a able body of man keenly alive to the importance of they work and with a firm grasp on the essential issue the meeting add a new dignity to statehood and furnish a new revelation of the power prestige and possibility of the governor 's office the atmosphere of the session be that of state ' rights but it be a new state ' rights a purify finer higher recognition by the state of they individual right and duty of self-government within they constitutional limitation it mean no lessen of interest in the federal government or of respect and honor of it it be as a family of son grow closer together strengthen as individual and work to solve those problem they have in common and to make they own way rather than to depend in weakness on the father of the household to manage all they affair and do they thinking for they to he should be leave the watchfulness of the family as a whole not the dictation of they individual living president taft have no part in the conference but in a address of welcome to the governor at the white house show he realization of the vital possibility of the meeting in these word : i regard this movement as of the utmost importance the federal constitution have stand the test of more than one hundred year in supply the power that have be need to make the central government as strong as it ought to be and with this movement toward uniform legislation and agreement between the state i do not see why the constitution may not serve we purpose always augustus e willson -lrb- 1 -rrb- governor of kentucky -lrb- footnote 1 : the follow letter be reprint by permission from a collection of such commentary from _ cottier 's weekly _ -rrb- president roosevelt hold two conference of governor and as a member of a committee choose to do so i have invite the governor of all of the state and territory to meet at the white house in washington January 18th 19th and 20th the conference have no legal authority of any kind at the previous conference the conservation subject be the one chiefly thought of and it will be bring up in the next conference the question of what the governor will recommend on the income-tax constitutional amendment may come up the matter of handle extradition papers be important uniform state law on matter of universal interest school law road law tax law commercial paper warehouse receipt bill of lade etc the control of corporation of which taxation be one branch the action of the state in regard to water-power within the state marriage divorce will school road be all within the range of this conference and the agreement of all of the governor on some of these subject and by many of they on any would be of useful influence the meeting have further interest and importance in be for two day in touch with the national civic federation which will afford all of the governor a chance to learn what that association of many of the most prominent man of this country be do and get the benefit of its discussion and the pleasure of be acquaint with many leader of thought and action in the country who will attend its session i be sure that i speak the sentiment of all of the governor that they do not wish any legal power or any authority except that of the weight of they opinion as choose state officer they only wish the benefit of discussion of important subject interesting to all of the state and to establish kindly and mutually helpful relation between the governor and the government of the state eben s draper governor of massachusett i believe that a meeting of governor may accomplish much good for every section of the country they naturally can not legislate nor should they attempt to they can discuss and can learn many thing which be now control by law in different state and which would be improvement to the law of they own state and they can recommend to the legislature of they own state the enactment of law which will bring about these improvement these governor will be the forty-six -lrb- now forty-eight -rrb- representative unit of the state of this great nation by come together they will be more than ever convince that they be integral part of one nation and i believe they meeting will tend to remove all notion of sectionalism and will help the patriotism and solidarity of the country charle s deneen governor of illinoi the conservation of natural resource often necessitate the cooperation of neighbor state in such case the discussion of propose conservation work by the representative of the state concern be of great importance it bring to the consideration of these subject the view and opinion of those most interested and best inform in regard to the question involve the same be true in relation to many subject of state legislation in which uniformity be desirable this be especially the case with regard to industrial legislation the great volume of domestic business be interstate and the industrial legislation of one state frequently affect and sometimes fix industrial condition elsewhere a example of the advantage of cooperation of state in the amendment and revision of law affect industry be see in the agreement by the commission recently appoint by new york wisconsin and minnesota to investigate the subject of employer ' liability and workman 's compensation to meet for the joint discussion of these matter the general assembly of illinoi be now convene in extraordinary session and have under consideration the appointment of a similar commission in order that it may meet and cooperate with the commission of the state name along these and other similar line it seem to I that the house of governor will be of practical advantage in the beneficial influence it will exert in the promotion of joint action where that be necessary to secure desire end frank w benson governor of oregon president roosevelt render the american people a great service when he invite the governor of the various state to a conference at the white house in 1908 the subject of conservation of we natural resource receive such attention from the assemble governor that the conservation movement have spread to all part of the country and have gain such headway that it will be of lasting benefit to we people this one circumstance alone prove the wisdom of the conference of governor and it be my earnest hope that the organization be make permanent with annual meeting at we national capital such meeting can not help but have a broaden effect upon we state executive for by interchange idea and by learn how the government of other state be conduct we governor will gain experience which ought to prove of great benefit not only to themselves but to the commonwealth which they represent matter pertain to interstate relation taxation education conservation irrigation waterway uniform legislation and the management of state institution be among the subject that the conference of governor will do well to discuss and such discussion will prove of inestimable value not only to the people of we different state but to we country as a whole the west be in the front rank of all progressive movement and welcome the conference of governor as a step in the right direction albert w gilchrist governor of florida i can only estimate the significance and importance of this conference of governor by my experience from such a conference in the past it be my good fortune to be for a week last October on the steamer excursion down the mississippus river the governor hold daily conference several elucidate the manner in which some particular governmental problem be solve in they respective state all of which be more or less interesting of the several federal matter discuss it be specially interesting to I to hear the various republican governor discuss state rights dispute the right of interference of the general government on such line it kinder make I smile in formal discussion of such matter in public in washington it be probable that such expression would not be make the result of this conference make I feel as if i know the governor and the people of the various state therein represent far better than i have before such discussion with the attend personal intercourse naturally tend to give those participate in they a broader nationality the house of governor will convene there will be many pleasant social function and many pleasant association will be form some of the governor will speak all of they will resolute they will behold evidence of the greatness of we common country and the evidence of the greatness of we public man as display in the rollick debate in the house and the knot on the log discussion of the senate everything will be as lovely as a christmas tree the house will then adjourn herbert s hadley governor of missourus during recent year the development of the national idea have carry with it a marked tendency on the part of the people to look to the national government for the correction of all evil and abuse exist in commercial industrial and political affair the importance of the state government in the solution of such question have be minimize and in some case entirely overlook although congress have be behind rather than in advance of public sentiment upon many question of national importance the congressman be elect by the people of the different congressional district and regard they most important duty as look after the interest of they respective district the united state senator be elect by the legislature of the several state and do not feel that sense of responsibility to the people that be incident to a election by the people the governor of the various state be elect by all of the people of the state and they be more directly tribune of the people than any other official either in we national or state government these officer will thus give a correct expression of the sentiment of the people of the state upon public question while these expression of opinion will naturally vary accord to the sentiment and opinion of the people of the various state represent yet on the whole they will represent more of progress and more of actual contact with present-day problem than could be secure from any similar number of public official and the address and discussion will also tend to mold the opinion of the people and have a marked influence not only upon state but also upon national legislation union of south africa ad 1910 prof stephen leacock few historical event have be so impressive as the sudden and complete union of the south-african state seldom have man 's mind progress so rapidly they life purpose change so completely in 1902 england with the aid of she african colonist in cape colony and natal be end a bitter war almost of extermination against the dutch boer of the transvaal and the orange free state in that year the ablest and most dreaded of england 's enemy in africa be the dutch general loui botha leader of the fiercest and most irreconcilable boer who still wage a hopeless guerrilla warfare against all the might of the british empire as one english paper dramatically phrase it : one use to see picture of botha in the illustrated papers in those day a gaunt bearded formidable figure with rifle and bandolier -- the most dangerous of we foe to-day he be the chief servant of the king in the federation the loyal head of the administration under the crown one of the half-dozen prime minister of the empire the responsible representative and virtual ruler of all race class and sect in south africa acclaimed by the man he lead in the battle and the rout no less than by the man who face he across the muzzle of the mauser ten year ago be ever so strange a transformation so swift a oblivion of old enmity and rancor so rapid a growth of union and concord out of hatred and strife necessity have in a way compel this harmony the old issue of boer independence be dead new and equally vital issue confront the south-african the whites there be scarcely more than a million in number and they dwell amid many time they number of savage black they must unite or perish moreover the folly and expense of maintain four separate government for so small a population be obvious so be the need of uniform tariff in a land where all sea-coast town find they prosperity in forwarding supplies to the rich central mining region of kimberley and johannesburg hence all earnest man of whatever previous opinion come to see the need of union and when this union have be accomplish lord gladstone the british viceroy over south africa wisely select as the fittest man for the land 's first prime minister general botha botha have seek to unite all interest in the cabinet which he gather around he the clear analysis of the new nation and its situation which follow be reproduce by permission from the _ american political science review _ and be from the pen of professor stephen leacock head of the department of political economy of mcgill university in montreal canada a distinguished citizen of one great british federation may well be accept as the ablest commentator on the foundation of another on may 31 1910 the union of south africa become a accomplished fact the four province of cape colony natal the orange free state -lrb- which bear again its old-time name -rrb- and the transvaal be henceforth join one might almost say amalgamate under a single government they will bear to the central government of the british empire the same relation as the other self-governing colony -- canada newfoundland australium and new zealand the empire will thus assume the appearance of a central nucleus with four outlying part correspond to geographical and racial division and form in all a ground-plan that seem to invite a renewal of the effort of the imperial federationist to the scientific student of government the union of south africa be chiefly of interest for the sharp contrast it offer to the federal structure of the american canadian and other system of similar historical ground it represent a reversion from the idea of state rights and balanced indestructible power and a attempt at organic union by which the constituent part be to be more and more merge in the consolidated political unit which they combine to form but the union and its making be of great interest also for the general student of politics and history concerned rather with the development of a nationality than with the nicety of constitutional law from this point of view the union come as the close of a century of strife as the aftermath of a great war and indicate the consummation for the first time in history of what appear as a solid basis of harmony between the two race in south africa in one shape or other union have always be the goal of south-african aspiration it be union which the prance proconsul of a earlier time -- the frere the shepstone and the lanyon -- try to force upon the dutch a unite africa be at once the dream of a rhode and -lrb- perhaps -rrb- the ambition of a kruger it be necessary to appreciate the strength of this desire for union on the part of both race and the intense south-african patriotism in which it rest in order to understand how the different section and race of a country so recently lock in the death-struggle of a three year ' war could be bring so rapidly into harmonious concert the point be well illustrate by look at the composition of the convention which in its session at durban cape town and bloemfontein put together the present constitution south africa from its troubled history have prove itself a land of strong man but it be reserve for the recent convention to bring together within the compass of a single council-room the survive leader of the period of conflict to work together for the making of a united state in look over the list of they and reflect on the part that they play toward one another in the past one realize that we have here a grim irony of history among they be general loui botha prime minister at the moment of the transvaal and now the first prime minister of south africa botha in the day of general buller and the dugelum be the hardest fighter of the boer republic beside he in the convention be dr jameson whom botha want to hang after the raid in 1896 another member be sir george farrar who be sentence to death for complicity in the raid and still another sir percy fitzpatrick once the secretary of the reform league at johannesburg and well know as the author of the transvaal from within one may mention in contrast general jan smut a ex-leader of the boer force and since the war the organize brain of the het volk party there be also mr merriman a leader of the british party of opposition to the war in 1899 and since then a bitter enemy of lord milner and the new regime yet strangely enough after some four month of session the convention accomplish the impossible by frame a constitution that meet the approval of the unite delegate of its proceedings no official journal be keep the convention meet first at durban October 12 1908 where it remain throughout that month after a fortnight 's interval it meet again at capetown and with a three week ' interruption at christmas continue and complete its work at the end of the first week of February the constitution be then lay before the different colonial parliament in the transvaal its acceptance be a matter of course as the delegate of both party have reach a agreement on its term the cape parliament pass amendment which involve give up the scheme of proportional representation as adopt by the convention similar amendment be offer by the orange river colony in which the dutch leader sympathize with the leader of the afrikanderbond at the cape in desire to swamp out rather than represent minority in natal which as a ultra-british and ultra-loyal colony be generally suppose to be in fear of union many amendment be offer the convention then meet again at bloemfontein make certain change in the draft of the constitution and again submit the document to the colony this time it be accept only in natal be it think necessary to take a popular vote and here contrary to expectation the people vote heavily in favor of union the logic of the situation compel it in the history of the movement natal be cast for the same role as rhode island in the making of the federal union of the united state of america the other colony once bring together into a single system with power to adopt arrangement in they own interest in regard to custom duty and transportation rate sheer economic pressure would have compel the adhesion of natal in the constitution now put in force in south africa the central point of importance be that it establish what be practically a unitary and not a federal government the underlying reason for this be find in the economic circumstance of the country and in the situation in which the province find themselves during the year after the war till that event the discord of south africa be generally think of rather as a matter of racial rivalry and conflict sovereignty than of simple question of economic and material interest but after the conclusion of the compact of vereinige in 1902 it be find that many of the jealousy and difficulty of the respective community have survive the war and rest rather upon economic consideration than racial rivalry to begin with there be the question of custom relation the colony be separate unit each jealous of its own industrial prosperity each have the right to make its own tariff and yet the division of the country with four different tariff area be obviously to its general disadvantage since 1903 the province have be hold together under the custom union of south africa -- make by the government of the cape and natal and the crown colony government of the conquered province this be but a makeshift arrangement with a common tariff make by treaty and hence rigidly unalterable and with a pro-rata division of the proceeds worse still be the railroad problem which have be in south africa a bone of contention ever since the opening of the mine of the rand offer a rich prize to any port and railway that could capture the transit trade the essence of the situation be simple the center of the wealth of south africa be the johannesburg mine this may not be forever the case but in the present undeveloped state of agriculture and industrial life johannesburg be the dominate factor of the country now johannesburg can not feed and supply itself it be too busy its one export be gold its quarter of a million people must be supply from the outside but the transvaal be a inland country dependent on the seaport of other community in position johannesburg be like the hub of a wheel from which the railway radiate as spoke to the seaport along the rim the line from cape town to johannesburg a distance of over 700 mile be the first complete and until 1894 the cape enjoy a monopoly of carry the whole trade of johannesburg but with the completion of the tunnel through the mountain at laing 's nek the natal government railway be able to connect with johannesburg and the port of durban enter into competition with the cape port of cape town and east london over a line only 485 mile long finally the opening of the delagoa bay railway in 1894 supply johannesburg with a access to the sea over a line 396 mile long of which 341 be in the transvaal itself this last line it should be notice lead to a portuguese seaport and at the time of its building traverse nowhere british territory hence it come about that in the all-important matter of railroad communication the interest of the transvaal and of the seaboard colony be diametrically oppose to earn as large a revenue as possible it naturally adjust the rate on its line so as to penalize the freight from the colony and favor the delagoa bay road when the colony try in 1895 to haul freight by ox-team from they rail-head at the frontier to johannesburg president kruger close the drift and almost precipitate a conflict in arm since the war the same situation have persist aggravate by the completion of the harbor work and dock at lorenzo marque which favor more than ever the delagoa route the portuguese seaport at present receive some 67 per cent of the traffic from the rand while the cape port which in 1894 have 80 per cent of the freight now receive only n per cent under lord milner 's government the unification of the railway of the transvaal and the orange river colony with the central south-african railway amalgamate the interest of the inland colony but leave they still oppose to those of the seaboard the impossibility of harmonize the situation under exist political condition have be one of the most potent force in create a united government which alone could deal with the question a equally important factor have be the standing problem of the native race which form the background of south-african politics in no civilized country be this question of such urgency south africa with a white population of only 1133000 people contain nearly 7000000 native and color inhabitant many of they such as the zulus and the basuto fierce warlike tribe scarcely affect by european civilization and want only arm and organization to offer a grave menace to the welfare of the white population the zulus numbering a million inhabit a country of swamp and jungle impenetrable to european troops have not forget the prowess of a cetewayo and the victory of isandhwana it may well be that some day they will try the fortune of one more general revolt before accept the permanent over-lordship of they conqueror natal life in apprehension of such a day throughout all south africa among both british and dutch there be a feeling that great britain know nothing of the native question the british people see the native through the softly tinted spectacles of exeter hall when they have give he a bible and a breech-cloth they fondly fancy that he have become one of themselves and urge that he shall enter upon he political rights they do not know that to a savage or a half-civilized black a ballot-box and a voting-paper be about as comprehensible as a telescope or a pocket camera -- it be just a part of the white man 's magic contain some particular kind of devil of its own the south-africans think that they understand the native and the first tenet of they gospel be that he must be keep in he place they have see the hideous torture and mutilation inflict in every native war if the native revolt they mean to shoot he into marmalade with machine gun such be they simple creed and in this matter they want nothing of what mr merriman recently call the damnable interference of the mother country but to handle the native question there have to be create a single south-african government competent to deal with it the constitution create for south africa a union entirely different from that of the province of canada or the state of the american republic the government be not federal but unitary the province become area of local government with local elect council to administer they but the south-african parliament reign supreme it be to know nothing of the nice division of jurisdiction set up by the american constitution and by the british north america act there be of course limit to its power in the strict sense of legal theory the omnipotence of the british parliament as in the case of canada remain unimpaired nor can it alter certain thing -- for example the native franchise of the cape and the equal status of the two language -- without a special majority vote but in all the ordinary conduct of trade industry and economic life its power be unhamper by constitutional limitation the constitution set up as the government of south africa a legislature of two house -- a senate and a house of assembly -- and with it a executive of minister on the customary tenure of cabinet government this government strangely enough be to inhabit two capital : pretorium as the seat of the executive government and cape town as the meeting-place of the parliament the experiment be a novel one the case of simlum and calcutta in each of which the indian government do its business and on the strength of which lord curzon have defend the south-african plan offer no real parallel the truth be that in south africa as in australium it prove impossible to decide between the claim of rival city cape town be the mother city of south africa pretorium may boast the memory of the fall republic and its old-time position as the capital of a independent state bloemfontein have the advantage of a central position and even garish johannesburg might claim the privilege of the money power the present arrangement stand as a temporary compromise to be alter later at the will of the parliament the making of the senate demand the gravest thought it be desire to avoid if possible the drowsy nullity of the canadian upper house and the preponderating bossiness of the american nor do the example of australium where the senate elect on a general ticket over huge provincial area become thereby a sort of national labor convention give any assistance in a positive direction the plan adopt be to cause each present provincial parliament and later each provincial council to elect eight senator the plan of election be by proportional representation into the arithmetical juggle of which it be impossible here to enter eight more senator will be appoint by the governor make forty in all proportional representation be apply also in the first draft of the constitution to the election of the assembly it be think that such a plan would allow for the representation of minority so that both dutch and british delegate would be return from all part of the country unhappily the afrikanderbond -- the powerful political organization support mr merriman and hold the bulk of the dutch vote at the cape -- take fright at the proposal even merriman and he colleague have to vote it down without this they could not have save the principle of equal rights which mean the more or less equal -lrb- proportionate -rrb- representation of town and country the town be british and the country dutch so the bearing of equal rights be obvious proportional representation and equal rights be in the end square off against one another south africa will retain duality of language both dutch and british be in official use there be no other method open the dutch language be probably doom to extinction within three or four generation it be in truth not one linguistic form but several : the taal or kitchen dutch of daily speech the lingua franca of south africa the school taal a modified form of it and the high dutch of the scriptural translation bring with the boer from holland behind this there be no national literature and the current dutch of holland and its book vary some from all of they english be already the language of commerce and convenience the only way to keep dutch alive be to oppose its use already the bitterness of the war have have this effect and language society be do they best to uphold and extend the use of the ancestral language it be with a full knowledge of this that the leader of the british party acquiesce in the principle of duality the native franchise be another difficult question at present neither native nor colored man -lrb- the south-african term for man of mixed blood -rrb- can vote in the transvaal the orange river and natal nor be there the faintest possibility of the suffrage be extend to they both the dutch and the british be convince that such a policy be a mistake in the cape native and color man if possess of the necessary property and able to write they name be allow to vote the name writing be say to be a farce the native draw a picture of he name under guidance of he political boss some 20000 native and color people thus vote at the cape and neither the progressive nor the bond party dare to oppose the continuance of the franchise lest the native vote should be throw solid against they as a result each province will retain its own suffrage at least until the south-african parliament by a special majority of two-third in a joint session shall decide otherwise the future conformation of party under the union be difficult to forecast at present the dutch party -- they may be call so for lack of a better word -- have large majority everywhere except in natal in the transvaal general botha 's party -- het volk the party of the people -- be greatly in the ascendant but it must be remember that het volk number many british adherent for instance mr hull botha 's treasurer in the outgoing government be a old johannesburg reformer of the uitlander day and fight against the boer in the war in the orange free state the party call the unie -lrb- or unite party -rrb- have a large majority while at the cape dr jameson 's party of progressive can make no stand against mr merriman mr malan mr sauer and the powerful organization of the afrikanderbond how the new government will be form it be impossible to say botha and merriman will of course constitute its leading factor but whether they will attempt a coalition by take in with they such man as sir percy fitzpatrick and dr jameson or will prefer a more united and less universal support be still a matter of conjecture from the outsider 's point of view a coalition of british and dutch leader work together for the future welfare of a common country would seem a auspicious opening for the new era but it must be remember that general botha be under no necessity whatever to form such a coalition if he so wish he can easily rule the country without it as far as a parliamentary majority go not long since a illustrious south-african a visitor to montreal voice the opinion that botha 's party will rule south africa for twenty year undisturbed but it be impossible to do more than conjecture what will happen _ ex africa semper quid novi _ most important of all be the altered relation in which south africa will now stand to the british empire the imperial government may now be say to evacuate south africa and to leave it to the control of its own people it be true that for the time be the imperial government will continue to control the native protectorate of basutoland bechuanaland and swaziland but the constitution provide for the future transfer of these to the administration of a commission appoint by the colonial government provision be also make for the future inclusion of rhodesium within the union south africa will therefore find itself on practically the same footing as canada or australium within the british empire what its future fate there will be no man can yet foretell in south africa as in the other dominion a intense feeling of local patriotism and colonial nationalism will be match against the historic force and the practical advantage of the imperial connection even in canada there be no use in deny it there be powerful force which if unchecked would carry we to a ultimate independence still more be this the case in south africa it be a land of bitter memory the little people that fight for they republic against a world in arm have not so soon forget it be idle for we in the other part of the empire to suppose that the bitter memory of the conflict have yet pass that the dutch have forget the independence for which they fight the vier klur flag that be hide in they garret still and the twenty thousand woman and child that lie bury in south africa as the harvest of the conqueror if south africa be to stay in the empire it will have to be because the empire will be make such that neither south africa nor any other of the dominion would wish to leave it for this much have already be do the liberation of the transvaal and orange river from the thraldom of they crown colony government and the frank acceptance of the union constitution by the british government be the first step in this direction meantime that future of south africa as of all the empire lie behind a veil portugal become a republic ad 1910 william archer the wave of democratic revolt which have sweep over europe during the first decade of the twentieth century be continue in 1910 by the revolution in portugal this as the result of long secret planning burst forth suddenly before dawn on the morning of October 4th before nightfall the revolution be accomplish and the young king manuel be a fugitive from he country the change have be long foresee the selfishness and blindness of the portuguese monarch and they supporter have be such as to make rebellion inevitable and its ultimate success certain mr william archer the note english journalist who be send post-haste to watch the progress of the revolution could not reach the scene before the brief tumult be at a end but he here give a picture of the joyous celebration of freedom that follow and then trace with power and historic accuracy the cause and conduct of the dramatic scene which have add portugal to the ever-growing list of republic when the poet wordsworth and he friend jone land at calai in 1790 they find france standing on the top of golden year and human nature seem bear again not once but fifty time in portugal these line come back to my mind the parallel it may be say be a ominous one in view of subsequent manifestation of the reborn french human nature but there be a world of difference between portugal and france between the house of braganza and the house of bourbon it be nearly one in the morning when my train from badajoz draw into the rocio station at lisbon yet i have no sooner pass the barrier than i hear a band in the great hall of the station strike up a unfamiliar but not unpleasing air the rhythm of which plainly announce it to be a national anthem -- a conjecture confirm by a wild burst of cheer at the close the reason of this midnight demonstration i never ascertain but indeed no one in lisbon ask for a reason for strike up a portugueza the new patriotic song before twenty-four hour have pass i be perfectly familiar with its rather plaintive than martial strain suit no doubt to the sentimental character of the people a american friend who arrive a day or two after I make acquaintance with a portugueza even more immediately than i do soon after pass the frontier he fall into conversation with a portuguese fellow traveler who in the course of ten minute or so ask he whether he would like to hear the new national anthem and then and there sing it to he amid great applause from the other occupant of the compartment in the cafés and theater of lisbon a portugueza may break out at any moment without any apparent provocation and you must of course stand up and uncover but there be in some quarter a movement of protest against these observance as savor of monarchical flunkyism when i leave lisbon at half-past seven be there be no demonstration such as have greet my arrival but at the first halting-place a man step out from a little crowd on the platform and shout viva machado dos santos viva a republica portugueza -- and i find that the compartment adjoining my own be illumine by the presence of the bright particular star of the revolt at the next station -- torre vedra of historic fame -- the platform be crowd and score of red and green flag be wave as the train steam in two band strike up a portugueza and as one have about two minute ' start of the other the effect be more patriotic than harmonious the hero have no sooner alighted than he be lift shoulder-high by the crowd and carry in triumph from the station amid the blaring of the band and the crackling of innumerable little detonator which here enter freely into the ritual of rejoice next morning i read in the papers a full account of the apoteose of machado dos santo which seem to have keep torre vedras busy and happy all day long one can not but smile at such simple-minded ebullition of feeling yet i would by no means be understand to laugh at they on the contrary they be so manifestly spontaneous and sincere as to be really touching whatever may be the future of the portuguese republic it have give the nation some week of unalloyed happiness and amid all the shouting and wave of flag all the manifold homage to this hero and to that there be not the slightest trace of rowdyism or of mafficking i could not think without some humiliation of the contrast between a lisbon and a london crowd it really seem as though happiness have ennoble the man in the street i be assure that on the day of the public funeral of dr bombarda and admiral do real though the crowd be enormous and the police have retire into private life there be not the smallest approach to disorder the police -- formerly the swear enemy of the populace -- have be reinstate at the time of my visit without they sword and pistol but they seem to have little to do that lisbon have become a strictly virtuous city it would be too much to affirm but i believe that crime actually diminish after the revolution it seem as though the nation have awaken from a nightmare to a sunrise of health and hope and the nightmare take the form of a poor bewildered boy guilty only of have be thrust without a spark of genius into a situation which only genius could have save in that surface aspect of the case there be a almost ludicrous disproportion between cause and effect but it be not what the young king be that matter -- it be what he stand for let we look a little below the surface -- even if we can into the soul of the people portugal be a small nation with a great history and the pride of a small nation which have anything to be proud of be apt to amount to a passion it be all the more sensitive because it can not swell and harden into arrogance it be all the more alert because the great nation in they arrogance be apt to ignore it what be the main source of portugal 's pride they be two : she national independence and she achievement in discovery and colonization a small country with no very clear natural frontier she have maintain she independence under the very shadow of a far larger and at one time a enormously preponderant power portugal be portugal long before spain be spain it have its alfr the great in alfonso henrique -lrb- bear 1111 -- a memorable date in two sens -rrb- who drive back the moor as alfred drive back the dane he found a dynasty of able and energetic king which however degenerate as dynasty will until a vain weakling ferdinand the handsome do he best to wreck the fortune of the country on he death in 1383 portugal be within a ace of fall into the clutch of castile but the corte confer the kingship on a bastard of the royal house john master of the knight of aviz and he aid by five hundred english archer inflict a crush defeat on the spaniard at aljubarrota the portuguese bannockburn john of aviz know as the great married philippa of lancaster daughter of john of gaunt and from this union spring a line of prince and king under whom portugal become one of the lead nation of europe prince henry the navigator son of john the great devoted he life to the further of maritime adventure and discovery like england 's first lord of the admiralty he be a navigator who do not navigate but it be unquestionably owe to the impulse he give to portuguese enterprise that vasco da gama discover the sea route to indium and pedro alvarez cabral secure for he country the giant colony of brazil angolum mozambique diu goa macao -- these name mean as much for portugal as havana cartagena mexico and lima for spain the sixteenth century be the heroic age of portuguese history and the hero -- notably the viceroy of portuguese indium -- be in fact a race of fine soldier and administrator no nation moreover possess more conspicuous and splendid memorial of its golden age it be literally golden for emmanuel the fortunate who reap the harvest sow by henry the navigator be the wealthiest monarch in europe and give he name to the emmanueline style of architecture a florid gothic which achieve miracle of ostentation and sometimes of beauty as the glorious pile of batalha commemorate the victory of aljubarrota so the splendid church and monastery of belem mark the spot where vasco da gama spend the night before he sail on he epoch-making voyage but it be not gold that raise the noblest memorial to portugal 's greatness : it be the genius of luis de camoens if spenser instead of lose himself in maze of allegoric romance have sing of crécy and agincourt of drake frobisher and raleigh he might have give we a national epic in the same sense in which the term apply to _ the lusiad _ with such a history so write in stone and song what wonder if pride of race be one of the mainspring of portuguese character but the house of aviz like the legitimate line of affonso henrique dwindle into debility it flicker out in dom sebastian who drag he country into a mad invasion of morocco and vanish from human ken on the disastrous battlefield of alcazar-khebir then for sixty year not by conquest but by intrigue portugal pass under the sway of spain and lose to the enemy of spain -- that be to say to england and holland -- a large part of she colonial empire at last in 1640 a well-planned and daring revolution expel the spanish intruder and place on the throne john duke of braganza as the house of aviz be a illegitimate branch of the stock of affonso henrique so the braganza be a illegitimate branch of the house of aviz with none of the plantagenet blood in they only one prince of the line pedro ii can be say to have attain anything like greatness another joseph have the sense to give a free hand to a able if despotic minister the marquis of pombal but on the whole the history of the braganza rule be one of steady decadence until the second half of the nineteenth century find the country one of the most backward in europe nor be there any comfort to be find in the economic aspect of the case a country of glorious fertility and ideal climatic condition inhabit by a industrious peasantry portugal be nevertheless so poor that much of its remain strength be year by year be drain away by emigration the public debt be almost as heavy per head of population as that of england taxation be crush the barest necessaries of life be subject to heavy impost protection protect not industry but monopoly and vested interest in short the material condition of the country be as distressing as its spiritual state to any one with the smallest sense of enlighten patriotism king charle i -- name of evil omen -- ascend the throne in 1889 he situation be not wholly unlike that of the english charle i inasmuch as -- though he have not the insight to perceive it -- he lot be cast in time when portugal be outgrow the tradition and method of he family representative government as it have shape itself since 1852 be a fraud and a farce to every municipality a government administrator be attach -lrb- at a annual cost to the country of something like # 70000 -rrb- whose business it be to work the election in concert with the local _ cacique _ or boss thus except in the great town the government candidate be always return the efficacy of the system may be judge from the fact that in a country which be at heart republican as event have amply show the republican party never have more than fourteen representative in a chamber of about 150 for the rest the monarchical party regeneradore and progresista arrange between they a fair partition of the loaf and fish this rotative system as it be call be in effect that which prevail or have prevail in spain but it be perfect in portugal by a device which enable minister in step out of office under the crown to step into well-paid post in financial institution more or less associate with the state anything like real progress be manifestly impossible under so rotten a system and with this system the monarchy be identify then come the scandal of the _ adeantamento _ or illegal advance make to the king beyond the sum vote in the civil list it be only fair to remember that the king of a poor country be nowadays in a very uncomfortable position more especially if the poor country have once be immensely rich the expense of royalty like those of all other profession have enormously increase of late year and a petty king who be to rub shoulder with emperor be very much in the position of a man with # 2000 a year in a club of millionaire he have always the resource no doubt of decline the society of emperor and even fix he domestic budget more in accord with present exigency than with the sumptuous tradition the palace and pleasure-house of he millionaire predecessor it be say of pedro ii that he have the wisdom and self-restraint not to increase the tax prefer to reduce the expense of he household to the lowest possible amount but dom carlo be not a man of this kidney easy-going and self-indulgent he have no notion of appear _ in forma pauperis _ among the royalty of europe or sacrifice he pleasure to the need of he country even he father dom lui and he uncle dom pedro have not live within they income and expense have go up since they time the king 's income under the civil list be a conto of reis a day or something over # 80000 a year additional allowance to other member of the royal family amount to about half as much again and there be i believe a allowance for the upkeep of palace one would suppose that a reasonably frugal royal family with no house-rent to pay could subsist in tolerable comfort on some # 2250 a week but as a matter of fact dom carlo make large additional draft on the treasury which servile ministry honor without protest he have expensive fantasy which he be not in the habit of stint the total of he anticipation i do not know but it be estimate in million of pound these eccentricity combine with other abuse of finance and administration render even the _ cacique _ - choose corte unruly and we charle i look about for a strafford who should apply a thorough remedy to what he call the parliamentary _ gâchis _ he find he man in joão franco this somewhat enigmatic personage can not as yet be estimate with any impartiality no one accuse he of personal corruption or of sordidly interested motive he great private wealth enable he the other day to find bail at a moment 's notice to the amount of # 40000 on the other hand he enemy diagnose he after the manner of lombroso and find he to be a degenerate and a epileptic ungovernably irritable vain mendacious arrogant sometimes quite irresponsible for he action a really strong man he can scarcely be scarcely a man of true political insight else he would not have try to play the despot with no plausible ideal to allege in defense of he usurpation be that as it may he agree with the king that it be impossible to carry on the work of government with a fractious corte in session and that the only way to keep thing go be to try the experiment of a dictatorship dom carlo in he genial fashion overcome by help of a anecdote any doubt he minister may have feel when the affair of frederick the great be at a low ebb say the king he one day on the eve of a decisive battle catch a grenadier in the act of make off from the camp ` what be you about ' ask frederick ` you majesty i be desert ' stammer the soldier ` wait till to-morrow ' reply frederick calmly ` and if the battle go against we we will desert together ' thus lightly be the adventure plot and in fact the minister do not desert until the king lay dead upon the field of battle franco dissolve the corte and on may 10 1907 publish a decree declare the administration to be a dictatorship the press be strictly gag and all the traditional weapon of despotism be polish up in June the dictator go to oporto to defend he policy at a public banquet and on he return a popular tumult take place in the rocio the central square of lisbon which be repress with serious bloodshed this be make the excuse for still more galling restriction on personal and intellectual liberty until it be hard to distinguish between administrative dictatorship and autocracy as regard the _ adeantamento _ franco 's declare policy be to make a clean slate of the past and for the future to augment the civil list in the autumn of that year a very able spanish journalist and deputy señor lui morote visit most of the lead man in portugal and find among the republican a absolute and serene confidence that the monarchy be in its last ditch and that a republic be inevitable seldom have political prophecy be more completely fulfil than those which morote then record in the _ heraldo _ of madrid say bernardino machado : the republic be the fatherland organize for its prosperity i believe in the moral force of portugal which be carry we directly toward the new order of thing we shall triumph because the right be on we side and the moral idealism peacefully if we can and i think it pretty sure that we can since no public force can stop a nation on the march say guerra junqueiro the lead poet of the day : within two year there will be no braganza or there will be no portugalthe revolution when it come will be a question of hour and it will be almost bloodless i could cite many other deliverance to the same effect but one must suffice theophilo braga the grand old man of portugal say : to stimulate the faith conscience will and revolutionary energy of the country i have impose on myself a plan of work and a mandate not to die until i see it accomplish the paris _ temp _ of November 14 1907 publish a interview with dom carlo which embittered feeling and alienate many of he supporter everything be quiet in lisbon declare the king echo another historic phase : only the politicaster be agitate themselves it be necessary that the _ gâchis _ -- there be no other word for it -- should one day come to a end i require a undaunted will which should be equal to the task of carry my idea to a happy conclusion i be entirely satisfy with m franco _ ça marche _ and it will continue it must continue for the good of the country in no country can you make a revolution without the army well the portuguese army be faithful to its king and i shall always have it at my side i have no shadow of doubt of its fidelity poor charle the first at the end of January 1908 a revolutionary plot be discover and be put down with severity after sign some decree to that end at one of he palace beyond the tagus the king with he whole family return to lisbon and the party drive in open carriage from the wharf toward the necessidade palace in the crowd at the corner of the great riverside square the praça do comercio stand two man name buiça and costa with carbine conceal under they cloak they shoot dead the king and the crown prince and slightly wound dom manuel both the assassin be kill on the spot it be say that there be no plot and that these man act entirely on they own initiative and responsibility at any rate none of the republican leader be in any way implicate in the affair but on all saint ' day of 1910 buiça 's grave share to the full in the rain of wreath pour upon the tomb of the martyr of the new republic and relic of the regicide hold a honor place in the historical museum which commemorate the revolution franco vanish into space and dom manuel aged nineteen ascend the throne have he possess strong intelligence and character or have he fall into the hand of really able adviser it be possible that the revulsion of feeling follow on so grim a tragedy might have indefinitely prolong the life of the monarchy but he mother be a bourbon and what more need be say the opinion in lisbon at any rate be that under dom carlo the jesuit enter the palace by the back door under dom manuel by the front door the republican agitation in public the revolutionary organization in secret soon recommence with renew vigor and the discovery of new scandal in connection with the tobacco monopoly and a financial institution know as the credito predial add fuel to the fire of indignation the government or rather a succession of government be perfectly aware that the foundation of the monarchy be undermine but they seem to be paralyze by a sort of fatalistic despair they persecute indeed just enough to make themselves doubly odious but they always lay hand on people who if not quite innocent be subordinate and uninfluential not one of the real leader of the revolution be arrest the thoroughness with which the republican party be organize say much for the practical ability of its leader the move spirit in the central committee be vice-admiral candido do reis affonso costa -lrb- now minister of justice -rrb- joao chaga and dr miguel bombarda simo raposo speak in the name of the freemason the carbonarium portugueza a powerful secret society be represent by machado do santo a officer in the navy there be a separate finance committee and fund be ample the arm buy be mostly browning pistol which be smuggle over the spanish frontier by republican railway conductor bomb also be prepare in large number not for purpose of assassination but for use in open warfare especially against cavalry meanwhile a untiring secret propaganda be go on in the army in the navy and among the peasantry almost every seaman in the navy and in many regiment almost all the non-commissioned officer and man be revolutionary while commission officer by the score be win over it be marvelous that so wide-spread a propaganda be only vaguely know to the government and do not beget a crowd of informer one man it be true who show a disposition to use he secret knowledge for purpose of blackmail be find dead in the street of cascae on the whole not only secrecy but discipline be marvelously maintain at last the propitious moment arrive three ship of war -- the _ dom carlo _ the _ adamastor _ and the _ san raphael _ -- be in the tagus to do honor to the president-elect of brazil who be visit king manuel but the government know that they presence be dangerous and would certainly order they off again as soon as possible the blow must be strike before that occur at a meeting of the committee on October 2 1910 it be agree that the signal should be give in the early morning of October 4th all the part be cast all the duty be assign : who should call this and that barrack to arm who should cut this and that railway line who should take possession of the central telegraph-office and so forth the whole scheme be lay down in detail in a precious paper in the keep of simôes raposo you have better give it to I say dr bombarda for i be less likely than you to be arrest even if they should think of search at rilhafolle -lrb- the asylum of which he be director -rrb- i can easily hide it in one of the book of my library he suggestion be accept the paper on which they life and that of the republic depend be hand to he and the meeting break up on the morning of Monday October 3d all be as quiet in lisbon as king carlo himself could have desire at about eleven o'clock dr bombarda sit in he office at the asylum when a former patient a young lieutenant who have suffer from the persecution mania be announce to see he bombarda rise and ask he how he be without a word the visitor produce a browning pistol and fire point blank at the physician put three bullet in he body bombarda have strength enough to seize he assailant by the wrist and hand he over to the attendant who rush in he then walk down-stair unaid before he realize how serious be he wound it soon appear however that he have not many hour to live and when this become clear to he he take a paper from he pocketbook and insist that it should be burn before he eye what the paper be i need not say at about six in the evening he die bombarda be a passionate anticlerical and he murderer be a fanatical catholic the citizen with whom he be very popular jump at the conclusion that the priest have inspire the deed as soon as he death be announce in the transparency outside the office of _ o seculo _ there be demonstration of anger among the crowd and some conflict with the police meanwhile the revolutionary committee to the number of fifty or thereabout be sit in the rua da esperança discuss the question to be or not to be the military member counsel delay for the government have order all officer to be at they quarter in the various barracks which be scatter over the city the intention have be to choose a time when most of the officer be off duty and the man could mutiny at they ease but this plan have for the moment be frustrate the military view might have carry the day but for the determination show by candido do real who point out that it would be madness to give the government time to order the ship out of the tagus finally he turn to the military group say if you will not go out i will go out alone with the sailor i shall have the honor of get myself shoot by my comrade of the army he insistence carry all before it and it be decide that the signal should be give as previously arrange at one o'clock in the morning that evening at the palace of belem some two mile down the tagus from the necessidade palace marshal herme da fonseca president-elect of brazil be entertaining king manuel at a state dinner there be a electrical sense of disquiet in the air several official guest be absent and every few minute there come telephone-call for this or that minister or general some of whom reappear while some do not at last the tension get so much on the nerve of the young king that he scribble on he menu-card a request that the banquet might be shorten and in fact one or two course be omit then follow the dreary ritual of toast and at last at half-past eleven dom manuel part from he host and set off in he automobile escort by a troop of cavalry two band play the royal anthem have he known poor youth that he be never to hear it again there might have be a crumb of consolation in the thought it would be impossible without a map to make clear the various phase of the battle of lisbon nor would there be any great interest in so do there be no particular strategy in the revolutionary plan and what strategy there be fall to piece at a early point it be not clear that the signal be ever formally give but about the appoint hour mutiny break out in several barracks in some case the royalist officer be put under arrest in one case a colonel and two other officer be shoot a mixed company of soldier and civilian with ten or twelve gun march as have be arrange upon the necessidade palace to demand the abdication of the king but they be meet on the height behind the palace by a body of the guardium municipal and after a sharp skirmish be force to retire leave three of they gun disabled behind they they retreat to the general rallying-point of the republican force the rotunda at the upper end of the mile-long avenida da liberdade this avenue stand to the rocio very much in the relation of chare cross road to trafalgar square : there be a curve at they junction which prevent you from see -- or shooting -- from the one into the other on reach the rotunda the insurgent learn that the rocio have be occupy by royalist troops from the citadel of st george and another barrack with one or two machine gun but no cannon there then the two force lay with a short mile of sloping ground between they await the dawn under cover of darkness a body of mount gendarme attempt to charge the insurgent position but they be repulse by bomb meanwhile what have become of the naval cooperation on which so much reliance have be place it have fail through the tragic weakness of one man candido dos reis be one of the canonize saint of the republic but i think it show a good deal of generosity in the portuguese character that the devil 's advocate have not make himself hear in the case do real have undertake the command of the naval side of the revolt but oddly enough he seem to have arrange no method of conveyance to he post of duty he find at the wharf a small steamer the captain of which agree to take he off to the ship but there be some delay in get up steam during this pause some one as yet unidentified but evidently a friend of do real rush down to the wharf and shout to he that the revolt be crushed and all be lose do real who have assume he naval uniform on board the steamer take it off again and in civilian attire go ashore he proceed to he sister 's house where he spend a hour then he sally forth again and be find next morning in a distant quarter of the city with a bullet through he brain there be no doubt that he commit suicide the theory of foul play be quite abandon as it be he who have veto the propose postponement of the rise one can understand that the sense of responsibility lay heavy upon he but that without inquiry into the alleged disaster without the smallest attempt to retrieve it he should have leave he comrade in the lurch and take the easiest way of escape be surely a proof of almost criminal instability the republic lose in he a ardent patriot but scarcely a great leader the dawn of Tuesday October 4th show the fortune of the revolt at rather a low ebb the land force be dismay by the inaction of the ship the sailor imagine from the non-appearance of they leader that some disaster must have occur on land it be in these hour of despondency that the true hero of the revolution show they mettle in the bivouac at the rotunda as the morning wear on the republican officer declare that the game be up and that there be nothing for it but to disperse and await the consequence they themselves actually make off and it be then that machado do santo come to the front take command of the insurgent force and revive they drooping spirit the position be not really a strong one for one thing it be command by the height of the misericordium and there be in fact some long-range firing between the insurgent and the guardium municipal station on that eminence again the gentle slope of the avenida a hundred yard wide be clothe by no fewer than ten row of low tree acacia and the like five row on each side of the comparatively narrow roadway which be block at the lower end by a massive monument to the liberator of 1640 thus the insurgent could not see they adversary even when they venture out of they sheltered position in the rocio and the artillery fire from the rotunda do much more damage to the hotel that flank the narrow neck of the avenida than to the royalist force on the other hand it would have be comparatively easy for the royalist with a little resolution to have creep up the avenida under cover of the tree and drive the insurgent from they position fortunately for the revolt there be a total lack of leadership on the royalist side excusable only on the ground that the officer could not rely on they man while thing be at a deadlock on the avenida critical event be happen on the tagus on all three ship the officer know that the man be only await a signal to mutiny but the signal do not come at this juncture and while it seem that the republican cause be lose a piece of heroic bluff on the part of a single officer save the situation lieutenant tito de moraes put off in a small boat from the naval barracks at alcantara row to the _ san raphael _ board it and calmly take possession of it in the name of the republic he give the officer a write guaranty that they have yield to superior force and then send they off under arrest to the naval barracks he now ask for order from the revolutionary committee and early in the afternoon the _ san raphael _ weigh anchor and move down the river in the direction of the necessidade palace in do so she have to pass the most powerful ship of the squadron the _ dom carlo _ : would she get past in safety yes the _ dom carlo _ make no sign the officer be almost all royalist but they know they could do nothing with the crew as a matter of fact when the crew ultimately mutiny the captain and a lieutenant be severely wound but i can find no evidence for the picturesque legend of a group of officer make a last heroic stand on the quarter-deck and ruthlessly mow down by the insurgent ' fire it be certain at any rate that no life be lose in the palace on its bluff above the river king manuel be practically alone no minister no general be at he side it be say on what seem to be good authority that when he see the _ san raphael _ move down-stream under the republican color he telephone to the prime minister teixeira de sousa to ask whether there be not a british destroyer in the river that could be get to sink the mutinous vessel even if this scheme have be otherwise feasible it would have demand a effort of which the minister be no longer capable at about two in the afternoon the _ san raphael _ cruise slowly up and down open fire upon the palace and she second shot bring down the royal standard from its roof what could the poor boy do to sit still and be blow to piece would have be heroic but useless have he have the stuff of a soldier in he he might have make he way to the rocio and try to put some energy into the officer some spirit into the troops but he have no one to encourage and support he such counselor as he have be all for flight he step into he motor-car set off for cintra and mafra and be henceforth out of the saga the flight of dom manuel mean the collapse of he cause it be true that the royalist be reenforce by certain detachment of troops who come in from the country and beat off by the insurgent at the rotunda make they way to the rocio by a circuitous route the guardium municipal too be stanch and show fight at several point it be the total lack of spirited leadership that leave the insurgent master of the field have do its work at the necessidade the _ san raphael _ move up stream again and begin drop shell over the intervene parallelogram of the low city into the crowded rocio they cause little loss of life for they be skilfully time to explode in air the object be not to massacre but to dismay there be nothing so try to soldier as to remain inactive under fire and as there have never be much fight in the garrison of the rocio the little that be leave speedily evaporate at eleven in the morning of Wednesday October 5th the republic be proclaim from the balcony of the town hall and before night fall all be once more quiet in lisbon the first account of the fighting which appear in the european press be as be only natural greatly exaggerate a careful enumeration place the number of the kill at sixty-one and of the wound at 417 some of the latter indeed die of they wound but the whole death-roll certainly do not exceed a hundred the portuguese monarchy be dead and the cause of death as disclose by the autopsy be moral bankruptcy and intellectual inanition it could not point to a single service that it render to the country in return for the burden it impose some of its defender profess to see in it a safeguard for the colony which would somehow fly off into space in the event of a revolution as yet there be no sign of this prophecy come true but the prophet may cling if they please to the hope of its fulfilment for the rest it be perfectly clear that the monarchy have do nothing for the material or spiritual advancement of the country which remain as poverty-stricken and as illiterate as it well could be dom carlo have not even the common prudence to affect if he do not feel a sympathy with the nation 's pride in its hero the monarchy could boast neither of good deed nor of good intention its cynicism be not temper by intelligence it drift toward the abyss without make any reasonable effort to save itself for the dictatorship be scarcely a effort of reason the dictatorship say bernardino machado the present foreign minister leave we only one liberty -- that of hatred and again the monarchy have not even a party -- it have only a _ clientèle _ that one word explain the disappearance of royalism for it have simply disappear even the royalist press be almost extinct some papers have cease to appear some have become republican the few who stick to they color do so rather from clerical than from specifically royalist conviction all the lead papers of the country have long be republican and excellent papers they be both in appearance and in matter _ o mundo _ and _ a lucta _ -lrb- the struggle -rrb- would do credit to the journalism of any country in size in excellence of production and in the well-considered weight of they article they contrast strangely with the flimsy ill-printed sheet that content the spanish public the provisional government have be sneer at as a clique of intellectual but it be scarcely a reproach to the republic that it should command the adhesion of the whole intelligence of the country nor be there any sign of lack of practical sense in the admirable organization which not only insure the success of the revolution -lrb- in spite of certain cross accident -rrb- but secure its absolutely peaceful acceptance throughout the country there be no doubt visionary and fantastic spirit in the republican rank and ridiculous proposal have already be moot for instance it have be gravely suggest that all street bear the name of saint -- and there be hundred of they -- should be rename in commemoration of republican hero date exploit etc but the common sense of the people and press be already on the alert and such whimsy be be laugh out of court of the provisional government i see only the president and the foreign secretary the president a illustrious scholar historian and poet be a delightful old man of the simplest most unassuming manners and eagerly communicative on the subject which have be the study of he life when i ask he to explain to I the difference of national character which make the portuguese attitude toward the church so different from the spanish he take I right back to the ligurian -- far out of my ethnological depth -- and give I a most interesting sketch of the development of the two nation but when we come to topic of more immediate importance he show if i may venture to say so a clear practical sense quite remote from visionary idealism the foreign minister dr machado be of more immediately impressive personality younger than the president by at least ten year yet little short i should guess of sixty he be extremely neat and dapper in person while he very handsome face have a birdlike keenness and alertness of expression betoken not only great intelligence but high-strung vitality he be a copious eloquent and witty talker and he remarkable charm of manner account in part at any rate for he immense popularity assuredly no monarchy could have more distinguished representative than this republic the desire of the republic to play fair be manifest in another little trait that interest I a good deal in the window of every book-shop in spain a translation from the portuguese entitle _ lo escandalos de la corte de portugal _ be prominently display it be a ferocious lampoon upon the royal family and upon franco but in lisbon i look for it in vain on inquiry i learn that it have be prohibit under the monarchy as it could not fail to be but have there be any demand for it no doubt it might have be reprint since the revolution there be apparently no demand the people to whom i speak of it evidently regard it as hit below the belt we do not fight with such weapon say a leading journalist in no one in fact do i discover the slightest desire or willingness to retail personal gossip with respect to the hate braganza the crush of finland ad 1910 john jackol baron von plehve baron sergius witte jn reuter in the midst of progress come reaction the far northern european country of finland have for a century be progress in advance of its neighbor it be a true democracy it have even establish first of european land the full suffrage for woman and numerous woman sit in its parliament but finland be tributary to russium and russium as far back as 1898 begin a deliberate policy of crush finland nationalize it be the russian phrase by which be mean compelling it to abandon its independence adopt the russian language and become a integral part of the empire under russian official and russian autocracy under pressure of this repressive policy the finn begin leave they country as early as 1903 emigrate to america in despair of successful resistance to russium 's tyranny many of they be exile or imprison by the czar 's government then come the day of the russian revolution and the czar and he adviser hurry to grant finland everything she have desire under fear that she people would swell the tide of revolution but that danger once pass the old policy of oppression be soon renew and be carry onward until in November of 1909 the finnish parliament be dismiss by imperial command all through 1910 repressive law be pass reduce finland step by step to a mere russian province so that before the close of that year the finlander themselves surrender the struggle one of they leader write so end finland we give here first the despairing cry write in 1903 by a well-known finn who flee to america then follow the official russian statement by the minister of the interior von plehve who hold control of finland in the early stage of the struggle and be later slay by russian revolutionist then we give the very different russian view express by the great liberal prime minister baron sergius witte who rescue russium from she domestic disaster after the japanese war the story be then carry to its close by a well-known finnish sympathizer john jackol russium be the rock against which the sigh for freedom break say kossuth the great statesman and patriot of hungary although fifty year have pass and sigh after sigh have break against it the rock still stand like a colossal monument of bygone age it be point toward the northern star as if to remind one of the all-enduring fixity other star may go round as they will there be one fix in its place and under that star the shadow of despotism hope to endure forever while yet in finland i use to fancy russium as a giant devil-fish whose arm extend from the baltic to the pacific from the black sea to the arctic ocean then i would think of my native land as a beautiful mermaid about whom the giant 's cold chilly arm be slowly creep and i fear that some day those arm would crush she that day have come the helpless mermaid lie prostrate in the clutch of the octopus not that the constitution of finland have be annul as have be so often erroneously state and quite generally believe the russian government have make only a few inroad upon it the great grievance of the finn be not with what have be absolutely do in opposition to they ancient rights and privilege nor in the number of they rights which have in reality be curtail but with the fact that they have henceforth no security the real grievance of the finn be that the welfare of they country no longer rest upon a inviolable constitution but upon the caprice of the minister in 1898 the reactionist succeed in get one of they tool appoint as governor-general no sooner have general bobrikoff take he high office than he declare that the finnish right to separate political existence be a illusion that there be no substantial foundation for it in any of the act or word of alexander i the people be amaze appal but this be not all pobiedonostseff the procurator of the holy synod and other man as reactionary as he discover the fact or give birth to the idea that the fundamental rights of finland could be interfere with if these fundamental rights interfere with the welfare of the russian empire in other word they discover a loophole which they term legal on the principle that the part should suffer for the whole and that this principle be a integral part of the plan of russian government the abrogation of maintenance of finland 's ancient rights would seem by this decision to rest on the arbitrary interpretation on the part of russium as to whether or not they interfere with the welfare of the empire it be possible that accord to the individual opinion of russian autocrat they might all interfere with the standard of welfare which certain individual have arbitrarily establish to fit the occasion in justice to the russian government it should be state however that the joy of persecution be not the motive which lead to the arbitrary act during the time that finland be under swedish control the finn have learn to dislike everything russian these anti-russian tendency be accentuate after finland become a appanage of the russian crown by the restrictive and often reactionary policy of the imperial government such a form of government be repugnant to the finn who have learn to be govern by good law well administer and by a enlighten public opinion at the same time owe to they larger liberty they higher culture and they susceptibility to western ideal the finn exert a attractive influence over the people of the baltic province and even of russium proper a finn would very seldom become russianize while many russian become finnicized unlike he russian brother the finn enjoy the privilege of free conscience free speech and free press to the average russian such a life be enchanting and many be so fascinate that they become citizen of finland in order to do so however they be oblige to go through the formality of change they nationality and become subject of the grand duchy doubtless this be distasteful to the russian but so many and so great be the advantage accrue from such a change that not a few renounce they nationality such a state of affair seem unnatural and antagonistic to the propaganda of the panslavistic party instead of russian ideal pervade the province provincial ideal manners and custom be gradually spread into the empire but there seem to be no honorable way of check the progress of the rapidly grow finnish nationality the finn maintain that they rights and privilege and they law rest upon a inviolable constitution which could be change only by a vote of the four estate of the landtag that body would never yield it be at this juncture that the procurator of the holy synod conceive the idea that the fundamental rights of the finn can be curtail in so far as they interfere with those of the empire act accord to this new idea the imperial government in 1899 take for its pretext the army service of the finn heretofore accord to a hereditary privilege the finn have not be call upon to serve in the russian army and they army service have be only three year to the russian 's five the officer of the finnish army be to be finn and this army could not be call upon to serve outside of the grand duchy this be the first fundamental right of the finn to be attack by the russian government in some mysterious way the very insignificant army of finland interfere with the general welfare of the russian empire immediately follow the czar 's startling proposal for a disarmament conference in 1899 come he call for a special session of the finnish landtag to extend the law of conscription and the time of regular service from three to five year furthermore the new law provide that instead of serve in they own country the finnish soldier be to be scatter among the various troops of the empire by this mean it be hope to russianize they the representative of the people have no time to consider the measure before the czar 's decree be issue February 17 1899 declare that thenceforth the law govern the grand duchy be make in the same manner as those of the empire it be not necessary to dwell upon the deep feeling of indignation and grief that pervade the country it have find a freer expression outside of the grand duchy than within its boundary wherever the human heart be beat in sympathetic harmony with universal progress the oppressed finnish people have find moral support in spite of this one by one the finn have be deprive of they hereditary rights and privilege to the finn this new order of thing seem appalling it be like the drawing of the veil of the dark age over they beloved country they have lose everything that be dear to the human heart : they language they religion and they independence they can do nothing but mourn in silence and mortification for a strict russian censorship prevent the expression of they just indignation and grief the present condition of finland be apathetic last fall the loss of crop be almost complete and pestilence and famine be devastate the country which have be drain of its vitality by a excessive migration and military conscription the young man of finland be force to serve five year in the russian army and the country be suffer from a lack of man to till the soil the credit of the country have be mine and panic be spread rapidly wholesale migration of the more thrifty have make the already difficult problem of readjustment more complicated those who remain behind be literally suffer from physical intellectual and moral starvation there be leave nothing to refresh fertilize and energize the nation 's vitality the finn be utterly helpless in this sad extremity of they people the best man of finland be exert they utmost in the endeavor to alleviate suffering and infuse hope and inspiration among the mass the young finnish party have become exasperated by the humiliation that have be heap upon the long-suffering people of they native land and its leader have advise active resistance the old finnish party have adopt the policy of passive resistance and protest but the inroad upon the constitution of finland in the form of imperial decree rule and regulation by the governor-general and he subordinate have be so many and so sweeping in they character that even the most conservative be begin to lose patience as long as the unconstitutional act affect only the political life of the people many be able to bear it but when the new rule attack the time-honored social institution and custom indignation could no longer be suppress for instance the order to open private mail cause a general protest the postal director and he secretary refuse to sign the order and resign no less obnoxious be the order forbid public meeting and direct the governor of the different province of finland to appoint only such man to fill municipal rural office as will be subservient to the governor-general the governor of the province of ulrasborg resign while several other province be already govern by pliant tool of general bobrikoff the long-suppressed anxiety of the people have change into a heartrending sigh of anguish these word of a national poet express the general sentiment better far than servitude a death upon the gallows a vicious circle have be establish the high-handed measure cause indignation and the governor-general be determine to suppress its expression there be no safety in finland for honest and patriotic man the judiciary have be make subservient to general bobrikoff latest advice be ominous April 24 1903 be a black day in the history of finland it witness the inauguration of a reign of terror which by the ordinance of April 2d and the rescript of April 9th general bobrikoff have be authorize to establish bobrikoff return to finland with authority if necessary to close hotel store and factory to forbid general meeting to dissolve club and society and to banish without legal process any one whose presence in the country he consider objectionable for 700 year finn have be free man now they have become russian serf and it be well to make closer connection between the finnish railway system and the trans-siberian road finn be long-suffering and patient but who could endure all this while the expression of indignation be suppress in finland outside of the grand duchy especially in sweden norway and denmark russium 's relentless tyranny have make the highest officer of state as resentful as the man in the street indeed entire scandinavium be aflame with indignation and apprehension the lead journal be warn scandinavian that the fate of finland imply other tragedy of similar character unless pan-scandinavia become something more than a political dream von plehve -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reprint by permission from the _ american review of review _ -rrb- in criticize russian policy in finland a distinction should be make between its fundamental principle -- _ ie _ the end which it be mean to attain and its outward expression which depend upon circumstance the former -- _ ie _ the aim and principle remain _ unalterable _ the latter -- _ ie _ the way in which this policy find expression -- be of a incidental and temporary character and do not always depend on the russian authority alone this be what should be take into consideration by russium 's western friend when estimate the value of the information which reach they from finland as to the program of the russian government in the finland question it be substantially as follow : the fundamental problem of every supreme authority -- the happiness and prosperity of the govern -- can be solve only by the mutual cooperation of the government and the people the requirement present to the partner in this common task be on the one hand that the people should recognize the unity of state principle and policy and the binding character of its aim and on the other that the government should acknowledge the benefit accrue to the state from the public activity along the line of individual development of its component element such be the grounds on which the government and the people should unite in the performance of they common task the combination of imperial unity with local autonomy of autocracy with self-government form the principle which must be take into consideration in judge the action of the russian government in the grand duchy of finland the manifesto of February 3-15 1899 be not a negation of such a peaceful cooperation but a confirmation of the aforesaid lead principle of we government in its full development it decide that the issue of imperial law common both to russium and finland must not depend altogether on the consent of the member of the finland diet but be the prerogative of the imperial council of state with the participation on such occasion of member of the finland senate there be nothing in this manifesto to shake the belief of russium 's friend in the compatibility of the principle of autocracy with a large measure of local self-government and civic liberty the development of the spiritual and material power of the population by its gradual introduction to participation in the conscious public life of the state as a healthy conservative principle of government have always enter into the plan of the sovereign leader of the life of russium as a state these intention be announce afresh from the throne by the manifesto of February 26 1903 in we country this process take place in accordance with the historical basis of the empire with the national peculiarity of its population the result be that in russium we have the organization of local institution which give self-government in the narrow sense of the word -- _ ie _ the right of the people to see to the satisfaction of they local economic need in finland the idea of local autonomy be develop far earlier and in a far wider manner its present scope which have grow and develop under russian rule embrace all side not only of the economic but of the civil life of the land russian autocracy have thus give irrefragable proof of its constructive power in the sphere of civic development the historian of the future will have to note its ethical importance in a far wider sphere as well : the greatest of social problem have find a peaceable solution in russium thanks to the condition of its political organization for a full comprehension however of the manifesto of 1899 it must be regard as one of the phase in the development of finland 's relation to russia it will then become evident that as a legacy of the past it be the outcome of the natural course of event which sooner or later must have lead up to it the initiation of finland into the historical destiny of the russian empire be bind to lead to the rise of question call for a general solution common both to the empire and to finland naturally in view of the subordinate status of the latter such question could be solve only in the order appoint for imperial legislation at the same time neither the fundamental law of the swedish period of rule in finland which be completely incompatible with its new status nor the statute of the diet introduce by alexander ii and determine the order of issue of local law touch or could touch the question of the issue of general imperial law this question arise in the course of the legislative work on the systematization of the fundamental law of finland this task undertake by order of the emperor alexander ii for the more precise determination of the status of finland as a indivisible part of we state be continue during the reign of he August successor the emperor alexander iii and lead to the question of determine the order of issue of general imperial law the rule draft for this purpose in 1893 form the contents of the manifesto of 1899 thus we see that during six year they remain without application there be no practical necessity for they publication when however this necessity arise owe to the lapse of the former military law the manifesto be issue it be therefore the finish touch to the labor of many year at the determination of the manner in which the principle of a unite empire be to find expression within the limit of finland and remain substantially true to the tradition which for a century have reign in the relation between russium and finland it present a combination of the principle of autocracy with that of local self-government without any serious limitation of the rights of the latter moreover while preserve the historical principle of russian empire-building this law determine the form of the expression of the autocratic power within the limit of the grand duchy in a manner so much in accord with the condition of life in finland that it do not touch the organization of a single one of the national local institution of the duchy this law in its application to the new conscription regulation have alleviate the condition of the population of finland the military burden lay on the population of the land have be decrease from 2000 man to 500 per annum and latterly to 280 as you will see there be in reality no opposition between the will of the emperor of russium as announce to finland in 1899 and he generous initiative at the hague conference but you ask I have not this confirmation of the ancient principle of russian state policy in finland be buy at too dear a price i shall try to answer you the hostility of public opinion toward we in the west in connection with finnish matter be much to be regret but hope may be entertain that under the influence of better information on finnish affair this hostility may lose its present bitterness we be accustomed moreover to see that the west while welcome the progressive development of russium along the old line it europe have follow itself be not always as amicably dispose toward the growth of the political and social self-consciousness of russium and toward the independent historical process take place in she in the shape of the concentration of she force for the fulfilment of she peaceful vocation in the history of the human race the attitude of the population of finland toward russium be not at all so inimical as would appear on read the article in the foreign press proceeding from the pen of hostile journalist to the honor of the best element of the finnish population it must be say that the degree of prosperity attain by finland during the past century under the egi of the russian throne be perfectly evident to they they know that it be the russian government which have resuscitate the finnish race systematically crush down as it have be in the day of swedish power the more prudent among the finlander realize that now as before the characteristic local organization of finland remain unaltered that the law which guarantee the provincial autonomy of finland be still preserved and that now as before the institution be active which satisfy its social and economic need on independent line they understand likewise the real cause of the increase emigration from finland if along with they political agitation have also play a certain part alarming the credulous peasantry with the specter of military service on the distant border of russium yet they emigration be and remain a economic phenomenon have originate long before the issue of the manifesto of 1899 it keep increase under the influence of bad harvest industrial crisis and the demand for labor in foreign land such be also the case in norway where the percentage of emigration be even greater than in finland have elucidate the substantially unalterable aim of russian policy in finland let we proceed to the cause which have lead to its present incidental and temporary form of expression this undoubtedly be distinguish by its severity but such be the requirement of a utilitarian policy by the bye the total of these severe measure amount to twenty-six finlander expel from the country and a few official dismiss the service without the right to a pension it be scarcely possible however to retain official in the service of the state once they refuse to obey they superior nor be it possible to bear with the existence of a conspiracy which attempt to draw the peaceful and law-abiding population into a conflict with the government and that too at a moment when the prudent member of the population of the duchy take the side of lawful authority thereby call forth against themselves persecution on the part of the secret leader of the agitation party the upholder of the necessity for a pacific policy toward russium be subject to moral and sometimes physical outrage and they opponent be not ashamed to institute scandalous legal process against they for the purpose of damage they reputation very different be the attitude of the great mass of the population as the follow incident show : the president of the abo hofgericht decline to follow the instruction of the party hostile to russium be on he arrival in helsingfor subject to a variety of insult from the mob gather at the railway station on he return to abo he be on the contrary present with a address from the peasantry and local landowner in which the follow word occur : we understand very well that you have be lead to you patriotic resolve to continue you labor in obedience to the government by deep conviction and do not require gratitude either from we or from any other but at the important crisis we people be now experience it may be of some relief to you to learn that the preponderating majority of the people and especially in broader class gratefully approve of the course you have take it will scarcely be know to any one in the west that when signature be be gather for the great mass-address of protest dispatch to st petersburg in 1899 those who refuse they signature number martyr among they there be some who for they courage in refuse they signature suffer ruin and disgrace and be imprison on trumped-up charge moreover the agitator aim at infect the lower class of the population with they intolerance and they hatred of russian but it must be say with scant success with regard to the essence of the question i repeat that in matter of government temporary phenomenon should be distinguish from permanent one the incidental expression of russian policy necessitate by a open mutiny against the government in finland will undoubtedly be replace by the former favor of the sovereign toward he finnish subject as soon as peace be finally restore and the current of social life in that country assume its normal course then certainly all repressive measure will be repeal but the realization of the fundamental aim which the russian government have set itself in finland -- _ ie _ the confirm in that land of the principle of imperial unity -- must continue and it would be best of all if this end be attain with the trustful cooperation of local worker under the guidance of the sovereign to whom divine providence have commit the destiny of russium and finland sergius witte when we talk of the means requisite for assimilate finland we can not help reckon first and foremost with this fact that by the will of russian emperor that country have live its own particular life for nearly a century and govern itself in quite a special manner another consideration that should be take to heart be this : the administration of the conquer country on line which differ from the organization of other territory form part of the empire and which give to finland the semblance of a separate state be shape by serious cause and do good service in the political history of the russian empire one be hardly justified therefore in blame this work of alexander i as be now so often do the annexation of finland poor by nature and at that time utterly ruin by protracted war be of moment to russia not so much from a economic or financial as from a strategical point of view and what in those day be important be not its russification but solely the military position which it afford besides the incorporation of finland take place at a calamitous juncture -- for russium on the political horizon of europe the cloud be grow denser and blacker and there be a general foreboding of the come event of the year 1812 if at that time czar alexander i have apply to finland the method of administration which be wont to be employ in conquered country finland would have become a millstone round russium 's neck during the critical period of she struggle with napoleon which demand the utmost tension of we national force fear of insurrection and rising would have compel russium to maintain a large army there and to spend considerable sum in administer the country but alexander i strike out a different course he majesty recognize the necessity of bestow upon the people by means of internal organization incomparably more advantage than it have have under the sway of sweden and the emperor hold that a effective means of achieve this would be to give the nation such a status that it should be account not enthral by russium but attach to she in virtue of its own manifest interest this valiant and trusty people say czar alexander i when wind up the diet of borgo will bless providence for establish the present order of thing and i shall garner in the best fruit of my solicitude when i shall see this people tranquil from without free within devote itself to agriculture and industry under the protection of the law and they own good conduct and by its very prosperity render justice in my intention and blessing its destiny subsequent history justify the rosiest hope of the emperor the immediate consequence of the policy he adopt toward finland be that the country quickly become calm and settle after the fierce war that have be wage there and that in this way russium be enable to concentrate all she force upon the contest with napoleon accord to the word of alexander i himself the annexation of finland be of the greatest advantage to russium without it in 1812 we might not perhaps have win success because napoleon have in bernadotte he steward who be within five day ' march of we capital would have be inevitably compel to join he force with those of napoleon bernadotte himself tell I so several time and add that he have napoleon 's order to declare war against russium and afterward during almost a century finland never occasion any worry political or economic to the russian government and do not require special sacrifice or special solicitude on its part if we may judge not by the speech and article of particular separatist but by overt act during that long period of time the finnish people never fail in they duty as loyal subject of they monarch or citizen of the common fatherland russium the successor of the conqueror of finland speak many time from the height of the throne of the numerous proof of unalterable attachment and gratitude which the citizen of this country have give they monarch and in effect neither general insurrection against russium 's dominion nor political plot nor the tumult of a ignorant rabble -- such as we cholera riot workman 's outbreak jewish pogrom and other like disturbance -- have ever occur in finland and when disorder of that kind break out in other part of the empire or alarming tiding from abroad come in they never evoke the slightest dangerous echo there it be a most remarkable fact that during the try time the russian government have when the polish insurrection be go on and later in the equally difficult period through which we pass at the close of the seventy finland remain perfectly calm and in the long list of political criminal spring from the various nationality of russium we do not find a single finlander in like manner fear of finland 's aspiration toward independence of she inordinate demand in the matter of military legislation of she turn she population into a armed nation in a word all the apprehension feel that finland may break loose from russium be down to the present moment devoid of foundation in fact finland under the egi of the russian realm we present emperor have say and strong in virtue of russium 's protection through the lapse of almost a whole century have advance along the way of peaceful progress unswervingly and in the heart of the finnish people live the consciousness of they attachment to the russian monarch and to russia in moment of stress and of russium 's danger the finnish troops have always come forward as the fellow soldier of we army and finland have share with we unhesitatingly we military triumph and also the irksome consequence and tribulation of war-time thus in the year 1812 and in the crimean campaign she army grow in number considerably in that eastern war almost she entire mercantile marine be destroy -- a possession which be one of the principal source of the revenue of the country during the polish insurrection and the war for the emancipation of bulgarium finnish troops take part in the expedition and when in 1885 the diet be open the emperor alexander iii in he speech from the throne bear witness to the unimpeachable way in which the population of the country have discharge its military obligation and he give utterance to he conviction that the finnish troops would attain the object for which they exist by way of prove finland 's strive to cut herself apart from russium people point to the doctrine disseminate about the finnish state to its unwillingness to establish military conscription on the same line as the empire and to the speech of the deputy of the diet of 1877-1878 and 1879 but none of these argument carry conviction the theory about the independence of finland as a separate realm which be work out for the purpose of devise the means of safeguard its idiosyncrasy be far from prove that finland aim at separation from russia down to the present moment separation have not be in she interest she be never a independent state she historical tradition do not move she to play a political part in europe besides she population be mix the swedish element constitute only the topmost layer and be not powerful enough to move toward a independent existence or toward union with the power which belong to the same race as that layer while the mass of finn dread the oppression of the swedish party be draw more to russia by the simple instinct of self-preservation that be why the finnish patriot may well be a true and devoted citizen of the russian empire and be as alexander iii term it a good finlander can also bear in mind that he be a member of the russian family at the head of which stand the russian emperor the unfavorable attitude of the finn toward the proposal of the war ministry for extend to they the general regulation that deal with the obligation to serve in the army be also intelligible that obligation of military service be exceedingly irksome and it be not only the finn who desire to fight shy of it nor can one discover any specially dangerous symptom in they wish to preserve the privileged position which they have hitherto enjoy as to the way of discharge they military duty they seek to perpetuate the privilege confer upon they in the form of fundamental law and they strive to avoid be incorporate in the russian army because service there would be very much more onerous for they than in they own finnish regiment if we now turn from the political to the economic aspect of the matter to the question how far the order of thing as at present establish in finland have prove advantageous to russia from the financial point of view we shall search in vain for datum capable of bear out the war minister 's opinion that for the period of a century the budget of finland have be sedulously husband at the cost of the russian people ever since finland have have a independent state budget she have never require any sacrifice on the part of russium for she economic development ill-used by nature and ruin by war the country by dint of its own effort have advance toward cultural and material prosperity without subsidy or guaranty from the imperial treasury the land become furrow with a network of carriage road and railway industry be create a mercantile fleet be build and the work of educate the nation be so successfully organize that one can hardly find a illiterate person throughout the length and breadth of the principality it be also a interesting fact worth record that whereas the russian government have almost every year to feed a starve population now in one district of the empire now in another and be oblige from time to time to spend enormous sum of money for the purpose finland in spite of its frequent bad harvest have generally dispense with such help on the part of the state treasury under these circumstance it be hardly fair to assert that finland have be live at russium 's expense on the contrary finland be perhaps the only one of we borderland which have not require for its economic or cultural development fund take from the population of russium proper the caucasus the kingdom of poland turkestan part of siberium and other portion of we border district -- nay even the northern province themselves -- be source of loss to we or at any rate they have cost the russian treasury very much and some of they still continue to cost it much but the expense they involve be hide in the total of the imperial budget a few datum will throw adequate light on this aspect of the situation it be enough for instance to call to mind what vast what incalculable sacrifice the pacification of the caucasus require from russium and what worry and expense it still cause we no less impose be the expenditure which the kingdom of poland with its two insurrection necessitate in the course of last century and if we cast a glance at the youngest of we borderland -- turkestan -- we shall find that here also the outlay occasion by the political situation of the country have already become sharply outline when we set those figure and datum side by side we shall find it hard to speak of we expenditure on finland or of the vast privilege we have confer on the principality it follow then that the system of administration establish for finland by the emperor alexander i have not yet have any harmful political result for russium and that it have dispense the russian government from incur heavy expenditure for the administration and the well-being of the country and in this way have enable russium to concentrate she force and she care on other part of the empire and to devote she attention to other state problem one can not of course contend that the system of government adopt in finland satisfy in each and all its part the requirement and the need of the present time on the contrary it be indubitable that the independent existence of the principality disconnect as it be from the general interest of the empire have lead to a certain estrangement between the russian and the finnish population that a estrangement really exist can not be doubt but the explanation of it be to be find in the difference of the two culture which have they root in history to the protracted sway of sweden and finland 's continuous relation through she intermediary with western europe the circumstance be to be ascribe that the think spirit among the finn gravitate -- in matter of culture -- not to russium but to the west and in particular to sweden with whom finland be link by bond of language -- through she highest social class -- and of religion law and literature for that reason the view idea and interest of western -- and in particular of scandinavian -- people be more thoroughly familiar and more intelligible to they than ours that also be why when work out any kind of reform and innovation they seek for model not among we but in western europe it be doubtless impossible to look upon that state of thing with approval it be highly desirable that a closer union should take place between the interest cultural and political of the principality and those of the empire : that be postulate by the mutual advantage of both country as i have already remark russian could not contemplate otherwise than with pleasure the possible union and assimilation -- in principle -- of the borderland with the other part of we vast fatherland : they will also be unanimous in wish this task as successful a issue as be possible but what be not feasible be to demolish at one swoop everything that have be create and preserve in the course of a whole century a change of policy if it be not to provoke tumult and disorganization must be carry out gradually and with extreme circumspection the assimilation of finland can never be efficacious if achieve by violence and constraint instead of by pacific mean the finnish people should be leave to appreciate the benefit which would accrue to they from union with a powerful empire : for a adequate understanding of they own interest will in the word of the imperial rescript of February 28 1891 inspire they with a desire to draw more closely the bond that link finland with russium there be no doubt that even at present a certain tendency be noticeable among the finn in favor of closer relation with russium : the knowledge of the russian tongue be spread more and more widely among they and business relation between they and we be grow brisker from year to year the desirable abolition of the custom cordon between the two country be bind to give a powerful fillip to the growth of commerce which be the most trustworthy and most pacific means of bring about a better understanding and strengthen the tie that bind finland to russia harsh drastic expedient may easily loosen the thread that have begin to get tie foster national hate arouse mutual distrust and suspicion and lead to result the reverse of those aim at assimilative measure adopt by the government therefore should be think out carefully and apply gradually jn reuter might can not dominate right in russium say m stolypin russian minister of the interior and president of the council of minister in the speech which he deliver in the duma on may 18 1908 when press by the various party to declare he policy with regard to finland this noble sentiment have the familiar ring of russian officialdom it may perhaps be worth while to consider it in the light of recent history and present-day issue alexander i the first russian sovereign of finland address a rescript to count steinheil on he appointment to the post of governor-general therein he write : my object in finland have be to give the people a political existence so that they shall not regard themselves as subject to russium but as attach to she by they own obvious interest it be not the place here to give a historical account of subsequent event it may however be briefly state that the political ideal express in the word quote here be at time forget but be again revive and in such time even result in the extension of finland 's constitutional rights then again this ideal be abandon and give way to a totally different one which find its most acute expression in February 1899 when the czar a year after the issue of he invitation to the first peace conference at the hague suppress by a imperial manifesto the constitutional right of finland the arbitrary and corrupt russian bureaucratic regime little by little force its way into the country while finlander watch with bitter resentment the suppression one by one of they most cherish national institution this manifesto be condemn in many european country at the time and a protest against it be sign by over a thousand prominent publicist and constitutional lawyer who present a international address to the czar beg he to restore the rights of the grand duchy in 1905 however it seem at last that a new era be about to dawn the change be bring about by the domestic crisis through which russium herself be then pass a imperial manifesto promulgate in October contain the principle of a constitutional form of government in russium be follow as a inevitable sequel by the manifesto of November 4th which practically restore to finland its full political rights in 1906 a new law of the diet be enact instead of triennial session of the estate annual session of the diet be introduce while a extension of the franchise to every citizen over twenty-four year of age without distinction of sex give to woman active electoral rights moreover the door be open to new and far-reaching reform the fulfilment of which infuse fresh life into the democratic spirit of finnish national institution while however so much be do to improve the political social and economic condition of the country the promise which be then make have not be fulfil the principal reason for this failure to redeem they pledge lie in a change of attitude among russian official and they interference in finnish affair it be by consideration of this change and of its effect upon finland that we may best judge how much truth there be in m stolypin 's claim that in russium might can not dominate right ominous sign of a reversal of policy have appear before but the first official expression to it be give in the speech of m stolypin already refer to in this speech he claim for russium as the sovereign power the right of control over finnish administration and legislation whenever the interest of the empire be concern this claim mean practically the restoration of the old bobrikoff régime and be base on the same idea as those underlie the February manifesto of 1899 m stolypin attempt to justify he attitude by argue that the constitutional relation between russium and finland be determine only by clause 4 of the treaty of peace between russium and sweden dated September 171809 this clause run as follow : he majesty the king of sweden renounce irrevocably and forever on behalf of himself as well as on behalf of he successor to the swedish throne and realm and in favor of he majesty the emperor of russium and he successor to the russian throne and empire all he rights and title of the government enumerate hereafter which have be conquer by the arm of he imperial majesty from the swedish army to wit : the province of kymmenegard etc these province with all they inhabitant town port fort village and island with they appurtenance privilege and revenue shall hereafter under full ownership and sovereignty belong to the russian empire and be incorporate with the same after quote this clause m stolypin exclaim this be the act the title by which russium possess finland the one and only act which determine the mutual relation between russium and finland now this clause contain no reference whatever to the autonomy of the grand duchy and if it be the only act by which the mutual relation of russium and finland be determine then finland would have no constitution the political autonomy of finland which have be recognize for exactly one hundred year would have be without legal foundation even m stolypin admit that finland enjoy autonomy there must be no room for the suspicion he say that russium would violate the rights of autonomy confer on finland by the monarch on what then do the claim to finnish autonomy rest and how be it confer clause 6 of the treaty of peace contain the following passage : he majesty the emperor of all the russia have already give the most manifest proof of the clemency and justice with which he have resolve to govern the inhabitant of the province which he have acquire by generosity and by he own spontaneous act assure to they the free exercise of they religion rights property and privilege he swedish majesty consider himself thereby release from perform the otherwise sacred duty of make reservation in the above respects in favor of he former subject this entry in the treaty of peace refer to the settlement make at the borgo diet a few month earlier and it be under this settlement confirm by deed of a later date that finland claim she right to autonomy m stolypin recognize the claim of finland to autonomy but refuse to recognize the binding force of the act of the borgo diet on which alone it can legally be base this claim give finland no voice in she external relation all international treaty include matter relate to the conduct of war -lrb- though law on the liability of finnish citizen to military service fall under the competency of the finnish diet -rrb- be matter common to russium and finland as one empire one international unit and be deal with by the proper russian authority this be admit by all finlander but m stolypin extend russian authority by make it paramount in all matter which have a bearing on russian or imperial interest the attempt to curtail finnish constitutional liberty have take different form early in 1908 the russian council of minister over which m stolypin preside draw up a journal or protocol to which the czar on June 2d give he sanction the chief provision of this protocol be briefly as follow : all legislative proposal and all administrative matter of general importance before be bring to the sovereign for he sanction or as be the case with bill to be present to the diet for he preliminary approval as well as all report draw up by finnish authority for the czar 's inspection must be communicate to the russian council of minister the council will then decide which matter concern the grand duchy of finland also have a bearing on the interest of the empire and consequently call for a fuller examination on the part of the ministry and government board if the council decide that a matter have a bearing on the interest of the empire the council prepare a report on it and should the council differ from the view take up by the finnish authority the finnish secretary of state who alone should be the constitutional channel for bring finnish matter before the sovereign 's notice can do so only in the presence of the president of the council of minister or another russian minister but in practice it have frequently happen that the council send in they report beforehand and the czar 's decision be practically take when the finnish secretary be permit a audience this important measure be bring about by the exclusive recommendation of russian minister neither the finnish diet nor the senate nor the secretary of state for finland who reside in st petersburg be consult or have the slightest idea of what be go on before the protocol be publish in russium it have never be promulgate in finland and no finnish authority have be officially advise of it the whole matter have be treat as a private affair between the czar and he russian minister the excuse have be make that the czar must be permit to seek counsel with whomsoever he choose in regard to the government of finland but this be not a question of privately consult one man or the other the new measure amount to a official recognition of the russian council of minister as a organ of government exercise a powerful control over finnish legislation administration and finance the center of gravity of finnish administration have in fact be shift from the senate for finland compose of finnish man to the russian council of minister the finnish senate protest to the czar in three separate memorandum date respectively June 19 1908 December 22 1908 and February 251909 the finnish diet adopt on October 13 1908 a petition to the czar to reconsider the matter on the occasion of the opening of the diet 's next session the speaker in he reply to the czar 's message briefly refer to the anxiety prevail in finland with the result that the diet be immediately punish by a order of dissolution from the czar the senate 's memorandum as well as the diet 's petition be reject the czar act on the exclusive recommendation of the russian council of minister they be not even bring before he through the constitutional channel the finnish secretary of state have be refuse a hearing as a result all member of the department of justice or half the number of the senator resign in the same year another but less successful attack be make on the finnish constitution in the autumn of 1908 the finnish diet adopt a new landlord and tenant bill but before it be bring up for the czar 's sanction the diet be dissolve in the manner just describe the bill be of a press nature the council of minister be at last prevail upon to report on it to the czar the latter then give he sanction to it but on the recommendation of the council add a rider in the preamble this be to the effect that though the bill have be adopt by a diet which be dissolve before the expiration of the three year ' period for which it be elect should not have be present for he consideration at all the czar would nevertheless make a exception from the rule and sanction it prompt by he regard for the welfare of the poorer part of the population the senate decide to postpone promulgation of this law in view of the constitutional doctrine involve in the preamble it be point out that this doctrine be entirely foreign to finnish law the preamble which accord to custom should have contain nothing beyond the formal sanction to the law in question embody a interpretation of constitutional law such a interpretation could only legally be make in the same manner as the enactment of a constitutional law _ ie _ through the concurrent decision of the sovereign and the diet the senate therefore petition the czar to modify the preamble in such a way as to remove from it what could be construe as a interpretation of constitutional law in reply the czar reprimand the senate for delay promulgation recommend it to do so immediately but promise later on to take the representation make by the senate into he consideration five of the senator then vote against while the governor-general and five other vote for promulgation of the law the minority then tender they resignation the inconvenience result from this new constitutional doctrine prove however of so serious a practical nature that the czar eventually in July 1909 issue a declaration that the gracious expression in the preamble to the landlord and tenant law concern the invalidity of the decision of a dissolve diet do not constitute a interpretation of the constitutional law and shall not in the future be bind in law a third and most important encroachment by the russian council of minister on the autonomy of finland be also carry out at the instigation of m stolypin the finnish constitution make no distinction between matter that may have or may not have a bearing on the interest of russium at the same time russian interest have never be disregard in finnish legislation it have be the practice when a legislative proposal be bring forward in finland and a russian interest might be affect by it to communicate with the russian minister whom the matter most closely concern in order that he might make he observation this practice be confirm by law in 1891 in its memorandum of 1908 and 1909 on the interference of the russian council of minister in finnish affair the senate suggest that in case the procedure under the ordinance of 1891 be not satisfactory a committee of russian and finnish member should be appoint to discuss a _ modus procedendus _ of such a nature that the constitution of finland should not be violate on the recommendation of the council of minister the czar reject these suggestion but the council of minister take the matter in hand and summon a special conference consist of several russian minister other high russian functionary the governor-general of finland who be also a russian with m stolypin as president they business be to draw up a program for a joint committee to be appoint for the draft of proposal for regulation concern the procedure of issue law of general imperial interest concern finland this conference accordingly draw up a program approve by the czar on April 10 1909 in which it be resolve that the joint committee should suggest a definition of the term law of general imperial interest concern finland these law it be propose should be totally withdraw from the competency of the finnish diet and should be pass by the legislative body of russium that be the council of state and the duma the only safeguard for the interest of finland suggest in the program be that a representative for finland should be admit to these two body when finnish question be discuss there it be impossible to say what law concern finland will be define as be of general interest have regard however to the wide interpretation which russian reactionary be wont to put on the expression there be every reason to suppose that the russian member of the committee will insist on its extension so as to include every important category of law the finnish member through they spokesman archbishop johansson declare that they proceed to work on the committee on the assumption that in case alteration in the law of finland should be find necessary have regard to imperial interest such alteration should be make through modification in the constitutional law of finland the finlander be prepare to do they duty by the empire but the archbishop say : sacrifice have be demand from we to which no people can consent the finnish people can not forego they constitution which be a gift of the most high and which next to the gospel be they most cherish possession m deutrich who speak on behalf of the russian member explain that any law result from the labor of the committee would not be submit to the ratification of the finnish diet so m stolypin 's way be now clear the sanction of the people will not be require the finlander have practically no other help than that give by a consciousness of the justice of they cause they have no appeal in November of 1909 the finnish diet be dissolve by a ukase of the czar since then the russian government have be pass decree after decree for finland give the constitutional authority no voice even of protest so end finland man 's fastest mile the automobile age ad 1911 cf carter isaac marcosson on April 23 1911 a automobile be drive along the hard smooth sand of a florida sea beach cover a mile in 25-2\/5 seconds and it continue for a second mile at the same tremendous speed these be the fastest two mile ever make by man they be at the rate of a trifle over 140 mile a hour as this record be not equal in the three year that follow it may be regard as approach the maximum speed of which automobile be capable and as another automobile in endeavor to reach such a speed dissolve into its separate part practically disintegrate and leave a astonished driver flounder by himself upon the sand we may assume that no noticeably greater speed can be attain except by some wholly different method or new invention in contrast to this picture of speed maniac dart more swiftly than ever eagle swoop or lightning express-train run let we contemplate for a moment that first automobile race hold in chicago in 1894 a twenty-four horse-power panhard machine show a speed of thirty mile a hour and be object to by the newspaper as a racing monster likely to cause endless tragedy menacing death to its owner and to the public thus in the brief space of seventeen year do the construction of automobile improve and the temper of the world toward they change the present day may almost be call the automobile age the progress by which this have come about and the enormous development of this new industry be here trace by two man who have follow it most closely the narrative of the auto 's triumph by mr cf carter appear first in the _ out magazine _ the account of the industry 's growth by mr isaac marcosson appear in _ munsey 's magazine _ of which he be the editor both be give here by the permission of the magazine cf carter when the marine architect and engineer catch up with the automobile maker they can build a ship capable of cross the atlantic in twenty-three hour or if we forget to make allowance for the difference in longitude capable of make the run from liverpool to new york in the same apparent time in which the twentieth century limited make the run from new york to chicago that be the vessel leave liverpool at three o'clock in the afternoon would arrive at new york at nine o'clock the follow morning which allow for the five hour ' difference in time would make twenty-three hour when the railroad engineer provide improved track and motive power that will enable they to parallel the feat of the automobile man if they ever do the run time for the fastest train between new york and chicago will be reduce to seven hour while san francisco will be but a day 's run from the metropolis and when the airship enthusiast be able to dart through the air at the speed attain by the automobile it will be time enough to think of take seriously the extravagant claim make in behalf of aviation for the automobile be the swiftest machine ever build by human hand it be so much swifter than its nearest competitor that those who read these line to-day be likely to be some year older before its speed be even equal to say nothing of be surpass by any other kind of vehicle so far as be know but one human be ever travel faster than robert burman do in he racing auto on the beach at daytona florida on April 23 1911 this solitary exception be a hindu carrier who chance to tumble off the brink of a chasm in the himalaya he name have not be preserve he never make any claim to the record he be not officially time and altogether the event have no official standing still as he be the only man who be ever allege to have cover so great a distance as six thousand foot in a obstruct fall the matter be not without interest for accord to the accept rule for find the velocity of a body fall freely from rest he must have be go at the rate of seven mile a second when he reach the bottom about burman 's record there can be no doubt for it be make in the presence of many witness and it be duly time with stop-watch by man skilled in the art the straightaway mile over the smooth hard beach be cover from a run start in the almost incredibly short time of 2540 seconds the next fastest mile ever travel by human being who live to tell about it be make in a electric-car on the experimental track between berlin and zossen in 1902 as the engineer who achieve this record for the advancement of scientific knowledge of the railroad consider such speed dangerous it be not at all likely to become standard practice the fastest time ever make by a steam locomotive of which there be any record be the run of five mile from fleme to jacksonville florida in two and a half minute by a plant system locomotive in march 1901 this be at the rate of 120 mile a hour as for steamship the record of 3053 mile per hour be hold by the _ mauretanium _ these thing if bear in mind will serve to throw into stronger relief the thing that a automobile can do and to supply a substantial basis for the premise that at least in some respects the automobile be the most marvelous machine the world have yet see it can go anywhere at any time flounder through two foot of snow ford any stream that be not deep enough to drown out the magneto triumph over mud axle deep jump fence and cavort over plow ground at fifteen mile a hour it have be use with brilliant success in various kind of hunting include coyote course on the prairie of colorado where it can run all around the bronco formerly in favor since it never run any risk of break a leg in a prairie-dog hole educate automobile have be train to shell corn see wood pump water churn plow and in short do anything require of they except figure out where the consumer get off under the new tariff law but to get back to the subject of speed as automobile talk always do the supremacy of the motor-car have be establish by so many official record that any attempt to select the most striking only result in bewilderment the best that can be do be to recite a few representative one that be a most interesting illustration for instance of the capacity for sustained high speed make by a stearn car on the mile track at brighton beach in 1910 in twenty-four hour the car cover the amazing distance of 1253 mile which be at the average speed of 52-1\/5 mile per hour this record be all the more remarkable from the fact the car be not a racer but a stock car which have be drive for some month by its owner before it be borrow for the race and do not have any special preparation the man who drive it be not notify that they service be want until the morning of the race while this be about the average rate per hour of the fastest train between new york and chicago it should be remember that the train run on steel rail that curve be comparatively few and they be not sharp while the automobile be spin around a mile track make of plain dirt and be oblige to negotiate 2506 sharp curve besides the locomotive on the fast train be change every 120 to 150 mile while the entire run of 1253 mile be make by one auto which have already run 7500 mile in ordinary service before it be enter in the race unfortunately for the automobile it have achieve so many remarkable speed record that its name be suggestive of swiftness if the english language be not the stereotyped inelastic vehicle for the communication of thought that it be we should now be speak of automobile a shady bill through the city council instead of railroad it there be few place where it be permissible to attain record speed and fewer man who with safety to other may be entrust with the attempt the true value of the automobile to the average man lie in its ability to keep right on go indefinitely at moderate speed under any and all condition one of the innumerable test in which the stay quality of the automobile be bring out be the trip from pittsburg to philadelphium by way of gettysburg by sd waldon and four passenger in a packard car September 20 1910 this run of 303 mile over three mountain range with the usual accompaniment of steep grade rock rut and thank-you-ma ` m to rack the machinery and bruise the feeling of the rider be make in 12 hour and 51 minute a little run of three or four hundred mile though be scarcely worth mention by way of show what a auto can do in a real endurance contest a much more notable trip be the non-stop run from jackson michigan to bangor maine in November 1909 by ep blake and dr charle percival the distance of 1600 mile be cover in 123 hour which mean travel at a average speed of 13 mile a hour in rain and snow and mud over country road at they worst in all that time the motor never once stop in the munsey historical tour of 1910 a brush single-cylinder car cover the 1550 mile of a schedule design for big car and come through with a perfect score if you know the hill road of pennsylvanium you 'll realize what that mean in the way of car performance still more remarkable endurance test be the transcontinental trip which be undertake so frequently nowadays that they no longer attract attention one such trip which show what very little trouble a automobile give when handle with reasonable care be that make in 1909 by george c rew wh aldrich jr ra luckey and hg toney travel by daylight only they make the journey of 2800 mile from san francisco to chicago in nineteen day in a stearn car they might have do better if they have not loiter along the way on one occasion they stop to haul water a distance of twenty-five mile for some cowboy on a round-up the motor give no trouble whatever while the only trouble with tire be a single puncture cause by a spike when they try to avoid a bad stretch of road by run on a railroad track the time record from ocean to ocean be hold by ll whitman who leave new york in a reo four-thirty at 1201 be on Monday August 8 1910 and arrive in san francisco on the 18th cover the 3557 mile in 10 day 15 hour and 13 minute this achievement may be more fully appreciate by compare it with the transcontinental relay race in which a courier carry a message from president taft to president chilberg of the alaska-yukon-pacific exposition in september-october 1909 in 10 day 5 hour by use thirty-two car and as many different driver who know the road over which they run those who be fortunate enough to have friend who own car know that automobile can climb hill and that the accept way to do it be to throw in the extra special high gear tear the throttle out by the root advance the spark twenty minute and push hard on the steer wheel the fact that the car will overlook such treatment and go ahead be a source of never-failing wonder indeed when it come to hill-climb the automobile be so far ahead of the locomotive that it seem like wanton cruelty to drag the latter into the discussion at all the steepest grade on a railroad do a miscellaneous transportation business climb by a locomotive rely on adhesion only be on the leopoldina system in brazil between bocca do monte and theodoso where there be a stretch of 8-1\/3 per cent grade with curve of 130 foot radius there be some log road in the united state with grade of 16 per cent how trifling this seem when compare with the feat of a thoma car which climb fillmore street san francisco which be allege to have a gradient of 34 per cent with twenty-three person on board as 25 per cent be regard as the maximum safe gradient for a abt rack railway since the cog-wheel be liable to climb out of the rack on any steeper grade it will be see that the strain upon the credulity of the hearer of this story be almost as great as that upon the car must have be enthusiasm may be expect to run high in the presence of such astounding triumph and it should therefore not be deem surprising that account of hill-climbing contest be generally lack in definiteness the name of the car and the driver be always give with scrupulous care but such incidental detail as length of ascent minimum maximum and average gradient maximum curvature and so on be generally leave to the imagination among the few exception to this rule be the hill-climbing contest at port jefferson long island in which ralph de palma go up a ascent of two thousand foot with a average gradient of 10 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent in 2048 seconds in he 190-horse-power fiat a little hupmobile one of the lightest car build reach the top in 1 minute 10 seconds de palma climb the giant 's despair near wilkesbarre pennsylvanium a ascent six thousand foot long with grade vary from 10 to 22 per cent in he big machine in 1 minute 28-2\/5 seconds a marmon stock car reach the top in 1 minute 50-1\/5 seconds pike 's peak mount washington ensign mountain in utah and lesser mountain elsewhere have also be climb repeatedly by automobile as the mere announcement of the fact vividly exhibit the stay power of the auto in a long stiff climb the engineering detail may be disregard next to its ability to do the exceptional thing when require the most useful accomplishment of the automobile be its wonderful capacity for stand up to its work day in and day out in fair weather or foul regardless of the condition of the road this be show every year in the spectacular glidden tour otherwise the national reliability test in which a number of car of various make cover a schedule route of two or three thousand mile in which be include all the different kind of abomination facetiously term road other test without number be constantly be evolve to demonstrate the already establish fact that a automobile can do anything require of it there be the new york to pari race for instance start from new york on February 12 1908 when travel be at its worst and arrive in paris July 30 the winner flounder in snow mud sand and rock over mountain range and through swamp in eighty-eight day ' run time for the 12116 mile of land travel that be a demonstration of what a automobile can do that have never be surpass yet the thoma car that do it be restore to its original condition at a cost of only $ 90 after the trip be end another remarkable demonstration of endurance be that give by a chalmers-detroit touring car which be drive 208 mile every day for a hundred consecutive day over average road when the 20800 mile be finish just to show that it still feel its oats the car which have already cover 6000 mile of road through western state before the test begin run over to pontiac michigan and haul the mayor 26 mile to detroit then it be run into the shop and take down for examination be find to be in perfect condition except for the valve which require some trifling adjustment to take up the wear on the valve stem and for the piston ring which need set out it be reassemble and start on another test but after all the most wonderful thing about a automobile be its almost infinite capacity to endure cruel and inhuman treatment no matter whether the brutality be inflict through ignorance or awkwardness or rarest of all through unavoidable accident the effect on steel and wood and rubber be the same yet the auto stand it in brake test it have be demonstrate that a car travel at the rate of eighteen mile a hour can be stop in a distance of twenty-five foot the knowledge that this can be do in a emergency be a great comfort but it should be equally well know that it do not improve the car to make all stop that way yet how often be driver see tear up to the curb at twenty mile a hour or more to slam on the brake at the last instant with a violence that nearly cause the car to turn a somersault bring it to a standstill in twenty foot when there be no earthly reason why they should not have use four time that distance or if occasion arise for slow down in a crowded street the same kind of driver throw out he clutch and apply the brake with the throttle wide open so the motor can race unhindered with the greenhorn the automobile be long-suffering there be a new owner in boston whose name be mercifully suppress who take he family out for a first ride in go down a hill on which the clay be slippery from recent rain it become necessary to turn out for a car come up the new driver make the turn so successfully that he turn clear over the edge of the embankment have nothing but air to support it the auto turn completely over without spilling a passenger and land right side up and on a even keel in a marsh fifteen foot below it be necessary to get a team to pull the car out of the mud but once on the solid road the new owner simply crank ` er up and go on he way rejoice another new owner could not find the key to fasten one rear wheel on the axle when he unloaded he auto from the car in which it have be ship from the factory nevertheless he start up the motor accord to direction and travel twelve mile with one wheel driving by this time the outraged motor be red hot whereupon the new owner stop at a farm-house and dash several bucket of cold water on it then he plug around the country a week or so before he decide to go to the agent to lodge a complaint that he derned car do not pull well still another new owner complain that he car do not give satisfactory service the agent be not at all surprise that it do not when upon investigation he find that the car have be drive five hundred mile without a single drop of oil be apply to transmission gear and rear axle george robertson the racing driver in tuning up for the vanderbilt race go over the embankment at the massapequa turn on long island at the rate of sixty mile a hour the car turn over twice but finally stop right side up robertson receive a cut on one arm in the fracas but neither he nor the car be so badly injured but what they could get back to new york a distance of twenty-five mile under they own power there the steer wheel be repair at a cost of $ 5 the radiator at a cost of $ 3 and robertson 's arm at $ 2 but the prize-winner be the fiat racing machine which throw a tire while go fifty-five mile a hour on the brighton beach track the fly racer now utterly uncontrollable dash through two fence one of they pretty substantial cut down a tree eight inch in diameter and finally come to a stop right side up eh parker the driver and he mechanician be somewhat surprised but otherwise undamaged they put on a new tire and in twenty minute be back in the race again what the automobile can do in the way of cheapness be show by the cost test sanction and confirm by the american automobile association between a maxwell runabout and a horse and buggy in seven day in all kind of weather and over city and country road the horse and buggy travel 197 mile at a cost per passenger mile of 2-1\/2 cent the runabout make 457 mile in the same time and the cost per passenger mile be 18 cent this covered operation maintenance and depreciation and incidentally all speed law be observe the winton company which conduct a sort of private automobile humane society offer prize for chauffeur who can show the greatest mileage on the lowest charge for upkeep the first prize winner in the contest for the eight month end June 30 1909 drive he car 17003 mile with no expense whatever for up-keep the second prize winner drive 11000 mile at a outlay of thirty cent while the third man drive 10595 mile without any expense this make a total of 38598 mile by three car at a cost of thirty cent for repair and all the car be two year old when the contest begin the moral for those who really want to see what a automobile can do be obvious isaac f marcosson every automobile that you see be a link in a chain of steel and power which if stretch out would reach from new york to st loui what be consider a freak fifteen year ago and a costly toy within the present decade be now a necessity in business and pleasure a mechanical cinderellum once reject despise and caricature have become a princess few people realize the extent of she sway hers be perhaps the only industry whose statistics of to-day be obsolete to-morrow so rapid be its growth in 1895 the value of the few hundred car produce in the united state be one hundred and fifty thousand dollar in 1910 the year 's output of approximately two hundred thousand machine be worth two hundred and twenty-five million behind they be a stalwart business represent with part and accessory maker a investment of more than a billion and a quarter of dollar four hundred thousand man or more than five time the strength of we standing army depend upon it for a livelihood and more than five million of people be touch or affect by it every day through its phenomenal expansion new industry have be create and old one enrich it withstand panic and ride down depression it have destroy the isolation of the farm and make society more intimate there be a car for every one hundred and sixty person in the united state twenty-five state have factory the _ honk _ of the horn on the american car be hear around the world such in brief be the miracle of the motor 's advance its development be a real epic of action and progress before go further it might be well to ask why and how the automobile have achieve such a remarkable development one reason perhaps be that it appeal to vanity and stir the imagination a man like to feel that by a simple pressure of the hand he can control a ton of quiver metal besides we live work and have we be in a breathless age into which rapid transit fit naturally so universal be the impress of the automobile that there be in reality but two class of people in the united state to-day -- those who own motor-car and those who do not it must be keep in mind too in analyze the cause of the automobile 's amazing expansion that it be the first real improvement in individual transportation since the chariot rattle around the roman arena the horse have he century-old day but when the motor come man trade he for a gas-engine characteristic of the pace at which the automobile have travel to success be the somewhat astonishing fact that while it take inventive genius nearly fifty year to develop a locomotive that would run fifty mile a hour on a specially build track it have take less than ten year to perfect a automobile that will run the same distance in less time on a common road since this business be so invest with human interest let we go back for a moment to its beginning here you find all the property accessory and environment to fit the launching of a great drama toward the close of the precarious ninety a few man wrestle with the big vision of a horseless age down in ohio and indiana be winton and hayne duryea be in pennsylvanium over in michigan be old ford maxwell with the brilliant brush dream mechanical dream in new york walker keep to the faith of the motor-car at that time some of the giant of to-day be outside the motor fold benjamin briscoe be make radiator and fender wc durant be manufacture buggy walter flander be sell machinery on the road hugh chalmer be make a great cash-register factory hum with system fred w haine be struggle with the problem of develop a successful gasoline engine scarcely anybody dream that man be on the threshold of a new era in human progress that would revolutionize traffic and set a new mark for american enterprise and achievement and yet it be little more than ten year ago those early year be year of experimentation pack with mistake and change few of the car would run long or fast it be inevitable that the automobile should take its place in jest and joke hence the comic era with the development of the mechanism come the speed mania which hardly add to the machine 's popularity you must remember in this connection that the automobile be a new thing with absolutely no precedent the maker grope in the dark and every step cost something new steel have to be weld new machinery make a whole new engineering system have to be create the model of to-day be in the junk heap to-morrow but just as curious instinct lead the hand of man to the silver heart of the comstock lode so do circumstance destiny and invention combine to point the way to the commercially successful car out of the wreck the chaos and the failure of the struggle day come a cheap and serviceable car that do not require a daily renewal of its part it prove to be the pathfinder to motor popularity for with its appearance early in this decade the automobile begin to find itself now begin the shoe-string period the most picturesque in the whole dazzling story of the automobile there could be no god in the car without gold here then be the situation -- on the one hand be the enthusiastic inventor on the other be the conservative banker we will make four thousand machine this year say the inventor who will buy they ask the banker in amazement he refuse to lend the capital that the inventor so sorely need the idea of sell four thousand motor-car in a year seem incredible yet within ten year they be sell fifty time as many and be unable to supply the demand no fabulous gold strike ever have more episode of quick wealth than this business here be a incident that will show what be go on : a detroit engineer who have serve he apprenticeship in a electric-light plant evolve a car which he believe would sell for a popular price he try to interest capitalist in vain finally he fall in with a stove-manufacturer who agree to lend he twenty-seven thousand dollar but i can not afford to be identify with you project say the backer who fear ridicule for he hardihood that small investment pay a dividend as high as thirteen hundred per cent in a year to-day the name of the struggle inventor be know wherever car be run and he output be measure by thousand this in substance be the story of henry ford a young machinist work in one of the first detroit automobile factory earn three dollar and fifty cent a day one day he say to himself : i can build a better car than we be make here he do so and the car succeed then he go to he employer and say : i be worth three thousand dollar a year they do not think so and he leave to go into business on he own account a manufacturer stake he at the start later through a friend some wall street capital be interested such be the start of jd maxwell whose interest to-day be merge in a company with a capitalization of sixteen million dollar a curly haired vermont machinery salesman who have sweat at the lathe become factory manager for a detroit automobile-maker he genius for production and organization make he the wonder and the admiration of the automobile world he be make other rich if i can do this for other why can not i do it for myself he reason one day with a stake of ninety-five thousand dollar supplement with a hundred thousand dollar which he borrow from some banker he build up a business that in twenty month sell for six million this be the feat of walter e flander i might cite other the shoe-string become golden band that bind man to fortune all the while the year be speed on but not quite so fast as the development of the automobile the production of ten thousand car in 1903 have leap to nearly twenty thousand in 1905 the thirty-thousand mark be pass in 1906 banker begin to sit up take notice and feed finance to this swell industry which have emerge from fadhood into the definite serious proportion of a great national business the reign of the inventor-producer become menaced because man of trained and organized efficiency in other activity join the rank of the motor-maker with they there come a vivify and broaden influence that have much to do with give assure permanency to the industry but other thing have happen which contribute to the stability of the automobile one be the fact that automobile-selling from the start have be on a strictly cash basis yet how many people save those in the business or who have buy car know this interesting fact no automobile-buyer have credit for a minute and john d rockefeller and the humblest clerk with savings look alike to the seller it be one constructive result of those early haphazard day every car that be ship have a sight draft attach to the bill of lading and the consignee can not get he car until he have pay the draft why be the cash idea inaugurate simply because there be so much risk in a credit transaction if a man buy a car on thirty day ' time and have a smash-up the day after he receive it there would be little equity leave behind the debt the owner might well reason that it be the car 's fault and refuse to pay besides the early maker need money badly in addition to the cash stipulation they compel all the agent to make a good-sized deposit and these deposit on sale give more than one struggle manufacturer he first working capital another reason why the business develop so tremendously be that good machine be produce they have to be good -- first because of the intense rivalry and then because the motor-buyer become the best inform buyer in the world this reveal a striking fact that few people stop to consider if a man own a cash-register or a adding-machine it never occur to he to wonder how or of what it be make but let he buy a automobile and ten minute after it be in he possession he want to know what be inside he be like a boy with he first watch hence the automobile-purchaser know all about he car and when he buy a second one it be impossible to fool he perhaps the first real test of the stability of the automobile business come with the panic of 1907 it resist the inroad of depression more than any other industry most of the big factory keep full work hour and the only reason why some other stop be because of they inability to secure currency for the pay-roll still another significant thing have happen -- more important perhaps than all the rest of the change that have crowd thick and fast upon this leap industry it begin to be plain that certain feature must be present in every first-class car hence come the standardization of the mechanism which be a big step forward what be the result to-day the automobile have become less of a design proposition and more of a manufacturing proposition less of a engineering problem and more of a factory problem the whole wide throbbing range of the business be bend to one great end -- to meet a demand which up to the present time have exceed the supply you have only to go to detroit to see this pulsating drama of production in action here beat the heart of the motor world here a mighty army be evolve a vast industrial epic its banner be the smoke that trail from a hundred soar stack its music be the clang of a thousand forge and the rattle of a maze of machinery you feel this quicken life the moment you enter the city for the tang of its uplift be in the air there be a automobile for every fifty people in detroit the child on the street know the name make and model of nearly all the car produce you can stand in front of the hotel pontchartrain in the public square and see the whole automobile world chug by formerly we city be motor-mad now as in the case of detroit they be motor-made ten year ago the proudest boast of the michigan metropolis be that she produce more pill paint stove and freight-car than any other american city the volume of the largest of these industry do not exceed eighteen million dollar a year to-day she lead the world in automobile production she twenty-five factory turn out in a year more than ninety thousand car or more than sixty per cent of the total output of the united state these car alone would stretch from new york to boston but these figure do not convey any adequate idea of what the motor-car have do for detroit you must go to the spot to feel the galvanic and compelling force that the industry project the city be like a mining-camp in the day of a fabulous strike instead of new mine there be new factory every day and the record of this industrial high tide be be make in brick stone and mortar energy resource and ingenuity be be push to the last limit to take advantage of the golden opportunity that the overwhelming demand for the automobile have create it be a thrilling and distinctively american spectacle and it make one feel proud and glad to be part of the people who be achieve it some of the new plant have rise almost overnight and on every hand there be miracle of rapid construction the business be overshadow all other activity a leading merchant of detroit ask a contractor the other day if he could do some work for he on receive a negative reply he ask the reason whereupon the man say : these automobile people keep I so busy that i can not do anything else i have a year 's work ahead now a visit to any one of the great automobile factory reveal a inspiring picture of cheerful labor as you wind through the wilderness of lathe hear a swirl industry singing its iron song of swell progress you find enthusiasm blend with organize ability in a marvelous attack on work plant with a daily capacity of forty car turn out sixty you can behold a complete machine produce every three minute you can see the evolution from steel billet to finish car in six day formerly it take five month while the development of the automobile business be in itself a wonder story no less amazing be its effect on all the ally industry on rubber alone it have work a revolution ten year ago practically all the rubber that we import go into boot shoe hose belt and kindred product the introduction of rubber tire on horse-drawn vehicle only draw slightly on the supply to-day more than eighty per cent of the crude article that reach we shore go into automobile tire and the biggest problem in the whole automobile situation be not a question of steel and output but a fear that we may not be able to get enough rubber to shoe the expand host of car you have only to look at the change in price to get a hint of the growth of this feature of the business in 1900 crude rubber sell at sixty-five cent a pound now it bring about two dollar and fifty cent the fact about rubber have a peculiar human interest when you sit back comfortably in you smooth-running car you may not realize that the rubber in the tire that stand between you and the jolting of the road be carry on the back of a native for a thousand mile out of the amazon jungle that for every twenty pound of the crude juice bring in from the wild one human life have be sacrifice no crop be garner with so great a hazard none take so merciless a toll the native who gather rubber in the wild of brazil in the congo in ceylon and elsewhere must combat disease insect war flood and a hundred hardship the harvest be slow and costly only the planting of vast new area in ceylon have prevent what many believe would have be a famine in rubber and this would have be a serious check to the development of the whole automobile business for as yet no man have find a substitute for it in such a substitute or in a puncture-proof tire lie one of the unplucked fortune of the future meanwhile it have start a speculative mania that almost rival the tulip excitement in holland in london alone hundred of fortune have be make by daring plunger in a crude article which only a few year ago be regard as be absolutely outside the pale of the gambling marketplace closely ally with the rubber end of the trade be the grow demand for sea-island cotton which be use in the tire a few year ago we use only fifty thousand yard a year now we absorb ten million yard worth seven and one-half million of dollar now take machinery and you find that the automobile business have create a whole new phase of this time-tried industry in many motor-car there be three thousand part in view of the extraordinary demand for car the machinery to produce they must be both swift and accurate the old standard tool and engine lathe be inadequate to perform the service the automobile-maker have to have new machinery and have it in a hurry this demand come at a heaven-sent moment for the tool-manufacturer they be stagger under the depression of 1907 and many be totter toward failure here come almost out of the blue sky a condition that at once tax they brain they resource and they energy and at the same time rescue they from bankruptcy you have only to go to any of the great factory in detroit in cleveland in indianapoli in buffalo in flint or elsewhere to see the result of this hurry call for tool and machinery you find automatic cut the finest gear by the score while one man operate a whole battery you see drill do from fifteen to twenty operation on a piston or a flywheel you see a almost human machine make seventeen hole at one time without observation or care through these machine run river of oil from they stream a steady line of part the whole scope of the tool business be broaden in the old day -- which mean in the automobile business about ten year ago -- a order for ten turret-lathe be consider large now the motor-maker order seventy-five at a time by telegraph and do not regard it as more than part of the day 's work the whole effect of this revolution in machinery be that time be save labor be economize and it be possible to achieve quantity production this in turn enable the large manufacturer to turn out a good car at a moderate price so with steel where likewise wonder have be work ten year ago the great mass of the steel output in this country be in structural metal and rail we have to import we fine alloy and carbon steel from germany and france but the automobile-maker have to have the lightest and toughest metal and they do not want to import it the result be that we mill begin to produce the finer quality to meet all motor need and it be now one of the biggest item in the business in half a dozen other ally industry you find the same expansion as you see in rubber steel and machinery for instance the automobile-maker buy twenty million dollar ' worth of leather a year so great be the demand that a composition substitute be create which be use on sixty per cent of the top a new industry in color leather for upholstery have be evolve wood too have have the same kind of experience whole forest area in the south have be denude for hickory for spoke a few year ago aluminum be use on ash-tray and exposition souvenir now hundred of thousand of pound be employ each year for sheathing and casing on motor-car no essential of the automobile however be of more importance than gasoline here be the life-blood of the car it be estimate that there be to-day three hundred thousand car in the united state that travel fifteen mile a day there be fifteen mile of travel in each gallon of gasoline this make the daily consumption three hundred thousand gallon at a average price of fourteen cent a gallon here be a expenditure of forty-two thousand dollar for gasoline each day or more than fifteen million dollar a year to this must be add the excess use in car that work longer and harder and in the host of taxicab that be in business almost all the time which will probably swell the annual expenditure for gasoline well beyond twenty million as in the case of rubber there be begin to be some apprehension about the future supply of high-power gasoline so great be the demand many student of this fuel problem believe that before many year there will be substitute in the shape of alcohol and kerosene the efficiency of alcohol have be prove in commercial truck in new york but its present price be prohibitive for a general automobile fuel if denatured alcohol can be produce cheaply and on a large scale it will help to solve the problem this bring we to the maker of part and accessory who have be term the father of the automobile business without he there might be no such industry for it be he that give the early maker credit and material which enable they to get they machine together ten year ago the part be all turn out in the ordinary forge and machine-shop to-day there be six hundred manufacturer of part and accessory and they investment include plant be more than a billion dollar they employ a quarter of a million people no one be more surprised at the growth of the automobile business than the parts-maker themselves a lead detroit manufacturer sum it up to I as follow : ten year ago i be in the machine-shop business make gas engine along come the demand for automobile part i think it would be a pretty good and profitable specialty for a little while but i develop my general business so as to have something to fall back on when it end to-day my whole plant work night and day to fill automobile order and we can not keep up with the demand what be look upon as the tail now wag the whole dog and be the dog the volume of business be so large and the interest concern so wide that the manufacturer have they own organization call the motor and accessory manufacturer it include one hundred and eighty maker whose capitalization be three hundred million and whose investment be more than half a billion dollar there still remain to be discuss two phase of the automobile which have tremendous significance for the future of the industry -- its commercial adaptability and its relation with the farmer and the farm let we consider the former first no matter in what town you live something have be deliver at you door by a motor-driven wagon or truck these vehicle at work to-day be only the forerunner of what many conservative maker believe will be the great body of the business here be a field that be as yet practically unscratched now that the pleasure-car have practically be standardized vast energy will be concentrate on the development of the truck wherever i go on a recent trip through the automobile-making zone i find that the manufacturer have be experiment in this direction and be lay plan for a big output within the next few year this year 's production will be about five thousand vehicle the ability and efficiency of the commercial truck for hard city work be undisputed it have have its test in new york where traffic be dense and most difficult to handle here of course be the ideal condition for the successful use of the motor-truck -- which be a full load a long haul and a good road in a city a horse vehicle can make only about five mile a hour while a motor-truck make twelve mile and carry three time the load some idea of motor-truck possibility in new york may be gain when it be state that there be nearly three hundred thousand licensed carry vehicle there the amount of work to be get out of a motor-truck be astonishing john wanamaker for instance get a hundred mile of travel per day out of some of he delivery-wagon the average five-ton truck in a ten-hour day can make eighty mile and keep constantly at work on the other hand a one-horse wagon can scarcely average half that mileage already you doctor whirl around in a automobile and he can make five time more visit than with a horse so too with the contractor and the builder the drummer carry he sample in a gasoline runabout and in addition to see twice the number of customer he can get they goodwill by take they for a spin fire-engine hose-wagon and police patrol race to conflagration propel by motor and get there quicker than ever before just as practically every great american activity ultimately hark back to the soil and have its real root there so in a certain sense may the farmer be regard as the backbone of the automobile business we have six million farm and more than forty-five million of we population live on the farm or in community of less than four thousand people to these dweller in the country the automobile have already prove a agency for uplift progress and prosperity it begin as a pleasure-car now it be a necessity on many farm in kansa you can see it hitch up to the alfalfa-stacker in illinoi and iowa it be harness up to the corn-cutter in indiana it run the dairy machinery but these be slight compare with the other service it perform for the farmer for year the curse of farm life be its isolation its worker be remove from the shop the theater the library and good school more farm woman go insane than any other class the horse work in the field all week and have to rest on Sunday so that the farmer could not go to church the automobile provide a vehicle not excessive in cost and able to provide pleasure for the farmer 's whole family it annihilate the distance between town and country contact with he coworker and proximity to the market make the fanner more efficient and prosperous more than this the motor-car have make the whole rural life more attractive and offer the one inducement that will keep the boy on the farm a hundred instance could be cite of the automobile 's aid to the farm one will suffice in time of harvest when a big gang be at work the breakdown of a thresher will stop operation for a whole day if the farmer have to drive to town behind a horse to get need part with a automobile he can dash in and out in a few hour no one expect the automobile to replace the horse on the farm but for work that the horse can not do efficiently -- such as the quick transit of milk butter and garden product to the market -- the motor-car have a future of wide utility incidentally the farmer may be the first to solve the fuel problem for by means of cooperative distil he could produce denatured alcohol for almost nothing the more you go into the study of the automobile on the farm the bigger become its significance in the united state four hundred and twenty-five million acre of land be uncultivated largely on account of they inaccessibility the motor-car will make they more accessible through the wide use of automobile by the farmer we shall get in time that most valuable agency for prosperity the good road one emerge from a investigation of the automobile industry in wonder over its expansion and with admiration for the man behind it clear-cut youth fresh vigor compelling action galvanize it yet what seem to be a miracle at the end of less than ten year of growth may only be the prelude to a vaster era meanwhile each day record a new chapter of its triumphant progress the downfall of diaz mexico plunge into revolution ad 1911 mr ea tweedie dolore butterfield on may 25 1911 porfirio diaz resign the presidency of mexico under the compulsion of a revolution head by francisco madero this act end a era the diaz era in mexican history diaz have be president for over thirty year he have find mexico a impoverished barbarism he raise it to be a wealthy and at least outwardly civilized state some able critic even among european have declare that diaz the grand old man be the greatest leader of the past century all mexican honor he but unfortunately for he fame he grow too old : he outlive he wisdom and he power of the downfall of such a man there must naturally be conflict view we give here the story from the pathetic diaz side by a well-known english writer upon mexico mr tweedie then we give the warm picture of madero 's heroic struggle against tyranny as it appear to dolore butterfield a young lady bring up in mexico but drive thence by the more recent revolution which result in madero 's death mr e a tweedie diaz have be hurl from power in he eighty-first year the rise against he in mexico have the character of a national revolutionary movement the aim of which perhaps madero himself have not clearly understand one thing the nation want apparently be the stamp out of what the party consider political immorality foster and abet by the act of what they call the _ grupo cientifico _ or grafter and by the policy of the minister of finance limantor in particular therefore when madero stand up as the chieftain of the revolution inscribe on he banner the redress of this grievance with some utopia the people follow he without stop to measure he capability he promise be enough it be one of the saddest episode in the history of great ruler and at the same time one of the most important in the history of a country mexico which have push so brilliantly ahead in finance industry and agriculture have still lag behind in political development the man who make a great nation out of half-breed and chaos be so sure of he own position he own strength and i may say he own motive that he do not encourage antagonism at the poll and free voting remain a name only a german author have say that all ruler become obsess with the passion of rule they lose they balance clearness of sight judgment and only desire to rule rule _ rule _ he be able to quote many example i thought of he and he theory when follow as closely as one be able to do six thousand mile away the recent course of event in mexico would he in a new edition add general diaz to he list diaz have reach a great age on the 15th September 1910 he celebrate he eightieth birthday he have rule mexico with one brief interval of four year since 1876 for thirty-five year therefore with one short break the country have know no other president and madero who have lay he low be a man more or less put into office by diaz himself a new generation of mexican have grow up under the rule of diaz time after time he have be reelect with unanimity no other candidate be nominate -- nor even suggest be it to be wonder at that by the time he seventh term expire in 1910 he should have at last come to regard himself as indispensable that he be so persuade permit of no doubt he would remain in office so long as he think mexico require he service he say in the course of the first abortive negotiation for peace -- before the capture of the town of juarez by the insurrectionist and the surrender of the republican troops under general navarro take the actual settlement out of he hand it be a fatal mistake and it have shroud in deep gloom the close of a career of unexampled brilliancy both in war and statesmanship the spanish-american republic have produce no man who will compare with porfirio diaz simon bolivar for year fight the decaying power of spain and to he what be now the republic of colombium venezuelum ecuador bolivium and peru owe they liberation but diaz have be more than a soldier and he great achievement in the redemption of modern mexico from bankruptcy and general decay completely overshadow he success in the field during the ceaseless struggle of he earlier year have he retire in 1910 he would have do so with honor and every hostile voice in mexico would have be still all would have be forget in remembrance of the immense debt that he country owe he he would have stand out as the great historic figure of a glorious era in the national annals it be the first time he have break he word with the people stay too long he have be drive from office by a movement of idea the strength of which it be evident that he never realize until too late and by a rebellion that in the day of he vigorous autocracy he would have stamp out with he heel it be a sad picture to look on especially when i turn to that other one of the simple palace-home in mexico city with the fine old warrior with dilate nostril like a horse at the covert side he face aglow he eye flash as he tell I of bygone battle escape from imprisonment and death and deed of wild adventure and romance these inspiriting recollection he freely give I for the authentic biography which he have give I permission to write up to that time he have refuse that favor to every one and in spite of he grateful recognition of the honesty and veracity of the volume i have write about he country five year before he be long in give he consent i have only do what i think right he say and it be my country and my minister who have really make mexico what she be in the day of he strength corruption be unknown in he country and even now no finger can point at he he retire a poor man to live on he wife 's little fortune diaz have the right to be egotistical but he be modesty itself yet he have rise from a barefoot lad of humble birth and little education to the dictatorship of one of the most turbulent state in the world and this by power of statesmanship for which owe to want of opportunity he have show no aptitude before he reach middle life before that he seem but a good soldier true as steel brave hardy resourceful in the field and nothing more it be not until he be actually president when near fifty that he gift for government assert themselves such late development be rare although cromwell be forty before he make any mark chatham again be fifty before he be hear outside he own circle and yet a few year barely month later the world be at he foot it be rather the cry nowadays that man 's best work be do before forty and even they good work no later than sixty but among endless exception general diaz must take high rank he real career begin at forty-six up to that time he have be a officer in a somewhat disorganized army and he ambition at the outset never soar beyond a colonelcy he be nearly fifty when he enter mexico city at the head of a revolutionary force romance and adventure be behind he although personal peril still dog he step he have to forget that he be a soldier and to be bear again as leader and politician a maker and not a destroyer in that capacity he have absolutely no experience of public affair but such as he have gain in a smaller way in early year spend in oaxaca yet diaz become a ruler and a diplomat and assume the courtly manners of a prince paradoxical as it may seem he overthrow be the result of a revolution mainly pacific in its nature and in substance a revolt of public feeling against abuse that have become stereotyped in the system of government by the too long domination of one masterful will the military rising be but its head spit fire behind be a immense body of opinion in favor of effect the retirement of the president by peaceful means and with all honor to one who have serve he country well in 1908 general diaz have state frankly in a interview grant to a american journalist that he be enjoy he last term of office and at its expiration would spend he remain year in private life there be no reason to doubt that this assurance represent he settle intention the announcement be extensively publish in the mexican press and be never contradict by the president himself then rumor gain currency that diaz be not unprepared to accept nomination for the presidency for a eighth term the statement be at first discredited then repeat without contradiction in a manner that could hardly have fail to excite alarm at length come the fatal announcement that the president would stand again hardly have the bell of independence cease ring out in joyous clang on September 15 1910 in celebration of free mexico 's centenary hardly have the gorgeous _ fêtes _ for the president 's birthday or the homage pay he by the whole world run they course when the spark of discontent become a blaze he have mistake the respect and regard of he people for a invitation to remain in office by the time the presidential election approach sign of agitation have increase a political party rise in direct hostility not so much to general diaz himself or limantor as to the vice-president who as next in the succession in the event of the demise of the president would have be able to rivet the autocracy on the country corral be the vice-president what little i saw of he i like but then he have hardly take up the rein of power he do not make himself popular in fact a large part of the country hate and distrust he but for that probably nothing would have be hear of the trouble which ensue as the party anxious for the introduction of new blood into the government increase in vigor the people show themselves more and more determine to get rid of corral they want a younger man than diaz in the president 's chair : they want above all the prospect of a better successor but the official group whose interest depend on the maintenance of the diaz régime be for the moment too powerful and it succeed in induce the president to accept reelection to the general hatred of this group on the part of the nation madero owe he success he be almost unknown but the malcontent be determine to act and to act at once and they could not afford to pick and choose for a leader as a proof that the country think less of the democratic principle invoke than of the destruction of the official cientifico may be cite the fact that it at first place all its trust and confidence in general reye who be just as despotic and autocratic as general diaz but have at the same time to they a redeeming quality -- he avowed opposition to the gang reye refuse to head the insurrection and it be then madero or nobody in the spring of 1910 franci i madero come to the front he be a man of education of fortune of courage and a lawyer by profession he have write a book entitle the _ presidential succession _ and although without experience in the management of state affair he have show that he have the courage of he conviction he consent to stand against diaz in a contest for the presidency of the republic the malcontent have find they leader madero not only accept nomination but begin a active campaign make speech against the diaz administration denounce abuse more especially the retention of office by the vice-president and the tactic of limantor and show the people that as general diaz be then eighty year of age and he new term would not expire until 1916 corral would almost certainly succeed to the inheritance of the diaz regime energetic courageous and outspoken madero have full command of the phraseology of the demagog he only shortcoming in the eye of he own party be that he have not be persecute by the government the official alas soon supply this deficiency a few day before the presidential election in July 1910 when make a speech in monterey madero be arrest as a disturber of the peace and throw into prison where he be keep until the close of the poll the election result as usual in a triumphant majority for general diaz though vote be record even in the capital itself for the anti-reelectionist leader as soon as opportunity offer madero escape to the united state and from that vantage-ground keep up a correspondence with he friend and partizan though the election have be hold in July the inauguration of the president do not take place until December 1910 a fortnight before that date a conspiracy at which madero probably connive be discover in pueblum the first victim be the chief of the police at pueblum he be shoot dead by a woman who at he knock have open the door of a house wherein the revolutionist be hold a meet the revolution have begin rising take place in different part of the republic but be quickly quell with the exception of one in the state of chihuahua where the rebel have a special grievance against the all-powerful family of the great landowner general terraza these large land proprietor be a subject of hatred to the new socialist party trouble follow trouble in the north which be it remember run to a distance of over a thousand mile from mexico city itself but nothing very serious occur until suddenly in the early week of 1911 president taft mobilize a force of 20000 american troops to watch the mexican frontier from that time event develop rapidly till the end of the diaz regime in may one thing become clear that the revolution be rapidly make its way to victory and that diaz prostrate with a agonizing disease a abscess of the jaw be in no condition to rally he disheartened follower in person he save he honor as the phrase go by a declaration that he would not retire from office until peace be declare and he keep he word he be too ill to leave he simple home in one of the chief street of the city where he live less ostentatiously than many of he fellow citizen but this do not prevent the mob from firing upon he home on the afternoon of may 25 1911 he resign and señor de la barra formerly minister at washington become provisional president until the next election fix for October madero be the hero of the hour he enter mexico city in triumphal procession June 7 1911 he entrance be precede by the most severe earthquake the capital have know in year many building be wreck and some hundred of people kill a arch of the national palace fall one beneath which diaz have often pass three day after sign he abdication general diaz be well enough to leave mexico city in the early hour of the morning three train draw up fill with he own solder and friend in the middle one of which the ex-president he wife the clever and beautiful carmelita colonel porfirio diaz he son with he young wife several child and they ten-days-old baby be seat along the route the train come upon a force of seven hundred rebel a sharp encounter ensue the revolutionist leave thirty dead upon the field the escort which number but three hundred lose only three man the old fighting spirit return to the old lion and unarm the ex-president descend from he car and take part in the engagement he enter mexico city fighting and he have leave she shore with bullet ring in the air this be but the second time that diaz have leave the land of he birth he work be now imperishable mexican i be sure will regret the pitiful circumstance under which he fall have come about and he will live long in the heart of he countryman nothing can alter the fact that he make modern mexico it be no easy task the mexican be a cross-breed of spaniard and countless indian tribe there be still half a million aztec diaz have give this strange mixed race education and a high order of education for such a people he have bring he country to a financial position in which the government can or could borrow all the money it want at four per cent railway intersect the land in every direction the largest financial interest be american the next in importance be british except germany no other foreign country have much capital invest in mexico thus close one of the most wild and romantic episode of the world 's history -- a peasant boy who become a soldier a general who become a president -- a president who become a great autocrat who raise a country from obscurity to greatness and be finally drive from power by the very people he have educate and to whom he have bring vast blessing the great diaz in he eighty-first year have pass from power the power he use so well verily a move spectacle from first to last dolore butterfield -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reproduce by permission from the _ north american review _ -rrb- in contemplate the present situation in mexico there be a tendency of late to deplore the madero revolution and the overthrow of diaz and to overlook the fact that the diaz regime itself not only make and force by its political abuse the revolution that overthrow it but by its economic abuse prepare the country for the anarchy now rife in it and also that it be the very same ring of man who surround diaz and finally render he rule unbearable who be now finance and foment the present rebellion against a government not in sympathy with they nor subservient to they interest porfirio diaz attain the presidency of mexico thirty-five year ago by overthrow lerdo de tejada he put a end to brigandage which be at that time wide-spread such bandit as he could not buy he exterminate he political opponent he also buy or exterminate so that without the slightest disturbance to the national peace he could be unanimously reelect whenever he term expire out of bankruptcy he establish credit he put up school he invite foreign capital into he country and make it possible for foreign capital to go in and so he gradually build up a material progress which win he the name of nation-builder there be railroad and telegraph the city be grace with beautiful edifice with theater and park with electricity and asphalt there be the appearance of a civilization and progress which consider the time in which it be compass be indeed marvelous but all this be only a shell and a semblance the economic condition of the mexican lower class be not touch -- the process of nation-building seem not to include they in the shadow of a modern civilization stalk poverty and ignorance worthy of the middle age and it be notorious that in the capital city itself under the very eye of the central government be where the very worst condition and the most glaring extreme of poverty and wealth be to be see on the one hand splendid _ paseo _ line with magnificent palace where in they automobile the pleasure-seeking woman of the rich display they raiment worth thousand of dollar and on the other street fill with beggar they clothes literally drop off they in filthy rag reek with the typhus which for year have be endemic in the city of mexico let it be say to diaz 's credit that he do try in a measure at first to better those condition hence the public school which though inadequate for the scatter rural population have accomplish much in the city he also attempt year ago a division of the land but drop it when he see that the great landowner be stronger than he and that to persist might cost he the presidency it be natural and inevitable that a government in which there be never any change or movement should stagnate and become corrupt porfirio diaz be not a president but in all save the name a absolute monarch and inevitably there form about he throne a cordon of man as unpatriotic and self-interested as he may have be patriotic and disinterested -- as to a great extent he undeniably be these man be the cientifico the term be of course not they own it be apply to they by the anti-reelectionist mean that they be scientific grafter and exploiter the full-fledged cientifico be at once a tremendous landholder and high government official to illustrate the land of the state of chihuahua be almost entirely own by the terraza family in the day of diaz don lui terraza be always the governor be further reenforce by he relative enrique c creel high in the diaz ministry in sonora the land be hold by ramon corral lui torre and rafael izabal these three gentleman who be call the trinity use to rotate in the government of the state until corral be make vice-president when torre and izabal take turn about until the death of the latter shortly before the madero revolution in every state there be either one perpetual governor or a combine of they thus in each state a small group of man be the absolute master politically economically and industrially they make and unmake the law at they pleasure for instance terraza impose a prohibitory tax upon cattle which force the small owner to dispose of they stock which he be the only purchaser buy at he own price after which he repeal the law they adjust taxation to suit themselves assess they own huge estate at figure nothing short of ridiculous while levy heavily upon the small farmer and especially upon enterprise and improvement they practice peonage though peonage be contrary to the constitution of the republic to the federal law and in many case to the law of the separate state as well they draw public salary for pervert the government to they private benefit and enrichment and as the dictator grow older and surrender to he satellite more and more of he once absolute power the condition become so intolerable and the tyranny and greed of the cientifico so shameless and unbridled -lrb- infinitely more so in the southern than in the northern state -rrb- that it would have be a reversal of the history of the world if there have be no revolution in 1910 the aged diaz declare he intention of resign perhaps he even intend to keep that promise when he make it but if so the cientifico who know that he prestige and the love of the nation for he be they only shield induce he to think better of it the strongest of the oppose party be the anti-reelectionist party it embody the best element and the best ideal of the country and from the first be the one of which the diaz regime be most afraid now by its very name this party be pledge to no reelection and yet it so far compromise with the regime as to nominate diaz for president only repudiate corral who be odious to the entire nation however the cientifico see that this be to be the enter wedge and they promptly prepare to crush the new political faction anti-reelectionist be arrest right and leave they newspaper be suppress the press wreck and the editor throw into prison but the party 's blood be up it do not dissolve it do not nominate corral instead it strike porfirio diaz 's name from its ticket and tender to francisco madero jr not the vice-presidential but the presidential nomination the bare fact that he accept it speak volume for he courage francisco madero be bear October 4 1873 he be educate from childhood in the united state and europe and upon return to he country imbue with the advanced idea of the most broad-minded man of the most enlighten country in the world it be perhaps only natural that he should resent the condition which he see in he own country the madero family own great tract of land in coahuilum besides property in other state madero introduce modern method and modern machinery in the management of he estate already a millionaire he make more million at the same time do much toward the betterment of condition for he own immediate dependent among the lower class madero first attract attention by write _ the presidential succession in 1910 _ the cientifico clique laugh at he as a visionary suddenly they awake to the fact that he book with its calm dispassionate logic and democratic tone be do they more harm than a thousand soldier and they suppress its publication it be the writing of this book that lead to madero 's nomination for president by the anti-reelectionist party when every one else have fail it madero take the attitude that he be a presidential candidate in a free republic and begin what he call he democratic campaign he go from city to city deliver speech and lay he platform before the people he be call the apostle of democracy and the multitude follow he like a apostle indeed but he do not carry out he democratic campaign without sacrifice and risk when he pass through hermosillo sonora the hotel-keeper close their-door to he torre feudal lord of the state have give out the necessary hint and madero for all he million could find no apartment for himself and he wife until a spaniard -- rely upon the fact of be a foreigner -- offer they lodgings not wish to lend himself to so ignoble a intrigue this be but one city of many in all place he have the most tremendous difficulty in rent hall for he address frequently he be reduce to speak in tumble-down shed or mule-yard or vacant lot the local authority often hire rowdy to create disturbance at he meeting he be ridicule he be threaten he be persecute but he go on unafraid just before and during the election every known maderista from madero down be arrest on charge of sedition thing come to such a pass that in the city where i live some sixty prominent maderista be arrest at two o'clock one morning without warrant and on no charge it be noteworthy that the man arrest be almost without exception some of the best and most honorable man in the state and this happen at the same hour of the same day in every city in mexico but in spite of the fact that many vote be lose to madero through intimidation or actual imprisonment so strong a vote be register for the madero elector that fraud be resort to to cover he gain the result of the election be that diaz and corral be _ unanimously _ reelect -- the former for he eighth term and the latter for he second the anti-reelectionist then appeal to congress and the senate to annul the election allege fraud and intimidation without the slightest pretense of consider or investigate these charge congress and senate -- long the mouthpiece of cientificismo -- ratify the election as just and legal every peaceful measure to bring about justice in the election and insure the free expression of the nation 's will be now exhaust the only recourse leave to the people by the cientifico regime be war they leader at the poll become they leader in the preparation for that war in the midst of this riot of tyranny while the nation yet seethe with indignation at the outrageous electoral farce impose upon it the first centennial of mexican independence be be celebrate before the foreign diplomat with unprecedented pomp and display the anti-reelectionist declare that liberty be dead and that instead of celebrate they be go to don deep mourn they be thus a mark for all manner of persecution from petty annoyance to the most unprovoked armed attack some student be fire upon by troops while they be carry wreath to the monument of the boy hero of chapultepec a young lawyer be arrest for make a speech beneath the statue of juarez and in tlaxcalum a procession of unarmed work man be fire upon and ride down by _ rurale _ several man and a woman be kill consecrate hypocritical hymn to liberty that do not exist and heap with wreath the tomb and monument of the hero of mexico while violate all the ideal for which those hero die drunk with the power they have wield so long the cientifico press blindly on follow the path that privilege have take since the beginning of history and which have only one end these be some of the cause and circumstance that make the revolution of 1910-11 -- not all of they for there must be remember in addition the yaqui slave traffic the contract-labor system of the great southern hacienda and a dozen other iniquity greater and lesser which also contribute to precipitate the revolt it be fortunate that that revolt be captain by a man of francisco madero 's _ type _ -- a man who know how to win the world 's sympathy for he cause and how to make he subordinate merit that sympathy by they observance of the rule of civilized warfare the actual armed contention of the madero revolution be singularly brief culminate in the capture of ciudad juarez which be follow by the resignation of diaz and corral there can be no doubt that the dictatorship could have hold together for a considerable time longer and that diaz surrender before he actually have to but he could probably see by this time that it be inevitable in any case and he be willing to sacrifice he personal pride and ambition sooner than necessary to avoid bloodshed in mexico if he could and also he have it upon he conscience and it be bring home to he by the mob outside he palace that he be not the constitutional president of mexico but the tool of the betrayer of she constitution that he have be shamelessly deceive and play upon by the impassable cordon of cientifico about he be easy to judge he message of resignation be one to touch any heart combine pathos with absolute dignity the resignation of diaz and corral be take by many to signify the complete surrender of the old régime and the triumph of the revolution indeed for the moment it so appear but although the cientifico be oust from direct political control they wealth and power and the tremendous machinery of they domination be still to be contend with before the revolution could follow up its political success with the economic reform which be its real object madero have pledge himself primarily to the division of the land he realize that only by the abolition of the land aristocracy and a equitable distribution among moderate holder for active development of the huge estate hold idle in great part or work by peon could the progress and prosperity of the nation be put upon a solid basis he know exactly what the remedy be and though a land aristocrat himself by birth and inheritance be not afraid of it as soon as he be elect to the presidency he set a committee of competent accredited engineer to work appraise property value in the different state and great tract of hundred of thousand and million of acre previously assess at half as many thousand as they be worth million be revalue and reassess at they true inherent value the _ haciendado _ raise a frightful cry they try threat intrigue and bribery it be useless the revaluation go on the new administration reclaim as national property all that it could of the _ terreno baldio _ or public land which under diaz have be rapidly merge into the great estate it establish a government bank for the purpose of make loan on easy term and thus assist the poor to take up and work these public land in small parcel even before become president madero have advise the work man to organize and demand a living wage which they do he attack the lottery the bull-fight the terrible pulque trust the unbridled traffic of which more than any other one factor have contribute to the degradation of the lower class he begin to extend the public-school system from the first the cientifico hamper and impede he to foment a counter-revolution they take advantage of the fact that in various part of the country there be disorderly band of armed man commit numerous depredation these man have rise up in the shadow of the maderista revolution and at its close instead of lay down they arm they devote themselves to the looting of ranch and ungarrisoned isolate town of these brigand -- for they be neither more nor less whatever they may have call themselves then or may call themselves now -- the most formidable be emiliano zapata he alleged reason for continue in arm after the surrender of the dictatorship be that he man have not be pay for they service president de la barra pay they but they brigandage continue and at the most critical moment pascual orozco jr madero 's trust lieutenant in command of the military force of chihuahua issue -- on the heel of reiterate promise of fealty to the government -- a _ pronunciamiento _ in favor of the revolution and deliver the state which have be entrust to he keep to the revolutionist at whose head he now place himself the new malcontent declare that madero have betray the revolution and that they be go to overthrow he and themselves carry out the promise he have make this sound heroic noble and patriotic but will not bear close inspection in the first place many of the revolutionist with whom the new faction ally itself have be in arm since before madero be even elect -- a trivial circumstance however which do not seem to shake they logic moreover as any honest fair-minded person must have recognize the promise of madero be not such as he could fulfil with a wave of he hand or a stroke of he pen they be big promise and they require time and careful study for they successful undertaking and the cooperation of the people at large against the public enemy whereas madero be not give time nor favorable circumstance nor the intelligent cooperation of any but a small proportion of the population as a matter of fact madero himself far from overstate the benefit of the revolution lead by he or make unwise promise of a utopia impossible of realization address these word to the mexican people at the close of that conflict : you have win you political freedom but do not therefore suppose that you _ economic _ and social liberty can be win so suddenly this can only be attain by a earnest and sustained effort on the part of all class of society it be to be fear that for long year to come mexico must stand judge in the eye of the world by the disgraceful and uncivilized conduct of the various rebel or so-called rebel and simon-pure bandit who be contribute to the revolt and run riot over the country but there be nevertheless in mexico a class of people as educate as refine as honorable as those exist anywhere and these people -- the _ obrero _ -lrb- skilled work man -rrb- and the professional middle class as well as the better element of the labor class be support madero -- not all in the spirit of he personal adherent but because they realize the tremendous peril to mexico of continued revolution in 1911 the revolution be necessary -- the peril have to be incur because nothing but arm could move the exist despotism but none of the pretended principle of the revolution can now justify that peril when the man attack be the legal constitutional duly elect president overwhelmingly choose by the people and venomously turn upon immediately follow he election without be give even a approach to a fair chance to prove himself all the better element of the country realize that madero no longer represent a individual or even a political administration he represent the civilization of mexico struggle against the unreined savagery of a population which have know no law but abject fear and have lose that fear and the restraint which it impose upon it threaten to deliver mexico to such a reign of anarchy rapine and terror as would be without a parallel in modern history he represent the dignity and integrity of mexico before the world whatever the outcome whether it triumph or fail the new administration assail on every side by a enemy as treacherous and unscrupulous as it be powerful and make a last stand -- perhaps a vain one -- for mexico 's economic liberty and political independence merit the support and comprehension of all the progressive element of the world fall of the english house of lord great britain change she constitution by restrict the power of the lord ad 1911 arthur ponsonby sydney brooks captain george swinton on August 10 1911 the ancient british house of lord gather in somber and resentful session and solemnly vote for the parliament bill a measure which reduce they own importance in the government to a mere shadow this vote come as the climax of a five-year struggle the lord have for generation be a conservative body hold back every liberal measure of importance in england of late year the liberal party have protest with ever-increasing vehemence against the unfairness of this unbalanced system by means of which the conservative when elect to power by the people could legislate as they please whereas the liberal though they might carry election overwhelmingly be yet block in all they chief purpose of legislation when the liberal find themselves elect to power by a vast majority in 1905 they be still seek to get on peaceably with the lord but this soon prove impossible in January of 1910 the liberal deliberately adjourn parliament and appeal to the people in a new election they be again return to power though by a reduce majority yet the lord continue to oppose they again they appeal to the people in December of 1910 this time with the distinct announcement that if re-elect to authority they would pass the parliament bill destroy the power of the lord in this third election they be still uphold by the people hence when the lord resist the parliament bill king george stand ready to create as many new peer from the liberal party as might be necessary to pass the offensive bill through the house of lord it be in face of this threat that the lord yield at last and vote most unwillingly for they own loss of power of this great step in the democratizing of england we give three characteristic british view -- first that of a well-known liberal member of parliament who naturally approve of it secondly that of a fair-minded though despondent conservative and thirdly that of a rabid conservative who can see nothing but shame ruin and the extreme of wickedness in the change he speak in the tone of the die-hard the peer who refuse all surrender and hold out to the last rave at they opponent assail they with curse and even with fist and in general aid the rest of the world to realize that the manners of some portion of the british peerage need reform quite as much as they governmental privilege arthur ponsonby mp a great and memorable struggle have end with the passage of the parliament bill into law in the calm atmosphere of retrospect we may now look back on the various stage of this prolonged conflict from its inception to its completion and further with the whole scene before we we may reflect on the wider meaning and real significance of the victory which have be gain on behalf of democracy freedom and popular self-government in the progressive cause there can be no finality no termination to the combat no truce no rest but we may fairly regard the conclusion of this particular struggle as the achievement of a notable step in advance and as the acquisition of territory that can not well be recapture the admission of the parliament bill to the statute-book mark a epoch and fill the heart of those who be pursue high ideal in politics and sociology with great hope for the future the long sequence of the event which have lead up to this achievement have not be smooth or without incident there have be moment of failure of rebuff and even of disaster it would almost seem as if the motive power which have carry the party of progress through the storm and stress and land it in security have be outside the control of any one man or any set of man although distinguished man have lead and there have be many valiant worker in the field a movement that have extend over nearly a hundred year must have its origin and energy deeper down than in any mere party policy it be the inevitable outcome of the steady but inexorable evolution of free institution among a liberty-loving people in order first of all to trace the course of the actual controversy as it have be carry on in the house of common and in the country it be not necessary to go further back than 1883 in that year the lord have reject the franchise bill and it be then that mr bright in a speech at leed deal with the deadlock between the two house sketch a plan which be really the essence and origin of the principle adopt in the parliament act that have just become law the lord have reject many liberal measure before then attempt have be make to get round or overcome they opposition but not till then be any practical method formulate for deal with the serious and permanent obstruction to progressive legislation mr bright himself have condemn the peer and declare that they arrogance and class selfishness have long be at war with the highest interest of the nation and now he advocate a specific remedy which he declare would be obtain by limit the veto which the house of lord exercise over the proceedings of the house of common the actual plan be that a bill reject by the lord should be send up to they again but when the bill come down to the house of common in the second session and the common would not agree to the amendment of the lord then the lord should be bind to accept the bill this method of procedure it will be see be more expeditious and drastic than the scheme in the parliament act mr chamberlain join vigorously in the campaign against the peer tell passage from he speech be quote to this day such as when he declare that the house of lord have never contribute one iota to popular liberty and popular freedom or do anything to advance the common weal but have protect every abuse and sheltered every privilege no further mention of the bright scheme be make for some time six year of conservative rule -lrb- 1886-1892 -rrb- divert the attention of liberal as a party in opposition to other matter and the lord subside as they always have do in such period into a entirely innocuous negligible and utterly useless adjunct of the conservative government in the brief period between 1892-1895 the animus against the house of lord be kindle afresh several liberal bill be mutilate or lose and the rejection of the second home rule bill serve to fan the flame into a dangerous blaze the bright plan be recall by lord morley i think he say -lrb- at newcastle on may 21 1894 -rrb- there will have to be some definite attempt to carry out what mr bright at the leed conference of 1883 suggest by which the power of the house of lord -- this non-elected this non-representative this hereditary this packed tory chamber -- by which the veto of that body shall be strictly limited mr gladstone too in he last speech in the house of common on the wreck amendment which the lord have make on the parish council bill dwelt on the fundamental difference between the two house and say that a state of thing have be create which could not continue and declare it to be a controversy which once raise must go forward to a issue but by far the most formidable the most vigorous the most animated and at the time apparently sincere attack be contain in a series of speech deliver in 1894 by lord rosebery who be then in a position of responsibility as leader of the liberal party if as subsequent event have show he be unmoved by the underlie principle and cause for which he eloquent plead stand anyhow we must believe he be deeply impress by the prospect of he personal ambition as the leader of a party be thwart by the contemptuous action of a irresponsible body he word however stand and have be quote again and again as the most effective attack against the partizan nature of the second chamber : -- what i complain of in the house of lord be that during the tenure of one government it be a second chamber of a inexorable kind but while another government be in it be no second chamber at all therefore the result the effect of the house of lord as it at present stand be this that in one case it act as a court of appeal and a packed court of appeal against the liberal party while in the other case the case of the conservative government it act not as a second chamber at all in the one case we have the two chamber under a liberal government under a conservative government we have a single chamber therefore i say we be face to face with a great difficulty a great danger a great peril to the state so vehement and repeat be lord rosebery 's denunciation that grave anxiety be say to have be cause in the highest quarter but for the next ten year -lrb- 1895-1905 -rrb- the conservative be in office and again it be impossible to bring the matter to a head though the past be not forget when the liberal be return in 1906 with they colossal majority every liberal be well aware that before long the same trouble would inevitably arise and that a settlement of the question could not be long delay the record of the house of lord ' activity during the last five year have be so indelibly impressed on the public mind that only a very brief recapitulation of event be necessary at the outset they action be tentative this be show by the conference and negotiation to arrive at a settlement on the education bill which be the first liberal measure in 1906 but these break down and defiance be find to be completely successful mr balfor the leader of the conservative party realize that although he be in a small minority in the house of common yet he could still control legislation and when he see how effectively the destructive weapon of the veto could be use he become bolder and as with all vicious habit increase indulgence encouraged appetite have mr balfor play he trump-card -- the lord ' veto -- with greater foresight and restraint it may safely be say that the house of lord might have continue for another generation or at any rate for another decade with its authority unimpaired though sooner or later it be bind to abuse its power but the temptation be too great and mr balfor become reckless the three crucial mistake on the part of the opposition from the point of view of pure tactic be : first the destruction of the education bill of 1906 in view of the historic attitude of the lord to all question of religious freedom and general enlightenment it be not surprising that they should stand in the way of a greater equality of opportunity for all denomination in matter of education six time between 1838 and 1857 they reject bill for remove jewish disability three time between 1858 and 1869 they veto the abolition of church rate for thirty-six year -lrb- 1835-1871 -rrb- the admission of nonconformist to the university by the abolition of test be delay by they it be only to be expect therefore that they would be deaf to the popular outcry that have be cause by the balfor education bill of 1902 but in the very first session of the parliament in which the government have be return to power by the immense majority of 354 that they should immediately show they tooth and claw be from they own point of view as event prove a vital error they second mistake be the rejection in 1908 by a body of peer at lansdowne house of the licensing bill which have occupy many week of the time of the house of common this be rightly regard as a gratuitous insult to the house of elect representative finally they culminate act of folly be the rejection of the budget in 1909 it be a outrageous breach of acknowledged constitutional practice which alienate from they a large body of moderate opinion in addition to these three notable measure there be of course a number of other bill on land electoral and social reform that be either mutilate or throw out during this period how could any politician in he sens suppose that a party who possess any degree of confidence in the country would tamely submit to treatment such as this while the lord proceed light-heartedly with they wreck tactic the liberal government slowly and cautiously but with great deliberation take action step by step a provocative move on the part of the lord be meet each time by a counter-move and thus gradually the final and decisive phase of the dispute be reach after the loss of the education bill of 1906 the first note of warning be sound by sir henry campbell-bannerman the resource of the house of common he declare be not exhaust and i say with conviction that a way must be find and a way will be find by which the will of the people express through they elect representative in this house will be make to prevail the first mention of the subject in a king 's speech occur in march 1907 when this significant phrase be use : serious question affect the working of we party system have arise from unfortunate difference between the two house my minister have this important subject under consideration with a view to the solution of the difficulty on June 24 1907 the matter be first definitely bring before the house sir henry campbell-bannerman move that in order to give effect to the will of the people as express by they elect representative it be necessary that the power of the other house to alter or reject bill pass by this house should be so restricted by law as to secure that within the limit of a single parliament the final decision of the common shall prevail to the evident surprize of the opposition he sketch a definite plan for curtail the veto of the house of lord this be follow in July by the introduction of resolution lay down in full detail the exact procedure in he statement sir henry make it very clear that the issue be confine to the relation between the two house : -- let I point out that the plan which i have sketch to the house do not in the least preclude or prejudice any proposal which may be make for the reform of the house of lord the constitution and composition of the house of lord be a question entirely independent of my subject my resolution have nothing to do with the relation of the two house to the crown but only with the relation of the two house to each other in 1908 mr asquith become prime minister but no further action be take on the rejection of the licensing bill however he show that the government be fully aware of the extreme gravity of the question but intend to choose they own time to deal with it speak at the national liberal club in December he say : the question i want to put to you and to my fellow liberal outside be this : be this state of thing to continue we say that it must be bring to a end and i invite the liberal party to-night to treat the veto of the house of lord as the dominate issue in politics -- the dominant issue because in the long run it overshadow and absorb every other when press on the address at the beginning of the follow session by he supporter who be impatient for action he explain the position of the government : i repeat we have no intention to shirk or postpone the issue we have raise i can give complete assurance that at the earliest possible moment consistent with the discharge by this parliament of the obligation i have indicate the issue will be present and submit to the country the rejection of the budget in 1909 lead to a general election in which the government 's method of deal with the lord be the main issue the liberal be return again but when the king 's speech be read some confusion be cause by the distinct question of the relation between the two house be couple with a suggest reform of the second chamber this be a departure from the very clear and wise policy of sir henry campbell-bannerman and have it be persist in it might have break up the rank of the liberal party -- very varied and different opinion be hold as to the constitution of a second chamber but the stronger course be adopt and the resolution subsequently introduce and pass in the house of common deal only with the veto and be to form the preliminary to the introduction of the bill itself just as matter seem about to result in a final settlement king edward die and a conference between the leader of both party be set up to tide over the awkward interval the conference be a experiment doom to failure as the liberal have nothing to give away and compromise could only mean a sacrifice of principle the house meet in November to wind up the business and the prime minister announce that a appeal would be make to the country on the single issue of the lord ' veto the specific proposal of the government be place before the electorate a liberal government be return to power for the third time in December 1910 with practically the same majority as in January the parliament bill be introduce and pass in all its stage through the house of common with large majority meanwhile the conservative make no attempt to defend either the action or composition of the house of lord but adopt a apologetic attitude they agree that the second chamber must be reform and during the second general election in 1910 some of they declare for the referendum as a solution of the difficulty of deadlock between the two house but there be a entire absence of sincerity about they proposal which be not think out but obviously only superficial expedient hurriedly grasp at by a party in distress they reform scheme introduce by lord lansdowne be revolutionary and at the same time fanciful and confuse it be ridicule by they opponent and receive with frigid disapproval by they supporter still they act as if they be confident that in the long run they could ward off the final blow they be persuade that the liberal government would neither have the courage nor the power to accomplish they purpose why waste time over abstract resolution ask mr balfor the liberal party he say have a perfect passion for abstract resolution -- and again it be quite obvious they do not mean business even when the bill itself be introduce they still do not believe that its passage through the house of lord could be force the opposition to the bill be not so much due to hatred of the actual provision as fear of its consequence the prospect of a liberal government be able to pass measure which for long have be part of they program such as home rule welsh disestablishment or electoral reform exasperate the party who have hitherto be secure against the passage of measure of capital importance introduce by they opponent the anti-home rule cry and the suppose dictatorship of the irish nationalist leader be utilize to the full and be useful when constitutional and reason argument fail at the same time as much as possible be make of the composite character of the majority support the government throughout the latter part of the controversy there be little doubt that the conservative would have be in a far stronger position have they act as a unite party with a definite policy and a strong leader ready at a moment 's notice to form a alternative government but they be deplorably lead they could agree on no policy and they warmest supporter in the press and in the country be the first to admit that the formation of a alternative conservative administration be unthinkable nevertheless there could be no rival for the leadership mr balfor aloof indifferent without enthusiasm and without conviction although discredit in the country and harass in he attempt to save he party from protection remain in ability parliamentary knowledge experience and skill head and shoulder above he very mediocre band of colleague in the house of common the bill go up to the house of lord where lord morley with the tact and skill of a experienced statesman and the unflinching firmness of a lifelong liberal conduct it through a very rough career the lord ' amendment be destructive of the principle and therefore equivalent to rejection but even a few day before those amendment be return to the common the conservative refuse to believe that the passage of the bill in its original form be guarantee when at last it be bring home to they that if necessary the king would be advise to create a sufficient number of peer to insure the passage of the bill into law a howl of indignation go up scene of confusion and unmannerly exhibition of temper take place in the house of common a party of revolt be form among the peer and the prime minister be brand as a traitor who be guilty of treason and whose advice to the king in the word of the vote of censure be a gross violation of constitutional liberty as a matter of fact mr asquith be adhering very strictly to the letter and spirit of the constitution lord gray who be confront with a similar problem in 1832 very truly say : if a majority of this house -lrb- house of lord -rrb- be to have the power whenever they please of oppose the declare and decide wish both of the crown and the people without any means of modify that power then this country be place entirely under the influence of a uncontrollable oligarchy i say that if a majority of this house should have the power of act adversely to the crown and the common and be determine to exercise that power without be liable to check or control the constitution be completely altered and the government of the country be not a limited monarchy it be no longer my lord the crown the lord and common but a house of lord -- a separate oligarchy -- govern absolutely the other have the prime minister submit to the lord ' dictation after two general election in the second of which the verdict of the country be take admittedly and exclusively on the actual term of the parliament bill he would have basely betray the constitution in acknowledge by he submission that the peer be the supreme ruler over the crown and over the common and could without check overrule the declare expression of the people 's will the lord chancellor point out the danger in one sentence this house alone in the constitution be to be free of all control no doubt the creation of ten peer would not have cause such a commotion as the creation of 400 but the principle be precisely the same and it be only the magnitude of partizan bias in the second chamber that make the creation of a large number necessary in the event of there be determine opposition it be a most necessary and salutary lesson for the lord that they should be show in as clear and pronounce a way as possible that the constitution provide a check against they attempt at despotism just as the marked disapproval of the electorate as show for instance in the remarkable series of by-election in 1903-1905 or by a reverse at a general election be the check provide against the arbitrary or unpopular action of any government the peer be split up into two party those who accept lord lansdowne 's pronouncement that as they be no longer free agent there be nothing leave for they but to submit to the inevitable and those who desire to oppose the bill to the last and force the creation of peer the view of the latter section lead by lord halsbury be a expression of the wide-spread impatience and annoyance with mr balfor 's weak and vacillate leadership all the counting of head and the guess as to how each peer would behave afford much material for sensational press paragraph and rather frivolous speculation and intrigue the action of any peer in any circumstance be always suppose to be of national importance the vision of large number of active peer be a perfect feast for the public mind at least so the newspaper think but in reality the final outcry the violent speech the sectional meeting the vituperation and passion be quite unreal and of very little consequence one way or the other the passage of the bill be secure the vote of censure bring against the government afford the prime minister a convenient opportunity of frankly take the house into he confidence with the king 's consent he disclose all the communication hitherto keep secret which have pass between the sovereign and he minister he rightly claim that all the transaction have be correct considerate and constitutional mr asquith 's brilliant and sagacious leadership impressed even he bitterest opponent it only remain for the lord not to insist on they amendment unparalleled excitement attend they final decision the uncompromising opponent among the unionist peer rather than yield at the last moment throw over lord lansdowne 's leadership they be bent on force a creation of peer although lord morley warn they of the consequence if we be beat on this bill to-night he declare then he majesty will consent to such a creation of peer as will safeguard the measure against all possible combination in this house and the creation will be prompt in number the die-hard as they be call be know to exceed a hundred and it be extremely doubtful right up to the actual moment when the division be take if the government would receive the support of a sufficient number of cross-bench peer unionist peer and bishop to carry the bill after a heated debate chiefly take up by violent recrimination between the two section of the opposition the lord decide by a narrow majority of seventeen not to insist on they amendment and the bill be pass and receive the royal assent now that the smoke have clear off the field of battle let we state in a few sentence what the parliament bill which have cause all this uproar really be it be by no means unnecessary to do this as those who take a close interest in political event be perhaps unaware of the incredible ignorance which exist as to the cause and essence of the whole controversy especially among that class of society who read head-line but not article who never attend political meeting but whose strong prejudice make they active and influential the parliament bill or rather the act do not even place a liberal government on a equal footing with a unionist government it insure that liberal measure if persist in may become law in the course of two year in spite of the opposition of the second chamber it lay down once and for all that finance or money bill can not be veto or amend by the house of lord -- which after all be only a indorsement of what be accept till 1909 as the constitutional practice -- and it limit the duration of parliament to five year the preamble of the bill which be regard with a good deal of suspicion by advanced radical indicate that the reform of the second chamber be to be undertake subsequently this be the bare record of the sequence of event in the parliamentary struggle between the two house each support by one of the two great political party in the course of the controversy the real significance of the conflict be liable to be hide under the mass of detail connect with constitutional law constitutional and political history and parliamentary procedure which have to be quote in speech on every platform and refer to repeatedly in debate the serious deadlock between the lord and common be not a mere inconvenience in the conduct of legislation nor be it purely a technical constitutional problem the issue be not between the 670 member of the house of common and the 620 member of the house of lord nor between the liberal government and the tory opposition the full purport of the contest be broader and far more vital it must be seek deeper down in the wider sphere of we social and national life in a word the rise tide of democracy have break down another barrier and the privilege and presumption of the aristocracy have receive a shatter blow this aspect of the case be worth study there could be no conflict of any importance between the two house so long as the common be practically nominee of the lord at the end of the eighteenth century no fewer than 306 member of the house of common be virtually return by the influence of 160 person landowner and boroughmonger most of whom be member of the other house thing could work smoothly enough in these circumstance as the two house represent the same interest and the same class and the territorial aristocracy dominate without effort over a silent and subservient people the reform bill of 1832 be the real beginning of the change by its provision not only be the franchise extend but fifty-six rotten borough represent by 143 member be sweep away there be something more in this than electoral reform it be the first step toward alienation between the two house there be a bitter fight at the time because the lord foresee that if they once lose they hold over the common the eventual result might be serious for they it be far more convenient to have a subordinate house of nominee than a independent house of possible antagonist the enfranchisement and emancipation of the people once inaugurate however be destine to proceed further the introduction of free education serve more than anything and be still serve to create a self-conscious democracy fully alive to its great responsibility for knowledge mean courage and strength change in the industrial life of the country lead to organization among the worker and the formation of trade-union the extension of local government bring to the front man of ability from all class of society and the franchise become further extend at interval the house of common now completely free and independent keep in close touch with the real national awakening and reflect in its membership the change in social development but the house of lord unlike any other institution in the country remain unchanged and quite unaffected by outside circumstance its stagnation and immobility naturally make it increasingly hostile to democratic advance the number of liberal peer or peer who could remain liberal under social pressure gradually diminish friction cause by diversity of aim and interest become consequently more and more frequent there be time of reaction time of stagnation time when the national attention be divert by war but the main trend take by the course of event be unalterable the aristocracy finding that it be lose ground make attempt to reenforce itself with commercial and american wealth thereby sacrifice the last trace of its old distinction money might give power of a sort -- a dangerous power in its way -- but not-power to recover the loss of political domination the south african war and the attempt to obliterate the resentment it cause in the country by institute a campaign for the revival of protection bring about the downfall of the tory party the electoral _ débâcle _ of 1906 be the consequence and serve as a signal of alarm in the easy-going conservative world till then many who be accustom to hold the rein of government in they hand as if by right have not fully realize that the control be slip from they the cry go up that socialism and revolution be imminent _ the time _ quote _ the clarion _ old fogy shake they head and declare the country would be ruin and that a catastrophe be at hand but it be soon find on the contrary that the government of the country be in the hand of man of great ability enlightenment and imagination trade prosper social need be more closely attend to and most important of all peace be maintain the house of common have open its door to man of moderate means and the labor party consist of work man miner and those with first-hand knowledge of industrial condition come into existence as a organize political force the last six year have show the desperate attempt of the ancient order to strain every nerve against the inevitable and to thwart and destroy the project and ambition of those who represent the new thought and the new life of the nation though apparently successful at first the rash action of the chamber which still represent the interest privilege and prejudice of the wealthier class and of vested interest only help in the long run to hasten the day when they be to be deprive of they most formidable weapon they still retain considerable power : they interest be guard by one of the political party and socially they hold undisputed sway in a amazing defense of the past action of the house of lord lord lansdowne in 1906 say : it be constantly assume that the house of lord have always show itself obstructive reluctant a opponent to all useful measure for the amelioration of the condition of the people of this island nothing be further from the truth you will find that in the past with which we be concern the house of lord have show itself not only tolerant of such measure but anxious to promote they and to make they effectual to the best of its ability _ and that i believe have be and i be glad to think it from time immemorial the attitude of what i suppose i may call the aristocracy toward the people of this country _ the last sentence be a fair statement of they case the aristocracy be _ not _ the people they be by nature a superior class which providence or some unseen power have mercifully provide to govern to rule and to dominate they be kind charitable and patronize and expect gratitude and subservience in return as a mid-victorian writer put it : what one want to see be a kind and cordial condescension on the one side and a equally cordial but still respectful devotedness on the other but these be voice from a time that have pass democracy have many a fight before it false ideal and faulty educational system may handicap its progress as much as the force that be avowedly array against it its achievement may be arrest by the discord of faction break up its rank conceivably it may have to face a severe conflict with a middle-class plutocracy but whatever trial democracy have to undergo it can no longer be subject to constant defeat at the hand of a constitutionally organize force of hostile aristocratic opinion at least it may now secure expression in legislation for its noblest ideal and its most cherish ambition a check on progressive legislation be harmful to the national welfare especially when there be no check on the real danger of reaction to devise a second chamber which will be a check on reaction as well as on so-called revolution be a problem for the future for the time be therefore the best security for the country against the peril of a reactionary regime be to allow freer play to the force of progress which only tend to become revolutionary when they be resist and suppress the curtailment of the veto of the second chamber fulfil this purpose whatever further adjustment of the constitution may be effect in time to come the door can no longer be close persistently against the wish of the people when they entrust the work of legislation to a liberal government sydney brook the first but by no mean the last or most crucial stage of we twentieth-century revolution have now be complete the old constitution which be perhaps the most adaptable and convenient system of government that the world have ever know be definitely at a end the power of a ancient assembly have be truncate with a violence that in any other land would have spell barricade and bloodsh long ago and the road have be clear or partially clear for development that must profoundly affect and that in all probability will absolutely transform the whole scheme of the british state thus far with they usual effective good-humored shortsighted common sense with few pause for inquiry and with a characteristically indifferent grasp on the ultimate trend of thing have we politician bring we we politician i say and not we people because one of the distinctive feature of the revolution so far be that it have be a political rather than a popular movement it do not originate in the constituency but in the cabinet it be not force upon the caucus by a arouse and indignant country but by the caucus upon the country nine-tenth of its momentum have be derive from above and not from below the true center of excitement throughout its polite and orderly progress have be the lobby of the house and the correspondence column of _ the time _ it be only at the last that the urbanity of the struggle between the die-hard and they fellow unionist furnish the public as a whole with material for a mild sport interest when roundhead and cavalier be line up for the battle of edgehill a warwickshire squire be observe between the opposing force placidly draw the covert for a fox the british people during the past twenty month have seem more than once to resemble that historic huntsman they have answer the scream exhortation of the politician with whisper of more than delphic ambiguity they have go unconcernedly about they pleasure and they business to all appearance unvexed by the din of revolution in they ear they have present the spectacle more common in france than in england of a tranquil nation with agitate legislator the ministerial explanation of this lethargy and indifference be that the people have no occasion to grow excite they mandate be be fulfil they be get what they want demonstration be superfluous but no one who have read the history of the reform bill of 1832 or of the chartist movement or who remember the passion stir up by the franchise agitation and the home rule struggle of the eighty will swallow that explanation without mentally choke the truth probably be first that the multiplication of cheap distraction and enjoyment and of cheaper newspaper have not only weaken the popular interest in politics but have impair that faculty of concentrated and continuous thought which use to invest affair of state with a attractiveness not so greatly inferior to that of football secondly that for the great mass of the democracy the politics of bread and butter have completely oust the politics of idea and abstraction and thirdly that the constitutional issue be precisely the kind of issue in which we people have have no previous training either actual or theoretical and which find they therefore without any intellectual preparation for its advent up till the end of 1909 we have always take the constitution for grant and be for the most part comfortably unaware that it even exist we have never as a nation or never rather within live memory trouble ourselves about theory of state or whet we mind on the fundamental of government there be nothing in we educational curriculum that correspond with the _ instruction civique _ of the french school nor have we the privilege which the american enjoy of carry a copy of we organic act of government in we pocket of read it through in twenty minute and of hear it incessantly expound in the class-room and the press debate in the national legislature and interpret by the highest judicial tribunal in the land when therefore we be suddenly call upon to decide the infinitely delicate problem of the place power and composition of a second chamber in we govern system the task prove as bewildering as it be unappetize any nation which regard its constitution as a vital and familiar instrument would have heavily resent so gross a infraction of it as the lord perpetrate in reject the 1909 budget but we own electorate so far from punish the party responsible for the outrage send they back to the house over a hundred stronger a result impossible in a country with any vivid sense or any sense at all of constitutional reality and only possible in great britain because the people adjudge the importance of the various issue submit to they by standard of they own and place the constitutional problem at the bottom or near the bottom of the list in no single constituency that i have ever hear of be the house of lord question the supreme and decisive factor at the election of January 1910 it deeply stir the impartial intelligence of the country but it fail to move the average voter even in the town while in the rural part it fall unmistakably flat even at the election of December 1910 when all other issue be admittedly subordinate to the constitutional issue it be exceedingly difficult to determine how far the stedfastness of the electorate to the liberal cause be due to a specific appreciation and approval of the parliament bill and of all it involve and how far it be a expression of general distrust of the unionist of irritation with the lord and of sympathy with the social and fiscal policy pursue by the coalition that the liberal be justify by all the rule of the party game in treat the result of that election as for all political and parliamentary purpose a direct indorsement of they proposal may be freely grant it be as near a approach to a _ ad hoc _ referendum as we be ever likely to get under we present system party exigency or at any rate party tactic it be true hurry on the election before the country be prepare for it before it have recover from the somnolence induce by the conference and before the opposition have time or opportunity to do more than sketch in they alternative plan but though the issue be incompletely present it be undoubtedly the paramount issue put before the electorate and the liberal be fairly entitle to claim that they policy in regard to it have the backing of the majority of the voter of the unite kingdom whether however this backing represent a reason view of the constitutional point involve and of the position prerogative and organization of a second chamber in the framework of british government whether it imply that we people be really interested in and have deeply ponder the relative merit of the single and double chamber system be much more doubtful when he be tell say the duke of northumberland on August 10th that the people of england be very anxious to abolish the house of lord he reply be that they do not understand the question and do not care two brass farthing about it that perhaps be put it somewhat too strongly the country within the last two year have unquestionably feel more vividly than ever before the anomaly of a hereditary upper chamber embed in democratic institution it have be stir by mr lloyd-george 's rhetoric to a mood of vague exasperation with the house of lord and of ridicule of the order of the peerage it have accept too readily the liberal version of the central issue as a case of peer _ versus _ people but while it be satisfy that something ought to be do i do not believe it realize precisely what have be accomplish in its name or the consequence that must follow from the passing of the parliament bill there be no sign that it regard the abridgment of the power of the upper house as a great democratic victory there be on the contrary manifold sign that it have be bore and bewilder by the whole struggle and that the extraordinary lassitude with which it watch the debate be a true reflex of its real attitude captain george swinton lcc it have be more like a bull-fight than anything else or perhaps the bull-baiting almost to the death which go on in england in day of old for the peerage be not quite dead but sore stricken rob of its high function prop up and leave stand to flatter the fool and the snob a kind of paint screen or a cardboard fortification arm with cannon which can not be discharge for fear they bring it down about the defender ' ear and in the end it be all effect so simply so easily could the bull be induce to charge a rag be wave first here then there and the dog bark that be all it be not difficult to be wise after the event everybody know now that with the motley group of grow strength array against they it behoove the peer to walk warily to look askance at the cloak trail before they to realize the danger of accept challenge however righteous the cause might be but no amount of prudence could have postpone the catastrophe for any length of time for indeed the house of lord have become a anachronism everything have change since the day when it have its origin when its member be peer of the king not only in name but almost in power prince of principality earl of earldom baron of barony then they be in a way enthrone represent all the people of the territory they dominate the people they lead in war and rule in peace they come together as magnate of the land sit in a upper house as lord of the shire even as the knight of the shire sit in the common and this continue long after the feudal system have pass away carry on not only by the force of tradition but by a sentiment of respect and real affection for these feeling be common enough until design man lay themselves out to destroy they many thing combine to make the last phase pass quickly it be impossible that the peerage could long survive the reform bill for it take from the great family they pocket borough and so much of they influence and there follow hard upon it the educational effect of new facility for exchange of idea the railway train the penny post and the halfpenny paper together with the centralization of general opinion and all government which have result therefrom but above all reason be the loss of the qualify ancestral land a link with the soil and the ennobling of landless man once divorce from its influence over some countryside a peerage rest on heredity be doom for no one can defend a system whereby man of no exceptional ability representative of nothing be legislator by inheritance should we summon to a conclave of the nation a king who have no kingdom but the pity of it not only the break with eight century of history -- nay more for when have not every king he council of notable -- not only the loss of picturesqueness and sentiment and lofty mien but the certainty the appalling certainty that when a aristocracy of birth fall it be not a aristocracy of character or intellect but a aristocracy -- save the mark -- of money which be bind to take its place five short year and four reject measure glance back over it all the wild blood on both side and the cunning on one the foolish comfortable word speak in every drawing-room throughout the unite kingdom yes they be terrible : what a lot of harm they would do if they could thank god we have a house of lord think now that this be commonplace conversation only three short year ago and all the time the ear of the mass be be poison week after week and month after month some laugh but other toil the laugher like the french noble before the revolution say contemptuously they will not dare why should they not there be man among they for whom the ark of the covenant have no sanctity and then when the combination be complete when those who stand out have be kick -- there can be no other word -- into compliance the blow fall quickly a budget be ingeniously prepare for rejection and the lord fall into the trap the storm break with its hurricane of abuse and misrepresentation we have one election which be inconclusive then befall the death of king edward there be a second election carefully engineer and prepare for rush upon a nation which have be deny the opportunity of hear the other side the government have out-maneuver the opposition and muzzle they to the last moment in a conference swear to secrecy it be remarkably clever and incredibly unscrupulous they win again they have not increase they number but they have maintain they position and this time they victory however achieve could not be gainsay for a moment there be a lull only some vague talk of guaranty assert scoff at and deny for the ordinary business of the country be in arrears and the coronation with all its pomp of circumstance and power all its medieval splendor and appeal to history and sentiment turn people 's thought elsewhere and then on the day the pageantry close mr asquith launch he thunderbolt few man live will ever learn the true story of the guaranty suffice it that somehow he have secure they whatever the resistance of the second chamber might be it could be overcome at he dictation the constitution be to fall there be no escape the bill must surely pass it rest with the lord themselves whether they should bow they head to the inevitable humbly or proudly contemptuously or savagely -- characterize it as you will -- or whether there should be red trouble first surely never in we time have there be a situation of higher psychological interest for never before have we see a body of some six hundred exceptional man call on to take each he individual line upon a subject which touch he to the core i say individual line and exceptional man do either adjective require defend the peer be not a regiment they be still independent entity with all the fault and virtue which this imply free gentleman subject to no discipline responsible to god and they own conscience alone at time they may combine on question which appeal to they sense of right they sentiment perhaps some may say they self-interest but this be no case for combination here be a sword point at each man 's breast what under the circumstance be to be he individual line of conduct and who will deny the word exceptional to a seventh of they it must perforce be applicable for they have be specially select to serve in a upper house and to the rest those who sit by inheritance do it not apply even more it be not what they have do in life this be no question of capacity or achievement by the accident of birth alone they have be put in a position different from other man how shall each in he wisdom or he folly interpret that well-worn motto which still have virtue both to quicken and control noblesse oblige very curious indeed be the result it be useless to consider the preliminary the pronouncement the meeting the campaign which rage for a fortnight in the press both by letter and lead article it be even useless to try and discover who if anybody be in favor of the bill which be the original bone of contention its merit and defect be hardly debate on that fateful 10th of August the house of lord split into three group on quite a different point the king 's government have seize on the king 's prerogative and utter threat should they or should they not be constrain to make good they threat and use it the first group say : yes they have betray the constitution and disgrace they position let they crime be bring home to they and to the world all be lose for we except honor shall we lose that also to the last gasp we will insist on we amendment the second group say : no they have indeed betray the constitution and disgrace they position but why add to this disaster the destruction of what remain to safeguard the empire we protest and withdraw wash we hand of the whole business for the moment but we time will come the third group say : no we do not desire the king 's prerogative to be use we will prevent any need for its exercise the bill shall go through without it and the second group abstain by seventeen vote the last prevail against the first but whether ever before a victory be win by so divide a host or ever a measure carry by man who so profoundly disapprove of it let those judge who read the scathing protest inscribe in due form in the journal of the house of lord by one who go into that lobby lord rosebery the only living peer who have be prime minister of england it be unnecessary to print here more than the tenth and last paragraph of this tremendous indictment it run -- because the whole transaction tend to bring discredit on we country and its

the ablest diplomat in europe constant access to the imperial ear regardless of foreign-office red tape during the heyday of the young turk party 's power this astute old player of the game be the dominant personality in turkey the disgruntled and disappointed briton have comfort themselves with prophecy -- how often have i hear they at it in the cosmopolitan cafe of constantinople -- the burden of they melancholy lay be that some day turkey would learn who be she real friend that be the british way they believe in they divine right to the earth and the high place thereof they be annoyed and rather bewilder when they see germany cutting in ahead of they especially in the commerce of the orient any englishman east of suez can give a dozen good reason why germany be a

more than a generation turkey have be the pampered _ enfant terrible _ of international politics violate the convention and propriety with impunity feeling safe amid the jealousy of the player of the great game every important nation have a bill of grievance to settle with turkey america 's claim for instance include the death of two native-born american citizen roger and maurer slay in the adana massacre under the constitution nobody have be punish for this crime because forsooth it happen in turkey italy make a pretext of a cluster of these grievance and startle the world by she claim upon tripolus accompany by a ultimatum turkey try to temporize press she turn to germany with a now earn you wages get I out of this scrape and call off you ally and germany could not with the taste of morocco dirt still on he tongue the kaiser have to take another unpalatable mouthful in constantinople he boast power upon which the turk have bank so heavily and for the sake of which they have bear so much humiliation prove unequal to the demand he could not help he friend the sultan italy would have none of he mediation for reason that will hereinafter appear then come britain 's vindication the turk turn to this historic and preeminent friend for succor the turkish cabinet cable frantically to great britain to intercede for they the people in mass-meeting in ancient st sophium 's echo the same appeal for grim humor the spectacle have scarcely a equal in modern history besought and entreat the british who no doubt approve of italy 's move from the first decline to pull turco-german chestnut out of the fire ask cousin william to help you be the ironical implication of they attitude well do britain know that if the situation be save the german would somehow manage to get the credit of it and if the worst should come great britain could probably meet it with christian fortitude for in that eventuality the bagdad railway concession would be nullify and britain would undoubtedly take over all of the arabian peninsula which be logically hers in the light of she persian gulf and red sea claim the break-up of turkey would settle the egyptian question make easy the british acquisition of southern persium and put all the holy place of islam under the strong hand of the british power where they would be no longer powder-magazine to worry the dream of christendom far-sighted move be necessary in the great game small wonder that germany become furious and that the berlin newspaper burst out in denunciation of italy 's wicked and piratical land-grabbing -- a morsel of rhetoric follow so hard upon the heel of the morocco episode that it give joy to all who delight in hear the pot rail at the kettle the great game be not without its humor but the sardonic joke of the business lie deeper than all this the kaiser have openly coquet with the sultan upon the policy of substitute turkey for italy in the triple alliance turkey have a potentially great army : the one thing the turk can do well be to fight with a suspicious eye upon neighbor russium the kaiser figure it out that turkey would be more useful to he than italy especially since the abyssinian episode have so seriously discredit the latter then of a sudden with a poetic justice that be delicious italy turn around and humiliate the nation that be to take its place the whole comic situation resemble nothing more nearly than a supposedly defunct spouse rise from he death-bed to thrash the expectant second husband of he wife here the great game digress in another direction that take no account of turkey of course it be more than a self-respecting desire to avenge affront that lead italy to declare war against turkey and also more than a hunger for the territory of tripolus italy need to solidify she national sentiment at home in the face of grow socialism and clever clericalism even more do she need to show the world that she be still a first-class power there have be a disposition of late year to leave she out of the international reckoning now at one skilful jump she be back in the game -- and on better term than ever with the vatican for she will look well to all the numerous latin mission in the turkish empire and especially in palestine these once be france 's special care and be yet to a degree but france be out of favor with the church and steadily decline from she former place in the levant although french continue to be the _ lingua franca _ of merchandising of polite society and of diplomacy in the near east let nobody think that this be lug religion by the ear into the great game religion even more than national or racial consciousness be one of the principal player in america politician try to steer clear of religion although even here a cherry cocktail mix with methodism have be know to cost a man the possible nomination for the presidency in the levant however religion _ be _ politics the ambition and policy of germany russium and britain be less potent factor in the ultimate and inevitable dissolution of turkey than the deep-seated resolution of some ten of million of people to see the cross once more plant upon st sophium 's ask anybody in greece or the balkan or european russium what the great idea be and you will get for a answer the return of the cross to st sophium 's backward and even benighted christian these eastern churchman may be but they hold a few fundamental idea pretty fast and be readier to fight for they than they occidental brethren the world may as well accept as the principal issue of the great game that center about constantinople the fact that the war begin twelve hundred year ago by the dusky arabian camel-driver be still on this turco-italian scrape be only one little skirmish in it \* \* \* \* \* the outbreak of war between italy and turkey come as a surprize to the great majority of the european public and even in italy until the last moment few believe that the crisis would come to a head so soon those who have closely follow the course of political opinion in the country during the past year however see that a change have come over the public spirit of italy and that a new attitude toward question of foreign policy be be adopt it may be of interest in the present circumstance to examine the cause and the course of this development since the completion of italian unity with the fall of the temporal power in 1870 the italian people have devote all its energy to internal affair for everything have to be create -- road railway port improve agriculture industry school scientific institution the public service be either totally lack or quite inadequate to the need of a great modern nation above all the finances of the state shatter by the war of independence and by bad administration have to be place on a sound footing consequently foreign affair attract but slight public interest such a state of thing be at that time inevitable owe to the precarious situation at home but it prove a most unfortunate necessity as it be during this very period that the great no-man 's - land of asia and africa be be partition among the other nation and vast uncultivated undeveloped and thinly populated territory annex by various european power and convert into important colonial empire offer splendid outlet for trade and emigration italy have appear last in this field when nearly all the best land have be annex and when conquest could not be attempt even in the still available region without large well-organized armed force and a determine intelligent and well-informed public opinion to back they up in italy neither be to be find the country be too poor to launch forth into colonial and foreign politics with any chance of success and the people be too untraveled and too little acquaint with the development of other country to pay much attention to event outside italy or at all event outside europe in the meanwhile considerable progress in the economic and social condition of the italian people have be achieve and by grind economy and incredible sacrifice the finances be be restore there come a moment however when the need for colonial expansion begin to be feel as a sop to public opinion which have be exasperate by the french occupation of tunis the italian government decide in 1885 to occupy massowah and the surrounding territory on the red sea coast but that country be not suit to italian colonization and italy be not yet ready to develop a purely trade colony at so great a distance from the homeland a long series of error be commit relieved at time by the heroism and devotion of the army fight against huge odds in a inhospitable and unknown land culminate in the disaster of adowa in 1896 what work the greatest injury to italian prestige be not so much the defeat in itself as the fact that it be allow to remain unavenged there be a fresh italian army on the scene under a admirable leader general baldissera who enjoy the full confidence of he man and it be clear that the abyssinian force could not hold together much longer the premier however signor crispus a man of unquestioned ability but who live in advance of he time before the nation be ready to follow he in he imperial policy be overwhelm by a storm of indignation and he successor marchese di rudini terrify by the riot promote by unscrupulous socialist and anarchist agitator as a protest against the african campaign conclude a disastrous peace with the enemy in the meanwhile italian socialism which have find a suitable field for action in the unsatisfactory condition of the work class have evolve a theory of government which although common to some extent to the socialist of other country be nowhere carry to such length as in italy socialism in theory have everywhere adopt a attitude of hostility to militarism imperialism and patriotism and profess to be internationalist and pacificist and regard class hatred and civil disorder as the only moral and praiseworthy form of warfare but in country where the mass have reach a certain degree of political education such view if carry to they logical conclusion be sure to be reject by the majority and even the socialist leader realize that nationalism be a vital force which have to be reckon with and that a sane imperialism and efficient military policy be as necessary in the interest of the mass as in those of the class in italy on the other hand where even the bourgeoisie take but a lukewarm interest in the wider question of world policy the socialist leader conduct a avowedly anti-patriotic propaganda against every form of national sentiment against the very existence of italy as a nation and they achieve considerable success by represent patriotism and the army as the cause of low wages and war and colonial imperialism as the result of purely capitalist intrigue because it be only the capitalist who profit by such adventure they meet with wide-spread acceptance among a large part of the work class thus a general feeling get possession of the italian people that war be play out and that even if it be to occur italy be sure to be defeat by any other power that nothing must be do to provoke the resentment of the foreigner that the only form of expansion to be encourage be emigration to foreign land and even the export trade which be grow so rapidly be look upon askance by the socialist as a mere capitalist instrument this attitude which be certainly not conducive to a healthy public spirit be reflect in the conduct of the government which feel that it would not be back by the nation if it give sign of energy the result be that italy find she interest block at every turn by other nation which be not imbue with such humanitarian theory and that she be subject to countless humiliation on the part of government who be convince that under no provocation would italy show resentment gradually and imperceptibly a change come over public feeling and the necessity for a sane and vigorous patriotism begin to be dimly realize one of the earliest symptom of this new attitude be the publication in 1903 of federigo garlanda 's _ la terza italia _ the book profess to be write by a friendly american observer and critic of italian affair and the author regard the absence of militant patriotism as the chief cause of italy 's weakness in comparison with other nation mario morasso in he volume _ l'imperialismo nel secolo xx _ publish in 1905 open fire on the still predominant socialistic internationalism and sentimental humanitarianism and extol the policy of conquest and expansion adopt by great britain germany france and the united state as a means of strengthen the fiber of the national character in December 1910 a congress of italian nationalist be hold in florence and at that gathering which be attend by several hundred person include numerous well-known name many aspect of italian national life be examine and discuss the various speaker impress on they hearer the importance of nationalism as the basis for all political thought and action the weakness of the country the contempt which other nation feel for italy the unsatisfactory state both of home and foreign politics and the poverty of a large part of the population be all trace to the absence of a sane and vigorous patriotism the strengthening of the army and navy the development of a military spirit among the people a radical change of direction in the conduct of the nation 's foreign policy and the ending of the present attitude of subservience to all other power great or small be regard as the first _ desideratum _ of the country the turk too who since the revolution of 1908 have become particularly truculent toward the italian especially in tripolus also come in for rough treatment and various speaker demand that the government should secure adequate protection for italian citizen and trade in the ottoman empire and that a watch should be keep on tripolus lest other seize it before the moment for italian occupation arrive signor corradinus insist that there be worse thing for a nation than war and that the occasional necessity for resort to the dread arbitrament must be boldly face by any nation worthy of the name the congress prove a success and the idea express in it which have be in the air for some time be accept by a considerable number of people the nationalist association be found then and there and soon gather numerous adherent a new weekly paper _ l'idea nazionale _ commence publication on march 1 1911 -lrb- the anniversary of adowa -rrb- and rapidly become a important organ of public opinion while several daily and review adopt nationalist principle or view they with sympathy italian nationalism have no resemblance to the party of the same name in france ireland or elsewhere indeed it be not really a party at all for it gather in liberal conservative radical clerical socialist even provide they accept the patriotic idea and be anxious to see they country raise to a higher place in the congress of nation even at the cost of some sacrifice italy accord to professor sighele _ -lrb- il nazionalismo ed i partiti politici _ p 80 sq -rrb- must be imperialist in order to prevent the close up of all the opening whence the nation receive its oxygen and to prevent the adriatic from become more and more a austrian lake to prevent even the mediterranean from be close around we like a camp guard by hostile sentinel and to provide a field of activity for we emigrant wherein they will enjoy that protection which they now lack and which only a bold foreign policy a thorough preparation for war and a clear imperialist attitude on the part of the ruler of the state can give they for some time the government continue to appear impervious to the nationalist spirit and profess to regard the movement as a schoolboy 's game but it could not long remain indifferent to so wide-spread a feeling italy 's relation with turkey be rapidly approach a crisis the new ottoman régime while it be prove no better than the old in the matter of corruption inefficiency and persecution of the subject-race have one new feature -- a outburst of rabid chauvinism and of hatred for all foreigner but especially for italian whom the young turk regard as the weakest of nation never have italian prestige fall so low in the levant as at this period and the italian government do nothing to retrieve the situation in tripolus above all where italy 's reversionary interest have be sanction by agreement with england and france the position of italian citizen and firm be render well-nigh intolerable turkish persecution reach such a point that two italian the monk father giustino and the merchant gastone terrenus be assassinate at the instigation and with the complicity of the authority without any redress be obtain the nationalist since the beginning of they propaganda have agitate for a firmer attitude toward turkey insist on the open up of tripolus to italian enterprise italy be be hem in on all side by france in algerium and tunisium and by england in egypt tripolitaine alone remain as a possible outlet for she eventual expansion the turkish government do nothing for the development of that province but it be determine that no one else should do anything for it and thwart the effort of every italian enterprise the banco di roma alone succeed by ceaseless activity and untiring patience in create important undertaking in the african vilayet have event pursue they normal course italy would probably have be content to develop she commercial interest in tripolitaine to the advantage of its inhabitant as well as of she own wait for the time when in due course the country should fall to she share but the persistent hostility of the turkish authority be bring matter to a head and while the italian government apparently refuse to regard the state of affair as serious the nationalist continue to demand the assertion of italy 's interest in tripolus the press gradually adopt they point of view the _ idea nazionale _ publish corradinus 's vivid letter from tripolus and even ministerial organ like the _ tribuna _ of rome and the _ stampa _ of turin follow the lead of they correspondent who visit tripolitaine during the past spring and summer and write of its resource and possibility with enthusiasm be soon convert if any nation have a right to colony it be italy with she rapidly increase population she small territory and she stream of emigrant still the government from fear of international complication and of alienate its socialist supporter who of course oppose all idea of territorial expansion refuse to do anything then the franco-german morocco bombshell burst and agadir make the italian people realize that the question of tripolus call for immediate solution the whole of the rest of mediterranean africa be about to be partition among the power and tripolus would certainly not be leave untouched if italy fail to make good she claim germany it be believe have cast she eye on it and already she commercial agent and prospector be on the spot the demand for a occupation by italy be insistent all class be call on the government to act and in genoa there be even angry muttering of revolt the nation realize that it be a case of now or never and every one feel that the folly of tuni must not be repeat at the same time the turk convince that italy would never fight continue in they overbearing attitude and place increase obstacle in the way of italian enterprise in all part of the empire while ostentatiously favor other foreign undertaking incident such as the abduction of a italian girl and she forcible conversion to islam and marriage to a turk and the attack on italian vessel in the red sea add fuel to the flame and public opinion become more and more excited the premier at last saw that the country be practically unanimous on the question of tripolus and although personally averse to all adventure in the field of foreign affair which interfere with he political action at home he realize that unless he face the situation boldly he prestige be go on the 20th of September the expedition to tripolus be decide hastily and secretly military preparation be make and the note concern the send of turkish reinforcement or arm to tripolus be issue then follow the ultimatum and finally the declaration of war the socialist leader who see in this awakening of a national conscience and of a militant imperialist spirit a serious menace to they own predominance be in a state of frenzy and they attempt to organize a general strike as a protest against the government but the movement fizzle out miserably and only a insignificant number of workman strike on the other hand the declaration of war be greet by a outburst of popular enthusiasm such as no one believe possible in the italy of to-day the departure or passage of the troops on they way to tripolus give occasion for scene of the most intense patriotic excitement and the sight of some two hundred thousand people in the street of rome at one be on October 7th cheer the march past of the 82d infantry regiment be one not easily forget the heart of the whole nation be in the enterprise even many prominent socialist cast the shackle of party fealty to the wind declare themselves in favor of the government 's african policy and accept the occupation of tripolus as a necessity for the country while the clerical be even more enthusiastic but there be hardly a trace of anti-turkish feeling it be simply that the people rejoice at have awaken from the long nightmare of political apathy and international servility have throw off the grind and degrade yoke of socialist tyranny and rise to a dawn of higher ideal of national dignity italy have at last assert herself the extraordinary efficiency speed and secrecy with which the expedition be organize ship across the mediterranean and land in africa the discipline _ moral _ and gallantry which both soldier and sailor display be a revelation to everybody and give the italian new confidence in they military force and make they feel that they could hold up they head before all the world unashame a new italy be bear -- the italy of the italian nation in the word of mamelus 's immortal hymn which have be revive as the war-song of the nationalist fratellus d'italia l'italium s ' è desta dell ' elmo di scipio s ' è cinta la testa the actual operation of the war be too one-sided to be interesting from the military viewpoint turkey have no navy which could compete for a moment with that of italy hence the turk could dispatch no troops whatever to tripolus and its defense devolve solely upon the native arab inhabitant these wild tribe be brave and warlike and fanatically mohammedan in they opposition to the christian invader but they be wholly without training in modern mode of warfare and without modern weapon they frenzied rush and antiquated gun be helpless in the face of quick-firing artillery the italian demonstrate they ability to handle they own force to transport troops land they and provision they with speed and skill that be about all the struggle establish on October 3d the city of tripolus the only important tripolitan harbor be bombard two day later the soldier land and take possession of it for a month follow there be minor engagement with the arab of the neighborhood night attack upon the italian rumor that they lose they head and shoot down score of unarmed and unresisting native then on November 5th italy proclaim that she have conquer and annex tripolus the only remain difficulty be to get the turkish government to give its formal assent to this new regime which it have be unable to resist here however the italian encounter a difficulty they have promise the rest of europe that they would not complicate the european turkish problem by attack turkey anywhere except in africa in africa they have now do they worst and so the turkish government with true mohammedan serenity defy they to do more turkey absolutely refuse to acknowledge the italian claim to tripolitan suzerainty true she could not fight but neither would she utter any word of surrender let the italian do what they please in tripolus turkey still continue in she address to she own people to call herself its lord this course satisfy the ignorant mohammedan of constantinople who know little of what be really happen and so it enable the young turk party to retain control of the political situation at home the dissatisfaction of italy however increase until she withdraw she earlier pledge to europe and set she navy to the task of seize one after another the turkish island lie in the eastern mediterranean after some month of this leisurely appropriation of helpless territory the turk yield the point at issue in October of 1912 they sign a treaty of peace with italy grant she entire possession of tripolus by this time the turk have become involve in they far more deadly struggle with the unite balkan state and the government be able to offer this new strife to its subject as its excuse for yield to the italian turkey though she still hold a nominal authority over egypt cease to have any real power over any part of africa she retain only a european and asiatic empire woman suffrage the movement come to the front by its triumph in californium ad 1911 ida hust harper jane addam david lloyd-george israel zangwill elbert hubbard when future generation look for a exact event to mark the triumphal turning-point in the progress of the woman-suffrage movement they will probably select the election which take place in the great american state of californium in October 1911 other state have give woman vote before but they be smaller community where the movement could still be regard as a eccentricity a mere whimsicality when however californium in 1911 grant full suffrage to she woman almost half a million in number the movement become obviously important the vote of californium might well turn the scale in a presidential election moreover other state follow californium 's example woman suffrage soon dominate the west and begin its progress eastward the shrewd lincoln say that no government could continue to exist half slave and half free and the axiom be equally true of a divide suffrage there can be little question that woman suffrage will ultimately be adopt throughout the eastern state not because of force but through the ever-increasing pressure of political expediency hence we give here a account of the progress of the woman-suffrage cause up to the californium election as it appear to the prominent suffragist writer ida hust harper and to the honor suffragist leader jane addam the peculiarity of the movement in england seem to necessitate separate treatment so we present the view of its antagonist as temperately express by britain 's celebrated minister of the treasury david lloyd-george and the defense of the militant by the note novelist israel zangwill then come a summary of the entire theme by that widely known friend of humanity elbert hubbard for permission to quote some of these authoritative utterance which have be previously print we owe cordial thanks to the publisher or author mr harper 's summary appear originally in the _ american review of review _ and miss addam 's comment in _ the survey _ of June 1912 both elbert hubbard 's word and those of lloyd-george be reprint from _ hearst 's magazine _ of August 1912 and August 1913 ida hust harper a few year ago no change in the government of the world would have seem more improbable than a constitution for china a republic in portugal and a house of lord in great britain without the power of veto and yet all these momentous change have take place in less than two year the underlying cause be unquestionably the strong spirit of unrest among the people of all nation have any degree of civilization cause by they increase freedom of speech and press they larger intercourse through modern method of travel and the send of the youth to be educate in the most progressive country it would be impossible for woman not to be affect by this spirit of unrest especially as they have make greater advance during the last few decade than any other class or body there be none whose status have be so revolutionize in every respect during the last half-century as with man everywhere this discontent have manifest itself in political upheaval so it be inevitable that it should be express by woman in a demand for a voice in the government through which law be make and administer in 1888 when elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony the leader of this movement in the united state where it begin attempt to cooperate with other country they find that in only one -- great britain -- have it take organize shape by 1902 however it be possible to form a international committee in washington dc with representative from five country two year later in berlin the international woman suffrage alliance be form with accredit delegate from organization in nine country this alliance hold a congress in stockholm during the summer of 1911 with delegate from national association in twenty-four country where the movement for the enfranchisement of woman have take definite organized form the united state at the November election 1910 the man of washington by a vote of three to one enfranchise the woman of that state eleven month later in October 1911 a majority of the voter confer the suffrage on the 400000 woman of californium these two election doubtless mark the turning-point in this country in 1890 wyome come into the union with suffrage for woman in its constitution after they have be vote in the territory for twenty-one year in 1893 the voter of colorado by a majority of 6347 give full suffrage to woman in 1895 the man of utah where as a territory woman have vote seventeen year by a vote of 28618 aye to 2687 no give they this right in its constitution for statehood in 1896 idaho by a majority of 5844 fully enfranchise its woman it be believe then that woman suffrage would soon be carry in all the western state but at this time there begin a period of complete domination of politics by the commercial interest of the country through whose influence the power of the party machine become absolute temperance tariff reform control of monopoly all moral issue be relegate to the background and woman suffrage go with the rest to the vast wave of insurgency against these condition be due its victory in washington and californium as many woman be already fully enfranchise in this country as would be make voter by the suffrage bill now under consideration in great britain so that american woman take as a whole can not be put into a secondary position as regard political rights while woman householder in great britain and ireland have the municipal franchise a much larger number in this country have a partial suffrage -- a vote on question of special taxation bond etc in louisiana iowa montana michigan and in the village and many third-class city in new york and school suffrage in over half of the state great britain the situation in great britain be now at its most acute stage there the question never go to the voter but be decide by parliament seven time a woman-suffrage bill have pass its second reading in the house of common by a large majority only to be refuse a third and final reading by the premier who represent the ministry technically know as the government in 1910 the bill receive a majority of 110 larger than be secure even for the budget the government 's chief measure in 1911 the majority be 167 and again the last reading be refuse the vote be wholly non-partizan -- 145 liberal 53 unionist 31 nationalist -lrb- irish -rrb- 26 labor member ninety town and county council include those of manchester liverpool edinburgh glasgow dublin and those of all the large city send petition to parliament to grant the final vote the lord mayor of dublin in he robe of state appear before the house of common with the same plea but the liberal government be unmoved in the pass year petition aggregate over four million signature have be send in just before the recent election the conservative national association present one sign by 300000 voter in they procession and hyde park gathering the woman have make the largest political demonstration in history there have be more meeting hold more money raise and more worker enlist than to obtain suffrage for the man of the entire world from the begin the various association have ask for the franchise on the same term as grant to man not all of whom can vote for political reason it seem impossible to obtain this and meanwhile the so-called militant movement be inaugurate by woman outrage at the way the measure have be put aside for nearly forty year the treatment of these woman by the government form one of the blackest page in english history and the situation finally become so alarming that the parliament be oblige to take action a conciliation committee be form of sixty member from all party who prepare a bill that would enfranchise only woman householder those who already have possess the municipal franchise since 1869 this do not mean property-owner but include woman who may pay rent for only one room the association accept it partly because it recognize the principle that sex should not disqualify but principally because it be unquestionably all that they could get at present this be the bill which be deny a third reading for two year on the ground that it be not democratic enough a careful canvass have show that in the different part of the unite kingdom from 80 to 90 per cent of those whom it would enfranchise be wage - or salary-earning woman and not one labor member of parliament vote against it woman in england have be eligible for school board since 1870 have have the county franchise since 1888 have be eligible for

demand be strongly support by many of the nationalist member of parliament and some of the cabinet and it be not impossible that after all these year of oppression the woman of ireland may be fully enfranchise before those of england scotland and wale in the isle of man woman property-owner have have the full suffrage since 1881 and woman rate - or rent-payer since 1892 english colony the

suffrage for woman if it be successful several woman vote in place of they husband at the recent election in mexico belize the capital of british hondura have just give the right to woman to vote for town council throughout the entire world be a unmistakable tendency to accord woman a voice in the government and strange to say this be stronger in monarchy than in republic in europe the republic of france and switzerland give almost no suffrage to woman norway and finland where they have the complete franchise sweden denmark iceland and great britain where they have all but the parliamentary and that close at hand be monarchy new zealand and australium where woman be fully enfranchise be dependency of a monarchical government jane addam the comfortable citizen possess a vote win for he in a previous generation who be so often profoundly disturb by the cry of vote for woman seldom connect the present attempt to extend the franchise with those former effort as the result of which he himself become a member of the enfranchised class still less do the average voter reflect that in order to make self-government a great instrument in the hand of those who crave social justice it must ever be build up anew in relation to change experience and that unless this readjustment constantly take place self-government itself be place in jeopardy yet the adherent of representative government with its foundation lay in diversified human experience must concede that the value of such government bear a definite relation to the area of its base and that the history of its development be merely a record of new human interest which have become the subject of governmental action and the incorporation into the government itself of those class who represent the new interest as the govern class have be increase by the enfranchisement of one body of man after another the art of government have be enrich in human interest and at the same time as government have become thus humanize by new interest it have inevitably become further democratize through the accession of new class the two proposition be complementary for century the middle class in every country in europe struggle to wrest governmental power from the noble because they insist that government must consider the problem of a rise commerce on the other hand the merchant claim direct representation because government have already begin to concern itself with commercial affair when the work man of the nineteenth century the chartist in england and the man of '48 in germany vigorously demand the franchise national parliament have already begin to regulate the condition of mine and the labor of little child the work man insist that they themselves could best represent they own interest but at the same time they very entrance into government increase the volume and pressure of those interest much of the new demand for political enfranchisement arise from a desire to remedy the unsatisfactory and degrading social condition which be responsible for so much wrongdoing and wretchedness the fate of all the unfortunate the suffer the criminal be daily force upon public attention in painful and intimate way but because of the tendency to nationalize all industrial and commercial question to make the state responsible for the care of the helpless to safeguard by law the food we eat and the liquid we drink to subordinate the claim of the individual family to the health and well-being of the community contemporary woman who be without the franchise be much more outside the real life of the world than any set of disenfranchised man could possibly have be in all history unless it be the man slave of ancient greece because never before have so large a area of life find civic expression never have hegel 's definition of the state be so accurate that it be the realization of the moral ideal certain it be that the phenomenal entrance of woman into governmental responsibility in the dawn of the twentieth century be coincident with the consideration by governmental body of the basic human interest with which woman have be traditionally concern a most advanced german statesman recently declare in the reichstag that it be a reproach to the imperial government itself that out of two million child bear annually in germany 400000 die during the first twelve month of they existence he proceed to catalog various reform which might remedy this such as better housing the increase of park area the erection of municipal hospital the provision for a adequate milk supply and many another but he do not make the very obvious suggestion that woman might be of service in a situation involve the care of child less than a year old nevertheless in spite of this lack of perception woman all over the world be claim and receive a place in representative government because they insist that they will not cease to perform they traditional duty simply because these duty have be take over by exist government the contemporaneous vote for woman movement be often amorphous and sporadic but always spontaneous it not only appear simultaneously in various country but manifest itself in widely separated group in the same country in every city it embrace the smart set and the hard-driven work woman sometimes it be sectarian and dogmatic at other philosophic and grandiloquent but it be always vital and constantly become more widespread in certain aspect it differ from former effort to extend the franchise we recall that the final entrance of the middle class into government be characterize by two dramatic revolution one in america and one in france neither of they without bloodshed and that although the final effort of the work man be more peaceful even in restrained england the chartist burn hayrick and destroy town property this world-wide entrance into government on the part of woman be happily a bloodless one although some glass have be break in england it be noteworthy that the movement as a whole have be without even a semblance of violence the creed of the movement however be similar to that promulgate by the doctrinaire of the eighteenth century : that if increase the size of the govern body automatically increase the variety and significance of government then only when all the people become the govern class can the collective resource and organization of the community be consistently utilize for the common weal david lloyd-george i have long be a convinced advocate of woman suffrage and be now firmer than ever in support it it seem to I a necessary and desirable consequence of the vast extension of the function of government which the past century and a half have witness the state nowadays enter the home of the people and insist on have a voice in question that individual man and woman act together take counsel together use to settle for themselves in they own way education and the training and feeding of child the housing and sanitation problem provision against old age and sickness the prevention of disease -- all these be question that formerly be deal with of course in a very isolate and inadequate way by cooperation and discussion between the head of each household what reason be there why the same cooperation should not continue now that these matter have be raise to the sphere of legislative enactment and official administration law to-day affect the interest of woman just as deeply as they do the interest of man some law -- many law -- affect they more gravely and intimately and i do not believe you can trust the welfare of a class or a sex entirely to another class or sex it be not that they interest be not identical but that they point of view be different take the housing problem a work man leave home in the morning within half a hour after he wake he be not there all day he turn up in the evening and do not always remain there if the house be a poor uncomfortable dismal one he very often seek consolation in the glare and warmth of the nearest public-house but he take very good care that the wife shall not do as he do she have get to stay at home all day however wretch she surroundings who can say that she experience she point of view be not much better worth consulting than she husband 's on the housing problem up to the present the only and the whole share of woman in the housing question have be suffer slum be often the punishment of the man they be almost always the martyrdom of the woman give woman the vote give they a effective part in the framing and administration of the law which touch not merely they own life but the life of they child and they will soon i believe cleanse the land of these foul den all sort of woman 's interest be affect by the national insurance act and all sort of question spring up in connection with it on which woman alone could speak with real authority but be voteless there be no way in which they view could be authoritatively set forth four million woman worker and seven million married woman have come under the operation of the act yet not one of they be give the opportunity of make they opinion know and feel through a representative in the house of common it be the experience of every friendly society official i consult that have it not be for the woman and they splendid self-sacrifice the subscription of the man would have lapse long ago yet these woman who have thus keep the society go be not consider worth consult as to they status under the act the house of common itself insist on there be at least one woman commissioner but if a woman be fit to be a commissioner -- a very heavy and difficult position involve enormous responsibility and demand great skill and judgment and experience -- how can she be say to be unfit to have a vote what be the meaning of democracy it be that the citizen who be expect to obey the law be those who make the law but that be not true of great britain at least half the adult citizen whose life be deeply affect by every law that be carry on the statute-book have absolutely no voice in make that law they have no more influence in the matter than the horse that drag they lord and master to the polling-booth the drunken loafer who have not earn a living for year be consult by the constitution on question like the training and upbringing of child the national settlement of religion in wale and elsewhere and as to the best method of deal with the licensing problem but the wife whose industry keep he and he household from beggary who pay the rent and tax which constitute he a voter who be therefore really responsible for he qualification to vote be not take into account in the slightest degree i come in contact not long ago with a great girl ' school in the south of england it be found by woman and it be administer by woman it be one of the most marvelous organization in the whole country and yet when we have in the year 1906 to give a national verdict on the question of education the man who split the firewood in that school be ask for he opinion about it while those lady be deem to be absolutely unfit to pass any judgment on it at all that be a preposterous and barbarous anachronism and so long as it last we democracy be one-sided and incomplete but it will not last long no franchise bill can ever again be bring forward in this country without raise the whole problem of whether you be go to exclude more than half the citizen of the land woman have enter pretty nearly every sphere of commerce and industry and professional activity and public employment and there never be a time when the nation stand more in need of the special experience instinct and sympathy of womanhood in the management of its affair when woman get the vote the horizon of the home will be both brighten and expand and they influence on moral and social and educational question especially on the temperance question and possibly on the peace of nation will be constant and humanize those be a few of the reason why i favor woman suffrage but because i favor it i do not therefore hold myself bind to either speak or vote for any and every suffrage bill that may be introduce into parliament i vote against the so-called conciliation bill which propose to give the vote to every woman of property if she choose to take the trouble to get it and at the same time enfranchise only about one-tenth or one-fifteenth of the work woman of the country that be simply a roundabout way of double the plural voter and no democrat could possibly support it so long as there remain a single alternative the solution that most appeal to I be the one embody in the dickinson bill that be to say a measure confer the vote on woman householder and on the wife of married elector and i believe that it be in that form that woman suffrage will eventually come in this country how soon it will come depend very largely on how soon the militant come to they sens i say unhesitatingly that the main obstacle to woman get the vote be militancy and nothing else its practitioner really seem to think that they can terrorize and pinprick parliament into give it to they and until they learn something of the people they be deal with they whole agitation so far as the house of common be concern be simply and utterly damned it be perfectly astonishing to recall with what diabolical ingenuity they have contrived to infuriate all they opponent to alienate all they sympathizer and to stir up against themselves every prejudice in the average man 's breast a few year ago they find three-fourth of the liberal mp 's on they side they at once proceed to cudgel they brain as to how they could possibly drive they into the enemy 's camp they rightly decide that this could not be do more effectually than by insulting and assault the prime minister the chief of the party and a leader for whom all he colleague and follower feel a unbounded admiration regard and affection when they have thus successfully estrange the majority of liberal they begin to study the political situation a little more closely they see that the irish nationalist be very powerful factor in the ministerial coalition the next problem therefore be how to destroy the last chance that the irish nationalist would support they cause they achieve this triumphantly first by make trouble in belfast where the only nationalist member be or be a strong suffragist and secondly by go to dublin when all nationalist ireland have assemble to welcome mr asquith throw a hatchet at mr redmond and try to burn down a theater that finish ireland but still they be dissatisfy there be a dangerous movement of sympathy with they agitation in wale and they feel that at any cost it have to be check they not only check but demolish it with the greatest ease by break in upon the proceedings at a eisteddfod now the eisteddfod be not only the great national festival of welsh poetry and music and eloquence it be also a oasis of peace amid the sharp contention of welsh life to bring into it any note of politics or sectarianism or public controversy even when these thing be rouse the most passionate emotion outside seem to a welshman like the desecration of a altar that be just what the militant do and welsh interest in they cause fall dead on the spot but even then they be not happy they be still encumber by the good-will of perhaps a hundred tory mp 's but they prove entirely equal to the task of antagonize they they begin smash window burn country mansion firing race-stand damage golf-green striking as hard as they could at the tory idol of property there be really nothing more left for they to do they have alienate every friend they ever have they work be complete beyond they wildest hope well one can not dignify such tactic and antic by the title of political propaganda the proper name for they be sheer organize lunacy the militant have erect militancy into a principle i be begin to think that a good many of they be more concern with the success of they method than with the success of they cause they would rather not have the vote than fail to win it by the particular brand of agitation they have pin they faith to they do not really want the vote to be give they they want to get it and to get it by force and they be quite unable to see that the more force they use the stronger become the resolve both of parliament and of the country to send they away empty-handed if they have accept mr asquith 's pledge of two year ago and thank he for it and help he redeem it woman suffrage by now would be a accomplished fact but they prefer they own way and what be the result the result be that work for they cause in the house of common to-day be like swim not merely against a tide but against a cataract the real reason why the attempt to carry woman suffrage through the house of common during the past two year have fail be not merely the difficulty of try to combine a non-party measure with the party system it be above all the impossibility of use parliament to pass a bill that the opinion of the country have be foment to condemn the fact that in both the principal party there be a clean division of opinion on this issue and that no government or none that be at present conceivable can bring forward a measure for the enfranchisement of woman as a government be a great but not necessarily a insuperable obstacle the one barrier there be no surmount and no get round be the decide and increase hostility of public sentiment and for that the militant have only themselves to thank personally i always try to remember first that militancy be the work of only a very small fraction of the woman who want the vote and ought to have it and secondly that there have be crazy man just as there be crazy woman militancy have not affect my own individual attitude toward the main question and never will but i recognize that it have kill the immediate parliamentary prospects of any and every suffrage bill and that so long as militancy continue the house of common will do nothing only a new movement altogether can now bring woman to the goal of political emancipation and it will have to be a sane hard-headed practical movement as full of liveliness as you please but absolutely divorce from stone and bomb and torch when it arise the friend of the woman 's cause will begin to take heart again israel zangwill the awkward age of the woman 's movement and what do she get by it say my uncle toby what do any woman get by it say my father _ martyrdom _ reply the young benedictine tristram shandy the present situation of woman suffrage in england recall the old puzzle : what happen when a irresistible force meet a immovable body the irresistible force be the religious passion of myriad of woman the fury of self-sacrifice the righteous zeal that shrink not even from crime the immovable body may be sum up as mr asquith almost as gross a incarnation of tory prejudice as squire western who lay it down that woman should come in with the first dish and go out with the first glass mr asquith be all that stand between the sex and the suffrage the answer to the old puzzle i suppose would be that though the immovable body do not move yet the impact of the irresistible force generate heat which as we know from tyndall be a mode of motion at any rate heat be the only mode in which the progress of woman suffrage can be register to-day the movement have come to what mr henry jame might call the awkward age : a age which have pass beyond argument without arrive at achievement a age for which word be too small and blow too big and because impatience have be the salvation of the movement and because the suffragette will not believe that the fiery charger which have carry she so far can not really climb the last ridge of the mountain but must be replace by a mule -- that miserable compromise between a steed and a anti-suffragist -- the awkward age be also the dangerous age when the cabinet of clement 's inn perceive that if a woman suffrage bill do not pass this session the last chance -- under the parliament act -- be go for this parliament resolve to rouse public opinion by break tradesman 's window it overlook that the english be a nation of shopkeeper and that the public opinion thus rouse would be for the first time almost unreservedly on the side of the government and when the cabinet of down street move to responsive recklessness raid the quarter of the woman 's social and political union and indict the leader for criminal conspiracy it equally overlook a essential factor of the situation the cabinet of the conspiracy be at least as much a restraint to suffragette as a incentive it hold in order the more violent member the soul naturally daring or madden by forcible feeding by its imposition of minor form of lawlessness it check the suggestion of major form crime be control by a curriculum and temper study by a time-table the interruption at meeting be distribute among the suppose neuropath like part at a play and we to the maenad who miss she cue with the police too the suffragette live for the most part on term of cordial cooperation each side recognize that the other must do its duty when the suffragette plan a raid upon down street or the house of common they give notice of time and place and be provide with a sufficient force of police to prevent it be the day inconvenient for the police owe to the pressure of social engagement another day be fix politics permit the _ entente cordiale _ extend even in some instance to the jailer and the bench and as in those early day of the quaker persecution of which milton 's friend ellwood have leave record prisoner sometimes leave they cell for a night to attend to imperative affair or good-naturedly shorten or cancel they sentence at the press solicitation of perturb magistrate prison be purify by all these gentle presence and woman criminal profit by the removal of the abuse they challenge holloway become a home from home in which beam wardress welcome old offender and to which husband conduct err wife in taxicab much as ellwood and he brethren march of themselves from newgate to bridewell explain to the astonished citizen of london that they word be they keeper a suffragette 's word stand higher than consol and the war-game be play card on table true there be brutal interlude when home secretary lose they head or hysterical magistrate they sense of justice or when the chivalrous constabulary of westminster be replace by whitechapel police dense to the courtesy of the situation but even these tragedy be transfuse by its humor by the subtle duel of woman 's wit and man 's lumber legalism the hunger-strike itself with all its grim horror and heroism be like the plot of a gilbertian opera it place the government on the horn of a irish bull either the law must kill or torture prisoner condemn for mild offens or it must permit they to dictate they own term of durance the criminal code whose dignity generation of male rebel could not impair the whole array of warder lawyer judge jury and policeman which all the scorn of a tolstoy could not shrivel shrink into a laughing-stock and the comedy of the situation be complicate and enhance by the fact that the home office so far from be a inquisition be more or less tenant by sympathizer with female suffrage and that a home secretary who secretly admire the quixotry of the hunger-striker be force to feed they forcibly he must either be denounce by the suffragette as a torquemada or by the public as a incapable bayard himself could not have cope with the position there be no place like the home office and its administrator like the governor of the gold coast have to be relieve at frequent interval as for the police they one aim in life become to avoid arrest suffragette such be the situation which the governmental _ coup _ transform to tragedy unrelieved give we in the place of order lawlessness and responsible leadership a guerrilla warfare against society by irresponsive individual more or less unbalanced that the heroic incendiary mr leigh who deserve penal servitude and a statue have be drive wild by forcible feeding be a fact that have give considerable uneasiness to headquarters but she have be keep in comparative discipline now that discipline have be destroy it be possible that other free-lance will catch the contagion of crime nay there be sign that the leader themselves be be infect through the difficulty of disavow they martyr the wisest course for the government would be to pardon miss pankhurst of pari and officially invite she to resume control of she follower before they have quite control she but even without such a crowning confession of the failure of its _ coup _ the humiliation of the government have be sufficiently complete force to put mr pankhurst and the pethick lawrence into the luxurious category of political prisoner next to release they altogether and finally to liberate they humblest follower they hunger-strike on behalf of whose equal treatment set a new standard of military chivalry the government succeed only in invest the vanish christabel with a new glamour the woman 's social and political union have again baffle the government and come triumphantly even through the window-breaking episode for if that episode be follow by the rejection of the second reading of the woman suffrage bill second reading like the oath of the profane have come to be absolutely without significance and the blocking of the bill beyond this stage have be assure long before by the tactic of mr redmond whose passion for justice like mr asquith 's passion for popular government be so curiously monosexual the only discount from the union 's winnings be that it give mendacious mp 's anxious to back out of woman suffrage a soft bed to lie on one should perhaps also add to the debit side of the account a considerable loss of popularity on the part of the suffragette a loss which would become complete be window-breaking to pass into graver crime and which would entirely paralyze the effect of they tactic for the tactic of the prison and the hunger-strike depend for they value upon the innocency of the prisoner they offense must be merely nominal or technical the suffragette have rediscover the quaker truth that the spirit be stronger than all the force of government and that thing may really come by fasting and prayer even the window-breaking though a perilous approach to the method of the pagan male be only a damage to insensitive material for which the window-breaker be prepare to pay in conscious suffering but once the injury be do to flesh and blood the injurer would only be pay tooth for tooth and eye for eye and all the sympathy would go not to the assailant but to the victim mr pankhurst say the government must either give vote to woman or prepare to send large number of woman to penal servitude that would be indeed awkward for the government if penal servitude be easily procurable unfortunately the woman must first qualify for it and they crime would disembarrass the government mr leigh could have be safely leave to starve have she attempt arson of that theater really come off especially with loss of life thus violence may be militant but it be not tactic and violence against society at large be peculiarly tactless george fox would hardly occupy so exalt a niche in history if he have use he hammer to make not shoe but corps the suffragette who run amuck have in fact become the victim of they own vocabulary they union be militant but a church militant not a army militant the salvation army might as well suddenly take to shoot the heathen it be only by mob misunderstanding that the suffragette be conceive as virago just as it be only by mob misunderstanding that the member of the society of friend be conceive as desperado if it can not be say that they proceedings be as quintessentially peaceful as some of those absolutely mute quaker meeting which the police of charle ii humorously enough break up as riot yet they have a thousand propaganda meeting -lrb- ignore by the press -rrb- to one militant action -lrb- record and magnify -rrb- even in battle nothing could be more decorous or constitutional than the overwhelming majority of they pin-prick i remember a beautiful young lady faultlessly dress who in soft musical accent interrupted mr birrell at the mansion house steward hurl themselves at she policeman hasten from every point of the compass but unruffle as at the dinner-table without turn a hair of she exquisite _ chévelure _ she continue gently explain the wish of womankind till she disappear in a whirlwind of hysteric masculinity but in gradually succumb to the vulgar misunderstanding play up to the caricature and finally assimilate to the crude and obsolescent method of man the suffragette have be throw away they own peculiar glory they characteristic contribution to history and politics rosalind in search of a vote have supply humanity with a new type who snatch from she testifying a grace beyond the reach of arden but rosalind with a revolver would be merely a reactionary hawthorne 's zenobium who for all she emancipation drown herself in a fit of amorous jealousy be no greater backslider from the true path of woman 's advancement it be some relief to find that mr pankhurst 's latest program disavow attack on human life limit itself to destruction of property and that the pethick lawrence have grow still saner there might indeed be -- for force be not always brute -- some excuse and even admiration for the terrorist do the triumph of she cause appear indefinitely remote be even that triumph to be bring perceptibly nearer by forcibly feed we with horror but the contrary be the case : even the epidemic of crime foreshadow by mr pankhurst could not appreciably delay woman suffrage it be come as fast as human nature and the nature of the parliamentary machine will allow to try to terrorize mr asquith into bring in a government measure be to credit he with a wisdom and a nobility almost divine no man be great enough to put himself in the right by admit he be wrong and even if he be great enough to admit it under argument he would have to be godlike to admit it under menace rather than admit it mr asquith have let himself be drive into a position more ludicrous than perhaps any prime minister have occupy for though he declare woman suffrage to be a political disaster of the gravest kind he be ready to push it through if the house of common wish rely for its rejection upon the house of lord which he have denounce and eviscerate he be even not unwilling it shall pass if only the disaster to the country be maximize by adult suffrage it be not that he love woman more but the tory party less all thing consider i be afraid the suffrage movement will have to make up its mind to wait for another parliament there be more hope for the premature collapse of this parliament than for its passing of a suffrage bill or clause and at the general election whenever it come vote for woman will be put on the program of both party the conservative will offer a mild dose the liberal a democratic whichever fail at the poll the principle of woman suffrage will be safe this prognostic it will be see involve the removal of the immovable asquith but he must either consent to follow a plebiscite of he party or retire like he doorkeeper from down street under the intolerable burden of the suffragette much as he party honor and admire he it can not continue to repudiate the essential principle of liberalism nor find refuge in he sophism that liberalism remove artificial barrier but can not remove natural barrier what natural barrier prevent a woman from accept or reject a man who propose to represent she in parliament no after he historic inning mr asquith will sacrifice himself and retire cover with laurel and contradiction pend which event the suffragette while do they best to precipitate it through the downfall of the government may very reasonably continue they policy of pin-prick to keep politician from go to sleep but serious violence would be worse than a crime it would be a blunder no general dare throw away he man when nothing be to be gain and we analysis show that the interval between woman and the vote can only be shorten by bring on a general election there be indeed skeptic who fear that even at the next general election both party may find a way of circumvent woman suffrage by secretly agree to keep it off both program but the country itself be too sick of the question to endure this even if the woman 's liberal federation and the corresponding conservative body permit it that the party would go so far as to pair off they woman worker against each other be unlikely at any rate now when other form of agitation be more or less futile be the moment for these and cognate body to take up the run but even if these woman worker fail in backbone and allow themselves as so often before to be lull and gull by they male politician there yet remain a ardent body to push forward they cause mr humphry ward and the anti-suffragist may be trust to continue tireless and ever-inventive mr ward 's league to promote the return of woman as town and county councilor be she latest device to prove the unfitness of woman for public affair and since the vegetarian league for combate the carnivorous instinct of the tigress by feed she on blood there have be no quite so happy adaptation of means to end if anything could add to the educative efficiency of the new league it be mrs ward 's scrupulousness in limit it exclusively to anti-suffragists elbert hubbard there be a time in england when all the law be make and execute by the king later he appoint certain favorite who act for he and these be pay honor and emolument accordingly still later all soldier be allow to express they political preference and that be where we get the idea about not allow folk to vote who could not fight it be once the law in england that no catholic should be allow to vote it be also once the law in england that no jew could hold real estate could vote at election could hold a public office or serve on a jury full rights of citizenship be not give to the jew in great britain until the year 1858 deist theist quaker and dissenter be not allow to testify in court and they right to vote be challenge in england up to 1885 for century jew occupy the position of minor mental defective or man with criminal record woman now in england occupy the same position politically that the jew do a hundred year ago until very recent time all lawmaker dispute the fact that woman have rights woman have privilege and duty -- mostly duty all the law be make by man and for the most part the rights only of male citizen be consider if the rights of woman or child be take into consideration it be only from a secondary point of view or because the attention of lawmaker be especially call to the natural rights of woman child and dumb animal provision however have always be make in england as well as all other civilized country for punish catholic jew quaker and woman in old new england there be once a please invention call a duck stool that be for woman only for the most part the punishment for these individual who be not citizen be very much more severe than it be for the people who make and devise the punishment for they woman be admit into the full rights of citizenship in new zealand and australium and in several state in the united state there will surely come a time when we will look back and regard the withholding of full political rights from woman in the same way that we now look back and regard the disfranchisement of jew and catholic there be no argument that can possibly be present against the right of woman to express they political preference which do not in equal degree apply to the right of male citizen to express theirs every possible logical argument have be put forward and answer the protest in england by certain woman who be work for equal suffrage have take what be call a militant form these woman in many instance have be guilty of violence the particular woman who have be foremost in this matter of violence be not criminal in any sense of the word they be not plot and plan the overthrow of the government they be not guilty of treason and certainly they be not guilty of disorder along any other line than that spring out of they disapproval of the failure of the government to grant the right of political representation to woman taxation without representation be the shibboleth of the man who found the government of the united state of america this shibboleth or slogan come to they from across the sea and be first utter in england before the day of magna charta that every adult individual man or woman possess of normal mentality should be thoroughly interested in the government and should have the right of express he or she political preference be beyond dispute especially under any government that affect to derive its power from the govern the right to govern be confer by the govern and this be now admit even in the so-called monarchy and the govern be not exclusively male the govern be man and woman for woman be responsible before the law so thoroughly be these fact fix in the mind of a great many man and woman everywhere that a few man be possess by the righteousness of the cause to a degree that they be willing not only to live for it and fight for it suffer for it but also to die for it some of these woman in london who have be throw stone into window thus destroy property have signify as great a willingness to injure themselves as they have to injure the property of they fellow citizen provide by so do they can bring to the attention of the man in charge of the government the absolute necessity of recognize the political rights of woman if certain people in the past have not be willing to stake they all on individual rights there would to-day be no liberty for any one the savior of the world be simply those who have be willing to die that humanity might live it may be hard for a individual of average purpose to understand or comprehend this mental attitude where the individual be fire with such zeal that he be willing to suffer physical destruction for it in england the test have come to a issue of whether these woman intent on bring about governmental recognition of the rights of woman should be allow to die for the cause or not and from all latest report john bull do seem trouble about it militarism its climax in the threat of universal war over morocco ad 1911 norman angell sir max waechter dl ever since germany by the completeness of she military preparation win so decisive a victory over france in 1870 europe have plunge deeper and deeper into militarism that be to say each european state that could possibly afford it have increase its army and its navy until to-day they military force be many time more powerful than it be half a century ago the theory on which this be do be that you can secure peace only by show you be ready to fight that if one nation be sure that it can thrash another it will probably plan a opportunity to do so such be the theory but what be the tragic result military expenditure have increase at a stupendous rate and all europe groan under a burden of almost unendurable taxation moreover the possession of such splendid machinery of warfare be a constant temptation to employ it and so vindicate its staggering expense this be startlingly show in the case of the morocco imbroglio during the early part of 1911 the french government make clear its intent to take complete possession of the semi-independent african state of morocco on July 1st germany send a warship to the moroccan port of agadir as a sign that she also have interest in the country which france must not override instantly europe buzz like a angry bee-hive england and france have previously make a secret treaty agree that france should be allow to take morocco in exchange for keep hand off egypt where england be establish herself hence england now feel compel to uphold she ally when germany seem inclined to bully the frenchman england insist that she also must be consult germany growl that this be none of england 's business everybody begin get out they gun and parade they army germany seek the support of austrium and italy she partner in the triple alliance france and england emphasize the fact that russium stand with they in a antagonistic triple entente on November 4th france and germany come to a peaceful agreement france take morocco and compensate germany by yield to she some territory in eastern equatorial africa thus the whole excitement pass off in rumbling there be no war but it be reveal a few month later that the nation have really approach to the very brink of a titanic struggle which would have desolate the whole of europe and here be the peculiar tragedy of militarism the mere threat of that great unfought war cost europe billion of dollar moreover as a result of germany 's discontent at what she rather regard as she defeat in this morocco affair she in 1913 enormously increase she army and more than double she already heavy military tax upon she people then france and russia feel compel to meet germany 's move by increase they army also extend as she have do the time of compulsory military service inflict upon they poorer class norman angell a english writer have recently stir all think people by a remarkable book of protest against militarism he here discuss the moroccan imbroglio under the title of the mirage of the map sir max waechter be a authority of international repute upon the same subject norman angell the press of europe and america be very busy discuss the lesson of the diplomatic conflict which have just end and the outstanding impression which one get from most of these essay in high politics -- whether french italian or british -- be that we have be and be witness part of a great world movement the setting in motion of titanic force deep-set in primordial need and impulse for month those in the secret of the chancellery have speak with bated breath -- as though in the presence of some vision of armageddon on the strength of this mere talk of war by the three nation vast commercial interest have be embarrassed fortune have be lose and win on the bourse bank have suspend payment some thousand have be ruin while the fact that the fourth and fifth nation have actually go to war have raise all sort of further possibility of conflict not alone in europe but in asia with remoter danger of religious fanaticism and all its sequelae international bitterness and suspicion in general have be intensify and the one certain result of the whole thing be that immense burden will be add in the shape of further taxation for armament to the already heavy one carry by the five or six nation concern for two or three hundred million of people in europe life which with all the problem of high price labor war unsolved social difficulty be none too easy as it be will be make harder still the need therefore that can have provoke a conflict of these dimension must be primordial indeed in fact one authority assure we that what we have see go on be the struggle for life among man -- that struggle which have its parallel in the whole of sentient existence well i put it to you as a matter worth just a moment or two of consideration that this conflict be about nothing of the sort that it be about a perfectly futile matter one which the immense majority of the german english french italian and turkish people could afford to treat with the completest indifference for to the vast majority of these 250000000 people more or less it do not matter two straw whether morocco or some vague african swamp near the equator be administer by german french italian or turkish official so long as it be well administer or rather one should go further : if french german or italian colonization of the past be any guide the nation which win in the conquest for territory of this sort have add a wealth-draining incubus this of course be preposterous i be lose sight of the need for make provision for the future expansion of the race of each party desire to find its place in the sun and heaven know what well let we for a moment get away from phrase and examine a few fact usually ignore because they happen to be beneath we nose france have get a new empire we be tell she have win a great victory she be grow and expand and be richer by something which she rival be the poorer for not have let we assume that she make the same success of morocco that she have make of she other possession of say tuni which represent one of the most successful of those operation of colonial expansion which have mark she history during the last forty year what have be the precise effect on french prosperity in thirty year at a cost of many million sterling -lrb- it be part of successful colonial administration in france never to let it be know what the colony really cost -rrb- france have found in tunis a colony in which to-day there be exclude soldier and official about 25000 genuine french colonist : just the number by which the french population in france -- the real france -- be diminish every six month and the value of tuni as a market do not even amount to the sum which france spend directly on its occupation and administration to say nothing of the indirect extension of military burden which its conquest involve and of course the market which it represent would still exist in some form though england -- or even germany -- administer the country in other word france lose twice every year in she home population two colony equivalent to tuni -- if we measure colony in term of community make up of the race which have spring from the mother country and yet if once in a generation she ruler and diplomat can point to 25000 frenchman live artificially and exotically under condition which must in the long run be inimical to they race it be pointed to as expansion and as evidence that france be maintain she position as a great power a few year as history go unless there be some complete change of tendency which at present seem as strong as ever the french race as we now know it will have cease to exist swamp without the firing may be of a single shot by the german belgian english italian and jew there be to-day in france more german than there be frenchman in all the colony that france have acquire in the last half-century and german trade with france outweigh enormously the trade of france with all french colony france be to-day a better colony for the german than they could make of any exotic colony which france own they _ tell _ I say a french deputy recently -lrb- in a not quite original _ mot _ -rrb- that the german be at agadir i _ know _ they be in the champs-elysées which of course be in reality a much more serious matter and those frenchman who regret this disappearance of they race and declare that the energy and blood and money which be now pour out so lavishly in africa and in asia ought to be divert to its arrest to the colonization and development of france by better social industrial commercial and political organization to the resist of the exploitation of the mother country by inflow mass of foreigner be declare to be bad patriot dead to the sentiment of the flag dead to the call of the bugle be silence in fact by a fustian as senseless and mischievous as that which in some marvelous way the politician hypnotize by the old formula have manage to make pass as patriotism in most country the french like they neighbor be not interested in the german of the champs-elysées but only in the german at agadir : and it be for these latter that the diplomat fight and the war budget swell and from that silent and pacific expansion which mean so much both negatively and positively attention be divert to the banging of the war drum and the dancing of the patriotic dervish and on the other side we be to assume that germany have during the period of france 's expansion -- since the war -- not expand at all that she have be throttle and cramp -- that she have not have she place in the sun : and that be why she must fight for it and endanger the security of she neighbor well i put it to you again that all this in reality be false : that germany have not be cramp or throttle that on the contrary as we recognize when we get away from the mirage of the map she expansion have be the wonder of the world she have add 20000000 to she population -- one-half the present population of france -- during a period in which the french population have actually diminish of all the nation in europe she have cut the biggest swath in the development of world trade industry and influence despite the fact that she have not expand in the sense of mere political dominion a proportion of she population equivalent to the white population of the whole colonial british empire make they living or the best part of it from the development and exploitation of territory outside she border these fact be not new they have be make the text of thousand of political sermon preach in england itself during the last few year but one side of they significance seem to have be miss we get then this : on the one side a nation extend enormously its political dominion and yet diminish in national force if by national force we mean the growth of a sturdy enterprising vigorous people -lrb- i be not deny that france be both wealthy and comfortable to a greater degree it may be than she rival but she have not she colony to thank for it -- quite the contrary -rrb- on the other side we get immense expansion express in term of those thing -- a grow and vigorous population and the possibility of feed they -- and yet the political dominion speak practically have hardly be extend at all such a condition of thing if the common jargon of high politics mean anything be preposterous it take nearly all mean out of most that we hear about primordial need and the rest of it as a matter of fact we touch here one of the vital confusion which be at the bottom of most of the present political trouble between nation and show the power of the old idea and the old phraseology in the day of the sailing ship and the lumber wagon drag slowly over all but impassable road for one country to derive any considerable profit from another it have practically to administer it politically but the compound steam engine the railway the telegraph have profoundly modify the element of the whole problem in the modern world political dominion be play a more and more effaced role as a factor in commerce the non-political factor have in practice make it all but inoperative it be the case with every modern nation actually that the outside territory which it exploit most successfully be precisely those of which it do not own a foot even with the most characteristically colonial of all -- great britain -- the greater part of she overseas trade be do with country which she make no attempt to own control coerce or dominate -- and incidentally she have cease to do any of these thing with she colony million of german in prussium and westphalium derive profit or make they live out of country to which they political dominion in no way extend the modern german exploit south america by remain at home where forsake this principle he attempt to work through political power he approach futility german colony be colony pour rire the government have to bribe german to go to they she trade with they be microscopic and if the twenty million who have be add to germany 's population since the war have have to depend on they country 's political conquest they would have have to starve what feed they be country which germany have never own and never hope to own brazil argentina the united state indium australium canada russium france and england -lrb- germany which never spend a mark on its political conquest to-day draw more tribute from south america than do spain which have pour out mountain of treasure and ocean of blood in its conquest -rrb- these be germany 's real colony yet the immense interest which they represent of really primordial concern to germany without which so many of she people would be actually without food be for the diplomat and the soldier quite secondary one the immense trade which they represent owe nothing to the diplomat to agadir incident to dreadnought it be the unaided work of the merchant and the manufacturer all this diplomatic and military conflict and rivalry this waste of wealth the unspeakable foulness which tripolus be reveal be reserve for thing which both side to the quarrel could sacrifice not merely without loss but with profit and italy whose statesman have be faithful to all the old axiom -lrb- heaven save the mark -rrb- will discover it rapidly enough even she defender be cease now to urge that she can possibly derive any real benefit from this colossal ineptitude italy strike at turkey for honor for prestige -- for the purpose of impress europe and one may hope that europe -lrb- after read the report of reuter _ the time _ the _ daily mirror _ and the new york _ world _ as to the method which italy be use in vindicate she honor -rrb- be duly impressed and that italian patriot be satisfy with these new glory add to italian history it be all they will get or rather will they get much more : for italy as unhappily for the balance of europe the substance will be represent by the increase of very definite every-day difficulty -- the high cost of live the uncertainty of employment the very deep problem of poverty education government well-being these remain -- worsen and this -- not the spectacular clash of arm or even the less spectacular killing of unarmed arab man woman and child -- constitute the real struggle for life among man but the dilettante of high politics be not interested for those who still take they language and habit of think from the day of the sailing-ship still talk of possess territory still assume that tribute in some form be possible still imply that the limit of commercial and industrial activity be dependent upon the limit of political dominion the struggle be represent by this futile physical collision of group which however victory may go leave the real solution further off than ever we know what precede this war : if europe have any moral conscience leave it would have be shock as it be never shock before turkey say : we will submit italy 's grievance to any tribunal that europe care to name and abide by the result italy say : we do not intend to have the case judge but to take tripoli hand it over -- in twenty-four hour the turkish government say : at least make it possible for we to face we own people call it a protectorate give we the shadow of sovereignty otherwise it be not robbery -- to which we should submit -- but gratuitous degradation we should abdicate before the eye of we own people we will do anything you like in that case say italy we will rob and we will go to war it be not merely robbery that the italian government intend but they mean from the first that it should be war -- to dish the socialist to play some sordid intrigue of internal politics the ultimatum be launch from the center of christendom -- the city which lodge the titular head of the universal church -- to teach to the mohammedan world what may be expect from a modern christian government with its back to eighteen century of christian teaching we christendom spend score of million -- hundred of million it may be -- in the propagation of the christian faith : numberless man and woman give they life for it we father spend two century in unavailing warfare for the capture of some of its symbol presumably therefore we attach some value to its principle deem they of some worth in the defense of human society or do we believe nothing of the sort be we real opinion that these thing at bottom do not matter -- or matter so little that for the sake of rob the squalid belongings of a few arab tribe or play some mean game of party politics they can be set aside in a whoop of patriotism we press wax indignant in this particular case and that be the end of it but we do not see that we be to blame that it be all the outcome of a conception of politics which we be forever ready to do we part to defend to do daily we part to uphold and those of we who try in we feeble way to protest against this conception of politics and patriotism where everything stand on its head where the large be make to appear the great and the great be make to appear the small be deride as sentimentalist utopian as though anything could be more sentimental more divorce from the sense of reality than the principle which lead we to a condition of thing like these as though anything could be more wildly burlesquely utopian than the idea that effort of the kind that the italian people be now make the energy they be now spend could ever achieve anything of worth be it not time that the man in the street verily i believe less deluded by diplomatic jargon than he betters less the slave of a obsolete phraseology insist that the expert in the high place acquire some sense of the reality of thing of proportion some sense of figure a little knowledge of industrial history of the real process of human cooperation at present europe be quite indifferent to italy 's behavior the chancellery which will go to enormous trouble and take enormous risk and concoct alliance and counter-alliance when there be territory to be seize remain cold when crime of this sort be commit and they remain cold because they believe that turkey alone be concern they do not see that italy have attack not turkey but europe that we more than turkey will pay the broken pot and there be a further reason : we still believe in these piracy we believe they pay and that we may get we turn at some swag to-morrow france be envy for she possession of morocco germany for she increase authority over some pestilential african swamp but when we realize that in these international burglary there be no swag that the whole thing be a illusion that there be huge cost but no reward we shall be on the road to a better tradition which while it may not give we international police may do better still -- render the police unnecessary for when we have realize that the game be not worth the candle when no one desire to commit aggression the competition in armament will have become a bad nightmare of the past sir max waechter it be generally admit that the present condition of europe be highly unsatisfactory to any close observer it must be evident that europe as a whole be gradually lose its position in the world other nation which be rapidly come to the front will in course of time displace the european unless the latter can pull themselves together and abandon the vicious system which now handicap they in the economic rivalry of nation the cause of this comparative decline be in my opinion to be find in the fact that all the european country be arm against one another either for defense or for aggression for the attack be frequently the best form of defense the motive for these excessive armament can clearly be find in the jealousy and mistrust exist among the nation of europe europe be spend on armament something like four hundred million pound sterling per year and there be a tendency to increase this tremendous expenditure in order to bring the magnitude of this sacrifice more vividly before the reader let we assume that a european war be not likely to occur more frequently than about every thirty year we then find that the incredible sum of twelve thousand million pound sterling have be spend in peace in preparation for this war a sum which greatly exceed the total of all the european state debt such stupendous sum can not be raise without impose crush taxation and without neglect the other duty of the state such as education scientific research and social reform one serious economic result of this heavy taxation be that european industry be place at a considerable disadvantage in compete with that of other nation notably the united state of america the late mr atkinson a american authority declare that compare with the united state we be handicap to the extent of five per cent in we production since then the figure have change considerably in favor of america i recently have a opportunity of discuss this point with a great german authority on political economy and he fix the advantage in favor of the united state at nearly ten per cent as regard the cost of production but this be not all the european country withdraw permanently four million of man at they best age from productive work thus cause a terrible loss and waste besides enterprise in europe be cripple by fear of war it may break out at any time possibly at a few hour ' notice the present system of europe must inevitably lead sooner or later to a european war -- a catastrophe which nobody can contemplate without horror consider the perfect means of destruction such a war would leave the vanquished utterly crushed and the victor in such a state of exhaustion that any foreign power could easily impose she will upon he the situation be certainly most alarming and ought to receive the fullest attention what then can be do to save europe from these impending danger the large number of peace society which have be establish in different country have do excellent spade work they main object have be to insure that dispute among nation should be refer to arbitration with a view to make more difficult they resorting to arm the great success of these society demonstrate plainly that there be a strong tendency among the people in favor of peace but no attempt have be make to reorganize the whole of europe on a sound basis the emperor of russium have make a most praiseworthy effort to bring about a different state of affair by originate and establish the hague conference with a view to secure by this mean the peace of the world this conference have do excellent service and be likely to be of increase usefulness to mankind in the future but the second meeting of the conference have amply prove that it can not succeed in its main object which be the peace of the world if the idea of bring the whole world into unison can ever be realize it be only by stage of which the union of europe would be the first let we look at the position germany have be for century the battle-field of other state and have narrowly escape national annihilation she have now at length succeed in consolidate she strength so far as to be able to withstand attack from any probable combination of two of she powerful neighbor can germany now be approach with a request to reduce she armament unless she be give the most solid guaranty against attack it would be almost a insult to the german intelligence to make such a proposal without a adequate guaranty with france the case be similar the third republic have be eminently peaceful and frenchman have devote they energy and brilliant quality principally to science the fine art and social development who would dare to ask they to cut down they armament in the present state of europe which make it compulsory for every country to arm to the fullest extent all the other state be in a similar position they need not be discuss individually the only hope to be find be in such a coalition of the power as will make these excessive armament unnecessary if this can be effect the reduction of armament will take place naturally and without any external pressure but then the question arise how can the permanency of such a coalition be guarantee the vital requisite to give stability to any international coalition be community of interest such a community of interest exist already in a larger or smaller degree among many state though it be unknown to most people besides it be not strong enough to prevent war in time of excitement in many country definite war party exist and most extraordinary opinion can be gather from they representative i be assure by some military leader and even by a diplomat in a responsible position that war be a blessing in disproof of this theory it may be desirable to state some plain fact mankind life and exist on this earth solely and entirely by the exploitation of we planet and the general average status of the people can be improve and raise to a higher level only by a more complete exploitation of the force of nature this process require in the present state of civilization capital intelligence and manual labor -- the handmaid of intelligence war be bind to destroy a enormous amount of capital and a great number of the ablest worker it be evident therefore that every war must reduce the general well-being of the people who inhabit this planet besides there be the misery inflict upon million of people principally belong to the poorer class who have always to bear the brunt of a war whether it be start by the personal ambition of one man or by the misguided ambition of a nation some people argue that from the day of alexander the great to those of napoleon combination of state have always be bring about by armed force and they believe this to be a natural law i do not admit that the case of napoleon be a proper illustration of such a law on the contrary he career seem to demonstrate clearly that the world be too far advance to be drive into combination by force and as to alexander the great have the world really make no progress since he time force or war be a relic of a savage age and will be relegate to the background with the advance of civilization persium 's loss of liberty ad 1911 w morgan shuster -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reprint in condensed form from the original narrative in _ hearst 's magazine _ by permission -rrb- as tell in the precede volume persium in the year 1905 begin a struggle for freedom from autocratic rule this she finally achieve in decisive fashion and set up a parliamentary government she career of liberty seem fairly assure she have against she however a irresistible force england and russium have long be encroach upon persian territory russium in especial have snatch away province after province in the north of course persium 's revival would mean that these territorial seizure would be stop hence russium almost openly oppose each step in persium 's progress in 1907 russium and england enter into a agreement by which each without consult persium recognize that the other hold some sort of rights over a part of persian territory : a sphere of russian influence be thus establish in the north and of british in the southeast the climax to this antagonism against persium come in 1911 the desperate persian appeal to the united state government to send they a honest administrator to guide they and president taft recommend mr shuster for the task the work of mr shuster soon win he the enthusiastic confidence and devotion of the persian themselves but in proportion as he reform seem more and more to strengthen the parliamentary government and bring hope to persia he find himself more and more oppose by the russian official finally russia make he mere presence in the land a excuse for send she army to assault the persian seldom have the murderous attack of a strong country upon a weak one be so open brazen and void of all moral justification thousand of persian be slay by the russian troops and many more have since be execute for rebellion against the russian authority the parliamentary government of persium be completely destroy it finally disappear in tumult and dismay on December 24 1911 the country be reduce to helpless submission to the russian army mr shuster 's own account of the tragedy follow he call it the strangling of persium of the many change scene during the eight month of my recent experience in persium two picture stand out in such sharp contrast as to deserve special mention the first be a small party of american of which the writer be one seat with they family in ancient post-chaise rumble along the tiresome road from enzeli the persian port on the caspian sea toward teheran it be in the early day of may 1911 and from these medieval vehicle draw by four ratlike pony in heat and dust we gain we first physical impression of the land where we have come to live for some year -- to mend the broken finances of the descendant of cyrus and darius we be fire with the ambition to succeed in we work and view through such eye the physical discomfort become unimportant hope sing loud in we heart as the carriage crawl on through two hundred and twenty mile of alternate mountain and desert scenery the second picture be eight month later almost to the day on January 11 1912 i stand in a circle of gloomy american and persian friend in front of the atabak palace where we have be live about to step into the automobile that be to bear we back over the same road to enzeli the mountain behind teheran be white with snow the sun shone brightly in a clear blue sky there be life-tonic in the air but none in we heart for we work in persium hardly begin have come to a sudden end between the two date some thing have happen -- thing that may be write down but will probably never be undo -- and the hope of a patient long-exploited people of reclaim they position in the world have be stamp out ruthlessly and unjustly by the army of a so-called christian and civilized nation prior to 1906 the mass of the persian have suffer in comparative silence from the ever-growing tyranny and betrayal of successive despot the last of whom muhammad alus shah a vice-sodden monster of the most perverted type openly avowed himself the tool of russium the people finally sting to a blind desperation and exhort by they priest rise in the summer of 1906 and by purely passive measure -- such as take sanctuary or _ bast _ in large number in sacred place and in the grounds of the british legation at teheran -- succeed in obtain from muzaffarn would din shah the father of muhammad alus a constitution which he grant some six month before he death the pledge give in this document he son and successor swear to fulfil and then violate a dozen or more time until the long-suffering constitutionalist who call themselves nationalist finally compel he despite the intrigue and armed resistance of russian agent and officer to abdicate in favor of he young son sultan ahmad shah the present constitutional monarch this be in July 1909 it be this constitutional government recognize as sovereign by the power that have determine to set its house in order and in practice to replace absolute monarchy with something approach democracy whence the persian a strictly oriental people have derive they strange confidence in the potency of a democratic form of government to mitigate or cure they ill no one can say we might ask the hindu of indium or the young turk or to-day the young chinese the same question the fact be that the past ten year have witness a truly marvelous transformation in the idea of oriental people and the east in its capacity to assimilate western theory of government and in its willingness to fight for they against everything that tradition make sacred have of late year show a phase heretofore almost unknown persium have give a most perfect example of this struggle toward democracy and consider the odds against the nationalist element the result accomplish have be little short of amazing fill with the desire to perform its task the medjli or national parliament have vote in the latter part of 1910 to obtain the service of five american expert to undertake the work of reorganize persium 's finances they apply to the american government and through the good office of we state department they legation at washington be place in communication with man who be consider suitable for the task the intervention of the state department go no further than this and the persian government like the man finally select be tell that the nomination by the american government of suitable financial administrator indicate a mere friendly desire to aid and be of no political significance whatsoever the persian have already try belgian and french functionary and have see they rapidly become mere russian political agent or at best see they lapse into a state of _ dolce far niente _ poor persium have be sell out so many time in the framing of tariff and tax law in loan transaction and concession of various kind that the nationalist government have grow desperate and certainly most distrustful of all foreigner come from nation within the sphere of european diplomacy what they seek be a practical administration of they finances in the interest of the persian people and nation in this way the writer find himself in teheran on the 12th of may last year have agree to serve as treasurer-general of the persian empire and to reorganize and conduct its finances it be difficult to describe the persian political situation exist at that time without go too deeply into history it be true that in a moment of temporary weakness after she defeat by japan russium have sign a solemn convention with england whereby she engage herself as do england to respect the independence and integrity of persium later by the stipulation of 1909 these two power solemnly agree to prevent the ex-shah muhammad alus from any political agitation against the constitutional government but as the world and persium have see a trifle like a treaty or a convention never balk russium when she have take the pulse of she possible adversary and find it weak what be more painful to anglo-saxon be that the british government have be no better nor more scrupulous of its pledge during the first half of July we begin to learn where some of the money be suppose to come from and we be just begin to control the government expenditure after a fashion when on July 18th late at night the telegraph bring the news that muhammad ali the ex-shah have land with a small force at gumesh-teppeh a small port on the caspian very near the russian frontier it be the proverbial bolt from the blue for while rumor of such a possibility have be rife most person believe that russium would not dare to violate so openly she solemn stipulation sign less than two year before persium be take unawares the persian cabinet at teheran be panic-stricken and for ten day there ensue a period of confusion and terror that beggar description there be no persian army except on paper the gendarmerie and police of the city do not number more than eighteen hundred man inadequately arm the russian turcoman on the northeast frontier be report to be flock to the ex-shah 's standard and it be commonly believe that he would be at the gate of teheran in a few week this belief be strengthen by the fact that he brother prince salaru would - dawlum have enter persium from the direction of bagdad and be know to have a large gathering of kurdish tribesman ready to march toward teheran after a time however reason prevail and step be take to create a army to defend the constitutional government against the invader at this time one of the old chief of the bakhtiyarus tribesman the samsamu 's - saltana be the prime minister hold the portfolio of war and he call to arm several thousand of he fight man who promptly start for the capital ephraim khan at that time chief of police of teheran be another defender of the constitution who raise a volunteer force and twice act with the bakhtiyari force he signally defeat the troops of the ex-shah by September 5th muhammad alus himself be in full flight through northeastern persium toward the friendly russian frontier whatever chance he may have formerly have be admit to be go the hound that russium have unleash with he horde of turcoman brigand upon the constitutional government of persium have be whip back into he kennel no one be more surprised than russium unless indeed it be the persian themselves russian official everywhere in persium have openly predict a easy victory for muhammad ali they have aid he in a hundred different way morally financially and by actual armed force they still hope however that the force of prince salaru would - dawlum which be march from hamadan toward teheran would take the capital but on September 28th the news come that ephraim khan and the bakhtiyari have route the prince and he army and the last hope from this source be go in the mean time another encounter with russium have occur there be at teheran a officer of the british-indian army major stoke who for four year have be military attache to the british legation he know persia well read write and speak fluently the language and thoroughly understand the habit custom and viewpoint of the persian people he be the ideal man to assist in the formation of a tax-collecting force under the treasury without which there be no hope of collect the internal tax throughout the empire not only be major stoke the ideal man for this work but he be the _ only _ man possess the necessary qualification i accordingly tender major stoke the post of chief of the future treasury gendarmerie he service as military attache have come to a end after some correspondence with the british legation i be inform late in July that the british foreign office hold that he must resign he commission in the british-indian army before accept the post this major stoke do by cable on July 31st and the matter be regard as settle what be my surprise therefore to learn on the evening of August 8th that the british minister follow instruction from he government have that day present a note to the persian foreign office warn the persian government that any attempt to employ major stoke in the northern sphere of persium -lrb- which include teheran the capital -rrb- would probably be follow by _ retaliatory action _ -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- by russium which england would not be in a position to deprecate between individual such action would clearly be consider bad faith sir edward gray british secretary of state for foreign affair shortly thereafter explain that the appointment of major stoke would be a violation of what he term the spirit of the anglo-russian convention of 1907 yet just two week before when he consent to stoke resign to accept the post he have never dream of such a thing the truth be that the semiofficial st petersburg press like the _ novoe vremya _ have begin to bluster about the affair egg on by the russian foreign office and sir edward gray be compel to _ invent some pretext _ for he manifest dread of displease britain 's good friend russium about anything hence the birth of that wondrous and fearsome child that rubber child which could be stretch to cover any and all thing the spirit of the convention it be a wonderful discovery for the gentleman of the so-called forward party of the russian government since they now behold not only a new means of evade the plain letter of they agreement but gleefully find a woful lack of spirit in they partner to the convention great britain the british foreign office pretend to believe that they have check russium 's march to the gulf they know better then and they know still better now there be but one thing on earth that will check that march and that thing england be apparently not in a geographical or a policial position to furnish in sufficient number the british public now know this and unfortunately the forward party in russium know it and that be why beard face at st petersburg crack open and emit rumble of genuine merriment every time sir edward gray stand up in the house of common and explain to he countryman that he have most ample and categorical assurance from russium that she sole purpose in send two or three army into persium be to show she displeasure with a american finance official for that same reason doubtless she have recently massacre some hundred of persian in tabriz enzelus and resht and have hang number of islamic priest provincial official and constitutionalist whom she classify as the dregs of revolution that be why the russian flag be hoist over the government building at tabriz the capital of the richest province of the empire while a russian military governor dispense justice at the bayonet-point and with the noose but to get back to event after the crush defeat of the ex-shah 's two force and he flight russium be still face by a constitutional regime in persium -- and by a somewhat solidify and more confident government and people at that tool and puppet have dismally fail enter the real thing russium now proceed to intervene directly and to break up the constitutional government in persium without risk of failure or hindrance she do not even intend to await a pretext -- she manufacture such thing as she go along the first instance be the shu'a ` us-saltana affair on October 9th some twelve day after the last defeat inflict on the ex-shah 's force i be order by the cabinet to seize and confiscate the property of prince shu'a ` us-saltana another brother of the ex-shah who have return to persia with he and be actively command some of he troops the same order be give as to the estate of prince salaru would - dawlum the other brother in rebellion pursuant to this entirely proper and legal order the purport of which have be communicate by the persian foreign office to the russian and british minister several day previously no objection have be even hint i send out six small party each consist of a civilian treasury official and five treasury gendarme to seize the different property in and about teheran as a matter of courtesy the british and russian legation have be inform that all rights of foreigner in these property would be fully safeguard and respect the principal property be the park of shu'a ` us-saltana a magnificent place in teheran with a palace fill with valuable furniture when the treasury official and five gendarme arrive there they find on guard a number of persian cossack of the cossack brigade on see the order of confiscation these man retire my man then take possession and begin make a official inventory a hour later two russian vice-consul in full uniform arrive with twelve russian cossack from the russian consulate guard and with imprecation abuse and threat to kill drive off my man at the point of they rifle later in the day these same vice-consul actually arrest other small party of treasury gendarme take they on mule through the street of teheran to the russian consulate-general and after insulting and threaten they with death if they ever return to the confiscate property allow they to go on hearing this i write and telegraph to my friend m poklewski-koziell the russian minister call he attention to the outrageous action of he consul-general m pokhitanow and ask the minister to give order to prevent any further unpleasantness on the follow day when i would again execute the government 's order the next day i send a force of one hundred gendarme in charge of two american treasury official and the order be execute two hour after we be in peaceable possession of the property the same two russian vice-consul drive up to the gate and begin insulting and abuse the persian treasury guard endeavor of course to provoke the gendarme into some act against they in other word find that they have lose in the matter of retain possession of the property these russian official deliberately seek to provoke my gendarme into something that they could construe as a affront to russian consular authority the man however have receive such strict and repeated instruction that they refuse even to answer they pay no attention to the taunt and abuse of these two dignified russian official who thereupon drive off and perjure themselves to the effect that they have be affront -- in other word that the incident which they have go there to provoke actually have occur these false statement be report to st petersburg by m pokhitanow independently of he minister who i have the strongest reason to believe entirely disavow the consul-general 's action the russian government thereupon publicly discredit its minister and demand from the persian government a immediate apology for something that have never occur the apology after some hesitation be make on the advice of the british government it be hope that this evident self-abasement by persium would appease even the russian bureaucracy but it now seem that a compliance with russium 's demand be exactly what be not desire by she since it remove all possible pretext for take more drastic step against persium 's national existence hence at the very moment when the persian foreign minister in full uniform be at the russian legation comply with this first ultimatum base as it be on absolutely false report the st petersburg cabinet be formulate new and even more unjust and absurd demand which as some of the public know have result in the expulsion of the fifteen american finance official and in the destruction of the last vestige of constitutional government in the empire of cyrus and darius russium call for my immediate dismissal from the post of treasurer-general she require that my fourteen american assistant already in persium should be subject to the approval of the british and russian legation at teheran that all other foreign official in future employ by persium be subject to the approval of those two legation that a large indemnity should be pay to russia for the expense of move she troops into persium to hasten the acceptance of these two ultimatum and that all other question between russium and persium should be settle to the satisfaction of the former the acceptance by persium of these demand mean of course a virtual cession of she sovereignty to russium and great britain it should be note also that in this russian ultimatum the name of the british government be freely use although the british minister take no part in the presentation of the same sir edward gray be subsequently ask in the british parliament as to this point and explain in effect that he agree with the russian demand with the possible exception of the indemnity the russian minister inform the persian government that this ultimatum be base on the follow two grounds : first that i have appoint a certain mr lecoffre a british subject to be a tax collector in the russian sphere of influence and second that i have cause to be print and circulate in persium a translation into persian of my letter to the london _ time _ of October 21 1911 thereby greatly injure russian influence in northern persium these grounds might be classify as unimportant if true the truth be however that they be both well know to have be utterly unfounded in fact i do not appoint mr lecoffre a british subject to a financial post in northern persium i find he in the finance department at teheran -lrb- the capital which be in the so-called russian sphere -rrb- when i arrive there last may and he have be occupy a important position there for nearly two year without the slightest objection ever have be raise by the russian government i propose to transfer he to a somewhat less important position but one in which i think he could be of greater service as to the second ground or pretext in effect that i have cause to be print and circulate a persian translation of my letter to the _ time _ it be simply false it be well know to be false -- so well know in fact that a newspaper in teheran the _ tamadun _ -lrb- _ civilization _ -rrb- which do print it and circulate it publicly admit the fact the minute they hear that i be charge by russium with have do so so these two at best rather puerile pretext upon which to base a ultimatum from a powerful nation to a weaker one lack even the merit of truth this second ultimatum despite all hypocritical attempt make to justify it fairly stun the persian people accustom as they have become in recent year to the high-handed and cynical action of the st petersburg cabinet they have not look for such a foul blow as this they have be realize dimly that the peace of europe be be threaten by the open hostility of germany and england over the moroccan incident and that british foreign policy be apparently leave russium absolutely free to work she will in asia so long at least as russium pretend to acknowledge the anglo-russian _ entente _ of 1907 but the persian people have too much far too much confidence in the sacredness of treaty stipulation and the solemnly pledge word of the great christian nation of the world to imagine that they own whole national existence and liberty could be jeopardize overnight and on a pretext so shallow and farcical as to excite world-wide ridicule they disillusionment come too late the trap have be unwittingly set by hand that make unexpected move on the european chessboard and the bear 's paw have this time be skilful enough to spring it at the proper moment the persian statesman and chieftain who form the cabinet at this time whether because they perceive the gleaming naked steel behind russium 's threat more clearly than they legislative compatriot of the parliament or medjli or whether they suffer from that abandon and tired feeling which come from play a unequal and always lose game quickly decide that they would accept this second ultimatum with all its future oppression and cruelty for they people on December 1st therefore shortly before the time limit of forty-eight hour fix by russium for the acceptance of the term have expire the cabinet file into the chamber of deputy to secure legislative approval of they intended course it be a hour before noon and the parliament grounds and building be fill with eager excited throng while the gallery of the medjli chamber be pack with persian notable of all rank and with the representative of many of the foreign legation at noon the fate of persium as a nation be to be know the cabinet have make up its mind to yield overlook no point that would increase they chance of secure the approval of the medjli believe evidently that the ridiculously short time to elapse before the stroke of noon announce the expiration of the forty-eight-hour period would effectually prevent any mature consideration or discussion of they proposal the premier samsamu 's - saltana cause to be present to the deputy a resolution authorize the cabinet to accept russium 's demand the proposal be read amid a deep silence at its conclusion a hush fell upon the gathering seventy-six deputy old man and young priest lawyer doctor merchant and prince sit tense in they seat a venerable priest of islam arise time be slip away and at noon the question would be beyond they vote to decide this servant of god speak briefly and to the point : it may be the will of allah that we liberty and we sovereignty shall be take from we by force but let we not sign they away with we own hand one gesture of appeal with he tremble hand and he resume he seat simple word these yet winged one easy to utter in academic discussion hard bitterly hard to say under the eye of a cruel and overpowering tyrant whose emissary watch the speaker from the gallery and mentally marked he down for future imprisonment torture exile or worse other deputy follow in dignified appeal brief because the time be short they uphold they country 's honor and proclaim they hard-earned right to live and govern themselves a few minute before noon the public vote be take one or two faint-hearted member seek a craven 's refuge and slunk quietly from the chamber as each name be call the deputy rise in he place and give he vote there be no secret ballot here and when the roll-call be end every man priest or layman youth or octogenarian have cast he own die of fate have stake the safety of himself and family and hurl back into the tooth of the great bear from the north the unanimous answer of a desperate and downtrodden people who prefer a future of unknown terror to the voluntary sacrifice of they national dignity and of they recently earn right to work out they own salvation amid tear and applause from the spectator the crestfallen and frightened cabinet withdraw while the deputy disperse to ponder on the course which lay darkly before they people by this vote the cabinet accord to the persian constitution cease to exist as a legal entity great crowd of people throng the lalezar one of the principal street of teheran shout death to the traitor and call allah to witness that they would give up they life for they country a few day later in a secret conference between the deputy of the medjli and the member of the depose cabinet a similar vote be give to reject the russian demand meanwhile thousand of russian troops with cossack and artillery be pour into northern persium from tifli and julfa by land and from baku across the caspian to the persian port of enzeli whence they take up they 220-mile march over the elburz mountain toward kasvin and teheran in the government at teheran conference follow conference intrigue against the deputy give way to threat through it all with the increase certainty of personal injury the member of the medjli stand firmly by they vote it be impossible to describe within the limit of this article the day and night of doubt suspense and anxiety that follow one another in the capital during this dark month of December there be a lurk dread in the very air and the snow-covered mountain themselves seem afflict with the mournful scene through which the country be pass a boycott be proclaim by the priest against russian and english goods in a day the old-fashioned tramway of the city be desert on the mere suspicion that it be own in russium while a excited belgian minister rain protest and petition on the persian foreign office in a endeavor to show that the tramway be own by he countryman crowd of youth student and woman fill the street drag absent-minded passenger from the car smash the window of shop that still display russian goods see that no one drink tea because it come from russium although produce in indium and go in procession before the gate of the foreign legation to demand justice of the representative of the world power for a people in the extremity of despair one day the rumor would come that the chief mulla or priest at nadjef have proclaim the holy war -lrb- _ jihad _ -rrb- against the russian on another that the russian troops have commence to shoot up kasvin on they march to teheran at one time when rumor be thick that the medjli would give in under the threat and attempt bribery which well-known russian protege be employ on many of its member three hundred veil and black-gowned persian woman a large proportion with pistol conceal under they skirt or in the fold of they sleeve march suddenly to the parliament grounds and demand admission to the chamber the president of the medjli consent to receive a deputation from they once admit into he presence these honor-loving persian mother wife and daughter exhibit they weapon and to show the grim seriousness of they word they tear aside they veil and threaten that they would kill they own husband and son and end they own life if the deputy fail in they duty to uphold the dignity and the sovereignty of they beloved country when neither threat nor bribe avail against the medjli russium decree its destruction by force in the early afternoon of December 24th the depose cabinet have be themselves duly _ persuade _ to take the step execute a _ coup d'état _ against the medjli and by a demonstration of gendarme and bakhtiyarus tribesman succeed in expel all the deputy and employee who be within the parliament grounds after which the gate be lock and bar and a strong detachment of the so-called royal regiment leave in charge the deputy be threaten with death if they attempt to return there or to meet in any other spot and the city of teheran immediately pass under military control the self-constituted _ directoire _ of seven who accomplish this dubious feat first ascertain that the considerable force of bakhtiyarus tribesman some 2000 who have remain in the capital after the defeat of the ex-shah 's force in September last have be duly fix by the same russian agency who have so early succeed in persuade the member of the ex-cabinet that they true interest lay in siding with russium it be impossible to say just what proportion of fear and cupidity decide the member of the depose cabinet to take the alien ' side against they country but both emotion undoubtedly play a part the premier be one of the lead chief or khan of the bakhtiyari and another chief be the self-styled minister of war these chieftain have always be a strange and change mixture of mountain patriot and city intriguer -- of loyal soldier and mercenary looter the mercenary instinct possibly aid by a sense of they own comparative helplessness against russian cossack and artillery lead they to accept the stranger 's gold and fair promise and they end they checkered but theretofore relatively honorable career by sell they country for a small pile of cash and the more alluring promise that the grand viziership -lrb- _ ie _ post of minister of finance -rrb- should be perpetual in they family or clan that same afternoon a large number of the abolish deputy come to my office they be man whom i have grow to know well man of european education in whose courage integrity and patriotism i have the fullest confidence to they the unlawful action of they own countryman be more than a political catastrophe it be a sacrilege a profanation a heinous crime they come in tear with broken voice with murder in they heart tear by the doubt as to whether they should kill the member of the _ directoire _ and drive out the traitorous tribesman who have make possible the destruction of the government or adopt the truly oriental idea of kill themselves they ask my advice and hesitate somewhat as to whether i should interfere to save the life of notorious betrayer of they country i finally persuade they to do neither the one nor the other there seem to be no particular good in assassinate even they treacherous countryman as it would only have give color to the pretension of russium and england that the persian be not capable of maintain order a exhibition of self-restraint when the last representative element of the constitutional government for which so many thousand have fight suffer and die be wipe out in a hour without a drop of blood be shed the persian people give to the world a exhibition of temperance of moderation of stern self-restraint the like of which no other civilized country could show under similar try circumstance the acceptance of russium 's term by the cabinet remove the last pretext for keep in northern persium the _ 15000 _ troops which by that time russium have assemble there -- at kasvin resht enzeli tabriz khoy and other point in the so-called russian sphere mon poklewski-koziell the russian minister have in fact give a equivocal sort of a promise to the effect that if no fresh incident arise the russian troops would be withdraw when persium accept the condition of the ultimatum with this in mind it be interesting to note the truly thorough precaution which be take by russium to prevent any such unfortunate necessity as the withdrawal of she troops from come to pass December 24th late in the evening a message be receive from the persian act governor at tabriz in which he declare that the russian troops which have be station in that city since they entry during the siege in 1909 _ have suddenly start to massacre the inhabitant _ shortly after this the indo-european telegraph line stop work and all news from tabriz cease it be subsequently state that the wire have be cut by bullet _ additional russian troops _ be immediately start for tabriz from julfa which be some eight mile to the north of the russian frontier the exact way in which the fighting begin be not yet clear the persian government report show that a number of russian soldier claim to be string a telephone wire climb upon the roof of the persian police headquarters about _ ten o'clock at night _ on December 20th when challenge by native guard they reply with shot reenforcement be call up by both side and serious street fight break out early the follow morning and continue for several day the act governor state in he official report that the russian troops indulge in they usual atrocity kill woman and child and hundred of other noncombatant on the street and in they home there be at the time about 4000 russian soldier with two battery of artillery in and around the city nearly i000 of the _ fidai _ -lrb- self-devoted -rrb- of tabriz take refuge in a old citadel of stone and mud call the ark they be without artillery or adequate provision and be poorly arm but it be certain death for one of they to be see on the street the russian bombard the ark for a day or more kill a large proportion of its defender the superior number and the artillery of the russian finally conquer and there follow a reign of terror during which no persian 's life or honor be safe at one time during this period the russian minister at teheran at the request of the member of the persian cabinet who be horror-stricken and in fear of they life for have make term with such a barbaric nation telegraph to the russian general in command of the troops at tabriz tell he to cease fighting and that the _ fidai _ would receive order to do likewise as matter be be arrange at the capital the gallant general reply that he take he order from the viceroy of the caucasus at tifli and not from any one at teheran the massacre go on on new year 's day which be the 10th of _ muharram _ a day of great mourning which be hold sacred in the persian religious calendar the russian military governor who have hoist russian flag over the government building at tabriz hang the sikutu ` l-islam who be the chief priest of tabriz two other priest and five other among they several high official of the provincial government as one british journalist put it the effect of this outrage on the persian be that which would be produce on the english people by the hanging of the archbishop of canterbury on good Friday from this time on the russian at tabriz continue to hang or shoot any persian whom they choose to consider guilty of the crime of be a constitutionalist when the fighting there be first report a high official of the foreign office at st petersburg in a interview to the press make the statement that russium would take vengeance into she own hand until the revolutionary dregs have be exterminate one more significant fact : at the same time that the fighting break out at tabriz the russian troops at resht and enzeli hundred of mile away shoot down the persian police and many inhabitant without warn or provocation of any kind and the date also happen to be just after the persian cabinet have definitely inform the russian legation that all the demand of russium 's ultimatum be accept -- a condition which the british government have publicly assure the persian would be follow by the withdrawal of the russian invade force and which the russian government have officially confirm _ unless fresh incident should arise _ in the mean time to make the retention of the troops advisable i would suggest that the power -- england and russium -- may _ think _ that they thus escape all responsibility for what go on in persium but the world have long since grow familiar with such method mere cant however seriously put forth in official statement no longer blind educate public opinion as to the fact in these act of international brigandage the truth be that england and russium be still play a hand in the game of medieval diplomacy the puerility of talking of persium have affront russian consular officer or of persium 's treasurer-general have appoint a british subject to be a tax collector at tabriz as the reason for russium 's aggressive and brutal policy in persium be only too apparent volume would not contain the bare record of the act of aggression deceit and cruelty which russian agent have commit against persian sovereignty and the constitutional government since the deposition of muhammad alus in 1909 discovery of the south pole ad 1911 roald amundsen on December 16 1911 a norwegian explore party head by captain roald amundsen reach the south pole the discovery thus follow with surprising closeness after peary 's triumph in reach the north pole in 1909 antarctic exploration have never attract so much attention as that of the far north partly because a almost impossible ice barrier a hundred foot high be know to extend across the southern ocean at about the parallel of the antarctic circle in 1908 however a english expedition under lieutenant shackleton manage to penetrate beyond this barrier in the region south of new zealand and reach to within less than two hundred mile of the pole they establish the fact that in contrast to the deep water which flow above the northern pole the southern pole be raise upon a antarctic mountain continent many thousand foot in height shackleton 's success lead to several other expedition and in 1910 three separate party make almost simultaneous effort to reach the pole one from japan and one from england as well as the norwegian one we give here captain amundsen 's own account of he expedition as first explain by he before the berlin geographical society and publish by the new york geographical society in they bulletin the glowing success of amundsen 's expedition throw into sharpest relief the tragedy of the parallel english expedition captain scott the leader of this party also reach the pole after a far more desperate struggle but he reach it on January 18 1912 only to find that he norwegian rival have precede he and he and he entire party die of starvation and exhaustion on they return journey toward they camp the first aim of my expedition be the attainment of the south pole i have the honor to report the accomplishment of the plan i can only mention briefly here the expedition which have work in the region which we have select for we starting-point as we wish to reach the south pole we first problem be to go south as far as possible with we ship and there establish we station even so the sled journey would be long enough i know that the english expedition would again choose they old winter quarter in mcmurdo sound south victoria land as they starting-point from newspaper report it be know that the japanese have select king edward vii land in order to avoid these two expedition we have to establish we station on the great ice barrier as far as possible from the starting-point of the two other expedition the great ice barrier also call the ross barrier lie between south victoria land and king edward vii land and have a extent of about 515 mile the first to reach this mighty ice formation be sir jame clark ross in 1841 he do not dare approach the great ice wall 100 foot high with he two sailing ship the _ erebus _ and the _ terror _ whose progress southward be impede by this mighty obstacle he examine the ice wall from a distance however as far as possible he observation show that the barrier be not a continuous abrupt ice wall but be interrupt by bay and small channel on ross 's map a bay of considerable magnitude may be see the next expedition be that of the _ southern cross _ in 1900 it be interesting to note that this party find the bay mention above at the same place where ross have see it in 1841 nearly sixty year before that this expedition also be able to land a few mile to the east of the large bay in a small bay name balloon bight and from there to ascend the ice barrier which heretofore have be consider a insurmountable obstacle to further advance toward the south in 1901 the _ discovery _ steam along the barrier and confirm in every respect what the _ southern cross _ have observe land be also discover in the direction indicate by ross namely king edward vii land scott too land in balloon bight and like he predecessor see the large bay to the west in 1908 shackleton arrive there on the _ nimrod _ he too follow along the edge of the ice barrier he come to the conclusion that disturbance have take place in the ice barrier the shore line of balloon bight he think have change and merge with the large bay to the west this large bay which he think to be of recent origin he name bay of whale he give up he original plan of landing there as the ice barrier appear to he too dangerous for the establishment of winter quarter it be not difficult to determine that the bay show on ross 's map and the so-called bay of whale be identical it be only necessary to compare the two map except for a few piece that have break off from the barrier the bay have remain the same for the last seventy year it be therefore possible to assume that the bay do not owe its origin to chance and that it must be underlay by land either in the form of sand bank or otherwise this bay we decide upon as we base of operation it lie 400 mile from the english station in mcmurdo sound and 115 mile from king edward vii land we could therefore assume that we should be far enough from the english sphere of interest and need not fear cross the route of the english expedition the report concern the japanese station on king edward vii land be indefinite : we take it for grant however that a distance of 115 mile would suffice on August 9 1910 we leave norway on the _ fram _ the ship that have originally be build for nansen we have ninety-seven superb eskimo dog and provision for two year the first harbor we reach be madeira there the last preparation be make for we voyage on the ross barrier -- truly not a insignificant distance which we have to cover namely 16000 nautical mile from norway to the bay of whale we have estimate that this trip would require five month the _ fram _ which have justly be call the stanchest polar ship in the world on this voyage across practically all of the ocean prove herself to be extremely seaworthy thus we traverse without a single mishap the region of the northeast and of the southeast trade the stormy sea of the roar forty the fog of the fifty the ice-filled sixty and reach we field of work at the ice barrier on January 14 1911 everything have go splendidly the ice in the bay of whale have just break up and we be able to advance considerably farther south than any of we predecessor have do we find a quiet little nook behind a project ice cape from here we could transfer we equipment to the barrier with comparative safety another great advantage be that the barrier at this place descend very gradually to the sea ice so that we have the best possible surface for we sled we first undertaking be to ascend the barrier in order to get a general survey and to determine a suitable place for the erection of the house which we have bring with we the supposition that this part of the barrier rest on land seem to be confirm immediately by we surroundings instead of the smooth flat surface which the outer wall of the barrier present we here find the surface to be very uneven we everywhere see sharp hill and point between which there be pressure-crack and depression fill with large mass of drift these feature be not of recent date on the contrary it be easy to see that they be very old and that they must have have they origin at a time which long precede the period of ross 's visit originally we have plan to establish we station several mile from the edge of the barrier in order not to subject ourselves to the danger of a unwelcome and involuntary sea trip which might have occur have the part of the barrier on which we erect we house break off this precaution however be not necessary as the feature which we observe on we first examination of the area offer a sufficient guaranty for the stability of the barrier at this point in a small valley hardly two and a half mile from the ship 's anchorage we therefore select a place for we winter quarter it be protect from the wind on all side on the next day we begin unload the ship we have bring with we material for house-building as well as equipment and provision for nine man for several year we divide into two group the ship 's group and the land group the first be compose of the commander of the ship captain nilsen and the nine man who be to stay on board to take the _ fram _ out of the ice and to bueno aire the other group consist of the man who be to occupy the winter quarter and march on to the south the ship 's group have to unload everything from the ship upon the ice there the land group take charge of the cargo and bring it to the building site at first we be rather unaccustomed to work as we have have little exercise on the long sea voyage but before long we be all break in and then the transfer to the site of we home framheim go on rapidly the house grow daily when all the material have be land we skilled carpenter olav bjaaland and jorgen stubberud begin build the house it be a ready-made house which we have bring with we nothing have to be do but to put together the various number part in order that the house might brave all storm its bottom rest in a excavation four foot beneath the surface on January 28th fourteen day after we arrival the house be complete and all provision have be land a gigantic task have be perform everything seem to point toward a propitious future but no time be to be lose we have to make use of every minute the land group have in the mean time be divide into two party one of which see to it that the provision and equipment still lack be take out of the ship the other party be to prepare for a excursion toward the south which have in view the exploration of the immediate environs and the establishment of a depot on February 10th the latter group march south there be four of we with eighteen dog and three sled pack with provision that morning of we start be still vividly in my memory the weather be calm the sky hardly overcast before we lay the large unlimited snow plain behind we the bay of whale with its project ice cape and at its entrance we dear ship the _ fram _ on board the flag be hoist it be the last greet from we comrade of the ship no one know whether and when we should see each other again in all probability we comrade would no longer be there when we return a year would probably elapse before we could meet again one more glance backward one more parting greet and then -- forward we first advance on the barrier be full of excitement and suspense so many question present themselves : what will be the nature of the region we have to cross how will the sled behave will we equipment meet the requirement of the situation have we the proper haul power if we be to accomplish we object everything have to be of the best we equipment be substantially different from that of we english competitor we place we whole trust on eskimo dog and ski while the english as a result of they own experience have abandon dog as well as ski but on the other hand be well equip with motor-sled and pony we advance rapidly on the smooth white snow plain on February 14th we reach 80 ° s we have thus cover ninety-nine mile we establish a depot here mainly of 1300 pound of provision which we intend to use on we main advance to the south in the spring the return journey occupy two day on the first we cover forty mile and on the second fifty-seven mile when we reach we station the _ fram _ have already leave the bay be lonely and desert only seal and penguin be in possession of the place the first excursion to the south although brief be of great importance to we we now know definitely that we equipment and we pull power be eminently suit to the demand upon they in they selection no mistake have be make it be now for we to make use of everything to the best advantage we sojourn at the station be only a short one on February 22d we be ready again to carry supplies to a more southern depot we intend to push this depot as far south as possible on this occasion we expedition consist of eight man seven sled and forty-two dog only the cook remain at framheim on February 27th we pass the depot which we have establish at 80 ° s we find everything in the best of order on march 4th we reach the eighty-first parallel and deposit there 1150 pound of provision three man return from here to the station while the five other continue toward the south and reach the eighty-second parallel on march 8th deposit there 1375 pound of provision we then return and on march 22d be again at home before the winter begin we make another excursion to the depot in 80 ° s and add to we supplies there 2400 pound of fresh salt meat and 440 pound of other provision on April 11th we return from this excursion this end all of we work connect with the establishment of depot up to that date we have carry out 6700 pound of provision and have distribute these in three repository the part of the barrier over which we have go heretofore have a average height of 165 foot and look like a flat plain which continue with slight undulation without any marked feature that could have serve for orientation it have heretofore be the opinion that on such a endless plain no provision can be cache without risk they loss if we be however to have the slightest chance of reach we goal we have to establish depot and that to as great a extent as possible this question be discuss among we and we decide to establish sign across we route and not along it as have be generally do heretofore we therefore set up a row of sign at right angle to we route that be in a east-west direction from we depot two of these sign be place on opposite side of each of the three depot at a distance of 56 mile -lrb- 9 kilometer -rrb- from they and between the sign and the depot two flag be erect for every kilometer in addition all flag be mark so that we might know the direction and distance of the depot to which it refer this provision prove entirely trustworthy we be able to find we depot even in dense fog we compass and pedometer be test at the station we know that we could rely upon they by we excursion to the depot we have gain a great deal we have not only carry a large amount of provision toward the south but we have also gain valuable experience that be worth more and be to be of value to we on we final advance to the pole the lowest temperature we have observe on these depot excursion be -50 ° centigrade the fact that it be still summer when we record this temperature warn we to see that we equipment be in good condition we also realize that we heavy sled be too unwieldy and that they could easily be make much lighter this criticism be equally applicable to the greater part of we equipment several day before the disappearance of the sun be devote to hunting seal the total weight of the seal kill amount to 132000 pound we therefore have ample provision for ourselves as well as for we 115 dog we next problem be to supply a protective roof for we dog we have bring with we ten large tent in which sixteen man could easily find room they be set up on the ice barrier the snow be then dig out to a depth of six and a half foot inside the tent so that each dog hut be nearly twenty foot high the diameter of a dog hut on the ground be sixteen foot we make these hut spacious so that they might be as airy as possible and thus avert the frost which be so injurious to dog we purpose be entirely attain for even in the severest weather no dog be freeze the tent be always warm and comfortable twelve dog be house in each and every man have to take care of he own pack after we have see to the want of the dog we could then think of ourselves as early as April the house be entirely cover by snow in this newly drift snow passageway be dig connect directly with the dog hut ample room be thus at we disposal without the need on we part of furnish building material we have workshop a blacksmith shop a room for sew one for pack a storage room for coal wood and oil a room for regular bath and one for steam bath the winter might be as cold and stormy as it would it could do we no harm on April 21st the sun disappear and the longest night begin which have ever be experience by man in the antarctic we do not need to fear the long night for we be well equip with provision for year and have a comfortable well-ventilated well-situated and protected house in addition we have we splendid bathroom where we could take a bath every week it really be a veritable sanatorium after these arrangement have be complete we begin preparation for the main advance in the follow spring we have to improve we equipment and make it lighter we discard all we sled for they be too heavy and unwieldy for the smooth surface of the ice barrier we sled weigh 165 pound each bjaaland we ski and sledmaker take the sled in hand and when spring arrive he have entirely make over we sledge equipment these sled weigh only one-third as much as the old one in the same way it be possible to reduce the weight of all other item of we equipment pack the provision for the sledge journey be of the greatest importance captain johansen attend to this work during the winter each of the 42000 loaf of hard bread have to be handle separately before it could be assign to its proper place in this way the winter pass quickly and agreeably all of we be occupy all the time we house be warm dry light and airy and we all enjoy the best of health we have no physician and need none meteorological observation be take continuously the result be surprising we have think that we should have disagreeable stormy weather but this be not the case during the whole year of we sojourn at the station we experience only two moderate storm the rest of the time light breeze prevail mainly from a easterly direction atmospheric pressure be as a rule very low but remain constant the temperature sink considerably and i deem it probable that the mean annual temperature which we record -26 ° centigrade be the lowest mean temperature which have ever be observe during five month of the year we record temperature below -50 ° centigrade on August 23d the lowest temperature be record -59 ° the _ aurora australi _ correspond to the northern light of the arctic be observe frequently and in all direction and form this phenomenon change very rapidly but except in certain case be not very intensive on August 24th the sun reappear the winter have end several day earlier we have put everything in the best of order and when the sun rise over the barrier we be ready to start the dog be in fine condition from now on we observe the temperature daily with great interest for as long as the mercury remain below -50 ° a start be not to be think of in the first day of September all sign indicate that the mercury would rise we therefore resolve to start as soon as possible on September 8th the temperature be -30 ° we start immediately but this march be to be short on the next day the temperature begin to sink rapidly and several day later the thermometer register -55 ° centigrade we human being could probably have keep on the march for some time under such a temperature for we be protect against the cold by we clothing but the dog could not have long withstand this degree of cold we be therefore glad when we reach the eightieth parallel we deposit there we provision and equipment in the depot which we have previously erect and return to framheim the weather now become very changeable for a time -- the transitional period from winter to summer we never know what weather the next day would bring frostbite from we last march force we to wait until we definitely know that spring have really come on September 24th we see at last positive evidence that spring have arrive : the seal begin to clamber up on the ice this sign be hail with rejoice -- not a whit less the seal meat which bjaaland bring on the same day the dog too enjoy the arrival of spring they be ravenous for fresh seal meat on September 29th another unrefutable sign of spring appear in the arrival of a flock of antarctic petrel they fly around we house inquisitively to the joy of all not only of ourselves but also of the dog the latter be wild with joy and excitement and run after the bird in hope of get a delicate morsel foolish dog they chase end with a wild fight among themselves on October 20th the weather have at last become so stable that we could start we have meanwhile change we original plan which be that we should all advance southward together we realize that we could travel with perfect safety in two group and thus accomplish much more we arrange that three man should go to the east to explore king edward vii land the remain five man be to carry out the main plan the advance on the south pole October 20th be a beautiful day clear mild weather prevail the temperature be 1 ° centigrade above zero we sled be light and we could advance rapidly we do not need to hurry we dog for they be eager enough themselves we number five man and fifty-two dog with four sled together with the provision which we have leave in the three depot at the eightieth the eighty-first and the eighty-second parallel we have sufficient sustenance for 120 day two day after we departure we nearly meet with a serious accident bjaaland 's sled fall into one of the numerous crevasse at the critical moment we be fortunately able to come to bjaaland 's aid have we be a moment later the sled with its thirteen dog would have disappear in the seemingly bottomless pit on the fourth day we reach we depot at 80 ° s we remain there two day and give we dog as much seal meat as they would eat between the eightieth and the eighty-first parallel the barrier ice along we route be even with the exception of a few low undulation dangerous hide place be not to be find the region between the eighty-first and the eighty-second parallel be of a totally different character during the first nineteen mile we be in a veritable labyrinth of crevasse very dangerous to cross at many place yawn abyss be visible because large piece of the surface have break off the surface therefore present a very unsafe appearance we cross this region four time in all on the first three time such a dense fog prevail that we could only recognize object a few foot away only on the fourth occasion do we have clear weather then we be able to see the great difficulty to which we have be expose on November 5th we reach the depot at the eighty-second parallel and find everything in order for the last time we dog be able to have a good rest and eat they fill and they do so thoroughly during they two day ' rest beginning at the eightieth parallel we construct snow cairn which should serve as sign-post on we return in all we erect 150 such sign-post each of which require sixty snow block about 9000 snow block have therefore to be cut out for this purpose these cairn do not disappoint we for they enable we to return by exactly the same route we have previously follow south of the eighty-second parallel the barrier be if possible still more even than farther north we therefore advance quite rapidly at every unit parallel which we cross on we advance toward the south we establish a depot we thereby doubtlessly expose ourselves to a certain risk for there be no time to set up sign-post around the depot we therefore have to rely on snow cairn on the other hand we sled become lighter so that it be never hard for the dog to pull they when we reach the eighty-third parallel we see land in a southwesterly direction this could only be south victoria land probably a continuation of the mountain range which run in a southeasterly direction and which be show on shackleton 's map from now on the landscape change more and more from day to day : one mountain after another loom up one always higher than the other they average elevation be 10000 to 16000 foot they crest-line be always sharp the peak be like needle i have never see a more beautiful wild and impose landscape here a peak would appear with somber and cold outline its head bury in the cloud there one could see snow field and glacier throw together in hopeless confusion on November 11th we see land to the south and could soon determine that a mountain range whose position be about 86 ° s and 163 ° w cross south victoria land in a easterly and northeasterly direction this mountain range be materially lower than the mighty mountain of the rest of south victoria land peak of a elevation of 1800 to 4000 foot be the highest we could see this mountain chain as far as the eighty-fourth parallel where it disappear below the horizon on November 17th we reach the place where the ice barrier end and the land begin we have proceed directly south from we winter quarter to this point we be now in 85 ° 7 ' s and 165 ° w the place where we leave the barrier for the land offer no special difficulty a few extended undulate reach of ice have to be cross which be interrupt by crevasse here and there nothing could impede we advance it be we plan to go due south from framheim and not to deviate from this direction unless we should be force to by obstacle which nature might place in we path if we plan succeed it would be we privilege to explore completely unknown region and thereby to accomplish valuable geographic work the immediate ascent due south into the mountainous region lead we between the high peak of south victoria land to all intent and purpose no great difficulty await we here to be sure we should probably have find a less steep ascent if we have go over to the newly discover mountain range just mention but as we maintain the principle that direct advance due south be the shortest way to we goal we have to bear the consequence at this place we establish we principal depot and leave provision for thirty day on we four sled we take provision with we for sixty day and now we begin the ascent to the plateau the first part of the way lead we over snow-covered mountain slope which at time be quite steep but not so much so as to prevent any of we from haul up he own sled farther up we find several glacier which be not very broad but be very steep indeed they be so steep that we have to harness twenty dog in front of each sled later the glacier become more frequent and they lay on slope so steep that it be very hard to ascend they on we ski on the first night we camp at a spot which lay 2100 foot above sea level on the second day we continue to climb up the mountain mainly over several small glacier we next camp for the night be at a altitude of 4100 foot above the sea on the third day we make the disagreeable discovery that we should have to descend 2100 foot as between we and the higher mountain to the south lay a great glacier which cross we path from east to west this could not be help the expedition therefore descend with the greatest possible speed and in a incredibly short time we be down on the glacier which be name axel heiberg glacier we camp of this night lay at about 3100 foot above sea level on the follow day the longest ascent begin we be force to follow axel heiberg glacier at several place ice block be heap up so that its surface be hummocky and cleft by crevasse we have therefore to make detour to avoid the wide crevasse which below expand into large basin these latter to be sure be fill with snow the glacier have evidently long ago cease to move the greatest care be necessary in we advance for we have no inkling as to how thick or how thin the cover of snow might be we camp for this night be pitch in a extremely picturesque situation at a elevation of about 5250 foot above sea level the glacier be here hem in by two mountain which be name fridtjof nansen and don pedro christophersen both 16000 foot high farther down toward the west at the end of the glacier ole engelstad mountain rise to a elevation of about 13000 foot at this relatively narrow place the glacier be very hummocky and rent by many deep crevasse so that we often fear that we could not advance farther on the follow day we reach a slightly inclined plateau which we assume to be the same which shackleton describe we dog accomplish a feat on this day which be so remarkable that it should be mention here after have already do heavy work on the precede day they cover nineteen mile on this day and overcome a difference in altitude of 5700 foot on the follow night we camp at a place which lay 10800 foot above sea level the time have now come when we be force to kill some of we dog twenty-four of we faithful comrade have to die the place where this happen be name the slaughter house on account of bad weather we have to stay here for four day during this stay both we and the dog have nothing except dog meat to eat when we could at last start again on November 26th the meat of ten dog only remain this we deposit at we camp fresh meat would furnish a welcome change on we return during the following day we have stormy weather and thick snow flurry so that we could see nothing of the surrounding country we observe however that we be descend rapidly for a moment when the weather improve for a short time we see high mountain directly to the east during the heavy snow squall on November 28th we pass two peculiarly shaped mountain lie in a north-south direction they be the only one that we could see on we right hand these helland-hansen mountain be entirely cover by snow and have a altitude of 9200 foot later they serve as a excellent landmark for we on the next day the cloud part and the sun burst forth it seem to we as if we have be transfer to a totally new country in the direction of we advance rise a large glacier and to the east of it lay a mountain range run from southeast to northwest toward the west impenetrable fog lay over the glacier and obscure even we immediate surroundings a measurement by hypsometer give 8200 foot for the point lie at the foot of this the devil 's glacier we have therefore descend 2600 foot since leave the slaughter house this be not a agreeable discovery as we no doubt would have to ascend as much again if not more we leave provision here for six day and continue we march from the camp of that night we have a superb view of the eastern mountain range belong to it we see a mountain of more wonderful form than i have ever see before the altitude of the mountain be 12300 foot its peak roundabout be cover by a glacier it look as if nature in a fit of anger have drop sharp cornered ice block on the mountain this mountain be christen helmer-hansen mountain and become we best point of reference there we see also the oscar wist mountain the olav bjaaland mountain the sverre hassel mountain which dark and red glitter in the ray of the midnight sun and reflect a white and blue light in the distance the mountain see before loom up romantically they look very high when one see they through the thick cloud and mass of fog which pass over they from time to time and occasionally allow we to catch glimpse of they mighty peak and they broken glacier for the first time we see the thorvald nilsen mountain which have a height of 16400 foot it take we three day to climb the devil 's glacier on the first of December we have leave behind we this glacier with its crevasse and bottomless pit and be now at a elevation of 9350 foot above sea level in front of we lay a inclined block-covered ice plateau which in the fog and snow have the appearance of a frozen lake travel over this devil 's ball room as we call the plateau be not particularly pleasant southeasterly storm and snow flurry occur daily during which we could see absolutely nothing the floor on which we be walk be hollow beneath we it sound as if we be go over empty barrel we cross this disagreeable and uncanny region as quickly as be compatible with the great care we have to exercise for during the whole time we be think of the unwelcome possibility of sink through on December 6th we reach we highest point -- accord to hypsometric measurement 11024 foot above sea level from there on the interior plateau remain entirely level and of the same elevation in 88 ° 23 ' s we have reach the place which correspond to shackleton 's southernmost advance we camp in 88 ° 25 ' s and establish there we last -- the tenth -- depot in which we leave 220 pound of provision we way now gradually lead downward the surface be in excellent condition entirely level without a single hill or undulation or other obstacle we sled forge ahead to perfection the weather be beautiful we daily cover seventeen mile nothing prevent we from increase we daily distance but we have time enough and ample provision we think it wiser also to spare we dog and not to work they harder than necessary without a mishap we reach the eighty-ninth parallel on December 11th it seem as if we have come into a region where good weather constantly prevail the surest sign of continued calm weather be the absolutely level surface we could push a tent-pole seven foot deep into the snow without meeting with any resistance this prove clearly enough that the snow have fall in equable weather calm must have prevail or a slight breeze may have blow at the most have the weather be variable -- calm alternate with storm -- snow stratum of different density would have form a condition which we would immediately have notice when drive in we tent-pole we dead reckoning have heretofore always give the same result as we astronomical observation during the last eight day of we march we have continuous sunshine every day we stop at noon in order to measure the meridian altitude and every evening we make a observation for azimuth on December 13th the meridian altitude give 89 ° 37 ' dead reckoning 89 ° 38 ' in latitude 88 ° 25 ' we have be able to make we last good observation of azimuth subsequently this method of observation become valueless as these last observation give practically the same result and the difference be almost a constant one we use the observation make in 88 ° 25 ' as a basis we calculate that we should reach we goal on December 14th December 14th dawn it seem to I as if we sleep a shorter time as if we eat breakfast in greater haste and as if we start earlier on this morning than on the precede day as heretofore we have clear weather beautiful sunshine and only a very light breeze we advance well not much be say i think that each one of we be occupy with he own thought probably only one thought dominate we all a thought which cause we to look eagerly toward the south and to scan the horizon of this unlimited plateau be we the first or -- the distance calculate be cover we goal have be reach quietly in absolute silence the mighty plateau lay stretch out before we no man have ever yet see it no man have ever yet stand on it in no direction be a sign to be see it be indeed a solemn moment when each of we grasp the flagpole with one hand we all hoist the flag of we country on the geographical south pole on king haakon vii plateau during the night as we watch show it to be three of we man go around the camp in a circle 10 geographical mile -lrb- 116 statute mile -rrb- in diameter and erect cairn while the other two man remain in the tent and make hourly astronomical observation of the sun these give 89 ° 55 ' s we might well have be satisfy with this result but we have time to spare and the weather be fine why should we not try to make we observation at the pole itself on December 16th therefore we transport we tent the remain 5-3\/4 mile to the south and camp there we arrange everything as comfortably as possible in order to make a round of observation during the twenty-four hour the altitude be measure every hour by four man with the sextant and artificial horizon these observation will be work out at the university of christianium this tent camp serve as the center of a circle which we draw with a radius of 5-1\/6 mile -lrb- on the circumference of which -rrb- cairn be erect a small tent which we have bring with we in order to designate the south pole be put up here and the norwegian flag with the pennant of the _ fram _ be hoist above it this norwegian home receive the name of polheim accord to the observe weather condition this tent may remain there for a long time in it we leave a letter address to he majesty king haakon vii in which we report what we have do the next person to come there will take the letter with he and see to its delivery in addition we leave there several piece of clothing a sextant a artificial horizon and a hypsometer on December 17th we be ready to return on we journey to the pole we have cover 863 mile accord to the measurement of the odometer we mean daily march be therefore 15 mile when we leave the pole we have three sled and seventeen dog we now experience the great satisfaction of be able to increase we daily ration a measure which previous expedition have not be able to carry out as they be all force to reduce they ration and that at a early date for the dog too the ration be increase and from time to time they receive one of they comrade as additional food the fresh meat revive the dog and undoubtedly contribute to the good result of the expedition one last glance one last adieu we send back to polheim then we resume we journey we still see the flag it still wave to we gradually it diminish in size and finally entirely disappear from we sight a last greet to the little norway lie at the south pole we leave king haakon vii plateau which lay there bath in sunshine as we have find it on we outward journey the mean temperature during we sojourn there be -- 13 ° centigrade it seem however as though the weather be much milder i shall not tire you by a detailed description of we return but shall limit myself to some of the interesting episode the splendid weather with which we be favor on we return display to we the panorama of the mighty mountain range which be the continuation of the two range which unite in 86 ° s the newly discover range run in a southeasterly direction and culminate in dome of a elevation of 10000 to over 16000 foot in 88 ° s this range disappear in the distance below the horizon the whole complex of newly discover mountain range which may extend a distance of over 500 mile have be name the queen maud range we find all of we ten provision depot again the provision of which we finally have a superabundance be take with we to the eightieth parallel and cache there from the eighty-sixth parallel on we do not need to apportion we ration every one could eat as much as he desire after a absence of ninety-nine day we reach we winter quarter framheim on January 25th we have therefore cover the journey of 864 mile in thirty-nine day during which we do not allow ourselves any day of rest we mean daily march therefore amount to 221 mile at the end of we journey two of we sled be in good condition and eleven dog healthy and happy not once have we need to help we dog and to push the sled ourselves we provision consist of pemmican biscuit desiccate milk and chocolate we therefore do not have very much variety but it be healthful and robust nourishment which build up the body and it be of course just this that we need the best proof of this be that we feel well during the whole time and never have reason to complain of we food a condition which have occur so often on long sledge journey and must be consider a sure indication of improper nourishment simultaneously with we work on land scientific observation be make on board the _ fram _ by captain nilsen and he companion which probably stamp this expedition as the most valuable of all the _ fram _ make a voyage from bueno aire to the coast of africa and back cover a distance of 8000 nautical mile during which a series of oceanographical observation be make at no less than sixty station the total length of the _ fram 's _ journey equal twice the circumnavigation of the globe the _ fram _ have successfully brave dangerous voyage which make high demand upon she crew the trip out of the ice region in the fall of 1911 be of a especially serious character she whole complement then comprise only ten man through night and fog through storm and hurricane through pack ice and between iceberg the _ fram _ have to find she way one may well say that this be a achievement that can be realize only by experienced and courageous sailor a deed that honor the whole nation in conclusion you will allow I to say that it be these same ten man who on February 15 1911 hoist the flag of they country the norwegian flag on a more southerly point of the earth than the crew of any other ship whose keel ever cleft the wave this be a worthy record in we record century farthest north farthest south do we dear old _ fram _ penetrate the chinese revolution ad 1912 robert machray rf johnston tai-chi quo the story of china 's awakening in 1905 be tell in we precede volume most startling and most important of the result of this arouse be the sudden successful revolution by which china become a republic this chinese revolution burst into sudden blaze in October 1911 and reach a triumphant close on February 12 1912 when the royal edict give in the follow article be proclaim at peke in this remarkable edict the ancient sovereign of china deliberately abdicate and declare the chinese republic establish we give here the account of the revolution itself and of its cause by the well-known english writer on eastern affair robert machray then come a discussion of the doubtful wisdom of the movement by a european official who have long dwell in china mr rf johnston district officer of wei-hai-wei then a patriotic chinaman educate in one of the college of america give the enthusiastic view of the revolutionist themselves they opinion of they victory and they high hope for the future robert machray with yuan shih-kai acknowledge as president by both the north and the south by peke and nank alike the great republic of china as it be call by those who have be mainly instrumental in bring it into be appear to have establish itself or at least it enter upon the first definite stage of its existence thus open a fresh volume of extraordinary interest as of incalculable importance in the history of the far east even in the day of the great and autocratic dowager empress tzu hsus who have no love for reform but know how to accept and adapt herself to the situation it be evident that a change deeply influence the political life and destiny of china be in process of development after she death in 1908 the force and sweep of this momentous movement be still more apparent -- it take on the character of something irresistible and inevitable the only question be whether the change would be accomplish by way of evolution -- gradual orderly and conservative -- or by revolution or a series of revolution probably violent and sanguinary and perhaps disastrous to the dynasty and the country the event of the last few month have supply the answer -- at any rate to a certain extent a successful revolution have take place in which it be true many thousand have be kill but which on the whole have not be attend by the slaughter and carnage that might have be anticipate consider the vastness of the country and the enormous interest involve actual warfare give way to negotiation conduct in a spirit of moderation and of give-and-take on the part of all concern the manchu dynasty have collapse though the emperor still remain as a quasi-sacred priestly personage and the prince have be pension off the great republic of china have come into be albeit it be in large measure inchoate and as it be on trial china have long be the land of rebellion and rising and it be hardly to be expect that the novel republican form of government however well construct intentioned or conduct will escape altogether from internal attack and nearly everything have yet to be do in organization general surprise have be express at the comparative ease and speed with which the revolutionary movement have attain success in drive the manchus from power and in found a republican _ régime _ the factor which chiefly contribute to this success be undoubtedly the weakness of the manchu dynasty and of the imperial clan who hate by the chinese and without sufficient resource of they own be utterly unable to offer any real resistance to the rebellious province of the south the loyalty of they troops be uncertain and any spirit or gift of leadership among themselves have disappear with the passing of the great tzu hsus in 1908 but it be a mistake to imagine that the idea of a republican form of government in place of the centuries-old autocratic semi-divine monarchy be something that have never be moot before and be entirely unknown to the chinese to the great majority no doubt it be if know at all something strange and hardly intelligible as it still be but in the south especially on and near the coast it have be familiar for some time among the possibility of the future it be not unknown even to the throne fourteen year ago after the _ coup d'état _ by which tzu hsus smash the reform movement that have be patronize by the emperor kuang hsu the then viceroy of canton state in a memorial to she that among some treasonable papers find at the birthplace of kang yu-wei the lead reformer of the time a document have be discover which not only speak of substitute a republic for the monarchy but actually name as its first president one of the reformer she have cause to be execute it must be admit on the other hand that the idea have be import into china comparatively recently the chinese language contain no word for republic but one have be coin by put together the word for self and government it must be many year before the mass of the chinese -- the rubbish people as lo feng-lu a former minister to england use to call they -- have any genuine understanding of what a republic mean the manchus be in power for nearly two hundred and seventy year and during that period there be various rising some of a formidable character against they and in favor of descendant of the native ming dynasty which they have displace powerful secret organization such as the famous triad society plot and conspire to put a ming prince on the throne but all be vain it have come to be generally believe that the race of the ming have die out but a recent dispatch from china speak of there still be a representative in existence who possibly might give serious trouble to the new republic in any case for a long time past the ming have cease to give the manchus any concern the pressure upon the latter come from outside the empire but that in its turn react profoundly on the internal situation the war with france and england have but a slight effect on china though the foreign devil beat it in war it yet despise they the effect of the war with japan in 1894 be something quite different begin the real awakening of china and impart life and vigor to the new reform movement which have its origin in canton the great city of the south whose highly intelligent people have most quickly feel and most readily and strongly respond to outside influence regard by the chinese as at least partially civilized the japanese be place in a higher category than the western barbarian but as they triumph over china be attribute to they adoption of western military method and equipment the more enlighten chinese come to the conclusion that however contemptible the man of the western world be the main secret of they success as of that of japan be open enough they decide that western learning and mode of government and organization must be study and copy as japan have study and copy they if the celestial empire be to endure it be a case on the largest scale of self-preservation and some part at least of the truth be glimpse by the throne itself something but not much be hear of a republic while tzu hsus live before she death the principle of a constitution with a national parliament and provincial assembly have be accept by the throne -- with reservation limit the sphere of these representative body retain the supreme power in the throne and in the case of the national parliament delay its come into existence for a term of year by tzu hsus 's command the throne pass at she death into the hand of a sort of commission a child of two year of age a nephew of kuang hsu call pu yi become emperor under the dynastic name of hsuan tung he father prince chun be nominate regent but be order to consult the new dowager empress lung yu the widow of kuang hsu and to be govern by she decision in all important matter of state prince chun amiable in disposition but weak and vacillate in character and not always on the best of term with lung yu begin well one of he first act be to assure president taft who have write entreat he to expedite reform as make for the true interest of china that he be determine to pursue that policy among those who have suggest reform to tzu hsus often go far beyond she wish or plan but who steadily support she in all she do in that direction the lead man be yuan shih-kaus with the possible exception of chang chih-tung the viceroy of hunan and hupeh mention above yuan shih-kaus have become the greatest man in china and even as he have advise and support tzu hsus so he advise and support prince chun at the commencement of the regency but the prince have receive a unfortunate legacy from he brother the emperor kuang hsu who believe that yuan shih-kaus have betray he to tzu hsus at the time of the _ coup d'état _ have give instruction to prince chun that if he come into power he be to punish yuan for he treachery at the beginning of 1909 the regent dismiss yuan on a apparently trivial pretext but every one in china know the real reason for he fall and not a few wonder that he life have be spare it be idle to surmise what might have happen if he service have be retain by the throne all the time but who could have imagine that so swift and almost incredible a instance of time 's revenge be in store -- that within barely three year yuan shih-kaus would be the acknowledged head of the state and prince chun and all the manchus in the dust representative government of a kind start in 1909 with the establishment of provincial assembly election be hold and assembly meet in most of the province in the following year a senate or imperial assembly be decree by a imperial edict its first session be hold in peke in October of that year and be open by the regent one of the first thing the assembly do be to memorialize the throne for the rapid hastening on of reform and in response a edict be issue announce the formation of a national parliament consist of a upper and a lower house within three year under further pressure the throne in may of 1911 abolish the grand council and the grand secretariat and create a cabinet of minister after the western model but the agitation continue and go on grow in intensity still it seek nothing apparently but a development of the constitution and at least on the surface be neither anti-dynastic nor republican a anti-dynastic outburst at changsha hunan in 1910 be easily suppress and certainly give no indication of what be so soon to take place so late as September of 1911 a rise on a considerable scale in the province of szechuan be not antidynastic but be declare by the rebel themselves to be direct against the railway policy of the government the best hope for china lie in a wide building of railway the chinese do not object to they but on the contrary make use of they to the fullest extent where they be in existence they do not wish however the line to be construct with foreign money hold that such investment of capital from without might be regard as set up lien on they land in favor of outside power -- how far they can do without outside capital be another matter then the whole question of railway-building involve the old quarrel between the province and the central government -- which be another way of say that the province do not see why all the spoil should go to peke a month after the rebellion in szechuan have break out the great revolution begin and meet with the most astonishing success from the very outset within a few week practically the whole of southern china be in the hand of the revolutionary and the throne in hot panic summon yuan shih-kaus from he retirement to its assistance after some hesitation and delay he come -- but too late to save the dynasty and the manchus though there be no shadow of doubt that he do he best and try he utmost to save they with wuchang hankau and hanyang -- the three form the metropolis as it may be term of mid-china -- in the possession of the revolutionary and other great center overtly disaffected or disloyal the regent open the session of the national assembly and it forthwith proceed to assert itself and make imperious demand with which the throne be compel to comply -- this be within a fortnight after the attack on wuchang that have begin the revolution on November 1st the throne appoint yuan shih-kai prime minister and a week later the national assembly confirm he in the office he arrive in peke on the thirteenth of the month be receive in semi-regal state and immediately institute such measure as be possible for the security of the dynasty and the pacification of the country but ten day before he reach peke the throne have be force to issue a edict assent to the principle which the national assembly have set forth in nineteen article as form the basis of the constitution these article while preserve the dynasty and keep sacrosanct the person of the emperor make the monarchy subject to the constitution and the government to parliament with a responsible cabinet preside over by a prime minister and give parliament full control of the budget here then be the triumph of the constitutional cause and yuan shih-kaus and most of the moderate progressive chinese would have be well satisfy with it if it have contented the revolutionary of the south but from the begin the southerner have make it plain that they be determine to bring about the abdication of the dynasty the complete overthrow of the manchus and the establishment of a republican form of government nor would they lay down they arm on any other term in a short time yuan shih-kaus see that the revolutionary be powerful enough to compel consideration and at least partial acquiescence in they demand it can not be think surprising that the propose elimination of the hate manchus from the government be popular yet it must seem remarkable that the revolutionary movement be so definitely republican in its aim and as such achieve so much success there have be little open agitation in favor of a republic but the ground have be prepare for it to a certain extent by a secret propaganda the foreign-drilled troops of the army be disaffected in many case and be approach with some result the eager spirit of the party in the south where practically the whole strength of the movement lay form a alliance with certain of the officer of these troops no sooner be the revolution begin than a military leader appear in the person of li yuan-hung a brigadier-general who have command a considerable body of these foreign-drilled soldier and be support by large number of such man in the fighting in and around wuchang-hankau that the revolutionary who be chiefly of the student class and not of the solid people of the country be able to enlist the active cooperation of these officer and they troops account for the quick and astonishing success of the movement and at the outset whatever be the case now many of the solid people -- magistrate gentry and substantial merchant -- also indorse it toward the end of November the revolutionary capture nank a decisive blow to the imperialist and this former capital of china become the headquarters of a provisional republican government soon afterward through the good office of great britain a truce be arrange between the north and the south yuan shih-kaus be strive with all he might to retain the dynasty as a limited monarchy but come event cast they shadow before in the resignation of the regent early in December negotiation go on between yuan who be represent at a conference hold in shanghaus by tang shao-yi a able and patriotic man and a protégé of he own and the revolutionary but the leader of the latter make it clear that there could be no peaceful solution of the situation short of the abdication of the dynasty and the institution of some form of republic at the end of December dr sun yat-sen whose striking and romantic story be well know be appoint provisional president by nanking in January he publish a manifesto to the people of china bitterly attack the dynasty promise that the republic would recognize treaty obligation the foreign loan and concession and declare that it aim at the general improvement of the country the remodeling of the law and the cultivation of better relation with the power meanwhile the dowager empress and the manchu prince have discuss the position of affair with yuan shih-kaus and the question of the abdication of the dynasty be under consideration but though the situation be desperate there be some counsel of resistance what finally make opposition impossible be the presentation to the throne in the last day of January of a memorial sign by the general of the northern army request it to abandon any idea of maintain itself by force this settle the matter no other course be practicable term be agree to between peking and nanking and on February 12th imperial edict commence for the last time with the customary formulum be issue from the capital give yuan shih-kai plenary power to establish a provisional republican government and to confer with the provisional republican government at nank approve of the arrangement which have be make for the emperor and the imperial family and exhort the people to remain tranquil under the new régime these edict will remain among the most remarkable thing in history and it can not be say that the passing of the manchus be attend by any want of that ceremonious calmness and dignity for which china be famed two or three day later sun yat-sen in a disinterested spirit resign and yuan shih-kaus be unanimously elect president by the nanking assembly yuan accept the office and thus north and south be unite in the great republic of china at the end of march progress in the settlement of affair be see in the formation of a coalition cabinet comprise minister of both the peking and the nanking government those select be man with a considerable knowledge of western life and think as for instance lu cheng-hsiang the foreign minister who have live many year in europe and speak french as well as english a further advance take place on April 2d when the nanking assembly agree by a large majority to transfer the provisional government to peke which thus resume its position as the capital of the country and the center of its administration among the cause which contribute to the success of the revolution be the inability of the north to obtain loan from outside and the pressure both direct and indirect exert upon both party by foreign power both of these cause be important the latter especially so the action of russium with respect to mongolium and of japan with regard to manchurium alarmed patriotic chinese lead they to fear that foreign interference might not be confine to these territory and to dread that the result would be the disintegration of the country under the manchus they have see the loss of korea the liaotung formosa and in a sense of manchurium itself they be apprehensive of german design in shantung of japanese in fuhkien the feeling that the country be in danger help both side to be of one mind but the pressure from the outside be not all of this sinister sort friendly representation from the genuinely well-disposed power do a good deal to bring the combatant to a mutual understanding but throughout the revolution as in the final result the great outstanding commanding figure be yuan shih-kai himself evidently a man of great gift he know how and when to yield and how and when to be firm the compromise which solve the situation -- at all event for the time -- be mostly he work statesman and patriot he save he country and it will always redound to he credit that he can not be charge with faithlessness to the manchus for he do all that be possible for they stand by they to the last by retain the emperor as the priestly head of the nation _ pater patria _ accord to chinese idea he have leave something to the manchus and at the same time contrived that the republican form of government shall bring as slight a shock to immemorial china as can be imagine what do this immemorial china -- mean thereby the great bulk of the chinese the un-westernized chinese -- think of the republic in other word be the republic likely to last what sort of republic will it probably be view the situation as it stand at one of the early stage of the revolution yuan shih-kaus state that only three-tenths of he countryman be in favor of a republic -- in itself however a considerable proportion of the population now that the republic be in existence will it be accept tranquilly by the rest the majority of these people be the inoffensive and industrious peasant of the interior who have long be accustom to bad government as they will scarcely find they lot harder now they will probably quietly accept the new order unless some radical change be make affect they habit of life which be unlikely some of the old conservative gentry be oppose to the republic but now the manchu dynasty be go whom or what can they suggest in its place that would be receive favorably by the country the descendant of the ming or the descendant of confucius neither seem a likely candidate in present circumstance for it may very well be the case that as the revolution have be so largely military and part of the army need careful handling as the recent riot in peking show the republican government will assume something of a distinctively military character and yuan shih-kaus as its head be in a position not very different from that of a military dictator -- as diaz be in mexico the republic will of course have its trouble and serious one enough to face but the balance of probability certainly suggest its lasting awhile rf johnston like political upheaval in other age and other land the chinese revolution have be the outcome of the hope and dream of impetuous and indomitable youth herein lie one of its main source of strength but herein also lie a very grave danger young china to-day look to europe and to america for sympathy let she have it in full measure only let we remind she that the work she have so boldly and perhaps light-heartedly undertake be not only the affair of china not only the affair of asia but that the whole world stand to gain or lose accord as the chinese people prove themselves worthy or unworthy to carry out the stupendous task to which they have set they hand the grave peril lie of course in the tendency of the chinese progressive -- as of all hot-headed reformer whether in china or in england -- to break with the tradition of past age and to despise what be old not because it be bad but because it be out of harmony with the latest political shibboleth those of we who believe in the fundamental soundness of the character of the chinese people and be aware of the high dignity and value of a large part of they inherit civilization and culture be await with deep anxiety a answer to this question : be the new china about to cast herself adrift from the old but surely many a western observer may exclaim the matter be settle already surely the abolition of the monarchy be in itself a proof that the chinese have definitely break with tradition be not the emperor a sacred be who represent a unbroken political continuity of thousand of year and who rule by divine right be not loyalty to the sovereign part of the chinese religion these question can not be answer with a simple yes or no reverence for tradition have always be a prominent chinese characteristic in respect of both ethic and politics we must beware of assume too hastily that the exhortation of a few frock-coated revolutionary have be sufficient to expel this reverence for tradition from chinese heart and mind yet we be oblige to admit that the national aspiration be be direct toward a new set of ideal which in some respects be scarcely consistent with the ideal aim at -lrb- if rarely attain -rrb- in the past the chinese doctrine of loyalty can not be properly understand until we have form a clear conception of the traditional chinese theory concern the nature of political sovereignty the political edifice no less than the social be build on the confucian and pre-confucian foundation of filial piety the emperor be father of he people the whole population of the empire form one vast family of which the emperor be the head as a son owe obedience and reverence to he parent so do the subject owe reverence and obedience to he sovereign in the four thousand year and more that have elapse since the day of yü over a score of dynasty have in they turn reign over china the _ shu ching _ -- the chinese historical classic -- give we full account of the event which lead to the fall of the successive dynasty of hsium -lrb- 1766 bc -rrb- and shang -lrb- 1122 bc -rrb- in both case we find that the leader of the successful rebellion lay stress on the fact that the _ t ` ien-ming _ -lrb- divine right -rrb- have be forfeit by the dynasty of the defeat emperor and that he the successful rebel have be but a instrument in the hand of god thus the rebel become emperor by right of the divine decree and it remain with he descendant until by they misdeed they provoke heaven into bestow it upon another house the teaching of the sage of china be in full accordance with the view that the sovereign must rule well or not at all confucius -lrb- 551-479 bc -rrb- spend the greater part of he life in try to instruct negligent prince in the art of government and we know from a well-known anecdote that he regard a bad government as worse than a tiger we be tell that when one of he disciple ask confucius for a definition of good statecraft he reply that a wise ruler be one who provide he subject with the means of subsistence protect the state against its enemy and strive to deserve the confidence of all he people and the most important of these three aim say confucius be the last : for without the confidence of the people no government can be maintain if the prince 's command be just and good let the people obey they say confucius in reply to a question put by a reign duke but if subject render slavish obedience to the unjust command of a bad ruler it be not the ruler only but he sycophantic subject themselves who will be answerable for the consequent ruin of the state so far from counsel perpetual docility on the part of the govern confucius clearly indicate that circumstance may arise which make opposition justifiable the minister he say should not fawn upon the ruler of whose action he disapprove : let he show he disapproval openly mencius the second sage of china -lrb- 372-289 bc -rrb- be far more outspoken than confucius in he denunciation of bad ruler there be no sycophancy in the word which he utter during a interview with king hsuan of the state of ch ' i when the prince treat he minister with respect as though they be he own hand and foot they in they turn look up to he as the source from which they derive nourishment when he treat they like he dog and horse they regard he as no more worthy of reverence than one of they fellow subject when he treat they as though they be dirt to be trodden on they retaliate by regard he as a robber and a foe it be interesting to learn that this passage in mencius so irritated the first sovereign of the ming dynasty -lrb- 1368-1398 ad -rrb- that he cause the spirit-tablet of the sage to be remove from the confucian temple to which it have be elevated about three century earlier but the remonstrance of the scholar of the empire soon compel the emperor to revoke he decree and the tablet of mencius be restore to its place of honor from which it be never subsequently degrade it be no matter for surprize that the people have reverence the second sage for he it be who have come nearest in china to the enunciation of the somewhat doubtful principle _ vox populus vox dei _ it be unmistakably the view of mencius that a bad ruler may be put to death by the subject whom he have misgovern king hsuan be once discuss with he the successful rebellion against the last sovereign of the hsium and shang dynasty and with reference to the slaying of the infamous king chou -lrb- 1122 bc -rrb- ask whether it be allowable for a minister to put he sovereign to death mencius in he reply observe that the man who outrage every principle of virtue and good conduct be rightly treat as a mere robber and villain i have hear of the killing of a robber and a villain name chou i have not hear about the killing of a king that be to say chou by he rascality have already forfeit all the rights and privilege of kingship before he be actually put to death on another occasion mencius be question about the duty of minister and royal relative if the sovereign rule badly he say they should reprove he if he persist again and again in disregard they advice they should dethrone he the prince for whose edification the philosopher utter these daring sentiment look grave i pray you majesty not to take offense say mencius you ask I for my candid opinion and i have tell you what it be several other passage of similar purport might be cite from mencius but two more will suffice let we suppose say the sage that a man who be about to proceed on a long journey entrust the care of he wife and family to a friend on he return he find that the faithless friend have allow he wife and child to suffer from cold and hunger what should he do with such a friend he should treat he thenceforth as a stranger reply king hsuan and suppose continued mencius that you majesty have a minister who be utterly unable to control he subordinate : how would you deal with such a one i should dismiss he from my service say the king and if throughout all you realm there be no good government what be to be do then the embarrassed king we be tell look this way and that and change the subject the last of mencius 's teaching on kingship to which we shall refer be perhaps the most remarkable of all the most important element in a state he say emphatically be the people next come the altar of the national god least in importance be the king these citation from the revered classic should be sufficient to prove that the people of china be not necessarily cut themselves adrift from the tradition of age and the teaching of they philosopher when they rise in they might to overthrow a incompetent dynasty for it can not be deny that china have know little prosperity under the later ruler of the manchu line and when the revolutionary leader declare that the reign house have forfeit the _ t ` ien-ming _ we must admit that they have ample justification for they belief that such be the case but many western friend of china while fully recognize the right of the people to remove the manchus entertain very grave doubt as to the wisdom of abolish the monarchy altogether and the establishment of a republican government in its stead the _ t ` ien-ming _ have always pass from dynasty to dynasty never from dynasty to people from the remotest day of which we have record the chinese system of government have be monarchic if the revolutionary can break tradition to the extent of abolish the imperial dignity what guaranty have we that they will not break with tradition in every other respect as well and so destroy the foundation on which the whole edifice of china 's social political and religious life have rest through all the century of she known history whether the chinese people -- as distinct from a few foreign-educated reformer -- do as a matter of fact honestly believe that a republican government be adapt to the need of the country be a very different question it certainly have not be prove that the whole nation be now incline toward a republic -- in spite of the admission to that effect contain in the imperial edict of abdication perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say that the overwhelming majority of the people of china have not the slightest idea what a republic mean and how they life and fortune will be affect by its establishment and therefore hold no strong opinion concern the advantage or disadvantage of republican government it can not be deny however that the social system under which the chinese people have live for untold age have in some way make they more fit for self-government than any other people in the world it would be well if european -- and especially englishman -- would try to rid themselves of the obsolete notion that every oriental race as such be only fit for a despotic form of government perhaps only those who have live in the interior of china and know something of the organization of family and village township and clan be able to realize to how great a extent the chinese have already learn the art of self-government it be not without reason that a western authority -lrb- writing before the outbreak of the revolution -rrb- describe china as the greatest republic the world have ever see the momentous edict in which the manchu house sign away its imperial heritage be issue on the twelfth day of February 1912 it contain many noteworthy feature but the word which be of special interest from the constitutional point of view i translate as follow : the whole nation be now incline toward a republican form of government the southern and central province first give clear evidence of this inclination and the military leader of the northern province have since promise they support in the same cause _ by observe the nature of the people 's aspiration we learn the will of heaven -lrb- t ` ien-ming -rrb- _ it be not fitting that we should withstand the desire of the nation merely for the sake of the glorification of we own house we recognize the sign of the age and we have test the trend of popular opinion and we now with the emperor at we side invest the nation with the sovereign power and decree the establishment of a constitutional government on a republican basis in come to this decision we be actuate not only by a hope to bring solace to we subject who long for the cessation of political tumult but also by a desire to follow the precept of the sage of old who teach that political sovereignty rest ultimately with the people such be the dignified and yet pathetic swan-song of the die manchu dynasty whatever we political sympathy may be we be not oblige to withhold we tribute of compassion for the sudden and startling collapse of a dynasty that have rule china -- not always inefficiently -- for the last two hundred and sixty-seven year the abdication edict can not fail to be of interest to student of the science of politics the throne itself be convert into a bridge to facilitate the transition from the monarchical to the republican form of government the emperor remain absolute to the last and the very republican constitution which involve he own disappearance from political existence be create by the fiat of the emperor in he last official utterance theoretically the republic be establish not by a people in arm act in opposition to the imperial will but by the emperor act with August benevolence for he people 's good the cynic may smile at the transparency of the attempt to represent the abdication as entirely voluntary but in this procedure we find something more than a mere face-saving device intend for the purpose of effect a dignified retreat in the hour of disaster perhaps the greatest interest of the decree center in its appeal to the wisdom of the national sage and its acceptance of they theory as to the ultimate seat of political sovereignty the heart of the drafter may have quail when he write the word that signify the surrender of the imperial power but the spirit of mencius guide he hand it now remain for we to hope that the teaching of the wise man of old which have be obey to such momentous issue by the last of the emperor will not be treat with contempt by he republican successor tai-chi quo the entire civilized world as well as china be to be heartily congratulate upon the glorious revolution which have be sweep over that vast ancient empire and which be now practically assure of success just as conflagration light up the whole city say victor hugo revolution light up the whole human race of no revolution record in the world 's history can this be say with a greater degree of truth than of the present revolution in china it spell the overthrow of monarchy which have exist there for over forty century and the downfall of a dynasty which have be the enemy of human progress for the last two hundred and seventy year it effect the recognition and establishment of personal liberty the sovereignty of man over himself for four hundred and thirty-two million soul one-third of the world 's total population the chinese revolution mark in short a great decisive step in the onward march of human progress it benefit not only china but the whole world for just as a give society should measure its prosperity not by the welfare of a group of individual but by the welfare of the entire community so must humanity estimate its progress accord to the well-being of the whole human race society can not be consider to be in a far advanced stage of civilization if one-third of the globe 's inhabitant be suffer under the oppression and tyranny of a one-man rule democracy can not be say to exist if a great portion of the people on the earth have not even political freedom real democracy exist only when all man be free and equal hence any movement which bring about the recognition and establishment of personal liberty for one-third of the member of the human family as the chinese revolution be do may well be pronounce to be beneficial to mankind but be it really true and credible that conservative slumbering and mysterious china be actually have a revolution that beautiful and terrible thing that angel in the garb of a monster if it be what be the cause of the revolution what will be its ultimate outcome what will follow its success will a republic be establish and will it work successfully these and many other question pertain to the chinese situation have be ask not only by skeptic but also by person interested in china and human progress there can be no doubt that china be in earnest about what she be do even the skeptic who call the revolution a mob movement or another boxer uprising at its early stage must now admit the truth of the matter the admirable order and discipline which have characterize its proceedings conclusively prove that the revolution be a well-organized movement direct by man of ability intelligence and humanitarian principle sacredness of life and its rights for which they be fight have generally guide the conduct of the rebel the mob element have be conspicuous by its absence from they rank it be very doubtful whether a revolution involve such a immense territory and so many million of people as be involve in this one could be effect with less bloodshed than have thus far mark the chinese revolution if some allowance be make for exaggeration in the newspaper report of the loss of life and of the disorder that have occur during the struggle allowance which be always permissible and even wise for one to make there have be very little unnecessary bloodshed commit by the revolutionist although anti-manchu spirit be a prominent factor in bring about the uprising it have be subordinate by the larger idea of humanity with the exception of a few instance of unnecessary destruction of manchu live at the beginning of the outbreak member of that tribe have be show great clemency the rebel leader have impress upon the mind of they follower that they first duty be to respect life and property and have summarily punish those have any inclination to loot or kill despite the numerous outrage and act of brutality by the manchus and imperial troops the revolutionary have be moderate lenient and humane in they treatment of they prisoner and enemy unnecessary bloodshed have be avoid by they as much as possible as dr wu ting-fang have say : the most glorious page of china 's history be be write with a bloodless pen regard the cause of the revolution it must be note that the revolt be not a sudden sporadic movement nor the result of any single event it be the outcome of a long series of event the culmination of the friction and contact with the western world in the last half-century especially the last thirty year and of the importation of western idea and method into china by she foreign-educated student and other agent during the last decade especially the last five year there have be a most wonderful awakening among the people in the empire one could almost see the growth of national consciousness so rapidly have it develop when the people fully realize they shortcoming and they country 's deplorable weakness as it have be constantly bring out in she dealings with foreign power they fall into a state of dissatisfaction and profound unrest fill with the shame of national disgrace and imbue with democratic idea they have be cry for a strong and liberal government but they plea and protest have be in most case ignore and in a few case respond to with half-hearted superficial reform which be far from satisfactory to the progressive the manchu government have follow its traditional _ laissez faire _ policy in the face of foreign aggression and threatening danger of the empire 's partition with no thought of the morrow until now it have be completely blind to the force of the popular will and have deem it not worth while to bother with the common people long ago patriotic chinese give up hope in the manchu government and realize that china 's salvation lay in the take over of the management of affair into they own hand for over a decade dr sun yat-sen and other chinese of courage and ability mostly those with a western education have be busily engage in secretly preach revolutionary doctrine among they fellow countryman and prepare for a general outbreak they collect numerous follower and a large sum of money the revolutionary propaganda be be spread country-wide among the gentry and soldier and even among enlighten government official in spite of governmental persecution and strict vigilance revolutionary literature be be widely circulate notwithstanding the rigid official censorship add to all this be the ever important economic cause famine and flood in recent year have greatly intensify the already strong feeling of discontent and unrest and serve to pile up more fuel for the general conflagration in short the whole nation be like a forest of dry leaf which need but a single fire spark to make it blaze hence when the revolution break out on the memorable 10th of October 1911 at wu-chang it spread like a forest fire within the short period of two week fourteen of the eighteen province of china proper join in the movement one after another with amazing rapidity everywhere people welcome the advent of the revolutionary army as the drought-stricken would rejoice at the coming rain or the hungry at the sight of food the great wave of democratic sentiment which have sweep over europe america and the island of japan at last reach the chinese shore and be now roll along resistlessly over the immense empire toward its final goal -- a world-wide democracy a step toward world peace the united state arbitration treaty ad 1912 hon william h taft later generation will doubtless note as one of the main manifestation of we present age its progress in international arbitration in the substitution of justice for force as the means of decide dispute between nation on march 7 1912 the united state senate after month of argument finally agree to ratify two arbitration treaty which president taft have arrange with england and france true the senate before thus establish the treaty strike out they most far-reaching article a agreement that every disagreement whatsoever should be refer to a joint high commission without this clause the treaty still leave a bare possibility of warfare over question of national honor or national policy but practically they put a end to war forever as between the united state and its two great historic rival these two treaty be the last and most important of 154 such arbitration treaty arrange since the recent inauguration of the great world peace movement they be here describe by president taft himself in a article reprint with he approval from the _ woman 's home companion _ he work as a leader in the cause of peace be likely to be remember as the most important of he administration in 1913 he purpose be carry forward by william j bryan as the united state secretary of state mr bryan evolve a general plan of arbitration which during the first year of its suggestion be adopt by thirty-one of the smaller nation to govern they dealings with the united state thus the strong promise international justice to the weak the development of the doctrine of international arbitration consider from the standpoint of its ultimate benefit to the human race be the most vital movement of modern time in its relation to the well-being of the man and woman of this and ensue generation it exceed in importance the proper solution of various economic problem which be constant theme of legislative discussion or enactment it be engage the attention of many of the most enlighten mind of the civilized world it derive impetus from the influence of church regardless of denominational difference society of noble-minded woman organization of worthy man be give they moral and material support to governmental agency in they effort to eliminate as cause of war dispute which frequently have lead to armed conflict between nation the progress already make be a distinct step in the direction of a higher civilization it give hope in the distant future of the end of militarism with its stupendous crush burden upon the work population of the leading country of the old world and foreshadow a decisive check to the tendency toward tremendous expenditure for military purpose in the western hemisphere it presage at least partial disarmament by government that have be and still be pile up enormous debt for posterity to liquidate and insure to multitude of man now involuntarily do service in army and navy employment in peaceful productive pursuit perhaps some war have contribute to the uplift of organize society more often the benefit be utterly eclipse by the ruthless waste and slaughter and suffering that follow the principle of justice to the weak as well as to the strong be prevail to a extent heretofore unknown to history rule of conduct which govern man in they relation to one another be be apply in a ever-increasing degree to nation the battle-field as a place of settlement of dispute be gradually yield to arbitral court of justice the interest of the great mass be not be sacrifice as in former time to the selfishness ambition and aggrandizement of sovereign or to the intrigue of statesman unwilling to surrender they scepter of power religious war happily be specter of a medieval or ancient past and the christian church be labor valiantly to fulfil its destiny of peace on earth if the united state have a mission besides develop the principle of the brotherhood of man into a living palpable force it seem to I that it be to blaze the way to universal arbitration among the nation and bring they into more complete amity than ever before exist it be know to the world that we do not covet the territory of we neighbor or seek the acquisition of land on other continent we be free of such foreign entanglement as frequently conduce to embarrassing complication and the effort we make in behalf of international peace can not be regard with a suspicion of ulterior motive the spirit of justice govern we relation with other country and therefore we be specially qualify to set a pace for the rest of the world the principle and scope of international arbitration as exemplify in the treaty recently negotiate by the united state with great britain and france should commend itself to the american people these treaty go a step beyond any similar instrument which have receive the sanction of the united state or the two foreign power specify they enlarge the field of arbitrable subject embrace in the treaty ratify by the three government in 1908 they lift into the realm of discussion and hearing before some kind of a tribunal many of the cause of war which have make history such a sickening chronicle of ravage and cruelty bloodshed and desolation after year of patient endeavor by man of various nation and despite many obstacle and discouragement there have be establish at the hague a permanent court of arbitration to which contend government may submit certain class of controversy for adjudication this court have already justified its creation and existence by the settlement of contention which in other day lead to disastrous war and even in this enlighten age might have precipitate serious rupture the united state government as represent by the national administration be ready to utilize this method of settle international dispute to a greater extent than ever before that be we be willing to refer to this tribunal or a similar one question which heretofore have be leave entirely to diplomatic negotiation the treaty go further by provide for the creation of a joint high commission to which shall be refer for impartial and conscientious investigation any controversy between this government on one hand and great britain or france on the other hand before such a controversy have be submit to a arbitral body from which there be no appeal and assume that government like individual do not always display while a dispute be in progress that calmness of judgment and equipoise which be so consistent with righteous deportment provision be make for the passion to subside and the blood to cool by defer the reference of such controversy to the joint high commission for one year this afford a opportunity for diplomatic adjustment without a appeal to the commission the plan of submission to a joint high commission compose of three citizen or subject of one party and the same number of another be a concession to the fear of be too tightly bind to a adverse decision make manifest in the objection of the senate committee because it may well be suppose that two out of three citizen or subject of one party would not decide that a issue be arbitrable under the treaty against the contention of they own country unless it be reasonably clear that the issue be justiciable under the first clause of the treaty ultimately i hope we shall come to submit we quarrel to a international arbitral court that will have power finally to decide upon the limit of its own jurisdiction and in which the form of procedure by the complain country shall be fix and the obligation of the country complain of to answer in a form prescribe shall be recognize and definite and the judgment shall be either acquiesce in or enforce these treaty be a substantial step but a step only in that direction and the feature of the binding character of the decision of the joint high commission as to the arbitral character of the question be the most distinctive advance in the right direction do not let we give up this feature without use every legitimate effort to retain it a understanding of the term _ justiciable _ may be essential to a full comprehension of the significance and scope of these treaty question involve boundary line the rights of fisherman in water border upon country with contiguous territory the use of water-power the erection of structure on frontier outrage upon alien be example of justiciable subject and these be make susceptible of adjudication and decision under these treaty it be now propose to establish a permanent method of dispose of such question without preliminary quarrel and menace whose result may never be foresee certain question of governmental or traditional policy be by they very nature exclude from the consideration of the joint high commission or even the permanent court of arbitration at the hague such specific exemption it be not necessary to set forth in the treaty objection have be make that under the first section of the pend pact it might be claim that we would be call upon to submit to arbitration of the monroe doctrine or we right to exclude foreign people from we shore or the question of the validity of southern bond issue in reconstruction day the monroe doctrine be not a justiciable question but one of purely governmental policy which we have follow for nearly a century and in which the country of europe have generally acquiesce with respect to the exclusion of immigrant it be a principle of international law that every country may admit only those whom it choose this be a subject of domestic policy in which no foreign country can interfere unless it be cover by a treaty and then it may become properly a matter of treaty construction with reference to the right to involve the united state in a controversy over the obligation of certain southern state to pay bond issue during reconstruction which have be repudiate it be sufficient to say that the pend treaty affect only case hereafter arise and the case of the southern bond all arise year ago after a time if we treaty stand the test of experience and prove useful it be probable that all the greatest power on earth will come under obligation to arbitrate they difference with other nation naturally the smaller nation will do likewise and then universal arbitration will be more of a actuality than a altruistic dream the evil of war and what follow in its train i need not dwell upon we could not have a higher object than the adoption of any proper and honorable means which would lessen the chance of armed conflict man endure great physical hardship in camp and on the battle-field in we civil war the death-roll in the union army alone reach the appalling aggregate of 359000 but the suffering and peril of the man in the field distressing as they be to contemplate be slight in comparison with the woe and anguish of the woman who be leave behind the hope that husband brother father son may be spare the tragic end which all soldier risk when they respond to they country 's call buoy they up in they privation and heart-breaking loneliness but theirs be the deepest pain for the most poignant suffering be mental rather than physical no pension compensate for the loss of husband son or father the glory of death in battle do not feed the orphan child nor do the pomp and circumstance of war clothe they the voice of the woman of america should speak for peace tragedy of the titanic the speed craze and its

ismay chairman of the board of director of the white star line suggest that the ship head for new york this be do the _ carpathium _ with nine hundred passenger of she own and the seven hundred survivor reach new york in safety the sad international tragedy of the sinking of the _ titanic _ touch man 's soul more deeply than any other disaster in many year to english-speaking race in particular the horror of the occasion press close home for here be the best of british ship bear many of the most prominent of america 's people to these seasoned voyager cross the atlantic have become a mere pleasant trifle seem no more dangerous than a afternoon 's shopping in town then suddenly there be thrust upon all of they that ancient awful knowledge that in the midst of life we be in death both american passenger and english crew live up to the best tradition of they race there be no panic no fighting for place in the boat on the doomed ship on the contrary people refuse to believe in the imminence of danger the idea that the ship be unsinkable have be so bear in on they that even when summon upon deck and order to put on life-belt many of they refuse in the first boat get away from the ship there be not many people some refuse to climb down through the deep blackness into the tiny craft they think the tumult all a empty scare that would soon pass when the steady ominous settling of the huge ship 's bulk break through this shallow confidence there be a solemn change grand and tender scene there be on those sink deck of husband and wife parting with the utterance of a hope turn suddenly to terror that they would soon meet again of other wife who refuse to leave they husband and deliberately stay to share they fate few of the more note passenger be among those save bruce ismay director of the steamship line be one the captain go down with he ship as do most of he officer though some of the latter save themselves by cling to the wreckage which rise after the vessel 's plunge while she be sink she band still play nearer my god to thee and other earnest hymn death do not find the old saxon stock cringe from he with hysteria and frenzy sudden as be he come wholly unexpected as be he hideous visage he be meet with the calm courage which be the best tradition of the race and what have be the consequence of this overwhelming tragedy a investigation be immediately begin in america by the united state government another slower dignified and ponderous be afterward undertake by the british government both of they in the end attribute the disaster to practically the same cause the speed mania which have overtake the nation the heedlessness of man 's over-confidence which take risk so many time successfully that it grow to forget that risk exist the _ titanic 's _ captain want to make a record on she maiden voyage he director want he to make a record that would mean increase advertisement and increase traffic for they line so in the face of danger know there be iceberg all around he the captain rush he ship blindly ahead the chance of he actually hit a iceberg be scarce one in a hundred so he take the chance the probability that if he do strike a iceberg it could do irreparable damage to he stout ship be scarce one in a hundred so he take that chance also he gamble with death as a thousand speed-driven captain have gamble before this time it be death 's turn to win a gamble even more reprehensible be that of the steamship company who have grow so sure they ship would not sink that they no longer provide sufficient means of escape from they why load a vessel down with useless life-boat which only hang the year in and year out block up space every foot of that space be valuable it might make room for a extra passenger or provide a extra amusement to draw traffic what voyager ever count life-boat or work out the awful calculation so obvious now that there be only rescue space provide for one-third of the number of soul aboard be not the ship unsinkable after all the _ titanic _ be go we sorrow for she be become but a memory we ship carry lifeboat sufficient now they be compel to by law and we sea captain run on safer line that too the law have make compulsory but it will be long before man 's overween self-confidence rise from the shock which have be give to he belief in he mechanical ability nature be not conquer yet ocean have still a strength beyond ours ship be not unsinkable and death will still take he toll of bold man 's life in the future as he have do in the past we know that cowardice cost more than courage but it be not so tragically costly as blind foolhardiness we progress knowledge of life surgery perpetuate the body 's organ ad 1912 genevieve grandcourt prof r legendre several year ago a wealthy swedish manufacturer of dynamite leave by he will a fund for the provide of a large prize to be confer each year upon the person who have accomplish most for the peaceful progress of mankind this annual sum of forty thousand dollar which be call from its donor the nobel prize be in October 1912 confer upon a surgeon dr alexi carrel for he remarkable work in the study of the life of the tissue and organ which exist in the human body even before this public recognition of he work dr carrel have in the summer of 1912 create a furor among the savant of pari by the announcement of what he have accomplish carrel though a native-born frenchman be a american by education and citizenship and the french be at first inclined to challenge the value of he work we therefore present here a popular scientific account of what he have achieve reprint by permission from the _ scientific american _ then come the grudging approval of professor legendre the note preparator of zoology head of that section in the national museum of pari briefly state the impressive step which science have here take be the preservation of life in the heart and other organ so that these may be take out of the body and yet keep alive for month with smaller animal carrel have even accomplish the actual transferrence of organ from one individual to another as for the simpler bodily tissue it now seem possible to preserve these indefinitely outside the body not only alive but in excellent health and ready to reassume they function in another body genevieve grandcourt the immortality of tissue a very evident disadvantage under which medical science have labor have be the impossibility of watch the chemical process set in motion by substance introduce into the body for this reason various experimenter from time to time have attempt to grow tissue artificially in such manner that they development function and decay -- under both healthy and diseased condition -- might be study under the microscope the only way in which this could be do would be to take a piece of live tissue from the body and cause its cell to multiply tissue be make up of a aggregation of cell science have fail to produce a single living cell that be a cell which will undergo the process of nuclear division -lrb- growth -rrb- which be the prime condition of its be and it seem equally impossible to cause a cell already live to undergo the same process if deprive of the circulation of the blood therefore when in 1910 it be announce that dr alexi carrel with he assistant dr m t burrow have succeed scientific credulity be tax a well-known french savant express the opinion before the society of biology in pari that as other experiment along these line have witness only degeneration and survival of cell this phenomenon be all carrel 's discovery amount to in view of past experience indeed the chance be in favor of a mistake in 1897 leo loeb say that he have produce this artificial growth both within and without the body obviously such development within the organism where the process of utilize the body-fluids etc follow the same course as in nature take on the character of graft rather than of cultivate in a culture medium as to cause the external growth it be ten year later before it seem first to have succeed in 1907 harrison from john hopkin university furnished detail of he research in such form as to be convincing but he work have reference to the growth of tissue only of coldblooded animal he have cultivate artificially nerve fiber from the central nervous system of the frog carrel 's work consist in extend harrison 's method to apply to warm-blooded animal include of course mammal he have primarily in view at this time a more precise knowledge of the law govern the restoration of tissue for example after serious surgical wound he and he assistant work steadily to this end and succeed the tissue of the higher animal include man can now be develop in a culture and such development can be make to correspond to a rigidly precise technique the feat be accomplish by put minute piece of live tissue into a plasmatic -lrb- blood -rrb- medium which will coagulate so complicated be this apparently simple matter in its application that only the most exquisite surgical skill be proof against incalculable modification in result have obtain evidence that tissue can be cultivate in accordance with a formulum that may be rely upon to give definite result the effort be make to grow artificially the various malignant -lrb- cancerous -rrb- tissue in turn of chicken rat dog and human be cancerous tissue invariably develop cancer and so rapidly and extensively that the growth could be observe with the naked eye it now become evident that under the right circumstance the artificial growth of tissue could be utilize in the study of many problem such as malignant growth of tissue certain problem in immunity as for example the production of antitoxin of certain organism the regulation of the growth of the organism or of different part of the organism rejuvenation and senility and the character of the internal secretion of the gland such as the thyroid which play a role most important in physical and mental development the difficulty lay in the fact that the artificial growth be so very short-lived it be find that by pass the growth into a new medium and repeat the process the tissue would begin to grow again but they life even under these circumstance be limit at the most to twenty day this be manifestly too short a time in which to study the fundamental question to which the researcher have address themselves thereupon study be take up to determine the question as to _ what make these tissue die _ it be find that apparently as incidental to growth there be the process of decay due to a _ inability of the tissue to eliminate waste product _ on January 17 1912 experiment be commence to determine whether these effect could be overcome the observation be on the heart and blood-vessel artificially grow of the chicken fetus these growth be put into a salt solution for a few minute at different period of they growth and then place in a new plasmatic medium it be find that by follow this method the tissue could be make to live indefinitely when a animal be in the early stage of its development the growth of its tissue be necessarily greater as it mature there be steady diminution after a certain age until the growth altogether cease and the size of the animal be determine but it be find by subject these artificial growth to washing in salt solution that the mass be _ fifteen time greater at the end of than at the commencement of the third month show that they do not grow old at all _ in the artificial growth the problem of senility and death be solve it be the announcement of this permanent life of tissue that cause such a furor in paris last summer and several eminent scientist to demand ocular demonstration because the discovery if true constitute the greatest scientific advance of a generation the follow summary of this interesting and vitally important and epoch-making work of carrel be translate from a article publish in paris recently by professor pozzus who witness the experiment : carrel find that the pulsation of a fragment of heart which have diminish in number and intensity _ or cease _ could be revive to the normal state by a wash and a passage in a secondary culture two fragment of heart separate by a free space beat as strongly and regularly the larger fragment contract 92 time a minute and the smaller 120 time for three day the number and intensity of the pulsation vary slightly on the fourth day the pulsation diminish considerably in intensity the large fragment beat 40 time a minute and the little fragment 90 time the culture be wash and place in a new medium a hour and a half after the pulsation have become very strong the large fragment contract 120 time a minute and the small fragment 160 time at the same time the fragment grow rapidly at the end of eight hour they be unite and form a mass of which all the part beat synchronically experiment to date seem to establish that the connective tissue at any rate be immortal from this research it be possible to arrive at certain logical conclusion which however it remain for the future to confirm one and the most important be that the normal circulation of the blood do not succeed in free all the waste product of the tissue and that this be the cause of senility and death be science to find some way to wash the tissue in the living organism as they have be wash in these culture man 's life might be indefinitely prolonged r legendre the nobel prize in medicine for 1912 have just be award to dr alexi carrel a frenchman of lyon now employ at the rockefeller institute of new york for he entire work relate to the suture of vessel and the transplantation of organ the remarkable result obtain in these field by various experimenter of whom carrel be most widely known and also the wonderful application make of they by certain surgeon have already be widely publish the journal have frequently speak lately of culture of tissue detach from the organism to which they belong and some of they exaggerate the result already obtain have state that it be now possible to make live tissue grow and increase when so detach have give these subject much study i wish to state here what have already be do and what we may hope to accomplish as a matter of fact we do not yet know how to construct living cell the form obtain with mineral substance by errera stephane leduc and other have only a remote resemblance to those of life neither do we know how to prevent death but yet it be interesting to know that it be possible to prolong for some time the life of organ tissue and cell after they have be remove from the organism the idea of preserve the life of greater or lesser part of a organism occur at about the same time to a number of person and though the end in view have be quite different the investigation have lead to essentially similar result the surgeon who for a long time have transplant various organ and graft different tissue bit of skin among other have seek to prolong the period during which the graft may be preserve alive from the time they be take from the parent individual until they be implant either upon the same subject or upon another the physiologist have attempt to isolate certain organ and preserve they alive for some time in order to simplify they experiment by suppress the complex action of the nervous system and of gland which often render difficult a proper interpretation of the experiment the cytologist have try to preserve cell alive outside the organism in more simple and well-defined condition these various effort have already give as we shall see very excellent result both as regard the theoretical knowledge of vital phenomenon and for the practice of surgery it have be possible to preserve for more or less time many organ in a living condition when detach from the organism the organ first try and which have be most frequently and completely investigate be the heart this be because of its resistance to any arrest of the circulation and also because its survival be easily show by its contractility in man the heart have be see to beat spontaneously and completely 25 minute after a legal decapitation -lrb- renard and loye 1887 -rrb- and by massage of the organ its beating may be restore after it have be arrest for 40 minute -lrb- rehn 1909 -rrb- by irrigation of the heart and especially of its coronary vessel the period of revival may be much prolong the first experiment with artificial circulation in the isolate heart be make in ludwig 's laboratory but they be limit to the frog and the inferior vertebrate since then experiment on the survival of the heart have multiply and become classic artificial circulation have keep the heart of man contracting normally for 20 hour -lrb- kuliabko 1902 -rrb- that of the monkey for 54 hour -lrb- her 1903 -rrb- that of the rabbit for 5 day -lrb- kuliabko 1902 -rrb- etc it have also enable we to study the influence upon the heart of physical factor such as temperature isotonium chemical factor such as various salt and the different ion and even complex pharmaceutical product kuliabko -lrb- 1902 -rrb- be even able to note contraction in the heart of a rabbit that have be keep in cold storage for 18 hour and in the heart of a cat similarly keep after 24 hour the other muscular organ have naturally be investigate in a manner analogous to that which have be use for the heart and for the same reason because it can be readily see whether or not they be alive the striated muscle survive for quite a long time after removal especially if they be preserve at the temperature of the body and care be take to prevent they dry by this method many investigation have be make of muscular contraction in isolate muscle landoi have note that the muscle of a man may be make to contract two hour and a half after removal those of the frog and the tortoise 10 day after recently burrow -lrb- 1911 -rrb- have note a slight increase in the myotome of the embryo chick after they have be keep for 2 to 6 day in coagulated plasma non-muscular organ may also survive a removal from the parent organism but the proof of they survival be more difficult to establish because of the absence of movement carrel -lrb- 1906 -rrb- graft fragment of vessel that have be in cold storage for several day upon the course of a vessel of a living animal of the same species in 1907 he graft upon the abdominal aorta of a cat a segment of the jugular vein of a dog remove 7 day previously also a segment of the carotid of a dog remove 20 day before the circulation be reestablish normally these experiment have however be criticize by fleig who think that the graft fragment be dead and serve merely as support and director for the regeneration of the vessel upon which they be set in 1909 carrel remove the left kidney from a bitch keep it out of the body for 50 minute and then replace it the extirpation of the other kidney do not cause the death of the animal which remain for more than a year normal and in good health thus prove the success of the graft in 1910 carrel succeed with similar experiment on the spleen take altogether these experiment show that the greater part if not all of the bodily organ be able to survive for more or less time after removal from the organism when favorable condition be furnish there be no doubt but what the observe time of survival may be considerably prolong when we have a better knowledge of the serum that be most favorable and the physical and chemical condition that be most advantageous if we can preserve the organ we may expect to also keep alive the tissue and cell of which they be compose biologist have study these problem too and have also obtain in this department some very interesting result the cell which live naturally isolate in the organism such as the corpuscle of the blood and spermatozoon be the first study since 1910 experiment on the survival of tissue have multiply and at the same time more knowledge have be obtain concern the condition most favorable to survival and the microscopical appearance of the tissue so preserved in 1910 harrison have place fragment of a embryo frog in a drop of coagulated lymph take from a adult see they continue they development for several week the muscle and the epithelium differentiate the nervous rudiment send out into the lymph filament similar to nerve fiber since 1910 with the aid of dr minot i have succeed in preserve alive the nerve cell of the spinal ganglion of adult dog and rabbit by place they in defibrinate blood of the same animal through which there bubble a current of oxygen at zero and perhaps better at 15 ° -20 ° the structure of the cell and they colorable substance be preserve without notable change for at least four day moreover when the temperature be raise again to 39 ° certain of the cell give a proof of they survival by form new prolongation often of a monstrous character at 39 ° some of the ganglion cell which have be preserve rapidly lose they colorability and then they structure break up but a certain number of the other form numerous outgrowth extremely vary in appearance we have besides study the influence of isotony of agitation and of oxygenation and these experiment have enable I to ascertain the best physical condition require for the survival of nervous tissue in 1910 burrow employ the technique of harrison obtain result similar to he with fragment of embryonic chicken since 1910 carrel and burrow apply the same method to what they call the culture of the tissue of the adult dog and rabbit they have thus preserve and even multiply cell of cartilage of the thyroid the kidney the bone marrow the spleen of cancer etc perhaps carrel and he collaborator may be criticize for call culture that which be merely a survival but there still remain in they work a great element of real interest such be too briefly summarize the experiment which have be make up to the present time we can readily imagine the practical consequence which we may very shortly hope to derive from they and the wonderful application of they which will follow in the domain of surgery without go so far as the dream of dr moreau depict by well since graft do not succeed between animal of different species we may hope that soon in many case the replace of organ will be no longer impossible but even easy thanks to method of conservation and survival which will enable we to have always at hand material for exchange the dream of to-day may be reality to-morrow there be also other consequence which will follow from these research i hope that they will permit we to study the physical and chemical factor of life under much simpler condition than heretofore and it be toward this end that i be direct my research they will enable we to approach much nearer the solution of the old insoluble problem of life and death what indeed be the death of a organism all of whose part may yet survive for some time these then be the research make in this domain fecund from every point of view and the great increase in the number of expert who be take they up while it be a proof of they interest give hope for they rapid progress the overthrow of turkey the first balkan war ad 1912 j elli barker frederick palmer prof stephen p duggan turkey 's _ opéra-bouffe _ war with italy in 1911 plunge she into a far more terrible and sanguinary struggle see she weakness the little balkan state seize the opportunity to unite and attack she each of the balkan ally have once be crush by turkey and have fight for freedom each be jealous and suspicious of all the other each people hope that in the break-up of turkey they own land would be enlarged each see member of they own race oppress in the macedonian region still hold by turkey in face of they great opportunity however all the four state -- bulgarium greece servium and montenegro -- hush they own quarrel and join in attack they common enemy of the cause of the war mr j elli barker the note english authority on turkey here give a brief account the tale of the first glorious campaign with its big battle of kirk-kilesseh and lule-burga be then tell by mr frederick palmer the foremost of american war correspondent upon the scene the confused negotiation for peace be then detail by prof stephen p duggan we american authority upon the balkan state j elli barker a short time ago i read a interesting account of sir max waechter 's recent journey to the capital of turkey and all the other balkan state he have visit these town wit the object of lay before the sovereign of the balkan state and they minister proposal for abolish war by the creation of a european federation of state all the balkan sovereign and minister whom he have see have express themselves sympathetically and favorably and have agree to accept the _ status quo _ a month later all the balkan state be at war russium austria-hungary and italy be arm and people be anxiously discuss the possibility of a world war the sudden transition from peace to war appear inexplicable to those unacquainted with the reality of foreign policy in July 1908 the turkish revolution break out it be a great and immediate success never in the world 's history have there be so successful a revolution or one so bloodless as by magic turkey be change from a medieval state into a modern democracy the turkish mass be rejoice old feud be forget mohammedan and christian fraternize the word liberty equality fraternity parliamentarism and democracy be on all lip over night a new turkey have arise soon the leader of young turkey begin to assert the right and claim of the new-born state we be tell that european intervention in the affair of turkey would no longer be tolerate and that those part of the turkish empire which though nominally subject to the sultan be no longer under turkish control would have to be hand back great britain be to restore egypt and austria-hungary bosnium and herzegovina many englishman indorse these claim and tell we that a new era have open in the east at that time only a few people venture to doubt whether the turkish revolution would be a lasting success i think i be the only british publicist who immediately and unhesitatingly foretell that parliamentary government in turkey be bind to be a failure and that it would inevitably lead to the formation of a balkan confederation which would attack turkey i say then : european turkey have about 6000000 inhabitant of whom only about one-third be turk the young turk have the choice of two evil they must either follow a liberal or a conservative policy if they follow a liberal policy if they introduce parliamentary representation self-government and majority rule in turkey in general and in macedonium in particular the christian will be the majority and it seem likely that they will then oust the turkish minority and convert the ruling race into a rule race a liberal policy will therefore bring about the rapid disintegration of the turkish empire foresee the danger of allow the alien element to be further strengthen many patriotic turk have demand that a vigorous conservative policy should be pursue which will abolish the national difference among the alien race and between the alien race and the turk they demand that a turkish national policy should be initiate that the alien should be nationalize in turkish national school that turkish shall be the language of turkey that the greek bulgarian and other school shall be close will bulgaria greece and servium quietly look on while the work of a generation be be undo will the greek serb and bulgarian reside in turkey allow themselves to be denationalize more or less forcibly besides can they be denationalize against they will except by destroy the parliamentary and democratic government the constitution of yesterday and by reintroduce the ancient absolutism in a aggravate form two hundred year ago the turk could easily have nationalize the alien race by means of the church and the school but it seem that it be now too late to make a attempt at turn the subject race into turk in endeavor to settle the conflict among the alien nationality and between the alien and the turk the path of the new turkish government will scarcely be smooth _ the balkan state _ be watch event with attention although they congratulate the new turkish government they have no interest in turkey 's regeneration and they be bind to oppose the ottomanization of they compatriot in turkey therefore they _ may be expect to draw the sword and to face turkey unitedly if they see they plan of expansion threaten by the nationalization of the alien element in turkey _ unfortunately my forecast have come true in every particular the failure of new turkey be natural it be unavoidable ancient state be ponderous and slow-moving body they course can be deflect and they character be alter only by gradual evolution by slow and almost imperceptible change spread over a long space of time democracy like a tree be a thing of slow growth and it require a congenial soil it can not be create over night in turkey persium or china the attempt to convert a ancient eastern despotism firmly establish on a theocratic basis a country in which the koran and the multeka be the law of the land into a western democracy base on the secular speculation of rousseau montesquieu bentham mill and spencer be ridiculous the revolution effect only a outward change it introduce some western innovation but altered neither the character of the government nor that of the people turkish parliamentarism become a sham and a make-believe the cruel absolutism of abdul hamid be speedily follow by the scarcely less cruel absolutism of a secret committee the new ruler of the country be mostly very young man who be conspicuous for they enthusiasm and they daring but not for they judgment and experience they have pick upon the boulevard and in the quartier latin of pari and in geneva the sonorous phrase of western democracy and demagogy and with these they impress not only they fellow citizen but also the onlooker in europe have obtain power they embark upon a campaign of nationalization however instead of try to nationalize the non-turkish million slowly and gradually by kind and just treatment couple with a moderate amount of nationalize pressure they begin ruthlessly to make war upon the language and to suppress the church school and other institution of the non-turkish citizen whom they disarm and deprive of they ancient rights the complaint and remonstrance of the persecute be answer with redoubled persecution with violence and with massacre and soon serious revolt break out in all part of the empire the young turk follow faithfully in abdul hamid 's footstep however abdul hamid be clever enough always to play off one nationality or race against the other in he balkan policy for instance he encourage greek christian to slay christian bulgarian and servian and allow bulgarian band to make war upon servian and greek support on principle one nationality against the other but the young turk persecute indiscriminately and simultaneously all non-turkish race albanian bulgarian servian and greek and thus they bring about the union of the balkan state against themselves the outbreak of the war could scarcely have be prevent by the european power it be bind to come it be as inevitable as be the breakdown of the young turkish _ régime _ since the earliest time the turk have be a race of nomadic warrior they policy have always be to conquer nation to settle among the conquer and to rule they keep they in strict and humiliating subjection they have always treat the subject people harshly and contemptuously unlike other conqueror they have never try to create among the conquer a great and homogeneous state which would have promise permanence but nomad-like have merely create military settlement among alien therefore the alien subject of the turk have remain alien in turkey they have not become citizen of the empire as the turk do not try to convert the conquer to islam -- the koran forbid proselytism by force -- and to nationalize they the subject and ill-treated alien mass never amalgamate with the ruling turk but always strive to regain they liberty by rebellion owe to the mistake make in its creation the turkish empire have be for a long time a empire in the process of disintegration its later history consist of a long series of revolt of which the present outbreak be the latest but scarcely the last instance the failure of the new turkish _ régime _ have increase to the utmost the century-old antagonism between the ruling turk and they christian subject the account of the suffering of they brother across the borderline inflict upon they by constitutional turkey which have promise such great thing have raise the indignation of the balkan people to fever heat and have make a explosion of popular fury inevitable the war fever increase when it be discover that servian bulgarian and greek be at last of one mind and that turkey 's strength have be undermine by revolt in all part of the empire and by the turkish-italian war the turk on the other hand be not unnaturally indignant with the perfidy of the christian power which instead of support turkey in she attempt at reform have snatch valuable territory from she immediately after she revolution not unnaturally they attribute the failure of the new _ régime _ and the revolt of they subject to the machination of the christian state and the balkan trouble to the hostile policy of the balkan state the tension on both side become intolerable if the balkan state have not mobilize a revolution would have break out in sofium and belgrade for the people demand war if the turkish government have give way to the balkan state a revolution would have break out in constantinople the instinct of self-preservation force the balkan government and turkey into war the passion of race-hatred have become uncontrollable frederick palmer -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reprint by permission from a article in _ everybody 's

army have be act together as a unit under a single command happily each army be to make a separate campaign under its own general each have its own separate task each be to strike at the force in

victory be seven or eight thousand casualty two or three fragment of the turkish army escape along the road otherwise there be complete disintegration uskub be now undefended it be the ancient capital of servium and the feeling of the serb as they march in approximate what ours would be if we battalion be swing down pennsylvanium avenue after a mexican proconsul have occupy the white house for five hundred year meanwhile at monastir be forty thousand more turk so far as help they comrade at kumanova be concern they might as well have be in jail in kamchatka you can imagine they sit cross-legged turkish fashion wait they turn they break the precedent of plevna which the garrison of adrianople and scutarus gloriously keep by yield rather easily there must have be a smile on the golden dome of

and sprig of green which they womenfolk have give in farewell the woman be just as spartan as the spartan perhaps more so if any soldier lack innate courage the spur of public opinion drive he forward in step with he comrade naturally bulgarian generalship have to adapt its plan of campaign to the obstacle between it and its adversary for army be cumbrous affair in all time they have be tie down to road and bridge the main highway and the main railway line from sofia the capital of bulgarium to constantinople both run through adrianople nature mean this city set in a basin among hill for defense and for the center of any army defend thrace on the near-by hill be a circle of permanent fort that command all approach for gun or infantry in front of it be the turbulent maritza and to the northeast lie the town of kirk-kilesseh partly fortify and naturally strong which form the turkish right the left rest at demotika to the south of adrianople in a rough country inaccessible to prompt action by a large force the bulgar must turn one wing or the other foreign military expert think that kirk-kilesseh could be take only after a long operation and then only by a force much larger than the bulgar could spare for concentration at any one point of the line let two week pass without a definite victory and the turk would have number equal to the bulgar a month superior number as it be the turk have altogether include the adrianople garrison a hundred and seventy-five thousand man in strong position against the bulgar ' first line of two hundred and eighty thousand a branch of the sofia-constantinople railway line run northeast to yamboli on the bulgarian frontier between yambolus and kirk-kilesseh be a highway -- the turkish kind of highway -- and no unfordable stream or other natural obstacle to a army 's progress at yambolus the bulgar concentrate they third army corps under general demetrief and a portion of they second the rest of the second face adrianople while the first corps operate to the south and east swing around on kirk-kilesseh the third army would not take no for a answer the bulgarian infantry storm the redoubt in the moonlight they know how to use the bayonet and the turk do not skilfully drive steel slaughter mohammedan fanaticism that fight with club gun hand and tooth ask no quarter this side of paradise kirk-kilesseh fall the turkish army flank have to go adrianople be isolate the bulgarian dead on the field could not complain the wound be in the rear the living have burn eye on the next goal _ na noj _ -lrb- fix bayonet -rrb- have win _ na noj _ give they the steel be the cry of a nation soldier sing it out to one another on the march child prattle it at home as if it be a new kind of game : give they the steel and they will go nothing can stop bulgarium not more than two bulgarian soldier out of twenty ever reach the turk with a bayonet the turk do not wait for they so the bayonet count no less in the morale of the eighteen than of the two frequently they fix it at a distance of five or six hundred yard they desire to use it make they press close at all point with the grim initiative that will not be gainsay when they charge the spirit of cold steel be in they rush there be a splendid audacity in general demetrief 's next move after kirk-kilesseh he do not pause to surround adrianople to the east be a wide gap in the investing line through this the garrison might have make a sortie with tell effect but demetrief know he enemy he take it for grant that the garrison be settle itself for a siege with twelve thousand turkish reenforcement a day arrive from asia even hour count as yet the turk be not decisively beat only the right that fight at kirk-kilesseh have be really demoralize on the line of bunar hissar to lüle burga they form to receive the second shock they be give scant time to prepare for it _ na noj _ for three day this battle the waterloo of the war rage the advance bulgarian infantry go down like ninepin but it do not give up for it know that they would go when they see the steel again the turn movement in flank crushed in the end this time the turkish main army be shatter it hardly have the cohesiveness of a large mob it be many little mob hungry stagger on to the rear where the ravages of cholera await in two week the bulgar have make they disposition and fight two battle each lasting three day they have advance seventy-five mile over a rough country where the road be slough the loss in kill and wound be sixty thousand one man out of five be down when officer and man have snatch any sleep it be on the rain-soaked earth the bread in they haversack be wet and moldy when they lay in the fire zone they be lucky if they have this to eat by day they have dig they way trench by trench up to the enemy 's position crouching in the mud to keep clear of bullet by night they have charge they be a army in a state of auto-intoxication bent on the one object of drive the turkish army back to the narrow line of the peninsula this accomplish all the isolate force in european turkey whether at distant scutarus or near-by adrianople be without hope of relief the neck of the funnel be close the war practically win all the world know now and the bulgarian staff must have know at the time that for a week after lüle burga the utter demoralization of the turkish retreat leave the way open to constantinople why do not general demetrief go on why do that army which have proceed thus far with such impetuous and irresistible momentum suddenly turn snail for the reason that the marathon winner when he drop across the tape be not good for another mile the bulgar be on he stomach in the mud though he be face toward the heel of the turk food and ammunition be not up a fresh force of fifty thousand man follow up the victory might easily have make its own term at the door of yildiz palace within three or four day but there be not even a fresh regiment it be three week after lüle burga before demetrief be ready to attack three week in which the cholera scare have abate the panic in constantinople have come and go reenforcement have arrive and be organize into a kind of order while they build fortification the turkish cruiser support both of nazim pasha 's flank with the fire of heavier gun than the bulgar possess there be a approachable turkish front of only about sixteen mile without silence the turkish battery demetrief send he infantry against the redoubt he lose five or six thousand man without gain a single fort against a stubborn and even semi-intelligent foe there be no storm a narrow frontal line of fortification when you may not turn the end adrianople lay across the straight line of transportation by railroad and highway to the peninsula all munitions for demetrief 's army have to go around it in the miserable antiquated ox-cart it be the rock splitting the flood of the bulgarian advance while the world be hear rumor of the city 's fall the truth be that it be not really invest until a month after lüle burga be fight for a month the garrison report to be starve be draw in supplies from a big section of farm country when the armistice be sign it still have pasturage within the line of defense for flock of sheep and herd of cattle the problem for the bulgar first and last be to keep this fact mask and to check the savage sortie and spare all the gun and man they could for the main army volunteer from macedonium still in native dress clerk still in white collar old man who have perjure themselves about they age in order to get a rifle and the young conscript of twenty year come to take the place of the regular force on the investing line who move on to re-enforce demetrief fifty thousand servian two division be spare after kumanova and speed across bulgarium on the single-line railway with a amazing rapidity to assist accord to plan the bulgar in the investment operation to the turk adrianople be a holy city here be the most splendid mosque in all the empire that build by the conqueror sultan selim with the shadow of the minaret over he shoulder the turkish private in a trench be ready to die for allah but death must come for he he be not go to hustle intelligently after paradise in short he be a sit-and-take-it fighter while any delay of the bulgarian advance be invaluable in gain time he make no use of he opportunity in a country of hill and transverse valley and ravine which nature mean for rear-guard action a company of infantry post on a hill could force a regiment to deploy and attack and a few mile farther on could repeat the process cavalry could harass the flank of the attack force field-gun could get a commanding position above a road with safe cover for retreat at mustapha pasha twenty mile in front of adrianople be a solid old stone bridge over the maritza whose flood in the winter rain would be a nightmare to engineer who have to maintain a cross with pontoon if ever a corps need a bridge the second bulgarian corps need this one they find that a small and badly place charge of dynamite have merely knock out a few stone between two of the buttress leave the bridge intact enough for all the army of europe to pass over it and the turk do not even put a mitrailleuse behind sandbag in the street or use field-gun from the adjacent hill to delay the bulgar in they cross the soldier who be good only for the defensive can never win what beat the turk be the turk himself he army be in the chaos between old-fashioned organization and a attempt at a modern organization he general be divide in they counsel he junior officer ape the modern officer in form but lack application they have cease to believe in they religion therefore they do not lead they private who do believe in the midst of the war captain and lieutenant trustworthy observer tell I would leave they untrained company of reservist to march by the road while they themselves ride by train they take they soldier ' pay they neglect all the detail which be the very essence of that preparation at the bottom without which no generalship at the top can prevail the bulgarian officer two-third of whom be reservist enjoy a comradeship with they man at the same time that discipline be rigid they believe in they god at least in the god of efficiency they work hard they belong in the world of to-day and the turk do not therefore the turk have to go we will not make peace without adrianople be the cry of every bulgar its possession become a national fetish no less than naval superiority to the british adrianople stand for the real territorial object of the war it must be the center of any future line of defense against the turk practically its siege be set once there be stalemate at tchatalja with no hope of beat the main bulgarian army back there be no hope of relieve the garrison whose fate be only a matter of time at the london peace conference the ally stand firm for the possession of adrianople the turkish commissioner after repeat for six week that they would never cede it have finally agree to yield on order from constantinople when the young turk kill nazim pasha the turkish commander-in-chief and overthrow the old cabinet you can have adrianople when you take it be the defiance of the new cabinet to the ally prof stephen p duggan the peace conference come to naught and hostility be resume on February 14 1913 because of the impossibility of agreement between the ally and turk on three important point : the status of adrianople the disposal of the aegean island and the payment of a indemnity by turkey bulgarium and turkey both maintain that adrianople be essential to they national safety moreover its possession by bulgarium be absolutely necessary be she to secure the hegemony in the balkan at which she aim on the other hand to the turk adrianople be a sacred city around which cluster the most glorious memory of they race thus they would yield it only as a last necessity the ambassadorial conference anxious to bring to a end a war which be threaten to embroil austria-hungary and russium and desirous also to make the settlement permanent have already on January 17th in its collective note to the porte unavailingly recommend to the porte the cession of adrianople to the balkan state the question of the aegean island present similar difficulty they be inhabit almost exclusively by greek who demand to be unite to the mother country but turkey insist that the possession of some of they -lrb- _ eg _ imbros tenedo and lemno -rrb- be necessary to she for the protection of the dardanelle since they command the entrance to the strait while other -lrb- _ eg _ chio and mitylene -rrb- be part of asiatic turkey the greek assert that to leave any of they to turkey would cause constant unrest in greece and subsequent uprising against turkey thus merely repeat the history of crete moreover the greek maintain that they must have the dispute island because they be the only large and profitable one but they express a willingness to neutralize they so that the integrity of the dardanelle would not be endanger the difficulty be complicate by the retention of a number of the island by italy until turkey should fulfil all the provision of the treaty of lausanne arise from the tripolitan war the greek assert that they fleet would have take all the island except for the italian occupation moreover they be suspicious of italian intention especially with regard to rhode the ambassadorial conference in its collective note to the porte have advise the porte to leave to the power the task of decide upon the fate of the island of the aegean sea and the power would arrange a settlement of the question which will exclude all menace to the security of turkey the third question in dispute concern a money indemnity the war have be a fearful drain upon the resource of the ally they be determine not to share any of the ottoman debt and to compel turkey if possible to bear the financial burden of the war but to yield to this demand would absolutely destroy turkish credit this would result in the financial ruin of many of the subject of the great power hence this demand of the ally meet with scant favor in the ambassadorial conference the war drag on during the entire month of February without change the relative position of the belligerent in the mean time the relation between austria-hungary and russium be daily become more strained this be due to the determination of austria-hungary to prevent servium from secure a seaboard upon the adriatic in the slogan of the ally the balkan peninsula for the balkan people austria-hungary find a principle which could be utilize against they demand she take the stand that the albanian be a balkan people entirely distinct from slav and greek and particularly unfriendly to the slav it would be as suicidal to place any of the albanian under the slav as to put back any of the slav under the turk albania must be a autonomous state that it may live in peace it must possess its seaboard intact in this position austria-hungary be second by italy which have interest in albanium as important as those of austria-hungary neither state can afford to allow the other to possess the eastern shore of the adriatic and both be determine that it shall not fall into the possession of another possibly stronger power as early as December 20 1912 the ambassador have recommend to they government and the latter have accept the principle of albanian autonomy together with a provision guaranteeing to servium commercial access to the adriatic this have arouse the intense indignation of the serb whose army contrary to the express prohibition of austria-hungary have already occupy durazzo on the adriatic and overrun northern albania the serb deny the right of any state to forbid they to occupy the territory of the enemy whom they have conquer and servium send a detachment of she best troops and some of she largest siege gun to help the montenegrin take scutarus moreover numerous report of outrage commit upon albanian by the liberator in they attempt to convert both moslem and catholic albanian to the orthodox faith reach central europe and cause great danger in vienna count berchtold 's statement to the delegation that austria-hungary would insist upon territory enough to enable independent albanium to be a stable state with scutarus as the capital arouse in turn much excitement in russium scutarus be the chief goal of montenegrin ambition to possess it have be the hope of king nichola and he people during he long reign of half a century to forbid he to possess it would be to deprive he of the fruit of the really heroic sacrifice he people have make during this war hence the excitement in all slavdom on February 7th franci joseph send prince hohenlohe to st petersburg with a autograph letter to the czar which have the good effect of reduce the tension between the two country the ambassadorial conference at london then direct its attention exclusively to settle the status of albanium after more than a month of acrimonious discussion a settlement be reach on march 26th in which the principle of nationality which have be invoke to justify the creation of a independent albanium be quietly ignore the conference agree upon the northern and northeastern boundary of albanium in order to carry she point that scutarus must be albanian austria-hungary agree that the almost exclusively albanian town of ipek djakova prizrend and dibra should go to the serb on April 1st king nichola be notify that the power have unanimously agree to blockade he coast if he do not raise the siege of scutarus he answer be that the propose action of the power be a breach of neutrality and that montenegro would not alter she attitude until she have sign a treaty of peace at once the warship of all the power save russium -lrb- which have none in the mediterranean -rrb- engage in the blockade on April 15th owe to the pressure of the power and to the strained relation that have arise between servium and bulgarium the servian troops be recall from scutarus nevertheless the montenegrin persist alone and scutarus fall April 22 1913 two day later the austro-hungarian government demand that vigorous action be undertake by the power to put independent albanium in possession of scutarus accord to the agreement of march 26th at once the greatest excitement prevail throughout russium street demonstration against the austro-hungarian policy be hold in many of the large city in austria-hungary military preparation become active on a large scale and on may 1st the dual monarchy give notice that it would undertake individual action should montenegro not agree to the ultimatum italy which be determine never to permit the dual monarchy individual action in albania announce that she would support she ally as the result of all the pressure bring to bear upon he on may 5th king nichola yield and place scutarus in the hand of the power just in time as sir edward gray inform the english house of common to prevent a outbreak of hostility between austria-hungary and russium while the chancellery of the great power be thus strain every nerve to agree upon the status of albanium and thereby to prevent a conflict between the two power most vitally interested the war between the ally and turkey be prosecute during march with greater vigor and with more definite result on march 5th janina surrender to the greek and on march 26th adrianople fall the power have already offer to mediate between the belligerent and they good office have be accept by both side the ally at first insist upon the rodosto-malatra line as the western boundary of turkey but be inform that the power would not consent to give bulgarium a foothold on the dardanelle after much outcry and violent denunciation by the ally a armistice be sign at bulair on April 19th by representative of all the belligerent except montenegro which be thereby only incite to more heroic effort to capture scutarus nevertheless the ally have profit so much by delay in they relation with the power since the very outbreak of the war that they now hope to secure advantage by a similar policy and it be not until may 21st that they representative reassemble at london even then there appear to be no sincere desire to come to term and on may 27th sir edward gray inform the delegate that they would soon lose the confidence of europe and that for all that be be accomplish they might as well not be in london the delegate be very indignant at this strong language but it have the desire effect for on may 30 1913 the treaty of london be sign by the representative of all the belligerent its principal provision be those already suggest by the power _ viz _ : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the boundary between turkey and the ally to be a line draw from midia to eno to be delimit by a international commission : -lrb- 2 -rrb- the boundary of albanium to be determine by the power -lrb- 3 -rrb- turkey to cede crete to greece -lrb- 4 -rrb- the power to decide the status of the aegean island -lrb- 5 -rrb- the settlement of all the financial question arise out of the war to be leave to a international commission to meet at paris it be time for a settlement since the problem be no longer to secure peace between turkey and the ally but rather to maintain peace among the ally the solution of the great problem of the war the division of the spoil could no longer be defer from the moment that adrianople have fall the troops of bulgarium servium and greece maneuver for position each state determine to secure possession of as much territory as possible in the hope that at the final settlement it might retain what it have seize mexico plunge into anarchy huerta seize a dictatorship ad 1913 edwin emerson william carol mexico have loom large in the affair of the world during recent year the overthrow of diaz in 1911 do not as the world have hope bring into power a earnest and energetic middle class capable of guide the downtrodden peon into the blessing of civilization on the contrary the land pass from the grip of a cruel oligarchy into that of a far more cruel anarchy horde of bandit spring up everywhere the new president madero be a philosopher and a patriot but he fail wholly to get any real grasp of the situation he be betray on every side rebellion rise all around he and in he extremity he entrust he army and he personal safety to the most savage of he secret enemy general huerta madero die because he be too far in advance of he countryman to be able to understand they after that huerta seek to reestablish the old diaz regime of wealth and terrorism but he only succeed in plunge the land back into utter barbarism the mexican be the last large section of the earth 's population thus leave to rule themselves in savagery hence the rest of the world have watch they with eagerness europe repeatedly remind the united state that by she monroe doctrine she have assume the duty of keep order in america at last she feel compel to interfere the picture of those day of anarchy be here sketch by two eye-witness a englishman and a american both fresh from the scene of action edwin emerson there be a say in mexico that it be much easier to be a successful general than a successful president inasmuch as almost all mexican president during the hundred year since mexico become a republic owe they presidency to successful generalship this say be significant at all event no mexican general who win he way into the national palace by he military prowess ever win he way out with credit to himself or to he country general victoriano huerta mexico 's latest interim-president during the first few month that follow he overthrow of the madero government find out to he own cost how much harder it be to rule a people than a army as a matter of fact general huerta be push into he interim-presidency before he really have a fair opportunity to learn how to command a army at the time he be so suddenly make chief magistrate of mexico he be not command the mexican army but be merely a recently appoint major-general who happen to command that small fraction of the regular army at the capital which be suppose to have remain loyal to president madero and he constitutional government huerta have be appoint by president madero to the supreme command of the loyal force at the capital numbering barely three thousand soldier only a few day before madero 's fall even if he have not turn traitor to he commander-in-chief as he do in the end huerta 's command of the loyal troops during the ten day ' struggle at the capital precede the fall of the constitutional government could not be describe as anything but a dismal failure before consider general huerta 's qualification as a president one should know something of he career as a soldier during the last few year it have repeatedly fall to my lot to follow general huerta in the field so that i have have a fair chance to view some of he soldierly quality at close hand i accompany general huerta during he campaign through chihuahua in 1912 and be present at he famous battle of bachimba near chihuahua city on July 3 1912 -- the one decisive victory win by general huerta against the rebel force of pascual orozco before this campaign i be in cuernavaca in the state of morelos during the time when general huerta have he headquarters there in he campaign against zapa 's bandit horde in that state after the fall of general diaz 's government general huerta then take charge of the last military escort which accompany general porfirio diaz on he midnight flight from mexico city to the port of vera cruz during the ten hour ' run down to the coast it may be recall the train on which president diaz and he family ride be hold up by rebel in the gray of dawn and the soldier of the military escort have to deploy in skirmish order lead by general diaz and huerta in person but the affair be over after a few minute ' firing with no casualty on either side before this eventful year general huerta have but few opportunity of win laurel on the field of battle have enter the military academy of chapultepec in the early ` seventy under lerdo de tejada 's presidency victoriano huerta be graduate in 1875 at the age of twenty-one and be commission a second lieutenant of engineer while still a cadet at chapultepec he distinguish himself by he predilection for scientific subject particularly mathematics and astronomy during the military rebellion of oaxaca when general diaz rise against president lerdo lieutenant huerta be engage in garrison duty and get no opportunity to enter this campaign after general diaz have come into power and have begin he reorganization of the mexican army young huerta lately promote to a captaincy of engineer come forward with a plan for organize a general staff general diaz approve of he plan and captain huerta accordingly in 1879 become the founder of mexico 's present general staff corps the first work of the new general staff be to undertake the draw up of a military map of mexico on a large scale the earliest section of this immense map on which the mexican general staff be still hard at work be survey and draw up in the state of vera cruz where the mexican military map commission still have its headquarters captain huerta accompany the commission to jalapa the capital of the state of vera cruz and serve there through a period of eight year receive he promotion to major in 1880 and to lieutenant-colonel in 1884 during this time he have charge of all the astronomical work of the commission and he also lead survey and explore party over the rough mountainous region that extend between the city of jalapa and orizaba while at jalapa he marry emilium aguilum of mexico city who bear he three son and a daughter in 1890 huerta be promote to a colonelcy and be recall to mexico city as a reward for indian campaign service huerta be promote to the rank of brigadier-general in mexico 's centennial year of 1910 when francisco madero rise in the north and other part of the republic give sign of disaffection general huerta be order south to take charge of all the detach government force in the mountainous state of guerrero almost simultaneously with he arrival in chilpancingo the capital of the state of guerrero almost the whole south of mexico rise in rebellion the military situation there be soon find to be so hopeless that huerta be recall to mexico city after general huerta see general porfirio diaz off to europe at vera cruz he return to the capital and place himself at the disposition of don francisco l de la barra mexico 's new president _ ad interim _ president de la barra dispatch he with a column of soldier to cuernavaca to restore peace huerta place himself at señor madero 's complete disposition when the latter be elect and inaugurate as president at mexico madero for reason that be self-evident be anxious to propitiate the military element and to secure the cooperation of the more experienced officer in the regular army for the better pacification of the country accordingly when zapa and he bandit horde give sign of return to they old way refuse to stay buy president madero send general huerta back into morelo at the head of a strong force of cavalry mountain artillery and machine gun numbering altogether 3500 man with order to put down zapa 's new rebellion at any cost at the same time president madero induce he former fellow rebel ambrosio figueroa now commander-in-chief of mexico 's rural guard to cooperate with general huerta by bring a mount force of three thousand rurale from guerrero into morelo from the south so as to hem in the zapatista between himself and huerta at cuernavaca figueroa 's man though they have to cover three time the distance strike the main body of the rebel first and get badly muss up in the battle that follow general huerta 's column do not get away from cuernavaca until the second day of the fight and do not reach the battlefield in the extinct crater of mount herradura until figueroa 's rurale have be all but route in the battle that follow general huerta succeed in drive the rebel out of they strong position but the loss of the federal owe to they belated arrival and hastily take position be disproportionately heavy this affair cause much ill-feeling between the rurale and regular and figueroa send word to madero that he could not afford to sacrifice he man by try to cooperate with such a poor general as huerta the much-heralded joint campaign accordingly fall to the ground president madero thereupon recall general huerta and send general roble of the regular army to replace he in command this furnished huerta with another grievance against madero some time afterward i hear general huerta explain in private conversation to some of he old army comrade that he have be recall from morelos because of he sharp military measure against the zapatista owe to president madero 's sentimental preference for deal leniently with he old zapatista friend at the time when general huerta make this private complaint however it be a notorious fact that he successor in morelos general roble have receive public instruction from madero to deal more severely with the morelos rebel general roble do as a matter of fact handle the morelos rebel far more ruthlessly than huerta lead to he own subsequent recall on charge of excessive cruelty meanwhile the orozco rebellion have arise in the north and become so threatening that general gonzalez sala madero 's war minister feel call upon to resign he portfolio to take the field against orozco general sala after organize a fairly formidable-looking force of 3500 regular and three battery of field artillery at torreon rush into the fray only to suffer a disgraceful defeat in he first battle at rellano in chihuahua not far from torreon general sala take he defeat so much to heart that he commit suicide on he way back to torreon this together with the panic-stricken return of he army to torreon cause the greatest dismay at the capital the inhabitant of which already believe themselves threaten by a irresistible advance of orozco 's rebel follower none of the federal general at the front be consider strong enough to stem the tide the only available federal general of high rank who have any experience in command large force in the field be victoriano huerta president madero in he extremity call upon huerta to reorganize the badly disorder force at torreon and to take the field against orozco cost what it may this be toward the end of march 1912 general huerta whom the army have come to regard as shelved lose no time in get to torreon there he soon find that the situation be by no means so black as it have be paint -- general trucy aubert who have be cut off with one of the column of the army have cleverly extricate he force from its dangerous predicament so as to bring it safely back to the base at torreon without undue loss of man or prestige thenceforth no expense be save by general huerta in bring the army to better fight efficiency heavy reenforcement of regular especially of field artillery be rush to torreon from the capital and large body of volunteer and irregular be send after they from all part of the republic president madero have say : let it cost what it may so all the preparation go forward regardless of cost hang the expense become the blithe motto of the army when general huerta at last take the field against orozco early in may he federal army now swell to more than six thousand man and twenty piece of field artillery move to the front in a column of eleven long railway train each numbering from forty to sixty car load down with army supplies and munitions of all kind besides a horde of several thousand camp follower woman sutler and other non-combatant the entire column stretch over a distance of more than four mile the transportation and sustenance of this unwieldy column which have to carry its own supply of drinking water it be estimate cost the mexican government nearly 350000 peso per day its progress be exasperatingly slow owe to the fact that the mexican central railway which be huerta 's only chosen line of advance have to be repair almost rail by rail after more than a fortnight 's slow progress general huerta strike orozco 's force at conejo in chihuahua near the branch line run out to the american mine at mapimus orozco 's force find themselves heavily outnumber and overmatch in artillery hastily evacuate conejo retreat northward up the railway line by means of some half-dozen railway train several week more pass before huerta again strike orozco 's force at rellano in chihuahua close to the former battlefield along the railway where he predecessor general gonzalez sala have come to grief this be in June huerta with nearly twice as many man and three time as much artillery drive orozco back along the line of the railway after a two day ' long-range artillery bombardment against which the rebel be powerless this battle in which the combined loss in dead and wound on both side be less than 200 be describe in general huerta 's official report as more terrific than any battle that have be fight in the western hemisphere during the last fifty year in he last triumphant bulletin from the field general huerta telegraph to president madero that he brave man have drive the enemy from the height with a final fierce bayonet charge and that they bugle blast of victory could be hear even then on the crest pascual orozco on the other hand report to the revolutionary junta in el paso that he have order he man to retire before the superior force of the federal and that they have accomplish this without disorder by the simple process of board they wait train and steam slowly off to the north destroy the bridge and culvert behind he as they go along one of my fellow war correspondent who serve on the rebel side during this battle afterward tell I that the federal whose bugle call huerta hear on the height do not get up to this position until two day after the rebel have abandon they trench along the crest the subsequent advance of the federal from rellano to the town of jimenez orozco 's old headquarters which have be evacuate by he without firing a shot last another week here huerta 's army camp for another week at jimenez the long-brewing unpleasantness between huerta 's regular officer and some of madero 's bandit friend command force of irregular cavalry come to a head the most note of these former guerrilla chieftain be francisco villa a old-time bandit who now rejoice in the honorary rank of a colonel villa have appropriate a splendid arab stallion originally import by a spanish horse-breeder with a ranch near chihuahua city general huerta covet this horse and one day after a unusually lively carouse at general headquarters he send a squad of soldier to bring the horse out of villa 's corral to he own stable the old bandit take offense at this and come stalk into headquarters to make a personal remonstrance he be put under arrest and huerta forthwith sentence he to be shoot that same day the sentence be to be put into execution villa be already face the firing squad and the officer in charge have give the command to load when president madero 's brother emilio who be serve on huerta 's staff in a advisory capacity put a stop to the execution by take villa under he personal protection president madero be telegraph to and immediately reply reprieving villa 's sentence and order he to be send to mexico city pend further official investigation this act of interference infuriate huerta for the moment he have to content himself with formulate a long string of serious charge against villa range from military insubordination to burglary highway robbery and rape it be even give out at headquarters that villa have strike he commanding general huerta never forgive the madero brother for they part in this affair and he resentment be fan to white heat subsequently when francisco villa be allow to escape scot-free from he prison in mexico city meanwhile huerta keep telegraph to president madero for more reenforcement of man munitions and supplies more engine more railway train and tank car and above all for more artillery madero keep send they though it cost he government a new loan of forty million dollar every other day or so a new train with fresh supplies arrive at the front at the end of several more week when orozco have slowly retreat half-way through the state of chihuahua and when he find that the destruction of the big seven-span bridge over the concho river at santa rosalium do not permanently stop huerta 's advance he reluctantly decide to make another stand at the deep cut of bachimba just south of chihuahua city this be in July by this time general huerta 's federal column have swell to 7500 fight man 20 piece of field artillery 30 machine gun and some 7500 camp-follower and woman make a total of more than 15000 person of all sex and age who be be carry along on more than twenty railroad train stretch over a dozen mile of single track the column be so long that some of my companion and i when we climb a high hill near the front end of the column at bachimba find it impossible to discern the tail end through we field-glass all the hungry people that be be carry on all those twenty railroad train have to be feed of course so that none of we be surprise to read in the mexican newspaper that the chihuahua campaign be now cost madero 's government nearly 500000 peso per day the battle at bachimba must have swell this budget during this one day 's fight nearly two million rifle cartridge and more than 10000 artillery projectile be fire away by the federal huerta 's twenty piece of field artillery neatly post in a straight line on the open plain barely half a mile away from he ammunition railway train keep firing at the suppose rebel position all day long without any appreciable interruption and all day long the artillery caisson and limber keep trot to and fro between the battery and ammunition car orozco have but 3000 man with two piece of so-called artillery with gun barrel improvise from railroad axle so he once more order a general retreat by way of he railroad train wait at a convenient distance on a bend of the road behind the intervene hill as at rellano at conejo and at other place in the campaign where the railroad sweep in big bend around the hill no attempt be make on the federal side to cut off the rebel ' retreat by short-cut flanking movement of cavalry of which huerta have more than he could conveniently use or choose to use the whole ten hour ' bombardment and rifle fire result in but fourteen dead rebel but it win the campaign for the government and earn for huerta he promotion to major-general besides the proud title of hero of bachimba president madero and he anxious government associate be more than glad to receive the tiding of this decisive victory the only trouble be that it do not decide anything in particular orozco and he follower while evacuate the capital of chihuahua keep on wreck railway property between chihuahua city and juarez and the campaign keep grow more expensive every day it take huerta from July until August to work he slow way from the center of chihuahua to ciudad juarez on the northern frontier before he reach this goal though the rebel have split into many smaller detachment some of which cut he communication in the rear while other harry he flank with guerrilla tactic and threaten to carry the war into the neighboring state of sonora so far as the trouble and expense to the federal government be concern this guerrilla warfare be far worse than the precede slow but sure railway campaign general huerta himself who be threaten with the loss of he eyesight from cataract give up try to pursue the flee rebel detachment in person but keep close to he comfortable headquarters in ciudad juarez and chihuahua city this unsatisfactory condition of affair give promise of endure indefinitely until president madero in mexico city whose government have to bear the financial brunt of it all suddenly lose he patience and recall huerta to the capital leave the command in general rabago 's hand for reason that be never quite fathom by madero 's government huerta take he time about obey these order thus he linger first at ciudad juarez then at chihuahua city then at santa rosalía next at jimenez and presently at torreon where he remain for over a week apparently sulk in he tent like achille this give rise to grave suspicion and rumor fly all over mexico that huerta be about to make common cause with orozco president madero himself at this time tell a friend of mine that he be afraid huerta be go to turn traitor about the same time at a diplomatic reception president madero state openly to ambassador wilson that he have reason to suspect huerta 's loyalty at length however general huerta appear at the capital and after a somewhat chilly interview with the president obtain a suspension from duty so that he might have he eye treat by a specialist thus it happen that huerta who be nearly blind then escape be draw into the sudden military movement that grow out of general felix diaz 's unexpected revolt and temporary capture of the port of vera cruz last October general huerta 's part in felix diaz 's second revolution four month later be almost too recent to have be forget he be the senior ranking general at the capital when the rebellion break out and be summon to he post of duty by president madero from the very first he accompany madero in he celebrated ride from chapultepec castle to the national palace on the morning of the first day of the famous ten day and be put in supreme command of the force of the government after the first hurry council of war president madero totally lack in military professional knowledge as he be confide the entire conduct of the necessary war measure to general huerta but it soon become apparent that the old general either could not or would not direct any energetic offensive movement against the rebel from the very first the government commit the fatal blunder of let the rebel slowly proceed to the citadel -- a fortified military arsenal -- the retention of which be of paramount importance without even attempt to intercept they roundabout march or to frustrate they belated entry into the poorly guard citadel later when it become clear that the rebel could not be dislodge from this stronghold by street rush no attempt be make to shell they out of they strong position by a high-angle bombardment of plunge explosive shell after it be all over general huerta explain the ill-success of he military measure during the ten day ' street-fighting by say that president madero be a madman who have spoil all huerta 's military plan and measure by utterly impracticable counter-order at the time though it be give out officially that huerta have be place in absolute unrestricted command when the american ambassador toward the close of the long bombardment appeal to president madero to remove some federal battery the fire from which threaten the foreign quarter of mexico city president madero reply that he have nothing to do with the military disposition and refer the ambassador to general huerta who promptly accede to the request on another occasion later in the bombardment when madero insist that the federal artillery should use explosive shell against the citadel general huerta do not hesitate to take it upon himself to countermand the president 's suggestion to colonel navarrete the federal chief of artillery afterward general navarrete admit in a speech at a military banquet that he federal artillery could have reduce the citadel in short order have this really be desire whether general huerta be really able to win or not be beside the issue since the final turn of event plainly reveal that he heart be not in the fight and that he be only wait for a favorable moment to turn against madero before general blanquet with he supposed relief column be allow to enter the city general huerta have a private conference with blanquet this conference seal madero 's doom later after blanquet 's force have be admit to the palace on huerta 's assurance to the president that blanquet be loyal to the government it be agree between the two general that blanquet should make sure of the person of the president while huerta would personally capture the president 's brother gustavo with whom he be to dine that day the plot be carry out to the letter when huerta put gustavo madero under arrest still sit at the table where huerta have be he guest huerta seek to palliate he action by claim that gustavo madero have try to poison he by put knock-out drop into huerta 's after-dinner brandy at the same time huerta claim that president madero have try to have he assassinate on the day before by lead huerta to a window in the palace which a instant afterward be shatter by a rifle bullet from outside neither of the two prisoner ever have a chance to defend themselves against these charge for gustavo madero on the night follow he arrest be shoot to death by a squad of soldier in the garden of the citadel and president madero meet a similar fate a few night afterward general huerta who by this time have get himself officially recognize as president give out a official statement from the palace pretend that gustavo madero have lose he life while attempt to escape and that he brother the president have be accidentally shoot by some of he own friend who be try to rescue he from he guard few people in mexico be incline to believe this official version yet the murder of the two madero and of vice-president pino suarez as well as the subsequent killing of other prisoner like governor abraham gonzalez of chihuahua be condone by many in mexico on the ground that these man if allow to remain alive be bind to make serious trouble for the new government it be generally hope at the same time even by those who condemn these murder as barbarous that general huerta might still prove himself a wise and able ruler no matter how severe these fond hope be change to gloomy foreboding only a few week after huerta 's assumption of the presidency when he be see to surround himself with notorious waster of all kind and when he be see to fall into madero 's old error of extend the glad hand to unrepentant rebel and bandit like orozco cheche campo tuerto morale and salgado victoriano huerta whether he be consider as a general or as a president can be express in one phrase : he be a indian huerta himself proudly say that he be a pure-blooded aztec he friend claim for he that he have the virtue of a indian -- courage patience endurance and dignified reserve he enemy on the other hand profess to see in he some of the vice of indian blood from what i have see of general huerta in the field in private life and as a president i would say that he combine in himself both the virtue and the fault of he race in battle i have see he expose himself with a courage worthy of the best indian tradition nor have i ever hear it intimate by any one that he be a coward one of he strong point as a commander be that he be a man of few word on the other hand he own soldier at the front hail he as a stern and cruel leader and some of the thing that be do to he prisoner of war at the front be enough to curdle any one 's blood it be during a moment of conviviality that general huerta once reveal he true sentiment toward the united state and ourselves this be during a banquet give in he honor at mexico city on the eve of he departure to the front in chihuahua on this occasion a englishman who have long be on term of intimacy with huerta ask the general what he would do if northern mexico should secede to the united state and the american should take a hand in the fray this question arouse general huerta to the follow extemporary speech : i be not afraid of the _ gringo _ why should i be no good mexican need be afraid of the _ gringo _ if it have not be for the treachery of president santa anna who sell himself to the united state in 1847 we should have beat the yankee then as we surely shall beat they the next time let they cross the rio bravo we will send they back with bloody head we mexican need not be afraid of any foreign nation do we not beat the spaniard do we not also beat the french and the austrian and the belgian and all the other foreign adventurer who come with maximilian in the same way we would have beat the _ gringo _ have we have a fair chance at they the texan who beat santa anna at san jacinto you must know be not _ gringo _ but brother mexican of whom we have reason to be proud to my mind there be only two real nation in the world besides we old aztec nation those nation be england and japan all the other can not properly be call nation least of all the unite state which be a mere hodge-podge of other nation one of these day england and japan and mexico will get together and after that there will be a end to the united state william carol -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : reproduce in condensed form from _ the world 's work _ by the kind permission of doubleday page & co -rrb- in order to understand the situation in mexico it be necessary to get firmly in we mind that there be in reality two mexico one may be call american mexico and the other mexican mexico the representative of the new half-formed northern or american mexico be francisco madero -- rich educate well mannered honest and idealistically incline the representative of the old mexico be huerta -- rough plain old indian as he describe himself pugnacious crafty ignorant of political amenity without understanding of any rule except the rule of blood and powder by the law of 1894 diaz change the character of the land title in mexico many smaller landowner unable to prove they title under the new system lose they holding which in large measure eventually fall into the hand of a few rich man in the feudal south this do not cause so much disturbance but in the north the grow middle class bitterly resent it madero become the spokesman of this discontent in he book and in he program of reform the plan of san lui potosus he attack the diaz regime and then in 1910 he join the rebel band organize by pascual orozco in the mountain of chihuahua with he weakened army diaz be unable to cope with this revolution and in October 1911 madero become president the country be then at peace except for the band of robber lead by zapa in the province of morelo and guerrero these be and have be the most atrocious of the many bandit with which mexico be infested no outrage or barbarity know to savage have they leave untried madero attempt to buy they off but to no avail he then send military force against they one column command by general huerta but with no success in the mean time pascual orozco who emerge from the madero revolution as a great war hero in he own state be give no post of responsibility under the new government but be leave as commander of the militia in the state of chihuahua the adherent of the old diaz régime take this opportunity to win he over to they side for orozco 's fighting be do purely for profit not for principle a reactionary movement with orozco at its head break out in February 1912 five thousand man be quickly get together the madero administration -- a northern administration in the southern country -- be not fully organize and with the army not yet rehabilitate find itself seriously embarrass have orozco be a intelligent and competent leader he probably could have march straight through to mexico city at that time as the only governmental troops that be available to fight he be only about sixteen hundred which he defeat and nearly annihilate at rellano in chihuahua they commander general gonzalez sala madero 's war minister commit suicide after the defeat the only general available at the time who have have experience in handle large force in the field be victoriano huerta although he have never especially distinguish himself huerta 's record show that he be one of the most progressive member of the army huerta 's column encounter little resistance chihuahua city be occupy on July 7th and later juarez the rebel be not pursue to any extent away from the railroad they separate into band keep up a guerrilla warfare raiding american mining camp and ranch and seize and hold american and other for ransom prominent among these leader of bandit be inez salazar a former rock driller in a american mine who raise a force in chihuahua and declare against madero little be do to destroy these rebel band by the federal and no engagement of any size take place in fact it be a current rumor that the federal do not wish to put they down in the first place the regular army be the same old diaz organization which consider madero largely as a usurper and which remain with the established government in a rather lukewarm manner besides the band of orozco salazar and other be instigate and support by the adherent of the old regime and although oppose to the mexican army both have many idea in common regard the madero administration furthermore the officer and man of the army be receive large increase of pay for the campaign a instance show this disposition on the part of the federal occur in the state of sonora in October 1912 general obregon now the commander of the sonora state force be at that time a colonel of the army and have he battalion compose largely of maya indians at agua prietá just across the border from dougla ariz salazar 's band of rebel have cross the mountain from chihuahua and have come into sonora popular clamor force the federal commander at agua prietá to do something and accordingly he order obregon to take he battalion proceed south get in touch with salazar and remain in observation salazar be looting the ranch of a friend of obregon 's near frontera the rebel have take no means to secure he bivouac against surprise he man be scatter around engage in slaughter cattle cooking and make camp for the night obregon deploy he force and charge salazar 's camp forty of salazar 's man be kill and a machine gun and a number of horse mule and rifle be capture whereupon salazar leave that part of the country upon obregon 's return to agua prietá he be severely reprimand and nearly court-martial for disobey he order in not remain in observation of salazar and attack he instead have obregon be give a free hand he undoubtedly could have destroy salazar 's force after salazar 's defeat at fronteras he move east again and about a month later appear near paloma a town about three mile from the international boundary south of columbus nm at paloma there be a federal detachment of about one hundred and thirty man under a old colonel they have be send there to protect various cattle interest in that vicinity and they have a considerable amount of money equipment and ammunition for maintain and provide ration and forage for themselves and for some outlying detachment salazar hearing of this demand that the money and equipment be immediately surrender upon be refuse salazar with about three hundred and fifty man attack a furious battle be fight end in a house-to-house fight with grenade -- can fill with dynamite with fuse attach which be throw by hand salazar 's force capture the town after the federal have suffer more than 50 per cent in casualty include the federal commander who be wound several time the rebel suffer more than 30 per cent casualty the town in the mean time be wreck this particular instance show that the mexican fight and fight well from a standpoint of physical courage the general idea that the mexican would not fight which american obtain during this period be obtain because they do not care to in the majority of case meanwhile general huerta have finish he chihuahua campaign in the autumn of 1912 be promote to the rank of general of division -lrb- major-general -rrb- and decorate for he achievement it be rumor in many place at that time that general huerta be about to turn against the madero government madero suspect he loyalty order he back to mexico city huerta take he time about obey this order and when he report in mexico city obtain a sick-leave to have he eye treat huerta be nearly blind when felix diaz 's revolt break out in vera cruz in October 1912 and probably thus escape be draw into that unsuccessful demonstration from this time until the _ coup d'etat _ of February 8 1913 there be no large organize resistance to the madero administration although banditism increase at a alarming rate in all part of the republic the diaz-reyes outburst in mexico city on February 8 1913 which result in the death of madero and suarez and the elevation of huerta to practical military dictatorship be bring about by the adherent of the old regime who look upon madero 's extinction as a punishment mete out to a criminal who have raise the slave against they master this view prevail to a considerable extent in mexico south of san lui potosus in the north however the people almost as a whole -lrb- at least 90 per cent in sonera and only to a slightly lesser extent in the other province -rrb- see in it the cold-blooded murder of they political idol at the hand of unscrupulous moneyed interest and of adherent of the old regime of the day of porfirio diaz the resentment be general in the north -- this new largely americanized north venustiano carranza the governor of coahuilum organize the resistance in the province of coahuilum nuevo leon and tamaulipa while maytorena the governor of sonora and pesqueira -lrb- later in washington dc as carranza 's representative -rrb- with obregon as the head of they military force rapidly clear that state of federal with the exception of the port of guayma these fight be no mere bloodless affair but stubbornly contest with heavy casualty as a decide principle be involve in the conflict villa the old bandit and personal enemy of huerta organize a force in sonora and urbina do likewise in northern durango arm and especially money to buy they with be hard to get fund be obtain from the tariff at port of entry internal taxation amounting at time to practical confiscation contribution and gift from various source it be say that the madero family put aside $ 1000000 gold for this purpose though a few individual go over to the constitutionalist cause the mexican regular army remain true to the _ ad interim _ government the revolutionist either hold or rapidly possess themselves of the great railroad line in the majority of case huerta who be a excellent organizer soon appreciate the magnitude of the revolt and rush troops to the north as rapidly as possible he strategy be to hold all railroad line and city with strong column which would force the revolutionist to operate in the interval between the railroad then huerta with these column as a support framework push out mobile column for the destruction of the rebel band the carranzista understand this plan and to meet it tear up all the railroad that they could and adopt as they fix plan never to risk a general engagement of a large force for the first few month the rebel who have adopt the name of constitutionalist continue recruit they force and destroy the railroad the federal try to repair the railroad and get enough troops into the north to cope with this movement they obtain new military equipment of all description the army be increase and old rebel such as orozco and salazar sympathizer or tool of the old régime be take into the federal force as irregular and give command to understand the apparent slowness of the federal in move from place to place and they inability to pursue the rebel away from the railroad some idea must be give as to they system of operate the officer of the regular army be well instruct and quite competent the enlist man however come from the lowest stratum of society and except in the case of a foreign war have to be impress into the rank they bring they woman with they to act as cook and to transport they food and camp equipage military transportation that be to say baggage train of four-mule wagon and excellent horse for the artillery do not exist in the mexican army in fact when away from a railroad the soldadera as the woman be call carry nearly everything and they obtain the food necessary for the soldier ' ration a commissariat as we understand it do not exist this tie the federal to the railroad as they can not carry enough ammunition and food for any length of time on the other hand those who first see obregon 's rebel force in sonora and villa be in chihuahua be surprise at they organization there be no woman take with they they have wagon regular issue of ration and ammunition a paymaster and the man be well mount and arm with obregon also be regiment of yaqui indian who be excellent fight material these force be mobile and could easily operate away from the railroad they lack artillery without which they be greatly handicapped especially in the attack on fortify place and on stone or adobe town as most of the horse and mule be drive away from the railroad the insurgent could get all the animal they want the first large battle occur on may 9-10-11-12th outside of guayma between ojeda 's federal and obregon 's constitutionalist at a place call santa rosa the federal advance north consist of about twelve hundred man and eighteen piece of artillery they be oppose by about four thousand man under obregon without artillery eight hundred federal be kill and all they artillery capture the constitutionalist lose two hundred and fifty man kill and wound comparatively few federal return to guayma each side kill all the wound that they find and also all captive who refuse to enlist in the captor 's force this success be not follow up and guayma remain in the hand of the federal the artillery capture by the constitutionalist have have the breech block remove to render they unserviceable new one however be make in the shop at cananca by a german mechanician name klaus in the summer urbina capture the city of durango annihilate the federal the city be give over to loot and the greatest excess be indulge in by the victor arson rape and the rob of bank store and private house be indiscriminately carry on horse be stable in the parlor of the home of the prosperous citizen and many non-combatant be kill by the soldier before order be restore at this time the only point hold by the federal on the boundary between the united state and mexico be juarez in chihuahua and nuevo laredo in tamaulipa the railroad south of these point be also in the physical possession of the federal but subject to continual interruption at the hand of the constitutionalist venustiano carranza have establish headquarters at ciudad porfirio diaz -lrb- piedras negras -rrb- across the rio grande from eagle pass tex he start on a trip during the late summer through the northern province to confer with the leader of the constitutionalist movement in order to bring about better coordination of effort on they part he go through the state of coahuilum durango chihuahua and sonora and establish a new headquarters in sonora since then the effort of the constitutionalist have be much better coordinate with the result that they have have much better success jesus carranza and pablo gonzalez be leave in charge at ciudad porfirio diaz by venustiano carranza when he leave on he trip shortly after this a federal column be organize under general maa for the capture of the railroad between saltillo and ciudad porfirio diaz this column slowly work its way to monclova and then to ciudad porfirio diaz which it occupy on October 7th the constitutionalist rip up the railroad and destroy everything that might be useful to the federal and a good deal that could not and offer very little resistance villa in the mean time have be reenforce by man from durango and some from sonora have be operate in chihuahua with considerable success he have fall on several small federal column destroy they and obtain about six piece of artillery besides a fresh supply of rifle and ammunition in September he have interpose he force between the federal at chihuahua city and torreon at a place call santa rosalía villa and the federal each have about four thousand man the federal from the south be make a determine attempt to retake durango and have start two column for torreon of more than two thousand man each one west from saltillo another north from zacateca these have to repair the railroad as they go torreon be be hold by about one thousand federal soldier villa be well inform of these movement and also of the fact that in they anxiety to take durango a federal force of about 800 man under general alvirez be to leave torreon before the arrival of the saltillo and zacateca column have the inner line villa with he mobile force could maneuver freely against any one of these he accordingly leave a rear guard in front of the federal at santa rosalía and march south rapidly meet and completely defeat general alvirez 's federal column about eighteen mile west of torreon near the town of avile general alvirez and 287 of he man be kill fight to the last villa then turn toward torreon the soldadera of alvirez 's force have escape when the fight at avile begin and reach torreon quickly spread the news the federal officer in command attempt to round they up but to no avail and torreon 's weak garrison become panic stricken put up a feeble resistance and evacuate the town villa occupy it on the night of October 1st he send he mount troops against the federal column from saltillo and zacateca tear up the railroad around they until they both retreat he maintain splendid order in torreon send a detachment of one officer and twenty-five man to the american consul to protect american interest and station patrol throughout the city with order to shoot all looter at first a few store contain provision and clothing be loot and some spaniard who be suppose to be aid the federal be kill but the pillaging soon stop villa 's occupation of torreon thus contrast strikingly with urbina 's occupation of durango the capture of torreon make precarious the military position of the federal in chihuahua as torreon be they principal supply point when villa 's advance reach santa rosalía the federal evacuate they fortify position at that place and concentrate all available troops at chihuahua city they expect that a decide attempt would be make by villa to take it the federal do succeed in repel small attack against chihuahua on November 6th-9th and to strengthen they garrison they reduce the troops in juarez until only 400 remain villa while keep up the investment of chihuahua city prepare a force for a dash on juarez and on the night of November 14th-15th the federal garrison at that place be completely surprised and the city be capture these be the main event -lrb- to December 1st -rrb- that mark this chapter in the inevitable struggle between the new mexico and the old before the united state by interfere actively in the tumult change the entire character of the war the carranza practice of kill the wound show that even the north have much to learn in civilized method of warfare on the other hand the self-restraint exercise in many case against looting capture town indicate that progress have be make this account also indicate that the new mexico in aim as well as in material thing be get the upper hand the new democracy the force of change dominate america ad 1913 woodrow wilson on march 4 1913 woodrow wilson be inaugurate as president of the united state and thus become the central figure of a new and tremendously important movement he be it be true elect as the candidate of what be know as the democratic party which have exist since the day of thoma jefferson but the idea advance by president wilson as be democratic be so different from the original theory and policy of jefferson that president wilson himself feel call on to formulate he principle in a now celebrated work entitle the new freedom from the opening page of this as originally publish in _ the world 's work _ we here by permission of both the president and the magazine give he own statement of the idea of the new era the voting body of american who stand behind president wilson be obviously of the type now generally call progressive in the convention which nominate he the conservative element of the old democracy struggle long and bitterly against the naming of any progressive candidate in the republican party the strife between conservatism and progress be so bitter as to produce a complete split and the progressive nominate a candidate of they own prefer if they could not control the government themselves to hand it over to the progressive element among the democrat the former political party in the united state seem to have be so completely disrupt by recent event that even though they continue to hold some power under the old name they now stand for wholly different thing the two party which in the triangular presidential contest poll the largest number of vote be both progressive so it seem settle that we be to progress but whither -- and into what be there any clear purpose before we new leader and how do it differ from mankind 's former purpose that be what president wilson try to tell we there be one great basic fact which underlie all the question that be discuss on the political platform at the present moment that singular fact be that nothing be do in this country as it be do twenty year ago we be in the presence of a new organization of society we life have break away from the past the life of america be not the life that it be twenty year ago it be not the life that it be ten year ago we have change we economic condition absolutely from top to bottom and with we economic society the organization of we life the old political formula do not fit the present problem they read now like document take out of a forget age the older cry sound as if they belong to a past age which man have almost forget thing which use to be put into the party platform of ten year ago would sound antiquated if put into a platform now we be face the necessity of fitting a new social organization as we do once fit the old organization to the happiness and prosperity of the great body of citizen for we be conscious that the new order of society have not be make to fit and provide the convenience or prosperity of the average man the life of the nation have grow infinitely vary it do not center now upon question of governmental structure or of the distribution of governmental power it center upon question of the very structure and operation of society itself of which government be only the instrument we development have run so fast and so far along the line sketch in the earlier day of constitutional definition have so cross and interlace those line have pile upon they such novel structure of trust and combination have elaborate within they a life so manifold so full of force which transcend the boundary of the country itself and fill the eye of the world that a new nation seem to have be create which the old formula do not fit or afford a vital interpretation of we have come upon a very different age from any that precede we we have come upon a age when we do not do business in the way in which we use to do business -- when we do not carry on any of the operation of manufacture sale transportation or communication as man use to carry they on there be a sense in which in we day the individual have be submerge in most part of we country man work for themselves not as partner in the old way in which they use to work but as employee -- in a higher or lower grade -- of great corporation there be a time when corporation play a very minor part in we business affair but now they play the chief part and most man be the servant of corporation you know what happen when you be the servant of a corporation you have in no instance access to the man who be really determine the policy of the corporation if the corporation be do the thing that it ought not to do you really have no voice in the matter and must obey the order and you have with deep mortification to cooperate in the do of thing which you know be against the public interest you individuality be swallow up in the individuality and purpose of a great organization it be true that while most man be thus submerge in the corporation a few a very few be exalt to power which as individual they could never have wield through the great organization of which they be the head a few be enable to play a part unprecedented by anything in history in the control of the business operation of the country and in the determination of the happiness of great number of people yesterday and ever since history begin man be relate to one another as individual to be sure there be the family the church and the state institution which associate man in certain limited circle of relationship but in the ordinary concern of life in the ordinary work in the daily round man deal freely and directly with one another to-day the everyday relationship of man be largely with great impersonal concern with organization not with other individual man now this be nothing short of a new social age a new era of human relationship a new stage-setting for the drama of life in this new age we find for instance that we law with regard to the relation of employer and employee be in many respects wholly antiquated and impossible they be frame for another age which nobody now live remember which be indeed so remote from we life that it would be difficult for many of we to understand it if it be describe to we the employer be now generally a corporation or a huge company of some kind the employee be one of hundred or of thousand bring together not by individual master whom they know and with whom they have personal relation but by agent of one sort or another work man be marshal in great number for the performance of a multitude of particular task under a common discipline they generally use dangerous and powerful machinery over whose repair and renewal they have no control new rule must be devise with regard to they obligation and they rights they obligation to they employer and they responsibility to one another new rule must be devise for they protection for they compensation when injure for they support when disabled there be something very new and very big and very complex about these new relation of capital and labor a new economic society have spring up and we must effect a new set of adjustment we must not pit power against weakness the employer be generally in we day as i have say not a individual but a powerful group and yet the work man when deal with he employer be still under we exist law a individual why be it that we have a labor question at all it be for the simple and very sufficient reason that the labor man and the employer be not intimate associate now as they use to be in time past most of we law be form in the age when employer and employee know each other know each other 's character be associate with each other deal with each other as man with man that be no longer the case you not only do not come into personal contact with the man who have the supreme command in those corporation but it would be out of the question for you to do it we modern corporation employ thousand and in some instance hundred of thousand of man the only person whom you see or deal with be local superintendent or local representative of a vast organization which be not like anything that the work man of the time in which we law be frame know anything about a little group of work man see they employer every day deal with he in a personal way be one thing and the modern body of labor engage as employee of the huge enterprise that spread all over the country deal with man of whom they can form no personal conception be another thing a very different thing you never see a corporation any more than you ever see a government many a work man to-day never see the body of man who be conduct the industry in which he be employ and they never see he what they know about he be write in ledger and book and letter in the correspondence of the office in the report of the superintendent he be a long way off from they so what we have to discuss be not wrong which individual intentionally do -- i do not believe there be a great many of those -- but the wrong of the system i want to record my protest against any discussion of this matter which would seem to indicate that there be body of we fellow citizen who be try to grind we down and do we injustice there be some man of that sort i do not know how they sleep o ' night but there be man of that kind thank god they be not numerous the truth be we be all catch in a great economic system which be heartless the modern corporation be not engage in business as a individual when we deal with it we deal with a impersonal element a material piece of society a modern corporation be a means of cooperation in the conduct of a enterprise which be so big that no one can conduct it and which the resource of no one man be sufficient to finance a company be form that company put out a prospectus the promoter expect to raise a certain fund as capital stock well how be they go to raise it they be go to raise it from the public in general some of whom will buy they stock the moment that begin there be form -- what a joint-stock corporation man begin to pool they earnings little pile big pile a certain number of man be elect by the stockholder to be director and these director elect a president this president be the head of the undertaking and the director be its manager now do the work man employ by that stock corporation deal with that president and those director not at all do the public deal with that president and that board of director it do not can anybody bring they to account it be next to impossible to do so if you undertake it you will find it a game of hide and seek with the object of you search take refuge now behind the tree of they individual personality now behind that of they corporate irresponsibility and do we law take note of this curious state of thing do they even attempt to distinguish between a man 's act as a corporation director and as a individual they do not we law still deal with we on the basis of the old system the law be still live in the dead past which we have leave behind this be evident for instance with regard to the matter of employer ' liability for work man 's injury suppose that a superintendent want a workman to use a certain piece of machinery which it be not safe for he to use and that the workman be injure by that piece of machinery we court have hold that the superintendent be a fellow servant or as the law state it a fellow employee and that therefore the man can not recover damages for he injury the superintendent who probably engage the man be not he employer who be he employer and whose negligence could conceivably come in there the board of director do not tell the employee to use that piece of machinery and the president of the corporation do not tell he to use that piece of machinery and so forth do not you see by that theory that a man never can get redress for negligence on the part of the employer when i hear judge reason upon the analogy of the relationship that use to exist between workman and they employer a generation ago i wonder if they have not open they eye to the modern world you know we have a right to expect that judge will have they eye open even though the law which they administer have not awaken yet that be but a single small detail illustrative of the difficulty we be in because we have not adjust the law to the fact of the new order since i enter politics i have chiefly have man 's view confide to I privately some of the biggest man in the united state in the field of commerce and manufacture be afraid of somebody be afraid of something they know that there be a power somewhere so organize so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they have better not speak above they breath when they speak in condemnation of it they know that america be not a place of which it can be say as it use to be that a man may choose he own calling and pursue it just so far as he ability enable he to pursue it because to-day if he enter certain field there be organization which will use means against he that will prevent he build up a business which they do not want to have build up organization that will see to it that the ground be cut from under he and the market shut against he for if he begin to sell to certain retail dealer to any retail dealer the monopoly will refuse to sell to those dealer and those dealer will be afraid and will not buy the new man 's wares and this be the country which have lift to the admiration of the world its ideal of absolutely free opportunity where no man be suppose to be under any limitation except the limitation of he character and of he mind where there be suppose to be no distinction of class no distinction of blood no distinction of social status but where man win or lose on they merit i lay it very close to my own conscience as a public man whether we can any longer stand at we door and welcome all newcomer upon those term american industry be not free as once it be free american enterprise be not free the man with only a little capital be find it harder to get into the field more and more impossible to compete with the big fellow why because the law of this country do not prevent the strong from crush the weak that be the reason and because the strong have crush the weak the strong dominate the industry and the economic life of this country no man can deny that the line of endeavor have more and more narrow and stiffen no man who know anything about the development of industry in this country can have fail to observe that the larger kind of credit be more and more difficult to obtain unless you obtain they upon the term of unite you effort with those who already control the industry of the country and nobody can fail to observe that any man who try to set himself up in competition with any process of manufacture which have be take under the control of large combination of capital will presently find himself either squeeze out or oblige to sell and allow himself to be absorb there be a great deal that need reconstruction in the united state i should like to take a census of the business man -- i mean the rank and file of the business man -- as to whether they think that business condition in this country or rather whether the organization of business in this country be satisfactory or not i know what they would say if they dare if they could vote secretly they would vote overwhelmingly that the present organization of business be mean for the big fellow and be not mean for the little fellow that it be mean for those who be at the top and be mean to exclude those who be at the bottom that it be mean to shut out beginner to prevent new entry in the race to prevent the building up of competitive enterprise that would interfere with the monopoly which the great trust have build up what this country need above everything else be a body of law which will look after the man who be on the make rather than the man who be already make because the man who be already make be not go to live indefinitely and they be not always kind enough to leave son as able and as honest as they be the originative part of america the part of america that make new enterprise the part into which the ambitious and gifted work man make he way up the class that save that plan that organize that presently spread its enterprise until they have a national scope and character -- that middle class be be more and more squeeze out by the process which we have be teach to call process of prosperity its member be share prosperity no doubt but what alarm I be that they be not _ originate _ prosperity no country can afford to have its prosperity originate by a small control class the treasury of america do not lie in the brain of the small body of man now in control of the great enterprise that have be concentrate under the direction of a very small number of person the treasury of america lie in those ambition those energy that can not be restrict to a special favored class it depend upon the invention of unknown man upon the origination of unknown man upon the ambition of unknown man every country be renew out of the rank of the unknown not out of the rank of those already famous and powerful and in control there have come over the land that un-american set of condition which enable a small number of man who control the government to get favor from the government by those favor to exclude they fellow from equal business opportunity by those favor to extend a network of control that will presently drive every industry in the country and so make man forget the ancient time when america lay in every hamlet when america be to be see on every fair valley when america display she great force on the broad prairie run she fine fire of enterprise up over the mountain side and down into the bowels of the earth and eager man be everywhere captain of industry not employee not look to a distant city to find out what they might do but look about among they neighbor find credit accord to they character not accord to they connection find credit in proportion to what be know to be in they and behind they not in proportion to the security they hold that be approve where they be not know in order to start a enterprise now you have to be authenticate in a perfectly impersonal way not accord to yourself but accord to what you own that somebody else approve of you owning you can not begin such a enterprise as those that have make america until you be so authenticate until you have succeed in obtain the good-will of large ally capitalist be that freedom that be dependence not freedom we use to think in the old-fashioned day when life be very simple that all that government have to do be to put on a policeman 's uniform and say now do not anybody hurt anybody else we use to say that the ideal of government be for every man to be leave alone and not interfere with except when he interfere with somebody else and that the best government be the government that do as little govern as possible that be the idea that obtain in jefferson 's time but we be come now to realize that life be so complicated that we be not deal with the old condition and that the law have to step in and create the condition under which we live the condition which will make it tolerable for we to live let I illustrate what i mean : it use to be true in we city that every family occupy a separate house of its own that every family have its own little premise that every family be separate in its life from every other family that be no longer the case in we great city family live in tenement they live in flat they live on floor they be pile layer upon layer in the great tenement house of we crowded district and not only be they pile layer upon layer but they be associate room by room so that there be in every room sometimes in we congested district a separate family in some foreign country they have make much more progress than we in handle these thing in the city of glasgow for example -lrb- glasgow be one of the model city of the world -rrb- they have make up they mind that the entry and the hallway of great tenement be public street therefore the policeman go up the stairway and patrol the corridor the lighting department of the city see to it that the hall be abundantly light the city do not deceive itself into suppose that that great building be a unit from which the police be to keep out and the civic authority to be exclude but it say : these be public highway and light be need in they and control by the authority of the city i liken that to we great modern industrial enterprise a corporation be very like a large tenement house it be not the premise of a single commercial family it be just as much a public affair as a tenement house be a network of public highway when you offer the security of a great corporation to anybody who wish to purchase they you must open that corporation to the inspection of everybody who want to purchase there must to follow out the figure of the tenement house be light along the corridor there must be police patrolling the opening there must be inspection wherever it be know that man may be deceive with regard to the contents of the premise if we believe that fraud lie in wait for we we must have the means of determine whether we suspicion be well found or not similarly the treatment of labor by the great corporation be not what it be in jefferson 's time whenever body of man employ body of man it cease to be a private relationship so that when court hold that work man can not peaceably dissuade other work man from take employment and base the decision upon the analogy of domestic servant they simply show that they mind and understanding be linger in a age which have pass away this dealing of great body of man with other body of man be a matter of public scrutiny and should be a matter of public regulation similarly it be no business of the law in the time of jefferson to come into my house and see how i keep house but when my house when my so-called private property become a great mine and man go along dark corridor amidst every kind of danger in order to dig out of the bowels of the earth thing necessary for the industry of a whole nation and when it come about that no individual own these mine that they be own by great stock company then all the old analogy absolutely collapse and it become the right of the government to go down into these mine to see whether human being be properly treat in they or not to see whether accident be properly safeguard against to see whether modern economical method of use these inestimable riches of the earth be follow or be not follow if somebody put a derrick improperly secure on top of a building or overtop the street then the government of the city have the right to see that that derrick be so secure that you and i can walk under it and not be afraid that the heaven be go to fall on we likewise in these great beehive where in every corridor swarm man of flesh and blood it be the privilege of the government whether of the state or of the united state as the case may be to see that human life be properly care for and that human lung have something to breathe these again be merely illustration of condition we be in a new world struggle under old law as we go inspect we life to-day survey this new scene of centralized and complex society we shall find many more thing out of joint one of the most alarming phenomenon of the time -- or rather it would be alarming if the nation have not awaken to it and show its determination to control it -- one of the most significant sign of the new social era be the degree to which government have become associate with business i speak for the moment of the control over the government exercise by big business behind the whole subject of course be the truth that in the new order government and business must be associate closely but that association be at present of a nature absolutely intolerable the precedence be wrong the association be upside down we government have be for the past few year under the control of head of great ally corporation with special interest it have not control these interest and assign they a proper place in the whole system of business it have submit itself to they control as a result there have grow up vicious system and scheme of governmental favoritism -lrb- the most obvious be the extravagant tariff -rrb- far-reaching in effect upon the whole fabric of life touch to he injury every inhabitant of the land lay unfair and impossible handicap upon competitor impose tax in every direction stifle everywhere the free spirit of american enterprise now this have come about naturally as we go on we shall see how very naturally it be no use denounce anybody or anything except human nature nevertheless it be a intolerable thing that the government of the republic should have get so far out of the hand of the people should have be capture by interest which be special and not general in the train of this capture follow the troops of scandal wrong indecency with which we politics swarm there be city in america of whose government we be ashamed there be city everywhere in every part of the land in which we feel that not the interest of the public but the interest of special privilege of selfish man be serve where contract take precedence over public interest not only in big city be this the case have you not notice the growth of socialistic sentiment in the smaller town not many month ago i stop at a little town in nebraska while my train linger and i meet on the platform a very engaging young fellow dress in overalls who introduce himself to I as the mayor of the town and add that he be a socialist i say what do that mean do that mean that this town be socialistic no sir he say i have not deceive myself the vote by which i be elect be about 20 per cent socialistic and 80 per cent protest it be protest against the treachery to the people and those who lead both the other party of that town all over the union people be come to feel that they have no control over the course of affair i live in one of the greatest state in the union which be at one time in slavery until two year ago we have witness with increase concern the growth in new jersey of a spirit of almost cynical despair man say we vote we be offer the platform we want we elect the man who stand on that platform and we get absolutely nothing so they begin to ask what be the use of voting we know that the machine of both party be subsidize by the same person and therefore it be useless to turn in either direction it be not confine to some of the state government and those of some of the town and city we know that something intervene between the people of the united state and the control of they own affair at washington it be not the people who have be rule there of late why be we in the presence why be we at the threshold of a revolution because we be profoundly disturb by the influence which we see reign in the determination of we public life and we public policy there be a time when america be blithe with self-confidence she boast that she and she alone know the process of popular government but now she see she sky overcast she see that there be at work force which she do not dream of in she hopeful youth do not you know that some man with eloquent tongue without conscience who do not care for the nation could put this whole country into a flame do not you know that this country from one end to another believe that something be wrong what a opportunity it would be for some man without conscience to spring up and say : this be the way follow I -- and lead in path of destruction the old order changeth -- changeth under we very eye not quietly and equably but swiftly and with the noise and heat and tumult of reconstruction i suppose that all struggle for law have be conscious that very little of it have be blind or merely instinctive it be the fashion to say as if with superior knowledge of affair and of human weakness that every age have be a age of transition and that no age be more full of change than another yet in very few age of the world can the struggle for change have be so widespread so deliberate or upon so great a scale as in this in which we be take part the transition we be witness be no equable transition of growth and normal alteration no silent unconscious unfold of one age into another its natural heir and successor society be look itself over in we day from top to bottom be make fresh and critical analysis of its very element be question its oldest practise as freely as its newest scrutinize every arrangement and motive of its life and it stand ready to attempt nothing less than a radical reconstruction which only frank and honest counsel and the force of generous cooperation can hold back from become a revolution we be in a temper to reconstruct economic society as we be once in a temper to reconstruct political society and political society may itself undergo a radical modification in the process i doubt if any age be ever more conscious of its task or more unanimously desirous of radical and extended change in its economic and political practice we stand in the presence of a revolution -- not a bloody revolution america be not give to the spilling of blood -- but a silent revolution whereby america will insist upon recover in practice those ideal which she have always profess upon secure a government devoted to the general interest and not to special interest we be upon the eve of a great reconstruction it call for creative statesmanship as no age have do since that great age in which we set up the government under which we live that government which be the admiration of the world until it suffer wrong to grow up under it which have make many of we own compatriot question the freedom of we institution and preach revolution against they i do not fear revolution i have unshaken faith in the power of america to keep its self-possession revolution will come in peaceful guise as it come when we put aside the crude government of the confederation and create the great federal union which govern individual not state and which have be these one hundred and thirty year we vehicle of progress some radical change we must make in we law and practice some reconstruction we must push forward which a new age and new circumstance impose upon we but we can do it all in calm and sober fashion like statesman and patriot i do not speak of these thing in apprehension because all be open and above-board this be not a day in which great force rally in secret the whole stupendous program must be publicly plan and canvass good temper the wisdom that come of sober counsel the energy of thoughtful and unselfish man the habit of cooperation and of compromise which have be breed in we by long year of free government in which reason rather than passion have be make to prevail by the sheer virtue of candid and universal debate will enable we to win through to still another great age without violence the income tax in america the united state constitution amend ad 1913 joseph a hill during the year 1913 a most amazing event happen the united state amend its constitution by peaceful means indeed the constitution be twice amend for have pass the sixteenth amendment in February permit a income tax the state just to show what they could do when arouse to it pass the seventeenth amendment in may authorize the direct election of united state senator by the people amend the united state constitution be so difficult and cumbrous a proceeding that it have not previously be accomplish for over a century except by the throe of the terrible civil war the original constitution have twelve amendment add to it before it be fully establish in run order in 1804 the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendment be add after 1865 to prohibit slavery they be force upon the unwilling southern state from 1804 to 1913 no amendment be put through by the regular process yet in that time effort to amend be make on over one hundred and forty occasion man have grow discourage at last they say that amendment be impossible the cumbrous system which have thus so long block all change be that congress must by a two-third vote in each house agree to submit a amendment to the state these must then pass upon the new law each in its own legislature if three-fourth of the legislature approve the amendment be to be accept few of the propose change ever win a two-third vote in both congressional house and of those few not one have ever appeal to the necessary overwhelming majority of state legislature the senatorial amendment pass congress several year ago and have long be knock rather hopelessly at legislative door then the income tax amendment appear congress pass it almost hurriedly in a spasm of progressiveness in 1909 then come the great sweep of progressive policy to victory in the election of 1912 and legislature everywhere awake to the universal insistence on the income tax all the state but six approve the amendment and one of the last act of president taft during he administration be to proclaim its adoption the popular amendment sweep along in its train the senatorial change and the latter though still oppose by most of the old south be ratify by all the rest of the state except rhode island and utah so it also become law nothing illustrate better the tyranny of the dead hand in the united state than the history of the income tax the constitution lay it down that no head tax or other direct tax should be impose except by apportion it among the several state on the basis of they population no more effective barrier to any system of direct taxation could possibly have be devise it would seem clear that the main intention of this constitutional provision be not merely to protect the people of the smaller state but to force the united state government to depend for its revenue upon indirect tax such at any rate have be its effect legal ingenuity however can get round anything the supreme court decide as long ago as 1789 that a income tax be not a direct tax and need not therefore be apportion among the state during the civil war though not curiously enough until every other source of taxable wealth have pretty well run dry a income tax be actually impose by three separate act of congress the act of 1864 levy a tax of 5 per cent on all income between $ 600 and $ 5000 and of 10 per cent on all income above $ 5000 the tax continue to be collect up to 1872 when it be repeal the constitutional character of the tax when levy without apportionment among the state of the union be once more fully argue out in the supreme court which in 1880 reaffirm its decision of 1789 that a tax on income be not a direct tax some fifteen year later however the question emerge again and in a crucial form the democrat come into power in 1893 and proceed to reduce the tariff rely upon a tax of 2 per cent on all income of over $ 4000 to make good the expected loss of revenue the supreme court in 1895 shatter all they fiscal plan and policy by pronounce the income tax to be a direct tax and therefore incapable of be levy except in strict proportion to the population of the various state and therefore in effect incapable of be levy at all that decision in all its absurdity have stand ever since its consequence be to deny to the united state government the right to tax income to restrict it still further to custom duty as virtually its sole source of revenue to deprive it of a power that might one day be vital to the safety of the union and to exhibit it in a condition of feebleness that be altogether incompatible with any rational conception of a sovereign state it be true that the supreme court have change not only its _ personnel _ but its spirit and its whole attitude toward question of public policy since 1895 it have more and more allow the influence of the age and the necessity of the time and the clear demand of social and economic justice to moderate its decision and have the question of a income tax be bring before it any time in the last five year it would probably have reverse its judgment of 1895 but president taft be undoubtedly right when he urge in 1909 that the risk of another adverse decision be too great to be run and that the safer course be to proceed by way of a amendment to the constitution the mere passing of the income tax amendment do not however establish a income tax it merely authorize the government to do this at will president wilson 's administration be prompt to take the matter up the democrat in conjunction with they reduction of the tariff need a new source of revenue so in October of 1913 the income tax law be pass in theory a income tax be obviously the most just of all tax it summons each citizen to pay for the government in proportion to he wealth and he wealth mark roughly the amount of government protection that he need in practice however the work out of a income tax be so complex that every grumbler can find in its intricacy some cause of complaint the present tax be therefore describe here by a expert statistician mr joseph a hill the united state government official at the head of the division of revision and result of the census bureau in washington among the notable event of the year 1913 one of the most important in its influence upon the national finances and constitutional development of the united state be the adoption of a amendment to the federal constitution give congress the power to lay and collect tax on income from whatever source derive without apportionment among the several state and without regard to any census or enumeration the mere fact that a amendment of any kind have be adopt be notable this be the first occasion on which the constitution have undergo any change since the period of the civil war and the first amendment adopt in peaceful and normal time since the early day of the republic it be a little remarkable although perhaps not altogether accidental that the adoption of this amendment should coincide with the return to power of the political party whose attempt to levy a income tax in 1894 be frustrate by the decision of the supreme court in that year then as now a income tax be a component part of the program of fiscal and commercial reform to which that party be commit this program include the reduction of protective tariff duty and the direct taxation of income what the democratic party fail to accomplish in 1894 it have have a free hand to do in 1913 indeed the national taxation of income might almost be regard as a mandate of the people of the united state at any rate it be a foregone conclusion that the adoption of the constitutional amendment would be immediately follow by the enactment of a income-tax law the law institute the income tax be approve October 31 -lrb- -rrb- together with the law revise the tariff both measure be include in one comprehensive statute entitle a act to reduce tariff duty and to provide revenue for government and for other purpose it be the object of the present article to give a general description of the income tax this seem to be especially well worth while because the tax can not be readily understand from a mere perusal of the involve and sometimes obscure phraseology of the law itself for the same reason however the task of interpretation be not easy or entirely safe the law have certain novel feature and some of the question of detail to which they give rise can not be answer until we have the official construction place upon the language of the act by the executive branch of the government and possibly by the court at the same time the main feature of the tax become fairly evident to any one who make a careful study of the provision of the act even though its application to specific case may remain doubtful the law provide that income shall be subject to a tax of one per cent on the amount by which they exceed the prescribe minimum limit of exemption this be designate as the normal income tax there be then a additional tax of one per cent on the amount by which any income exceed $ 20000 the rate be increase to two per cent on the amount above $ 50000 to three per cent above $ 75000 to four per cent above $ 100000 to five per cent above $ 250000 and to six per cent above $ 500000 therefore under the normal and additional tax combine the first $ 20000 of income exclusive of the minimum exemption will be tax one per cent the next $ 30000 two per cent the next $ 25000 three per cent the next $ 25000 four per cent the next $ 150000 five per cent the next $ 250000 six per cent and all income above that point seven per cent this be a rigorous application of the progressive principle the minimum exemption at the same time be comparatively high -- $ 4000 for a marry person and $ 3000 for everybody else the higher exemption in case of the marry be conditional upon husband and wife living together and apply only to they aggregate income that be to say it can not be deduct from the income of each it may be note in this connection that in england the exemption allow under the income tax be # 160 or $ 800 in prussium it be 900 mark or $ 225 and in the state of wisconsin it be $ 800 for individual and $ 1200 for a husband and wife with a further allowance for child or dependent member of the family the sharply progressive rate and the comparatively high exemption have give rise to the criticism that this be a rich man 's income tax and disregard the principle that all person should contribute to the expense of the government in proportion to they several ability it be often say that a income tax ought to reach all income with the exception of those which be close to or below the minimum necessary for subsistence and that if people generally be call upon to contribute directly to the government they would take greater interest in public affair and show more concern over any wasteful or unwise expenditure of public money in reply it be contend that the limitation of the tax to the wealthy or well-to-do class be justified because these class do not pay they fair share of the indirect national tax or of local property tax these debatable question lie outside the scope of the present article it be evident however that the income tax should not be criticize as if it be a single tax or form the only source of revenue for the federal government from the fiscal standpoint it occupy a subordinate position in the national finances be expect to yield about $ 125000000 annually out of a total estimated tax revenue of $ 680000000 the normal tax of one per cent be to be levy upon the income of corporation in effect this provision of the law merely continue the corporation or excise tax which be already in existence but that tax now become a integral part of the income tax cover the income which accrue to the stockholder and be distributable in the form of dividend on the theory that this income be reach at the source by the tax upon the net earnings of the corporation the dividend as such be exempt they be not to be include so far as concern the normal tax in the taxable income of the individual stockholder and the law do not provide that the tax pay by the corporation shall be deduct from the dividend it be perhaps a question whether under these condition income which consist of dividend should be consider as subject to the normal tax or as exempt it may be contend that a tax upon the net earnings of corporation be virtually a tax on the stockholder 's income and in theory this be true but so long as the tax be not actually withhold from the dividend or the dividend be not reduce in consequence of the tax the stockholder 's current income be not affect the imposition of the tax might indeed affect he prospective income and might depreciate the value of he stock it be hardly likely however that such effect will be perceptible at least as regard the stock of railroad and other large corporation if however it be consider that income consist of dividend pay the tax it follow that the stockholder 's income be tax no matter how small it may be no minimum be leave exempt on the other hand if it be consider that all dividend be virtually exempt the stockholder would seem to be unduly favor under this form of taxation in comparison with people whose income be derive from other source doubtless in future the investor will look upon dividend as a form of income not subject to the normal income tax in the levy of the normal income tax there be to be a limited application of the method of assessment and collection at the source of the income this method be apply very completely in the taxation of income in great britain it may be well to recall summarily the essential feature of the british system the tax be levy upon the property or industrial enterprise which yield or produce the income but the person occupy the property or conduct the enterprise and pay the assessment in the first instance be authorize and require to deduct the tax from the income as it be distribute among the person entitle to share in it either as proprietor landlord creditor or employee under the english system a industrial corporation for instance pay the income tax upon its gross earnings and then deduct it from the dividend interest salary and rent as these payment be make the householder pay a assessment levy upon the annual value of he dwelling -lrb- less a allowance for repair and insurance -rrb- and then if he occupy the premise as tenant deduct the tax from he rent the income from agriculture be reach by a similar assessment upon the farmer base upon the annual or rental value of the farm and with the same right of deduction from the rent if he be a tenant farmer from the standpoint of the government the main advantage of this mode of assessment as compare with a tax levy directly upon the recipient of the income be the greater certainty with which it reach the income subject to taxation the opportunity for evasion by concealment of income be reduce to a minimum partly because the source of income be in general not easily conceal and partly because to a considerable extent the person upon whom the tax be assess be not interested in avoid the tax the advantage however be not all on the side of the government the tax possess certain advantage from the standpoint of the taxpayer also assume he to be a honest taxpayer who be not seek opportunity to evade taxation one advantage be that he be relieve in almost every case from the necessity of reveal to the tax official the whole of he personal income the tax do not pry into he personal affair another advantage be that the tax be pay out of current income be deduct from the income as it be receive it be therefore distribute over the year and adjust to the flow of income as it come in a tax thus collect be less burdensome in its incidence than a tax pay in one lump sum several month after the expiration of the year to which it related and after the income on which it be levy have be all receive and perhaps all expend the english system of assess a income tax at the source however have its disadvantage it be admirably suit for a tax levy at a uniform rate on all income or on all income above a small minimum but it be not well suit for the application of progressive taxation or for the introduction of gradation or distinction base upon the size or character of the individual income nevertheless the english income tax besides exempt a minimum provide for grade reduction or abatement in favor of the possessor of small income above the minimum and for a reduce rate on unearned income within certain limit all this however make necessary a declaration or complete statement of income from the person claim the benefit of those provision and also necessitate refund a large amount of the tax collect at the source moreover the progressive principle have recently be apply by impose a super-tax on income in excess of # 5000 which also require a declaration the tax be necessarily assess upon the possessor of the income and not at the source the super-tax it may be observe occupy a position in the english system similar to that of the additional tax in the united state serve to increase the tax upon the larger income in accordance with the principle of progression consider the various proviso and exception in connection with the general rule of the act the scope of the application of the method of collect the tax at the source may perhaps be safely state thus : the normal tax be to be deduct -lrb- 1 -rrb- from all interest payment make by corporation on bond and the like without regard to the amount -lrb- 2 -rrb- from all other interest payment when the amount be more than $ 3000 in any one year -lrb- 3 -rrb- from all payment of rent salary or wages amount in any one case to over $ 3000 annually -lrb- 4 -rrb- from all other payment of over $ 3000 -lrb- except dividend -rrb- which may be comprise under the designation premium compensation remuneration emolument or other fix or determinable gain profit or income the principle of assess income at its source as apply in this act do not relieve the individual from the necessity of make a full revelation to the tax official of he personal income from all source though this statement need to be qualify in one or two particulars the law provide in general that every person subject to the tax and have a income of $ 3000 or over shall make a true and accurate return under oath or affirmation setting forth specifically the gross amount of income from all separate source and from the total thereof deduct the aggregate item or expense and allowance authorize by the law although income from which the tax have be withhold be not include in the net personal and taxable income of the taxpayer it must nevertheless be account for and include in he declaration as a part of he gross income form one of the specify item which be to be deduct from the gross income in arrive at the income subject to taxation as already intimate the general requirement of the full and complete statement of income be subject to certain exception one relate to the income from dividend the law provide that person liable to the normal tax only shall not be require to make return of the income derive from dividend on the capital stock or from the net earnings of corporation joint-stock company or association and insurance company taxable upon they net income it will be note that this proviso be restricted to person who be liable for the normal tax only _ ie _ person have net income under $ 20000 it would seem therefore that the taxpayer claim and secure this privilege must in some way without reveal the amount receive from dividend satisfy the tax assessor that he total net income include the dividend -lrb- amount not state -rrb- do not exceed $ 20000 of course a form of statement can easily be devise to cover the situation but whether the law will be administer in such a way that this provision afford some relief from the general obligation of make a detailed and complete statement of income remain to be see another exception to the general requirement of a complete declaration of income cover the case of the taxpayer whose entire income have be assess and the tax on it deduct at the source the law relieve such person from the obligation of make any declaration of income although it be not certain that this privilege can be secure without foregoing or sacrifice the benefit of any abatement to which the individual taxpayer might be entitle on account of business expense interest payment loss etc it seem probable that where the income be all assess at the source the taxpayer may obtain the benefit of the minimum exemption without make a declaration of income it appear therefore that assessment at the source do not under this law operate in such a way as to afford the taxpayer any substantial relief from the necessity of make a revelation of he income to tax official whatever basis there may be for the common criticism or complaint that a income tax be inquisitorial remains under the operation of this law to nearly the same extent that it would if the tax be levy wholly and directly upon the recipient of the income with no resort to taxation at the source regard the assessment of the additional tax not much need be say in the way of explanation it be in theory at least a comparatively simple matter there be no attempt here to make any application of the principle of collection at the source the tax be all levy directly upon the recipient of the individual income and the assessment be base upon the taxpayer 's declaration which for the purpose of this tax must cover the entire net income from all source corporate or otherwise the tax be thus largely distinct from the normal income tax as regard both the method of assessment and the rate it be however to be administer through the same machinery and no doubt to some extent the information obtain as to the source of income in connection with the assessment of the normal tax will prove useful as a check upon the return of income require for assessment of the additional tax every person whose income exceed $ 20000 will be subject to both tax the normal and the additional but presumably will be require to make only one declaration for the purpose of the additional tax he will be require to declare he income from all source and therefore any relief from the obligation of make a complete revelation of income which may be secure to he through the application of the principle of assessment at the source in connection with the normal tax will be entirely sacrifice the administration of a direct personal income tax -- use that term to describe a tax levy directly on individual income -- be a comparatively simple matter however ineffective it may prove to be in reach the income subject to it under this method of taxation it be easy to exempt a minimum to apply progression in the rate or to make any other adjustment that may be deem equitable with reference either to the size or character of the income or to the circumstance of the taxpayer but as soon as we depart from this simple method and resort to taxation at the source we encounter difficulty in vary the rate allow exemption or make any similar adjustment in the english income tax these difficulty be squarely meet and surmount as previously explain that tax be in the first instance levy indiscriminately on all accessible source of income and the adjustment be effect by refund the tax collect at the source so far as may be necessary no provision be make for forestall the deduction of the tax and no return be require of the name and address of person to whom payment of income be make the exemption however be small -lrb- $ 800 -rrb- and the abatement extend only to income below $ 3500 above that point the entire income be taxable a tax which provide for the exemption of $ 3000 or $ 4000 from every individual income place a formidable barrier in the way of a thoroughgoing application of assessment at the source it be evident that with a universal exemption as high as this a very large amount of tax withhold and collect at the source would ultimately have to be refund the law as enact indicate a intention to secure in part the advantage of assessment at the source and at the same time avoid in part the attendant disadvantage of have to refund the tax the measure might be characterize as one which as regard the normal tax apply the principle of assessment at the source to corporate income completely and to other income in spot the additional tax be simply the direct personal tax the normal tax will doubtless be successful in reach the large amount of income earn or create by enterprise conduct under the corporate form of organization much of which would probably escape assessment under a direct personal income tax but beyond this it be questionable whether the method of assessment at the source as here apply will be of sufficient advantage to justify the administrative complication which it involve it seem useless however as well as unwise to venture any prediction as to how successful the tax will be in reach the income subject to it or how well it will work in actual practice the law will doubtless require amendment in many particulars even if it do not need to be radically revise that the income tax in some form will be perpetuate as a permanent part of we system of national finance may safely be predict properly adjust and wisely administer it should greatly strengthen the financial resource of the government make possible a closer adjustment of revenue to expenditure and secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation the second balkan war greece and servium crush the ambition of bulgarium ad 1913 prof stephen p duggan capt ah trapmann the crush defeat of turkey by the balkan state during the winter of 1912-13 have be accomplish mainly by bulgarium the bulgarian be therefore eager to assert themselves as the chief balkan state the power which be to take the place of turkey as ruler of the near east naturally this rouse the antagonism not only of bulgarium 's recent ally greece and servium but also of the other neighboring state roumanium bulgarium hope to meet and crush she two ally before roumanium could join they thus she deliberately precipitate a war which result in she utter defeat from this contest greece have emerge as the chief state of the eastern mediterranean a grow power which at last bear some resemblance to the classic greece of ancient time to understand this war it should be realize that the bulgar be really a asiatic race who break into europe as the hungarian have do before they and as the turk do afterward hence they kinship with european race or manners be really slight though they have something of slavic or russian blood the servian be near akin to the russian the roumanian trace they ancestry proudly if somewhat dubiously back to the old roman colonist of the day of rome 's world empire the greek be really the most ancient dweller in the region and to they pride of race be now add a furious eagerness to prove they military power this have be much scorn after they ineffective war against turkey in 1897 and they have find no opportunity to give decisive proof of they strength during the war of 1912 to professor duggan 's account of the cause and result of the war which appear originally in the _ political science quarterly _ we append the picture of its most striking incident by captain trapmann who be with the greek army through its brief but brilliant campaign prof stephen p duggan when the secret treaty of alliance of march 1912 between bulgarium and servium against turkey be sign a division of the territory that might possibly fall to the ally be agree upon neither bulgarium nor servium have ever publish the treaty in full but from the denunciation and recrimination indulge in by the parliament of both we know in general what the division be to be the river maritza it be hope would become the western boundary of turkey and a line run from a point just east of kumanova to the head of lake ochrida be to divide the conquer territory between servium and bulgarium this would give monastir prilip ochrida and vele to the bulgarian -- a great concession on the part of servia certain other dispute town be to be leave to the arbitrament of the czar of russium the chief aim to be attain by this division be that servium should obtain a seaboard upon the adriatic sea and bulgarium upon the aegean incidentally bulgarium would obtain western thrace and the greater part of macedonium and servium would secure the greater part of albanium these calculation have be entirely upset by the course of event bulgarium 's share have be considerably increase by the unexpected conquest of eastern thrace include adrianople whereas servium 's portion have be greatly diminish by the creation of a independent albanium out of she share moreover m pashitch the servian prime minister maintain that whereas by the preliminary treaty bulgarium be to send detachment to assist the servian army operate in the vardar valley the reverse have be find necessary and adrianople have only be take with the help of 60000 servian and by means of the servian siege gun equity demand that the new condition which have arise and which have entirely alter the situation should be give consideration and that bulgarium should not expect the preliminary agreement to be carry out now from the outbreak of hostility bulgarium 's foreign affair in which king ferdinand be suppose to be supreme be really control by the prime minister dr daneff he prove to be the evil genius of he country for he arrogant unyielding attitude upon every dispute point not only with the enemy but with the ally and with the power destroy all kindly feel for bulgarium and leave she friendless in she hour of need dr daneff 's answer to the servian contention be that bulgarium bear the brunt of the fight that have she not keep the main turkish force occupied servium and greece would have be crush that a treaty be a treaty and that the additional gain of eastern thrace in no way invalidate the old agreement the recrimination between greek and bulgarian be quite as bitter there have be no preliminary agreement as to the division of conquer territory between they and this permit each to indulge in the most extravagant claim the great bone of contention be the possession of the fine port of salonika as soon as the war against turkey break out both state push forward troops to occupy that city the greek arrive first and be still in possession moreover they maintain that except for the jew the population be chiefly greek so be the trade and the school m venezelo the greek prime minister insist also that the erection of a independent albanium deprive greece of a large part of northern epirus as it have deprive servium of a great part of old servium and montenegro of scutarus in fact he assert that bulgarium alone would retain everything she hope for secure nearly three-fifths of the conquer territory and leave only two-fifth to be divide among she three ally and this despite the fact that but for the activity of the greek navy in prevent the convoy of turkey 's best troops from asia bulgarium would never have have she rapid success at the beginning of the war finally he strenuously object to the whole seaboard of macedonium go to bulgarium as the population where it be not moslem be chiefly greek all the party to the dispute make much of ethnical and historical claim -- a thousand year be as a day in they sight the answer of dr daneff to the greek demand be to the effect that greece already have one good port on the mediterranean while bulgarium have none and that bulgarium would have to spend immense sum on either kavalum or dedeagatch to make they of any great value moreover as a result of the war greece would get crete the aegean island and a good slice of the mainland she have suffer least in the war and be really be overpay for she service behind all these formal contention be the conflict ambition and the racial hatred which no discussion could effectually resolve bulgarium be determine to secure the hegemony of the balkan peninsula she believe that she role be that of a balkan prussium and she great victory make she confident of she ability to play the role successfully to this servium would never consent the servian far outnumber the bulgarian be they unite under one scepter they would be the strongest nation in the balkan they policy be to maintain a equilibrium in the peninsula until the hoped-for annexation of bosnium and herzegovina will give they the preponderance this alone would incline servium to make common cause with greece in addition she have the powerful motive of direct self-interest since she do not secure the coveted territory on the adriatic salonika would be more than ever the natural outlet for she product should bulgaria wedge in behind greece at salonika servium would have two power to deal with each of which could pursue the policy of destroy she commerce by a prohibitory tariff a policy so often adopt toward she by austria-hungary m pashitch therefore be determine to have the new southern boundary of servium coterminous with the northern boundary of greece moreover greek and servian be aware of the relative weakness of the bulgarian due to they great loss and to the wide territory occupy by they troops the war party be in the ascendant in each country the servian be anxious to avenge slivnitza and the greek still further to redeem themselves from the reputation of 1897 have peace be sign in January there be little doubt that a greater spirit of conciliation would have prevail the young turk be universally condemn at that time for refuse to yield but have they deliberately adopt abdul hamid 's policy of play off one people against another they could not have succeed better than by they determination to fight even before the fall of adrianople on march 26th military conflict have take place between bulgarian and servian and between bulgarian and greek on march 12th a pitched battle occur between the latter at nigrita and though a mixed commission at once draw up a code of regulation for use in town occupy by joint army not the slightest attention be subsequently pay to it the servian shortly afterward expel the manager of the branch of the national bulgarian bank at monastir a step which draw forth emphatic protest from sofium against the policy of serbize district in anticipation of the final settlement on April 17th m pashitch inform bulgarium that the government would refuse to be bind by the term of the preliminary treaty of march 1912 from that date until the signing of the treaty of peace with turkey on may 31st the recent ally carry on a unofficial war which consist of combat of extermination mark by inhuman rage after that event each of the combatant strain every nerve to push forward its army and to possess new territory while each continue to accuse the other of violate every principle of international law the ambassador of the great power at the capital of the balkan state make urgent representation to the balkan government to restrain they army but without effect on June 10th the servian government dispatch a note to sofia demand a categorical answer to the servian demand for a revision of the preliminary treaty on July 11th the czar telegraph to king peter and king ferdinand appeal to they to avoid a fratricidal war remind they of he position as arbitrator under the preliminary treaty and warn they that he would hold responsible whichever state appeal to force the state which begin war will be responsible before the slav cause this well-meant action have a effect the opposite of that hope for in vienna it be look upon as a indirect assertion of moral guardianship by russium over the slav world the austrian press insist that the balkan state be of age and could take care of themselves if not it be for europe not for russium to control they the political horizon grow still darker when one week later dr daneff answer the servian note in the negative this result in the servian minister withdraw from sofium on June 22d what be the plan of campaign and the degree of preparedness of the principal belligerent in the second balkan war which be about to commence the plan of the bulgarian be the only one whereby they could hope to secure victory it depend for success upon surprize the servian by send mass of bulgarian troops into the home territory of servium by way of the pass lead directly from sofium westward through the mountain this would cut off the servian army operate in macedonium from they base of supplies and require they immediate recall for the defense of the home territory it be a operation attend by almost insurmountable obstacle the major part of the bulgarian army be in eastern thrace and would have to be bring across a country unprovided with either railroad or sufficient highway moreover the army would have to rely for the transport of provision and equipment upon slow-moving bullock wagon nevertheless give time secrecy and freedom from interference the aim might be attain the necessary division of the army be set in motion in the beginning of may so successful be the bulgarian in keep secret the route and the progress of the army that by the middle of June they confidently look forward to success they high hope be destroy by the evil diplomacy of dr daneff in he relation with roumanium russium reward roumanium for she splendid assistance in the russo-turkish war of 1877 by deprive she of she fertile province of bessarabium and compelling she to take in exchange the dobrudja a low marshy district inhabit chiefly by bulgarian and moslem and that be not all through russian influence the commission appoint to delimit the boundary between roumanium and the new principality of bulgarium put the town of silistrium upon the bulgarian side of the boundary now the height of silistrium command absolutely the roumanian territory opposite to it and the dobrudja the danube directly in front of silistrium spread out in a marsh several mile wide so that it be impossible to approach silistrium from the roumanian side by bridge as a result roumanium have always feel that she southern border be at the mercy of bulgarium and have always as one of the chief aim of she national existence look forward to the rectification of she southern boundary the unfriendly attitude of russium throw roumanium into the arm of austrium so that from the day of the berlin treaty to the balkan war roumanium have be consider a true friend of the triple alliance she view with jealousy and fear the rapid growth of bulgarium in power and in strength crowd in between the two military empire of russium and austria-hungary roumanium naturally look upon the development of another military state upon she southern border as a menace to she national existence hence when the macedonian question become very acute in 1903 and it seem that action would be undertake by bulgarium and servium against turkey roumanium have declare that she would not tolerate a alteration of the _ status quo _ she do not move however when the ally undertake the war of liberation in October 1912 but when a month 's campaign change the war from one of liberation to one of conquest roumanium demand from bulgarium as the price of neutrality silistrium and a small slice of the black sea coast sufficient to satisfy strategic military demand it be in he relation with roumanium that daneff 's diplomacy be most stupid m take jonescu one of roumanian ablest statesman be send by the government to the first peace conference at london to secure pledge from dr daneff in regard to the roumanian demand he could get no answer daneff use every device to gain time in the hope that a settlement with turkey would relieve bulgarium from the necessity of give anything when the peace negotiation fail and the war between the ally and turkey recommence the relation between roumanium and bulgarium become very critical however at the czar 's suggestion both country agree to refer the dispute to a conference of the ambassador of the great power at st petersburg dr daneff who represent bulgarium adopt a most truculent attitude and refuse to yield on any point as a result of the skilful diplomacy of the french ambassador m delcassé in reconcile the divergent view of the great power roumanium be award on April 19th the town of silistrium and a three-mile zone around it but be refuse a increase on the seaboard the award be very unpopular in roumanium but m jonescu risk he official life by successfully urge the roumanian government to accept it but when it become perfectly evident after the signing of the treaty of london on may 30th that the former ally be now to be enemy the roumanian government notify bulgarium that she could not rely upon its neutrality without compensation in the interest of the equilibrium of the balkan such be the diplomatic situation when the czar 's telegram of June 11th be receive by king ferdinand nothing could have be more inopportune for the bulgarian cause though the government have no intention of change its plan sufficient deference have to be pay to the czar 's request to suspend the forward movement of troops the delay be fatal the servian who be already aware that the bulgarian be in motion now learn they direction and they actual position the servian government hasten to fortify the pass of the balkan between bulgarium and the home territory and the servian army in macedonium effect a junction with the greek army from salonika there be nothing leave for the bulgarian but to direct they offensive movement against the southern servian division in macedonium the great _ coup _ have fail instead of attack first the servian and then the greek and overwhelming they separately it be necessary to fight they combined force every element in the situation demand the utmost caution on the part of bulgarium elementary prudence dictate that she yield to roumanian demand for a slice of the seaboard to baltchik in order to prevent roumanium from join servium and greece no doubt have daneff yield he would have be vote out of office by the opposition for the military party be in the ascendant at sofia also but a real statesman would not have flinch seldom have the influence of home politics upon the foreign affair of a state operate so disastrously upon both it be determine to carry out that part of the original plan of campaign which call for a surprise attack upon the servian it must be remember that all the engagement that have hitherto take place between the former ally have be unofficial daneff all the while insist that there exist no war but only military action to enforce the serbo-bulgarian treaty nevertheless on June 29th the word go forth from bulgarian headquarters for a general attack upon the servian line which take by surprise yield in the mean time public opinion at bucharest become almost uncontrollable in its demand for the mobilization of the troops and the government be outrage at the continue prohibition by russium of a forward movement the roumanian government have already appeal to count berchtold for austro-hungarian support against russian interference but austria-hungary like every other great power expect bulgarium to win and she intend that bulgarium should take the place vacate by turkey as a counterpoise to russia in the balkan hence count berchtold inform roumanium that she could not rely upon austro-hungarian support be she to ignore the russian veto but in the mean time a exaggerated report of the servian defeat have reach st petersburg on July 1st and to save servium russium lift the embargo on roumanian action forty-eight hour later europe know that the greek have fight the fearful battle of kilchi result in the utter rout of the bulgarian who be in full retreat to defend the balkan pass into they home territory russium at once recall she permission for roumanian mobilization but it be too late the army be on the march the situation of bulgarium be now truly desperate not only have she _ coup _ against the servian fail but she troops be flee before the victorious greek up the struma valley on July 5th war be officially recognize by the withdrawal of the representative of greece montenegro and roumanium from sofium on the same day turkey request the withdrawal of all bulgarian troops east of the enos-midia line in the bloody battle which continue to be fight against greek and servian the bulgarian be nearly everywhere defeat and on July 10th bulgarium place herself unreservedly in the hand of russium with a view to a cessation of hostility this do not however prevent the forward movement of all she enemy on July 15th turkey move by the unnatural war exist in the balkan peninsula dispatch enver bey with a army to adrianople which he reoccupy July 20th by that time the roumanian be within twenty mile of sofium and the gun of the servian and greek could be hear in the bulgarian capital the next day king ferdinand telegraph to king charle of roumanium ask he to intercede with the king of greece servium and montenegro he do so and all the belligerent agree to send peace delegate to bucharest they assemble there on July 29th and at once conclude a armistice each of the belligerent state send its best man to the peace conference greece be represent by m venezelo servia by m pashitch roumanium by m jonescu montenegro by m melanovitch and bulgarium chiefly by general fitcheff who have oppose the surprise attack upon the servian the policy of bulgarium at the conference be to satisfy the demand of roumanium at once sign a separate treaty which would rid she territory of roumanian troops and then treat with greece and servium but m jonescu who control the situation insist that peace must be restore by one treaty not by several at the same time he let it be know that roumanium would not uphold extravagant claim on the part of greece and servium which they could never have advance be she troops not at the gate of sofium the moderate roumanian demand be easily settle she southern boundary be to run from turtukaus via dobritch to baltchik on the black sea she also secure cultural privilege for the kutzovlach in bulgarium the servian who before the second balkan war would have be satisfy with the vardar river as a boundary now insist upon the possession of the important town of kotchana ishtib radovishta and strumnitza to the east of the vardar with the assistance of roumanium bulgarium be permit to retain strumnitza the greek be the most unyielding before the war they would have be perfectly satisfy to have secure the struma river as they eastern boundary now they demand much more of the aegean seacoast include the important port of kavala the bulgarian representative refuse to sign without the possession of kavalum but under pressure from roumanium they have to consent but they would yield on nothing else the money indemnity demand by greece and servium and the all-around grant of religious privilege suggest by roumanium have to be drop the treaty be sign August 6 1913 in the mean time the power have not be passive onlooker austria-hungary insist that balkan affair be european affair and that the treaty of bucharest should be consider as merely provisional to be make definitive by the great power on this proposition the member of both the triple alliance and the triple entente divide austrium and italy in the one and russium in the other favor a revision austrium fear a strong servium and italy dislike the growth of greek influence in the eastern mediterranean these two state and russium favor a whittling-down of the gain of greece and servium and insist upon kavalum and a bigger slice of the aegean seaboard for bulgarium but france england and germany insist upon let well-enough alone king charle of roumanium who demand that the peace should be consider definitive send a telegram to emperor william contain the follow sentence : peace be assure and thanks to you will remain definitive this give great umbrage at vienna but in the divide condition of the european concert no state want to act alone so the treaty stand the condition of bulgarium be indeed pitiable but she cup be not yet full immediately after occupy adrianople on July 20th the turk have make advance to the bulgarian government look to the settlement of a new boundary but bulgarium rely upon the intervention of the power have refuse to treat at all on August 7th the representative of the great power at constantinople call collectively upon the porte to demand that it respect the treaty of london but the porte have see europe so frequently flout by the little balkan state during the previous year that it have slight respect for europe as a collective entity in fact europe 's prestige at constantinople have disappear _ j' y suis j' y reste _ be the answer of the turk to the demand to evacuate adrianople the recapture of that city have be a godsend to the young turk party the treaty of london have destroy what little influence it have retain after the defeat of the army and it grasp at the seizure of adrianople as a means of awaken enthusiasm and keep office as the day pass by it become evident that further delay would cost bulgarium dear on August 15th the turkish troops cross the maritza river and occupied western thrace though the porte have hitherto be willing to accept the maritza as the boundary the bulgarian hope of a european intervention begin to fade the turk be soon able to convince the bulgarian government that most of the great power be willing to acquiesce in the retention of adrianople by the turk in return for economic and political concession to themselves there be nothing for bulgarium to do but yield and on September 3d general savoff and m tontcheff start for constantinople to treat with the turkish government for a new boundary line they plead for the maritza as the boundary between the two state the possession of the west bank be essential for railway connection between bulgarium and dedeagatch she only port on the aegean but this plea come in conflict with the determination of the turk to keep a sufficient strategic area around adrianople hence the turk demand and secure a considerable district on the west bank include the important town of dimotika by the preliminary agreement sign on September 18th the boundary start at the mouth of the maritza river go up the river to mandra then west around dimotika almost to mustafa pasha on the north the line start at svetus stefan and run west so that kirk kilesseh be retain by turkey while the balkan belligerent be settle upon term of peace among themselves the conference of ambassador at london be try to bring the settlement of the albanian problem to a conclusion on August 11th the conference agree that a international commission of control consist of a representative of each of the great power should administer the affair of albanium until the power should select a prince as ruler of the autonomous state the conference also decide to establish a _ gendarmerie _ under the command of military officer select from one of the small neutral state of europe at the same time the conference agree upon the southern boundary of albanium this line be a compromise between that demand by greece and that demand by austria-hungary and italy unfortunately it be agree that the international boundary commission which be to be appoint should in draw the line be guide mainly by the nationality of the inhabitant of the district through which it would pass at once greek and albanian begin a campaign of nationalization in the dispute territory which result in sanguinary conflict unrest soon spread throughout the whole of albanium on August 17th a committee of malissorus chief visit admiral burney who be in command at scutarus of the marine from the international fleet to notify he that the malissorus would never agree to incorporation in montenegro they proceed to make good they threat by capture the important town of dibra and drive the servian from the neighborhood of djakova and prizrend since then the greater part of northern and southern albanium have be practically in a state of anarchy the settlement of the balkan describe in this article will probably last for at least a generation not because all the party to the settlement be content but because it will take at least a generation for the dissatisfied state to recuperate bulgarium be in far worse condition than she be before the war with turkey the second balkan war cause by she policy of greed and arrogance destroy 100000 of the flower of she manhood lose she all of macedonium and eastern thrace and increase she expense enormously she total gain whether from turkey or from she former ally be but eighty mile of seaboard on the aegean with a thracian hinterland wofully depopulate even railway communication with she one new port of dedeagatch have be deny she bulgarium be in despair but full of hate however with a reduce population and a bankrupt treasury she will need many year to recuperate before she can hope to upset the new arrangement and it will be hard even to attempt that for the _ status quo _ be found upon the principle of a balance of power in the balkan peninsula and roumanium have definitely announce herself as a balkan power servium and more particularly greece have make acquisition beyond they wildest dream at the beginning of the war and have now become strong adherent of the policy of equilibrium the future of the turk be in asia and turkey in asia just now be in a most unhappy condition syrium armenia and arabium be demand autonomy and the former respect of the other moslem for the govern race _ ie _ the turk have receive a severe blow whether turkey can pull itself together consolidate its resource and develop the immense possibility of its asiatic possession remain of course to be see but it will have no power and probably no desire to upset the new arrangement in the balkan the settlement be probably a landmark in balkan history in that it bring to a close the period of tutelage exercise by the great power over the christian state of the balkan neither austria-hungary nor russium emerge from the ordeal with prestige the pan-slavic idea have receive a distinct rebuff to roumanium and greece another non-slavic state _ ie _ albanium have be add and in no part of the peninsula be russium so detest as in bulgarium which unreasonably protest that russium betray she call we hun turk or tatar but not slav twice the austro-hungarian in they anxiety to maintain the balance of power in the balkan make the mistake of back the wrong combatant in the first war they uphold turkey and in the second they favor bulgarium in encouraging bulgarian aggression they estrange roumanium the faithful friend of a generation and bulgarium win only debt and disgrace yet austria-hungary must now continue to support bulgarium as a counterpoise to a stronger servium which they consider a menace to they security because of servian influence on they southern slav the balkan state will manage they own affair in the future but they will still offer abundant opportunity for the play of russian and austro-hungarian rivalry it have be hope that the balkan peninsula when free from the incubus of turkish misrule would settle down to a period of general tranquillity instead of this the ejectment of the turk have result in increase bitterness and more dangerous hate capt albert h trapmann i doubt if history can show a more brilliant or dramatic campaign than that which the greek commence on the first of July and end on the last day of the same month certainly no country have ever be drench with so much blood in so short a space of time as be macedonium and never in the history of the human race have such enormity be commit upon the helpless civilian inhabitant of a war-stricken land bulgarium feel herself amply strong enough to crush the servian and greek army single-handed provide peace with turkey could be assure and the bulgarian troops at tchataldja set free thus while bulgarium talk loudly about the conference at st petersburg she be make feverish haste to persuade the ally to join with she in conclude peace with turkey but the ally be quite alive to the danger they run as peace with turkey become daily more assure the bulgarian army at tchataldja be gradually withdraw and transport to face the greek and servian army in macedonium but meanwhile bulgarium have get one more preparation to make she plan be to attack the ally suddenly but to do it in such a way that the czar and europe might believe that the attack be mutual and unpremeditated she therefore set herself to accustom the world to frontier incident between the rival army on no fewer than four occasion various bulgarian general act under secret instruction attack the greek or servian troops in they vicinity the last of these incident which be by far the most serious take place on the 24th of may in the pangheion region when the sudden attack at sunset of 25000 bulgarian drive the greek defender back some six mile upon they support on each occasion the bulgarian government disclaim all responsibility and attribute the bloodsh to the personal initiative of individual soldier act under -lrb- imaginary -rrb- provocation the incident of the 24th of may cost the bulgarian some 1500 casualty while the greek lose about 800 man sixteen of whom be prisoner two of these subsequently die from ill-treatment in connection with this last incident a circumstance arise which demonstrate more vividly than mere adjective the underhand method employ by the sofia authority it be announce that the bulgarian have capture six greek gun and these be duly display at sofium and inspect by king ferdinand i myself be at salonica at the time and know that this be not true i protest through the _ daily telegraph _ against the misleading rumor a controversy arise but it be subsequently prove by two artillery expert who inspect the gun in question that they be really bulgarian gun paint gray with they telltale breech-block remove on the morning of the 29th of June we at salonica receive the news that during the night bulgarian troops in force have attack the greek outpost in the pangheion region and drive they in all through the day come in fresh news of further attack all along the line at guevghelus where the greek and servian army meet the bulgarian have attack fiercely occupy the town and cut the railway line the two army be separate from each other by a interpose bulgarian force on the morning of the 30th of June it be learn that all along the line the bulgarian have cross the neutral line and be advance while at nigrita they have drive back a greek detachment and press some fifteen mile southward thus threatening entirely to cut off the greek troops remain in the pangheion district the situation be critical and demand prompt attention king constantine be away at athen but he send he instruction by wireless and hasten hotfoot back to salonica to place himself at the head of the army at noon general hessaptchieff -lrb- brother-in-law of m daneff -rrb- the bulgarian plenipotentiary accredit to greek army headquarters drive to the station and with he staff leave by the last train for bulgarian headquarters at serre order be immediately give for all bulgarian troops to be confine to barracks and the cretan gendarmerie duly arrest any find about the street gradually as the afternoon wear on the civilian element retire behind closed door and shutter window all shop be shut and picket of greek soldiery be alone to be see in the desert street at 430 pm the bulgarian battalion commander be invite to surrender the arm of he man when they would be convey in two special train to serre or anywhere else they like he be give a hour to decide owe to the intervention of the french consul the time limit be extend but the offer be refuse and at 650 pm on the 30th of June the greek apply force around every house occupy by bulgarian soldiery greek troops have be introduce into neighbor house machine gun have be install on rooftop company of infantry be picket at street corner suddenly throughout the town all this hell be let loose the street give back the echo a thousandfold the crackle of musketry and din of machine gun be positively infernal as evening come and darken into night one after another of the bulgarian fort chabrol surrender sometimes persuade thereto by the deadly effect of a field-gun at thirty yard ' range but the sun have rise ere the chief stronghold contain five hundred bulgarian give up the hopeless struggle by nine o'clock the bulgarian garrison of salonica deprive of its arm be safely stow in the hold of greek ship bind for crete the casualty list be as follow : bulgarian -- prisoner : 11 officer 1241 man 11 man wound 51 man kill comitadji 4 wound 11 kill greek : 11 soldier kill 4 cretan gendarme kill 4 officer wound 6 soldier wound while 6 bulgarian officer who have desert they man and escape in woman 's clothing be not capture until later in the day all the morning of the 1st of July the greek troops be busy round up bulgarian comitadji and collect hidden explosive but at 4 pm the second division march out of the town king constantine who have arrive in the small hour of the morning have give the order for a general advance of he army greek patience be expend and no wonder meanwhile let we consider the bulgarian intention as reveal by the capture dispatch-box of the general command the 3d bulgarian division which contain document likely to become historic on the 28th of June the bulgarian divisional commander receive order from the commander-in-chief to undertake a general attack upon the ally on the 2d of July unfortunately for the bulgarian general ivanoff commanding-in-chief against the greek could not restrain he impatience and instead of wait for a sudden and general attack on the 2d of July he troops attack piecemeal during the night of the 29th and 30th of June as describe thus the greek general forward movement on the 1st and 2d of July find the bulk of he troops unprepared while the 14th bulgarian division schedule to arrive at kilki on the 2d of July from tchataldja be not available during that day to oppose the greek initiative though they save the situation on the 3d of July by detrain partly at kilki and partly at doiran the two weak point of the ally be at guevghelus and in the pangheion region and it be precisely at these point that the bulgarian strike as regard number on the 2d of July the respective force number : bulgarian 80000 greek 60000 on the 3d of July -lrb- not deduct loss -rrb- -- bulgarian 115000 greek 80000 in both case the troops on line of communication be not reckon with these probably amount to -- bulgarian 25000 greek 12000 almost immediately and at all point the opposing army come into contact the bulgarian gunner have very carefully take all range on the ground over which the greek have to advance and at first they shrapnel fire be extremely damage the greek however do not wait to fight the battle out accord to the usual rule of warfare -- by endeavor to silence the enemy 's artillery before launch they infantry forward phenomenal rapidity characterize the greek tactic from the moment they troops first come under fire they artillery immediately sweep into action and ply the bulgarian battery with shell and shrapnel the while greek infantry deploy into line of attack and push forward at kilkis so rapid be the advance of the greek infantry that the bulgarian gunner could hardly alter they range sufficiently fast and every time that the greek infantry have make good five hundred yard the greek artillery would gallop forward and come into action on a new alinement it be a run fight by leap and bound the incredible _ élan _ of the greek troops drive the bulgarian back toward kilki itself which position have be heavily entrench by 4 pm on the 2d of July the greek main army be within three mile of the town while the 10th division help by two battalion of servian infantry gradually fight its way up the vardar toward guevghelus at 430 pm -lrb- at kilki -rrb- the bulgarian deliver a furious counter-attack in which some 20000 bayonet take part but it be repulse with heavy slaughter and the weary greek soldier who have fight they way over twenty mile of disputed country roll over on they side and sleep toward guevghelus the evzone battalion have for two hour to advance through waist-deep marsh under a heavy artillery fire but they struggle along through muddy water sing they own melancholy song and without pay the least attention to the heavy loss they be sustain on the 3d of July the greek reoccupy guevghelus and toward evening the bulgarian trench at kilki be take at the bayonet 's point the town be entirely destroy partly by greek shell fire -lrb- for the bulgarian battery have be locate in the street -rrb- and partly by the bulgarian who fire the town as they retire on the 3d and 4th the bulgarian retire sullenly northward toward doiran contest every yard and put in the unit of the 14th division as quickly as they could be detrain but the greek never flag for one moment in the pursuit the 10th and 3d division march at tremendous speed come up on the left menace the line of retreat on strumnitza it be in the pass ten mile south of this town that remnant of the bulgarian 3d and 14th division make they last stand upon the 8th of July throughout the week they have be fight and retreat incessantly have lose at least 10000 in kill and wound some 4500 prisoner and about forty gun while the greek lose about 4500 and 5000 man in front of kilki and another 3000 between doiran and strumnitza meanwhile at lakhana a equally sanguinary two day ' conflict have be in progress the greek attack and finally capture the bulgarian entrenched position time after time they charge fail to reach but eventually they persistent courage and inimitable _ élan _ win home and the bulgarian flee in utter rout and panic leave everything even many of they uniform behind they king constantine speaking in germany recently attribute the success of the greek army to the courage of he man the excellence of the artillery and to the soundness of the strategy but i think he overlook the chief factor that make for victory -- the unspeakable horror loathing and rage arouse by the atrocity commit upon the greek wounded whenever a temporary local reverse leave a few of the gallant fellow at the mercy of the bulgarian i have see a officer and a dozen man who have have they eye put out and they ear tongue and nose cut off upon the field of battle during the lull between two greek charge and there be other worse but nameless barbarity both upon the wound and the dead who for a brief moment fall into bulgarian hand this be during the very first day of the war later when the news of the wholesale massacre of greek peaceable inhabitant at nigrita serre drama doxat etc become know to the army it raise a spirit which no pen can describe the man see red they be drunk with lust for honorable revenge from which nothing but death could stop they wound mortal wound be unheed so long as the man still have strength to stagger on i have see a sergeant with a great fragment of common shell through he lung run forward for several hundred yard vomit blood but still encourage he man who truth to tell be as eager as he it be impossible to describe or even conceive the purposeful and ache desire to get to close quarter regardless of all loss and of all consequence the bulgarian in commit those obscene atrocity not only damned themselves forever in the eye of humanity but they double nay quadruple the strength of the greek army nothing short of extermination could have prevent the greek army from victory there be not a man who would not have a million time rather die than have hesitate for a moment to go forward the day of those first battle be steam hot with a pitiless macedonian sun the greek troops be in far too high a state of spiritual excitation to require food even if food have be able to keep pace with they lightning advance all that the man want all they ever ask for be water and ammunition and here the greatest self-sacrifice of all to the cause be frequently see for a wounded man unable to struggle forward another yard would as he fall to the ground hastily unbuckle water-bottle and cartridge-case and hand they to a advance comrade with a cheery word go on and good luck my lad and then as often as not he would lay he down to die with parched lip and cleave tongue i be myself at the press and personal invitation of king constantine the first to visit nigrita where the bulgarian general before leave have the inhabitant lock into they house and then with guncotton and petroleum burn the place to the ground here 470 victim be burn alive mostly old folk woman and child serre drama kilki and demir hissar -lrb- all important town -rrb- have similar tale to tell only the death-roll be longer small wonder that these story of ferocity be not give credence for they be incredible and it be only when one study the bulgarian character that one can understand how such orgy of carnage be possible the scope of this article do not permit I to describe in detail the minor battle and operation between the 6th of July and the 25th of July suffice it to say that the rapidity of the greek advance upon strumnitza and up the valley of the struma force the bulgarian to beat in full retreat toward they frontier leave behind they all that impede they flight military store gun cart and even uniform strew the line of they march and they be only save from annihilation because the mountain which guard they flank be impassable for the greek artillery by blow up the bridge over the struma the impetuosity of the greek pursuit be delay and it be in the kresna pass that the bulgarian rear-guard first turn at bay the pass be a twenty-mile gorge cut through mountain 7000 foot high but the greek turn the bulgarian position by march across the mountain and it be near semitlus five mile north of the pass that the bulgarian offer they last serious resistance it be a wonderful battle the greek at the urgent request of the servian general staff have detail two division to help the servian on the west bank of the struma they push the 2d and 4th division gently northward while in the narrow struma valley -lrb- it be little better than a gorge in most place -rrb- they have the 1st division on the main road with the 5th behind it in reserve on the right perch on the summit of well-nigh inaccessible mountain be the greek 6th division with the 7th division on its right somewhat draw back it come to the knowledge of greek headquarters that the bulgarian contemplate a attack upon mehomium a village six mile on the extreme right and rear of the 7th division only hold by a small detachment of that division reenforcement be immediately dispatch to relieve the pressure and the 6th division be call upon to reenforce the position of the 7th during the absence of the relief column with the result that on the 25th of July the 6th division only have some 6000 man available meanwhile the bulgarian have secretly transfer the 40000 man of they 1st division from face the servian at kustendil to djumaia 20000 of these be send in a column to strike at the junction of the greek and servian army where they be hold by the 3d and 10th greek division after a bloody battle which last three day 5000 march on mehomium and be annihilate by the greek 7th division the remain 15000 reenforce the troops face the greek 6th division it be a most dramatic fight on the 25th of July the greek unconscious of the bulgarian reenforcement push northward and all day long they 1st 5th and 6th division gradually drive the enemy in front of they the fighting be of the most desperate nature and at one moment the ammunition on both side have give out the troops pelt each other with fragment of rock at last toward 5 pm the greek 6th division find the enemy in front of they retire they push onward fight for every yard the man be dead-weary they have sleep for day upon bleak and waterless mountain summit -- frozen at night they be grilled at noon but they push ever onward at last when victory seem within they grasp when they foe be see to run a general advance be order the man spring forward with a last effort of physical endurance -- the bulgar be run they give chase suddenly in one solid wall 15000 entirely new bulgarian troops of the 1st division rise as if from the ground and deliver a counter-attack it be a crucial moment : some 4000 greek chase a similar number of bulgarian suddenly have to face 15000 new troops the impact be terrible the greek line break up into fragment around which the bulgarian cluster and peck like vulture at a feast for ten minute it be anybody 's battle the remnant of each greek company form itself into a ring and defend itself as best it could these ring gradually grow smaller as bullet and bayonet claim they victim many of they be wipe out altogether and when the battle be over it be possible to find the place where these company have make they last stand for there be not a single survivor -- the wound be kill by the victor but the victory be short-lived true the right of the 6th division have crumple up but a regiment of the 1st division come up at the critical moment and stiffen up the left and center and again the tide of battle sway irresolute then ten minute later perhaps a regiment from the 5th division come up at the double on the right rear of the bulgarian take they in reverse and enfilade the bulgarian right and center crumple like a rotten egg while they left fall hastily back the bulgar have throw they last hazard and have lose the carnage be appalling on both side the greek 6th division have commence the day with about 6000 man at sunset barely 2000 remain opposite the greek position nearly 10000 bulgarian be bury next day which speak well for the fight power of the greek when he be make he last stand the holocaust of wounded beggar description but that eminent french painter george scott tell I a incident which come to he own notice he be ride up to the front the day after semitlus and be just emerge from the awesome kresna pass when he and he companion come upon a greek dress station the narrow space between cliff and river be entirely occupy by some hundred of greek wound some of they already dead many die and other faint they be lie about await they turn for the surgeon 's knife in the center stand the surgeon with the sleeve of he operating-coat turn up he arm red to the elbow in blood all about he blood-stained bandage and wad of cotton-wool they rein in they horse and survey the scene as one patient be be remove from the packing-case that serve as operating-table the surgeon raise he weary eye and see they the only unwounded man in all that vast and silent gathering you be newspaper correspondent he ask well tell I tell I when this butchery will cease for seventy-two hour i have be ply my knife and look at those who have yet to come -- he sweep the circle of wound with a outstretched bloody hand o god if you know how to write write to you papers and tell europe she must stop this gruesome war then tire out and enervate he swoon into the arm of the medical orderly as he come to to be apologize that he say be the third time i have faint i suppose i must waste precious time in eat something to sustain I the battle of semitlus be fight almost contemporaneously with that of the 3d and 10th greek division on the extreme greek left flank which latter action result in a bulgarian repulse after a temporary success and these be the last great battle of the shortest and bloodiest campaign on record on the 29th and 30th of July there be some skirmish three mile south of djumaium on the 31st of July the armistice be concede during the month of July the greek army have practically wipe out the 1st 3d 4th and 14th bulgarian division some 160000 strong they have march 200 mile over terrible mountain they have take 12000 prisoner 120 gun and have cheerfully sustained 27000 casualty out of a total number of 120000 troops engage it be difficult to do justice to such a exploit within the scope of a single article the privation suffer by the troops they uncomplaining endurance the fight with cholera the appalling atrocity perpetrate by the bulgarian upon those who fall within they power furnish matter for a monumental volume opening of the panama canal ad 1914 col geo w goethal bampfylde fuller as be tell in a previous volume the united state acquire possession of the panama canal territory in 1903 actual work on the canal be begin by american in 1905 with the prediction that the canal would be finish in ten year 1915 the engineer have be better than they word the difficulty with mexico render the canal suddenly useful to the united state and colonel goethal report that he would have the big ditch ready for the passage of any war-ship by may 15 1914 that promise he carry out the canal be still in danger of be block by slide of mud in the deep culebra cut and probably will continue expose to this difficulty for some year to come but the work be practically complete ship pass through the canal under government order in 1914 the greatest engineering work man ever attempt the profoundest change he have ever make in the geographical face of the globe have be successfully accomplish honor where honor be due the man chiefly responsible for the success of this great work have be colonel goethal we quote here by he special permission a portion of one of he official report on the canal we then show the work as other see we by give a account of the canal and the impression it have make on other nation write by one of the most distinguish of its recent british visitor the hon bampfylde fuller col geo w goethal we army a canal connect the atlantic and pacific ocean have occupy public attention for upward of four century during which period various route have be propose each have certain special or peculiar advantage it be not until the nineteenth century however that any definite action be take look toward its accomplishment in 1876 a organization be perfect in france for make survey and collect datum on which to base the construction of a canal across the isthmus of panama and in 1878 a concession for prosecute the work be secure from the colombian government in may 1879 a international congress be convene under the auspices of ferdinand de lessep to consider the question of the best location and plan of the canal this congress after a two week ' session decide in favor of the panama route and of a sea-level canal without lock de lessep 's success with the suez canal make he a strong advocate of the sea-level type and he opinion have considerable influence in the final decision immediately follow this action the panama canal company be organize under the general law of france with ferdinand de lessep as its president the concession grant in 1878 by colombium be purchase by the company and the stock be successfully float in December 1880 the two year follow be devote largely to survey examination and preliminary work in the first plan adopt the canal be to be 295 foot deep with a ruling bottom width of 72 foot leave colon the canal pass through low ground to the valley of the chagre river at gatun a distance of about 6 mile thence through this valley for 21 mile to obispo where leave the river it cross the continental divide at culebra by means of a tunnel and reach the pacific through the valley of the rio grande the difference in the tide of the two ocean 9 inch in either direction from the mean in the atlantic and from 9 to 11 foot from the same datum in the pacific be to be overcome and the final current reduce by a proper sloping of the bottom of the pacific portion of the canal no provision be make for the control of the chagre river in the early eighty after a study of the flow due to the tidal difference a tidal lock near the pacific be provide various scheme be also propose for the control of the chagre the most prominent be the construction of a dam at gamboa the dam as propose afterward prove to be impracticable and this problem remain for the time be unsolved the tunnel through the divide be also abandon in favor of a open cut work be prosecute on the sea-level canal until 1887 when a change to the lock type be make in order to secure the use of the canal for navigation as soon as possible it be agree at that time that the change in plan do not contemplate abandonment of the sea-level canal which be ultimately to be secure but merely its postponement for the time be in this new plan the summit level be place above the flood line of the chagre river to be supply with water from that stream by pump work be push forward until 1889 when the company go into bankruptcy and on February 4th that year a liquidator be appoint to take charge of its affair work be suspend on may 15 1889 the new panama canal company be organize in October 1894 when work be again resume on the plan recommend by a commission of engineer this plan contemplate a sea-level canal from limon bay to bohio where a dam across the valley create a lake extend to bas obispo the difference in level be overcome by two lock the summit level extend from bas obispo to paraiso reach by two more lock and be supply with water by a feeder from a artificial reservoir create by a dam at alhajuelum in the upper chagre valley four lock be locate on the pacific side the two middle one at pedro miguel combine in a flight a second or alternative plan be propose at the same time by which the summit level be to be a lake form by the bohio dam feed directly by the chagre work be continue on this plan until the rights and property of the new company be purchase by the united state the united state not unmindful of the advantage of a isthmian canal have from time to time make investigation and survey of the various route with a view to government ownership and control congress direct a investigation of the nicaraguan canal for which a concession have be grant to a private company the result report bring about such a discussion of the advantage of the panama route to the nicaraguan route that by a act of congress approve march 3 1889 a commission be appoint to make full and complete investigation of the isthmus of panama with a view to the construction of a canal the commission report on November 16 1901 in favor of panama and recommend the lock type of canal by act of congress approve June 28 1902 the president of the united state be authorize to acquire at a cost not exceed $ 40000000 the property rights of the new panama canal company on the isthmus of panama and also to secure from the republic of colombium perpetual control of a strip of land not less than 6 mile wide extend from the caribbean sea to the pacific ocean and the right to excavate construct and to perpetually maintain operate and protect thereon a canal of such depth and capacity as will afford convenient passage of ship of the greatest tonnage and draft now in use pursuant to the legislation negotiation be enter into with colombium and with the new panama canal company with the end that a treaty be make with the republic of panama grant to the united state control of a 10-mile strip constitute the canal zone with the right to construct maintain and operate a canal this treaty be ratify by the republic of panama on December 2 1903 and by the united state on February 23 1904 the formal transfer of the property of the new panama canal company on the isthmus be make on may 4 1904 after which the united state begin the organization of a force for the construction of the lock type of canal in the mean time continue the excavation by utilize the french material and equipment and such labor as be procurable on the isthmus president roosevelt in a message to congress dated February 19 1906 state : the law now on we statute-book seem to contemplate a lock canal in my judgment a lock canal as herein recommend be advisable if the congress direct that a sea-level canal be construct its direction will of course be carry out otherwise the canal will be build on substantially the plan for a lock canal outline in the accompany papers such change be make of course as may be find actually necessary include possibly the change recommend by the secretary of war as to the site of the dam on the pacific side on June 29 1906 congress provide that a lock type of canal be construct across the isthmus of panama of the general type propose by the minority of the board of consult engineer and work have continue along these line the board of consult engineer estimate the cost of the lock type of canal at $ 139705200 and of the sea-level canal at $ 247021000 exclude the cost of sanitation civil government the purchase price and interest on the investment these sum be for construction purpose only i venture a guess that the construction of the lock type of canal would approach $ 300000000 and without stop to consider that the same cause which lead to a increase in cost over the original estimate for the lock canal must affect equally the sea-level type the advocate of the latter argue that the excess of the new estimate be a additional reason why the lock type should be abandon in favor of the sea-level canal the estimate cost by the present commission for complete the adopt project exclude the item let out by the board of consult engineer be place at $ 297766000 if to this be add the estimate cost of sanitation and civil government until the completion of the work and the $ 50000000 purchase price the total cost to the united state of the lock type of canal will amount to $ 375201000 in the preparation of these estimate there be no unknown factor the estimate cost of the sea-level canal for construction alone sum up to $ 477601000 and if to this be add the cost of sanitation and civil government up to the time of the completion of the canal which will be at least six year later than the lock canal and the purchase price the total cost to the united state will aggregate $ 563000000 in this case however part of the estimate be more or less conjectural -- such as the cost of divert the chagre to permit the building of the gamboa dam and the cost of construct the dam itself much criticism have result because of the excess of the present estimate over those originally propose arise largely from a failure to analyze the two estimate or to appreciate fully the actual condition the estimate prepare and accompany the report of the consulting engineer be base on datum less complete than be available at present the unit cost in the report of 1906 be identical with those in the report of 1901 and since 1906 there have be a increase in the wage scale and in the cost of material on the isthmus wages exceed those in the united state from 40 to 80 per cent for the same class of labor the original estimate be base on a ten-hour day but congress impose the eight-hour day subsequent survey and the various change already note have increase the quantity of work by 50 per cent whereas the unit cost have increase only 20 per cent -- not such a bad showing in addition municipal improvement in panama and colon advance to the panama railroad and money receive and deposit to the credit of miscellaneous receipt aggregate $ 15000000 which amount will eventually and have in part already be return to the treasury finally no such system of housing and caring for employee be ever contemplate as have be introduce and install materially increase the overhead charge and administration the idea of the sea-level canal appeal to the popular mind which picture a open ditch offer free and unobstructed navigation from sea to sea but no such substitute be offer for the present lock canal as between the sea-level and the lock canal the latter can be construct in less time at less cost will give easier and safer navigation and in addition secure such a control of the chagre river as to make a friend and aid of what remain a enemy and menace in the sea-level type in this connection attention be invite to the statement make by mr taft when secretary of war in he letter transmit the report of the board of consult engineer : we may well concede that if we could have a sea-level canal with a prism of 300 to 400 foot wide with the curve that must now exist reduce it would be preferable to the plan of the minority but the time and cost of construct such a canal be in effect prohibitive we be justly proud of the organization for the prosecution of the work the force originally organize by mr john f steven for the attack upon the continental divide have be modify and enlarged as the necessity of the situation require until at the present time it approach the perfection of a huge machine and all be work together to a common end the manner in which the work be be do and the spirit of enthusiasm that be manifest by all forcibly strike every one who visit the work the main object of we be there be the construction of the canal everything else be subordinate to it and the work of every department be direct to the accomplishment of that object too much credit can not be give to the department of sanitation which in conjunction with the division of municipal engineering have work such a change in the condition as they exist in 1904 as to make the construction of the canal possible this department be subdivide into the health department which have charge of the hospital supervision of health matter in panama and colon and of the quarantine and into the sanitary inspection department which look after the destruction of the mosquito by various method by grass and brush cut the drain of various swampy area and the oiling of unavoidable pool and stagnant stream accord to the statistics of the health department base on the death-rate the canal zone be one of the healthiest community in the world but in this connection it must be remember that we population consist of man and woman in the prime of life with few if any of the aged and that a number of the sick be return to the united state before death overtake they bampfylde fuller the panama canal stand out as one of the most noteworthy contribution that the teutonic race have make toward the material improvement of the world so regard it englishman and german may take some pride to themselves from this great achievement of the american the teutonic race have its limitation it be deficient in the gaiety of mind the expansiveness of heart which add so largely to human happiness its bent have lie in direction that be superficially at all event less attractive but by its cult of cleanliness self-control and efficiency it have give a new meaning to civilization it have invent puritanism the gospel of the day 's work and the water-closet these reflection may not seem very apposite to the subject of the canal but they will suggest themselves to one who arrive in panama after travel through the latin state of south america it be however by some sacrifice of moral sense that the united state gain control of the isthmus they offer a financial deal to the republic of colombium : the term be liberal and the colombian government have in principle no objection to make money by the grant of a perpetual lease of so much land as be need for the canal but it haggle unreasonably over the detail with the object of delay business until the period of the french concession have expire so that it might secure not only its own share of the compensation but the share that be to be pay to the french investor whose rights and achievement be take over by the united state a revolution occur : the province of panama declare its independence of colombium and at once complete the bargain the revolution be so exceedingly opportune in the interest of the united state and of the french concessionaire that it be impossible not to suspect its instigation in these interest beyond a doubt the united state assist the revolutionary : they prevent the colombian force from attack they panama be originally independent of colombium and have be badly treat by the colombian government which in its distant capital of bogota be out of touch with panamanian interest and return to the province but a very small share of its tax but however this may be we may take it without strain fact that the united state be unable to bring colombium to term evict she in favor of a more pliable authority this be not in accord with christian morality nor be political dealings generally and from a practical point of view it be preposterous that the cupidity of some colombian politician should stand in the way of a improvement in geography the agreement with the newly bear republic of panama give the united state a perpetual lease of a strip of land ten mile broad across the isthmus this be style the canal zone the latin town of panama and colon fall within its limit but they be expressly exclude from the united state jurisdiction in substance the canal work consist first of a enormous dam -lrb- at gatun -rrb- which hold up the water of the river chagre so as to flood a valley twenty-four mile long secondly of a channel -- nine mile in length -- -lrb- the culebra cut -rrb- -- which carry the valley on through a range of low hill and thirdly of a set of lock at each end of this stretch of water that be connect by comparatively short approach with the sea the surface of the lake will be from 79 to 85 foot above sea-level and vessel will be raise to this height and lower again by pass through a flight of three lock upward and another flight of three lock downward the passage of both flight of lock be not expect to occupy more than three hour and ship should complete the transit of the isthmus -- a distance of about fifty mile -- within twelve hour at most the design of the work offer nothing that be new in principle to engineering science dam cutting and lock be familiar contrivance but they be on a immensely larger scale than anything which have previously be attempt the area of the lake of impound water will be 164 square mile and it have be doubt whether the damming of so large a mass of water to a height of 85 foot could safely be undertake but this portion of central america be apparently not liable to earthquake and the dam be so large as to be a feature of the earth 's surface it be nearly half a mile broad across its base so that although its crest be 105 foot above sea-level its slope be not very perceptible its core be form of a mixture of sand and clay pour in from above by hydraulic process this have set hard and be believe to be quite impervious to water at a much higher pressure than that to which it will be subject in the center of the river valley -- a mile and a half broad -- across which the dam have be fling there very fortunately arise a low rocky hill this be include in the dam and across its summit have be construct the escape or spill-way during season of heavy rain the surplus discharge of river water will be very heavy and a cataract will pour over the spill-way but it will rush across a bed of rock and will be unable to erode its channel and it will be employ to generate electrical power which will open and shut the lock-gate and generally operate the canal machinery the river chagre will energize the canal as well as fill it the lock be gigantic construction of concrete standing within they one be impressed as by the mass of the pyramid the gate be hollow structure of steel 7 foot thick they lower portion be water-tight so that they buoyancy in the water will relieve the stress upon the bearing which hinge they to the lock-wall along the top of each lock-wall there run a electric railway four small electric locomotive will be couple to a vessel as it enter the lock approach and will tow it to its place the vessel will not use its own steam this will lessen the risk of its get out of hand and ram the lock-gate a accident which have occur on the big lock that connect lake superior with lake huron so catastrophic would be such a mishap release as it might this immense accumulation of water that it seem desirable at whatever expense to provide additional safeguard against it there be in the first place cross-chain tighten under pressure which may be draw across the bow of a ship that threaten to become unmanageable secondly the lock-gate be double at the entrance to all the lock and at the lower end of the upper lock in each flight and thirdly each flight of lock can be cut off from the lake by a emergency dam of peculiar construction it be essentially a skeleton gate which ordinarily lie uplift along the top of the lock-wall but can be swing across lowered and gradually close against the water by let down panel in its ordinary position it lie high above the masonry -- conspicuous from some distance out at sea as a large cantilever bridge swing in air peculiar difficulty have be encounter in establish the foundation of the lock the lowest of each flight be plant in deep morass and could only be settle by remove vast mass of estuary slime to a depth of 80 foot below sea-level the sea be cut off and a dredger introduce which gradually clear its way down to the bottom rock but the trouble which the american engineer will remember be those which have present themselves in the culebra cut the channel be nine mile long its average depth be between 100 and 200 foot but at one point it reach 490 foot the formation of the ground vary extraordinarily at some point it be rock at other rock give place to contorted layer of brilliantly color earth which be almost as restless as quicksand unfortunately it be at place where the cutting be deepest that its bank be most unstable the side of the lowest 40 foot of the excavation -- the actual water channel -- be cut vertically and not to a slope in a firm formation this reduce the amount of excavation but in loose material it must apparently have increase the risk of slide but however this may be slip on a gigantic scale be inevitable the cutting be a endeavor to form precipitous slope of crumble material under a tropical rain-fall : it may be liken to molding in brown sugar under the rose of a watering-pot the bank have be in a state of constant movement and be break up into irregular shelf and chasm so that at some point the channel resemble a natural ravine rather than a artificial cut one thing be certain -- that for some year to come the channel will only be keep open by constant assiduous dredging but it be of course easier to dredge out of water than to excavate in the dry the material excavate from the culebra channel will aggregate nearly one hundred million cubic yard some of it have be utilize in reclaim land much have be carry out to sea and heap into a break-water three mile long which run out from the panama or southern end of the canal and will check a coast-ways current that might if uncontrolled silt up the approach the canal be a triumph not of man 's hand but of machinery regiment of steam shovel attack the bank exhibit a grotesque appearance of animal intelligence in they behavior a iron grabber be lower by a crane it pause as if to examine the ground before it in search of a good bite open a pair of enormous jaw take a grab and swing round empty its mouthful onto a railway truck the material be loosen for the shovel by blast of dynamite and all the day through the air be shake by explosion alongside each row of shovel stand a train in wait over a hundred and fifty train run seaward each day load with spoil the bed of the canal be ribbon with railway track which be shift as require by special track-lifting machine the masonry work of the lock be lay without hand high latticed tower -- grind mill and crane combine -- overhang the wall that be be build up they take up stone and cement by the truck-load mix they and grind they -- in fact digest they -- and swing the concrete out in cage gently and accurately deposit it between the molding board how sharp be the contrast between this elaborate steam machinery and the hand-labor of the _ fellahín _ who patiently dig out the suez canal but there be so to speak edge to be trim : this mass of machinery be to be guide and control and there be work to employ a staff of over thirty thousand man some four thousand of they be american who form a superior service style gold employee in order to avoid racial implication they salary be calculate in american dollar the remainder class as silver employee be pay in panama dollar the value of which be half that of the american two series of coin be current one be double the value of the other and since the corresponding coin of the two series be of about the same size newcomer be harass by constant suspicion of they small change the silver employee number about twenty-six thousand some of they be immigrant from europe -- mostly from italy and the north of spain -- but the great majority be negro british subject from jamaica and trinidad it be foresee that if negro from the southern state be employ the high wages rate might unsettle the american cotton labor market : so it be decide to recruit from british colony and it be not too much to say that so far as the canal be hand-made it be mainly the work of british labor several hundred of hindu have find they way here they be chiefly employ upon the fortification because it be say they be unlikely to talk about they these british color laborer with they family constitute the bulk of the population of the canal zone : the town of panama swarm with they and one see few of any other class in the street of colon the american engineer have thus be work with a staff that can claim the protection of the british minister and it be please to a englishman to hear on every side the heartiest tribute to the energy tact and good sense of england 's representative sir claude mallet at the outset the negro laborer be exceedingly suspicious of the american authority and be ready to strike on the smallest provocation : they have refuse to take they ration until sir claude have taste they he possess the complete confidence of the british labor force and indeed the hindu immigrant who deposit money at the consulate will hardly wait to obtain receipt for it speak of ration it may be mention that the canal authority undertake to feed all they employee and a large commissariat establishment include extensive cold-storage depot at colon be one of the most prominent feature of they administration every morning a heavy trainload of provision leave colon drop its freight as it pass the various labor settlement in numerous eating-house meal be provide at very moderate charge and at panama and colon large up-to-date hotel be maintain by the american government these be use very extensively by the canal staff and give periodic dance which be crowd with young people the vagary of the one-step be sternly bar by a puritan committee and to one who expect surprise the style of dancing be disappointingly monotonous but these hotel be also of great use in conciliate the american taxpayer tourist come by thousand and elaborate arrangement be make for they education by special sight-seeing train by appreciative guide and by course of lecture the canal staff be also house by the state -- in wooden structure build upon pile and protect by mosquito-proof wire screen the accommodation for bachelor be somewhat meager but married couple be treat very liberally and they quarter be brighten by pretty little garden the rate of pay be high and there be numerous concession which to one of indian experience appear exceedingly generous but the expenditure throughout be on a lavish scale : the canal will not cost much less than eighty million pound the money that be draw from the american taxpayer be however for the most part return to they practically the whole of the machinery be of american manufacture the food be american the store that be sell in the shop be mainly american and the only money that be lose to the state be that which be save by the foreign laborer very few of these have any intention of remain under the american flag or will indeed be permit to remain residence within the canal zone apart from the town of panama and colon be only to be permit to the permanent work staff of the canal and to the military force in occupation it should be add that the salary of the american gold employee liberal though they may appear do not tempt they to remain in service one be astonish to learn that nearly half the american staff change annually : young man come to acquire a little experience and save a little money which may help they to a start in they own country service on the canal work lead to no pension and the medal which be to be grant to all who remain two year in employ be but moderately attractive to man whose object be severely practical the chief control authority be all in the military service of the state in the northern state of america the british love of cleanliness have become a gospel of life and the sanitation of the canal zone be a model of scientific and successful thoroughness to india it be also a model of hopeless generosity nearly three million pound have be spend in improve the health condition of this small area the agreement which reserve the town of panama and colon to the administration of the republic of panama provide for american interference in matter that may concern general health and the canal authority have take the fullest advantage of this provision the street of both town have be pave insanitary dwelling have be ruthlessly demolish water-works have be provide by loan of american money the water rate be collect by american official the meanest house be equip with a water-closet and a shower-bath panama and colon be now model of cleanliness and from they appearance might belong to a north american state efficiency be the watchword and in cleanse these town the american health officer have not trouble themselves with the compromise which would temper the despotism of british official american can hardly be imagine as stretch they conscience by such a concession as that for instance which in british indium exempt gentleman of position from appearance in the civil court efficiency be not popular with those who do not practice it and the latin race of southern and central america have no love for they northern neighbor the american like the german would increase they popularity do they appreciate the value of personal geniality in smooth government within the canal zone the jungle have be cut back from the proximity of dwelling-houses surface water whether stagnant or run be regularly sterilize by dose of larvicide all inhabit building be protect by mosquito-proof screening and in some place a mosquito-catching staff be maintain at the time of my visit not a mosquito be to be see but this be during the season of dry heat during the rainy month mosquito be it seem still far from uncommon and the latest sanitary rule emphasize the importance of systematically catch they medical experience have show that if house be keep clear of mosquito there be very little fever even in place where the water pool and channel be leave unsterilized wire screening supplement by a butterfly net be the great preventive but we can not attain the good without a admixture of evil : behind the wire screen the indoor atmosphere become very oppressive yellow fever the scourge of the isthmus in former day have be completely eradicate admission to hospital for malarial fever amount it must be confess to several thousand a year but judge from the terrible experience of the french company be it not for these precaution fever would incapacitate for long period the whole of the staff the hospital a heritage from the french be a village of wooden building set upon a hill overlook the gulf of panama in the midst of a charming study in tropical gardening it be manage with a energy which explore to the uttermost the medical experience of other tropical country and be not afraid of improve upon time-honored method the daily dose of quinine be seldom less than forty-five grain and patient be not allow to leave they bed until they temperature have remain normal for five day at least complaint of deafness be disregard if the patient turn of a blue color he may be console by a dose of epsom salt it be claim that by this drastic treatment the relapse be prevent which in indium and elsewhere probably account for at least nine attack out of ten democracy be not always fortunate in the selection of they executive but mr roosevelt 's government be gifted with the wit to find in the united state army man who could carry out this big work and with the good sense to employ they so much be tell of the commanding influence of colonel goethal the chief in command of the administrative talent of colonel gorga the head of the sanitary department of the engineering skill of colonel sibert the protagonist of the gatun dam that a englishman must wish to claim kinship with these american officer who be make so large a mark upon the surface of the earth devotion to the great work in hand have exorcise meaner feeling and you will hear little of the boost which we be tempt to associate with the other side of the atlantic i ask colonel sibert whether he initial calculation have need much correction as the operation develop we _ guess _ he reply have be remarkably fortunate the medical staff relate with delight how a british doctor send by the indian government to study they method be leave to himself for half a hour succeed in catch quite a number of mosquito of a very noxious kind within the mosquito-proof precinct of a hospital ward new york be now divide from san francisco by 13135 mile of sea travel the canal will reduce this distance by 7873 mile and will bring new york 6250 mile nearer callao and 3747 mile nearer valparaiso the pacific ocean include so large a extent of the curvature of the earth that the effect of the canal in develop trade route with asia will depend very greatly upon they direction across it vessel from new york which after pass the canal trend northward or southward upon the great circle will find that the panama route will be much shorter than that _ via _ suez they will save 3281 mile on the distance to yokohama and 2822 mile on the distance to melbourne but if they course lie along the equator the panama canal will not curtail they journey very materially it be surprising to find that manila will be only forty-one mile nearer new york _ via _ panama than it be _ via _ suez and the saving on a journey to hong kong will be no more than 245 mile in trading with peru chile australium north china and japan the merchant of new york will gain very materially by the opening of the canal they will gain moreover by the withdrawal of the advantage which english merchant now enjoy in trading with new zealand australium north china and japan _ via _ the suez canal at present london be nearer to these place than new york be by 1000 mile or more the canal will not only withdraw this advantage : it will give new york a positive advantage in distance of 2000 to 3000 mile it be more than doubtful however whether the canal would ever have be construct in the sole interest of commerce its chief value to the united state be strategical it will mobilize they fleet and enable they to concentrate it upon either they eastern or they western coastline the canal will primarily be a instrument against war but like much else in this world it will incidentally bestow multifarious advantage the importance of fortify it be manifest it would appear that the lock at either end be open to naval bombardment indeed those at gatun be clearly visible from the sea fortification be be construct at both entrance and it be probable that the canal zone will be garrison by
