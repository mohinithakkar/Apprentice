do i do it with this introduction i will now state what i be about to do mademoiselle mortontus will seat herself on a stage in a chair in full view of you all i will cover she for a moment only with a silken veil this if i be a real necromancer i should say be to prevent you see she dissolve into a spirit as she disappear but to tell you the truth it be to conceal the manner in which i do the trick you would guess that anyhow if i do not tell you he add there be a good-natured laugh at this admission as soon as i remove the silken veil go on joe you will see that the lady will have disappear before you very eye what be that through a hole in the stage do some one say question joe appear to catch a protest voice well that be what i hear everywhere i go he go on with easy calmness every time i do the vanish lady trick some one think she disappear through a hole in the stage now in order to convince you to the contrary i be go to put a newspaper over that part of the stage where the chair be place i will show you the paper before and after the trick and if there be not a hole or a tear in the paper either before or after the lady have disappear i think you will admit that the lady do not go through a hole in the stage floor will not you ask joe strong yes i think you would he add as he pretend to hear a yes from somewhere in the audience all ready now helen he say in a low voice to the girl and a attendant bring forward a ordinary look chair and a newspaper joe who have do the trick many time before but not often with helen be perfectly at ease helen be very frankly nervous she have not do the trick for some time and joe have introduce into it some novel feature since last present it helen be afraid she would cause some hitch in the performance you 'll be all right joe say to she in a low voice just act as though you have do this every day for a year place the chair in the center of the stage and hand joe the newspaper the attendant step back joe address the audience you here see the paper say the magician as he hold it up you see that there be no hole in it i 'll now spread it down on the stage if the lady disappear down through the stage she will have to tear the paper you shall see if she do joe next place the chair directly over the square of paper and motion to helen she plain black dress of soft cling silk sway about she as she take she place i might add say joe pause a moment after helen have take she seat that in order to prevent any shock to mademoiselle mortontus i be go to mesmerize she she will then be unconscious i do this for two reason in totally disappear there be sometimes a shock to a person 's mentality that be unpleasant to avoid indict that on mademoiselle mortontus i will hypnotize she the other reason i do that be that she may not know how or when she disappear thus she will not be able to see how i do the trick and so can not give away my secret of course this be all bunk or patter to use name give to it by the performer it keep the attention of the audience and so enable joe to do certain thing without attract too much attention to they as a matter of fact he do not mesmerize helen and she know perfectly well how the trick be do those who have read previous book of this series be also in the secret joe wave he hand in front of helen 's face she sway slightly in she chair then she eye close as though against she will and she seem to sleep she be now in the proper condition for the trick say joe i must beg of you not to make any sudden or unnecessary noise you might suddenly awaken she from the mesmeric slumber and this might be very serious as joe say this with every indication of mean it there be a quick hush among the audience even though many know it be only a trick they could not help be impress by the solemn note in joe 's voice such be the psychology of a audience and the power over it of a single person she now sleep say joe in a low voice as a matter of fact helen be wide awake and as joe stand between she and the circus crowd she slowly open one eye and wink at he he be glad to see this as it show she nervousness have leave she now for the mystic veil cry joe as he take from he helper a thin cling piece of black silk gauze he toss this over helen and the chair completely cover both from sight he bring the veil around behind helen 's head fasten it there with a pin to make sure that mademoiselle mortontus sleep i will now make the few remain mesmeric pass say joe i must be positive that she slumber he wave he hand slowly over the black robed figure a great hush have fall over the big crowd every eye be on the black figure in the center of the raise stage in the middle of the big circus tent all the other act have temporarily stop to make that of joe strong the boy magician more spectacular as joe continue to wave one hand with a undulating motion over the silent black-covered figure in the chair he touch here and there the drapery over helen he seem very solicitous that it should hang perfectly right cover the figure of the girl and the chair completely from sight in every direction all around the stage the music which have be play softly suddenly stop at a wave of joe 's hand he stand for a moment motionless before the veil figure she spirit be dissolve into thin air he say in a low voice which nevertheless carry to every one in the crowd suddenly joe take hold of the veil in the center and directly over the outline head of the figure in the chair quickly the young magician raise the soft black silk gauze whisk it quickly to one side the audience gasp the chair in which but a moment before helen morton have be seat be empty the girl have disappear -- vanish joe stoop and raise from the stage the newspaper it show not a sign of break or tear then before the applause could begin the girl appear walk out from one of the improvise wing of the circus stage she smile and bow the act have be a great success now the silent admiration of the throng give place to a wave of hand clapping and foot stamp be it all right joe ask helen as he hold she hand and they both bow they appreciation of the applause could not have be better he say we 'll do this trick regularly now it take even better than my ten thousand dollar box mystery you be great i be so glad the two performer be bow themselves off the stage when suddenly there come the unmistakable roar of a wild beast from the direction of the animal tent it seem to shake the very ground at the same time a voice cry : a tiger be loose one of the tiger be out of he cage chapter ii a dangerous swing there be no cry which so startle the average circus audience as that which be raise when one of the wild animal be say to be at large not even the alarm that the big tent be fall or be about to be blow over will cause such a panic as the shout : a tiger be loose there be something instinctive and perfectly natural in the fear of the wild jungle beast let it be say that a tiger or a lion be loose and it cause greater fear even than when it be state that a elephant be on a rampage a elephant seem a big but good-natured creature though often they turn ugly but a lion or a tiger be always fear when loose but the chance be not one in a hundred that a circus lion or a tiger get out of its cage would attack any one the creature be so surprised at get loose and so frightened at the hue and cry at once raise that all it want to do be to slink off and hide and the only harm it might do would be to some one who try to stop it from run away joe strong jim tracy and the other circus executive and employee know this as soon as they hear the cry : a tiger be loose who raise the cry and which of the several tiger in the sampson show be out of its cage neither joe nor any of those in the big tent near he know but they realize the emergency and know what to do keep you seat do not rush cry joe as he release helen 's hand and hurry to the front of the platform there be no danger the animal man will catch the tiger if one be really loose stay where you be keep you seat do not rush it be the panic and rush that circus man be afraid of -- the push and milling of the crowd and the trample under foot of helpless woman and child there be some commotion near the junction of the animal tent and that in which the main performance take place what it be joe do not concern himself about just then he feel it to be he task to prevent a panic and to this he lend himself aid by helen jim tracy and other who realize the danger and while this be go on and while the

put several spoke in bill 's wheel when you turn the laugh on he that time say jim tracy i do not believe he 'll ever show up around we circus again but they little know bill carfax those who have

explanation in the previous volume helen morton receive much applause at the conclusion of she act with she trick horse rosebud joe strong 's promise wife be a accomplished bareback rider as well as one of she fiancé 's helper in he mystery trick well i be glad to-day be over say helen to joe that night as they go to the train that be to take they to the next city where the circus performance would be give what with do the vanish lady act for the first time in a long while and the tiger get loose we have have quite a bit of excitement yes agree joe but everything come out all right i be go to put on a new stunt next week what be that ask helen something in the mystery line no i be go back to some of my high trapeze work you know since we lose wogand there have not be any of the big swing work do that be so agreed helen but i have be so busy practice the vanish lady act with you on top of my other work that i have not give it a thought but you be not go to do that dangerous trick be you i think i be joe answer it be sensational and we need sensational act now to draw the crowd i use to do it and i can again i think with a little practice i be go to start in and train to-morrow i wish you would not say helen in a low voice but joe do not seem to hear she the big swing be a trapeze act perform on the highest of the circus apparatus part of this apparatus consist of two platform fasten to two of the opposite main pole and up under the very roof of the big top midway between the platform which be just large enough for a man to stand on be a trapeze with long rope capable of be swing from one rest place to the other it be in reality a big swing joe 's act which he have often do but which of late have be perform by a man bill as wogand be to stand on one platform have the long trapeze start in a long pendulumlike swing by a attendant and then to leap down catch hold of the bar with he hand and swing up to the other platform if he miss catch the bar it mean a dangerous fall a fall into a net it be true but dangerous none the less its danger can be judge when it be say that wogand have die as a indirect result of a fall into the net he miss the trapeze topple into the net and by some chance do not land properly he back be injure he spine become affected and he die when circus performer on the high trapeze fall or jump into the safety net they do not usually do it haphazardly if they do many would be kill there be a certain knack and trick of landing in a net joe strong ever have the interest of the circus at heart have decide to do this dangerous swing he be a acrobat as well as a stage magician and he have decide to take up some of he earlier act which have be so successful but i wish he would not say helen to herself i have a premonition that something will happen helen be very superstitious in certain way but to all she say joe only laugh i be go to do the big swing he reply simply chapter iii too many people hundred of man toiling and sweating over stiff canvas and stiffer rope the thud of big wooden sledge hammer drive in the tent stake the rumble of heavy wagon and a cloud of dust where they be be shove into place by the busy elephant on one edge of the big vacant lot be wisp of smoke from the fire in the stove wagon and from these same wagon come appetizing odor here and there man and woman dart carry portion of they costume in they hand clown partly make up look from they dress tent to smile or shout at some acquaintance who chance to be pass by all this be the sampson brother ' circus in preparation for a day 's performance joe strong have have a good breakfast without which no circus man or woman start the day stroll over to where helen morton be just finish she morning meal feeling all right he ask she well yes pretty well she answer what be the matter ask joe quickly as he detect a under note of anxiety in the girl 's voice be you star horse rosebud lame or off he feed oh no she answer it be just -- oh here come mother watson and i promise to help she mend a skirt say helen quickly as she turn to greet the veteran clown 's wife see you later joe she call to he over she shoulder as she start away the young magician move away toward he own private quarter i wonder what be the matter with helen he say she do not act naturally if that bill carfax have be around again annoy she i 'll put he out of business for all time but if he have be around i would have hear of it i do not believe it can be that nor be it helen 's anxiety have to do with something other than bill carfax the unprincipled circus man who have so annoyed she before joe discharge he and as joe have say the man have not be see publicly since the fiasco of he attempt to expose joe 's mystery box trick well i suppose she will not tell I what it be until she get good and ready mused joe now i 'll go in and have a little practice at the big swing before the parade joe do not take part in the street pageant though helen do ride she beautiful horse to the admiration not only of the small boy and they sister but the grown-up throng in the highway as well helen make a striking picture on she spirited but gentle steed it be not that joe strong feel above appear in the parade that be not he reason for not take part he have do so on more than one occasion and with he wing of steel have create more than one sensation but now that he do a trapeze act as well as work the sleight-of-hand mystery he time be pretty well occupy he have not as yet do the big swing in public since that act be abandon on the death of the man who have be injure while do it but joe have be perfect himself in it he have have a new set of trapeze make and have ornament they and the two platform in a very striking manner in other word the trick have a new dress and joe as one of the circus proprietor hope it would go well and attract attention this be from a business standpoint and not only because joe be himself the performer of course it be natural that he should like applause -- all do more or less but joe be one of the owner of the circus -- the chief owner in fact -- and he want to make a financial success of it nor be this a purely selfish reason many person own stock in the enterprise and joe feel it be only fair to they to see that they receive a good return for they investment any trick he could do to draw crowd he be willing to attempt so while the parade be be get ready joe go inside the main top which by this time be erect to see about have he platform and trapeze put in place in this he be always very careful as be every aerial performer the least slip of a rope may cause disaster and no matter how careful the attendant be the performer themselves always give at least a casual look to they apparatus all right harry ask joe of one of the rigger who have charge of put up the platform and the big swing sure it be all right mr strong be the answer i should say so i do not make no mistake when i be put up trapeze you 'll find everything shipshape and proper go to have a big crowd to-day i guess joe look at harry loper closely the young man have never talk so much before be on the whole rather close-mouthed as the man pass joe after give a pull on the last rope the young magician become aware that harry have be drink -- and something stronger than pink lemonade i be sorry about that muse joe as the rope rigger pass on if there be any place a man ought not to drink it be in a circus and especially when he have to rig up high fly apparatus for other it be drink that put bill carfax out of business i do not know harry be that kind i never notice it before i be sorry and i 'll take extra precaution that my rope will not slip you can not trust a man who drink joe shake he head a bit sadly he be think of bill carfax and of the fact that he have have to discharge the man because while under the influence of liquor he have insult helen then bill have try to get revenge on joe i hope it do not turn out this way with harry loper mused joe as he begin climb up a rope ladder that lead to one of the high platform and as harry have to do with the placing of this ladder joe test it carefully before ascend i do not want to fall and be lay up in the middle of the circus season muse the young circus man with a frown however the ladder appear to be perfectly secure and as joe go up finally reach the high platform he feel a sense of exhilaration height always affect he this way he like more than anything else to soar aloft on he wing of steel and he like the sensation when he leap from one platform toward the swing trapeze bar aim to grasp it in he hand and swing in a great arc to the other little elevated place close under the top of the tent there be a thrill about it -- a thrill not only to the performer but to the audience as well -- and joe could hear the gasp that go up from thousand of throat as he make he big swing but for the time be he give he whole attention to the platform and its fastening the platform be not very likely to slip be catch on to the main tent pole which themselves be well brace the real danger be in the long trapeze not only must the thin wire rope of this be strong enough to hold joe 's weight but a add pressure cause by the momentum of he jump and not only must the cable be strong but there must be no defect in the wooden bar and in the place where the upper end of the rope be fasten to the top of the tent well this platform be all right remark joe as he look it over now for the other and the trapeze he go down the rope ladder and climb up another to the second platform the show would not start for several hour yet and the tent be fill with man put in place the stage for joe 's magic trick and other apparatus for various performer the parade be just form to proceed down town joe find that harry loper have do he work well at least as far as the platform be concern they be firmly fasten the one to which joe leap after he swing need to be considerably stronger than the one from which he take off the next act of the young circus performer be to climb up to the very top of the tent and there to examine the fastening of the trapeze rope he spend some time at this have reach he high perch by a third rope ladder i guess everything be all right mused joe perhaps i do harry a injustice he might have take some stimulant for a cold -- they all get wet through the other night but still he ought to be careful he be a little too talkative for a man to give he whole attention to fasten a trapeze but this seem to be all right i 'll do the big swing this afternoon and to-night in addition to the box trick and the vanish lady helen work exceedingly well in that have see that he aerial apparatus be all right joe next go to he tent where he magical appliance be keep many stage trick depend for they success on special piece of apparatus and joe 's act be no exception joe see that everything be in readiness for he sleight-of-hand work and then examine he box of mystery as this be a very special piece of apparatus he be very careful about it he ability to get out of it once he be lock and rope in depend on a delicate bit of mechanism and the least hitch in this mean failure but a test show that it be all right and as by this time it be nearly the hour for the parade to come back and the preliminary to begin joe go over to the circus office to see if any matter there need he attention as he cross the lot to where the office be set up in a small tent the first horse of the return parade come back on the circus grounds follow be a mob of delighted small boy and not a few man look as if we would have a big crowd say joe to himself and it be a fine day for the show we 'll make money he attend to some routine matter and then the first of the afternoon audience begin to arrive as joe have predict the crowd be a big one the young performer be in he dress room get ready for the big swing which he would perform before he mystery trick when mr moyne the circus treasurer enter there be a queer look on mr moyne 's face and joe could not help but notice it what be worry you ask joe do not this weather suit you or be not there a big enough crowd that be just it joe be the unexpected answer there be too big a crowd we have too many people at this show and that be what be worry I a whole lot joe strong look in surprise at the treasurer what could mr moyne mean chapter iv the rust wire yes go on the circus treasurer as he rub he chin reflectively it be a curious state of affair and as you be so vitally interested i come to you at once there be go to be trouble trouble cry joe with a laugh i can not see that mr moyne you say there be a big crowd of people at we circus -- too much of a crowd in fact i can not see anything wrong in that it be just what we be always want -- a big audience let 'em fill the tent i say and put out the ` straw seat only ' sign trouble why i should say this be good luck and joe hasten he preparation for he want to go on with the big swing ordinarily say mr moyne in the slow precise way he have of speak bring about perhaps by he need of be exact in money matter a big crowd would be the very thing we should want but this time we do not -- not this kind of a crowd what do you mean asked joe begin to feel that it be more than a mere notion on the part of the treasurer that something be wrong be it a rough crowd will there be a ` hey rube ' cry raise -- a fight between we man and the mill hand oh no nothing like that the treasurer hasten to assure joe the whole thing be just this there be a great many more people in the main top now than there be admission price in the treasurer 's cash box the book do not balance as it be more people in the tent than have pay they way ask joe well that always happen at a circus small boy will crawl in under the canvas in spite of club oh it be not a question of the small boy -- i never worry about they return mr moyne but there be about a thousand more person at the performance which will soon begin than we have admission price for in other word there be a thousand person occupy fifty cent seat that have not pay they half dollar it be not the reserve chair that be affect we be all right there but fully a thousand person have come into the show and we be short five hundred dollar in we cash you do not tell I cry joe he see that mr moyne be very much in earnest have the ticket man and the entrance attendant be work a flim-flam game on we oh no it be not that say the treasurer i could understand that but the man be perfectly willing to have they account go over and they ticket check up they be straight then what be it ask joe that be what we have get to find out go on mr moyne in some way the thousand people have come in without pay the circus anything and they do not sneak in either a few might do that but a thousand could not they have come in by the regular entrance do they force themselves past without ticket no each one have the proper coupon have there be a theft of we ticket demand the young magician and acrobat no we ticket account be all right except there be a thousand extra entrance coupon in the box -- coupon take in by the entrance attendant it be a puzzle to I confess the treasurer there be some game be play on we and we be out to the tune of five hundred dollar by it already be there any way of find out who these person be who have come in without pay we and have they eject ask joe i do not see how admit mr moyne if they be in reserved seat it could be do but not in the ordinary un-numbered fifty cent section the whole situation be that we have a thousand person too many at the show well we 'll have a meeting of the executive body and take it up after the performance say joe as he quickly prepare to get into he aerial costume we 'll have to go on with the performance now it be get late if we be swamp by people come along who hold we regular ticket we 'll have to sit 'em anywhere we can if we lose five hundred dollar we 'll make it up by have a smash crowd which be always a good advertisement i 'll see you directly after the show mr moyne i wish you would say the harass treasurer something must be do about it if this happen very often we 'll be in a financial hole at the end of the season he depart look at some figure he have jot down on the back of a envelope joe strong be puzzle nothing like this have ever come up before true there have be swindler who try to mulct the circus of money and there be always small boy and grow man too who try to crawl in under the tent but such a wholesale game as this joe have never before know well five hundred dollar for once will not break we he say grimly as he fasten on a brightly spangled belt but i would not want it to happen very often now i wonder what luck i 'll have in my big swing i have not do it in public for some time but it go all right in practice joe look from he dress room he be all ready for he act now but the time have not yet come for he to go on he see helen hasten past on she way to enter the ring with she horse rosebud which a groom hold at the entrance for she good luck call joe wave he hand and smile the same to you answer helen you 'll need it more than i oh joe she go on earnestly will not you give up this big swing stick to you box trick and let I act with you in the disappear lady stunt do not go on with this high trapeze act she plead why helen anybody would think you would be bite by the jinx bug laugh joe i think you be all over that perhaps i be foolish she say but it be because -- she blush and look away i suppose i should take it as a compliment that you be so interested in my welfare say joe with a smile and believe I i be but helen i can not back out of this act now it be be advertise big i have get to go on then do be careful will not you she beg oh do be careful somehow i have a feeling that -- oh well i will not set you to worry by tell you she say quickly with a laugh in which however there be no mirth she smile again try to make it a bright one but joe see that she be under a strain i 'll be careful he promise really there be no danger i have do the stunt a score of time and i can judge my distance perfectly besides there be the safety net yes i know but there be poor -- oh well i will not talk about it good luck and she hurry on for it be time for she act -- the whistle of the ringmaster have blow joe look after the girl he love he smile and then a rather serious look settle over he face like a flash there have come to he the memory of the too loquacious harry loper who have fit up he aerial apparatus there can be nothing wrong with that muse joe i go over every inch of it i guess helen be just nervous well there go my cue he hurry toward the entrance and then he begin to ponder over the curious fact of there be a thousand person too many at the performance we 'll have to straighten out that ticket tangle after the show muse joe it be likely to get serious i wonder -- he go on strike by a new thought i wonder if -- oh no it could not be he have not be around in a long while out into the tent fill with a record-breaking crowd go joe to the place where he high trapeze be wait for he the band be play lively air on one platform some trained seal be juggle big ball of color rubber and on another a bear be go about on roller skate in one end ring helen be perform with rosebud while in another a troupe of japanese acrobat be do wonderful thing with they supple body joe wave he hand to helen in pass and then he begin to ascend to he high platform when he reach it and stand poise ready for he act there come a shrill whistle from jim tracy the ringmaster who wear he usual immaculate shirt front and black evening clothes -- rather incongruous in the daytime the whistle be the signal for the other act to cease that the attention of all might be center on joe this be always do in a circus in the case of star and joe be certainly a star of the first magnitude lady and gentleman cry jim tracy with the accented drawl that carry he voice to the very end of the big tent call you attention to one of the most marvelous high trapeze act ever perform in any circus he point dramatically to joe who stand up straight ready to do he act be you ready ask the man who be to release the trapeze which be catch up at one side of the platform opposite joe ready answer the young acrobat the man pull a rope which release a catch let the trapeze start on its long sway swing the man pull it by means of a long thin cord until it be make big arc like some gigantic pendulum joe watch it carefully judge it to the fraction of a inch he stand poise and tense on the gayly decorate platform himself a fine picture of physical young manhood the band be blare out the latest jazz melody suddenly from he perch the young acrobat give a cry and jim tracy on the ground below hear it hold up he white-gloved hand as a signal for the music to cease then joe leap full and fair he leap out toward the swing bar of the big trapeze the snare drum throb out as he jump he be dimly conscious of thousand of eye watch he -- eye that look curiously and apprehensively up and he realize that helen be also watch he as true as a die joe 's hand catch and grip the bar of the swing trapeze so far he be safe the momentum of he jump carry he in a long swing and he at once begin to undulate himself to increase he swing he must do this in order to get to the second platform as the young performer begin to do this he look up at the wire rope of he trapeze it be a look give instinctively and for no particular purpose as joe 's eye must rest most of all on the second platform where he need to land to save himself from a bad fall as he eye glance along the steel cable on which he life depend he see to he horror a spot of rust on one and at the spot of rust several of the thin strand of twisted wire be loose and fray the cable seem about to give way chapter v a fire sensation joe strong have to think quickly every acrobat every person who do stunt in a circus must for something be always happen or on the verge of take place and when joe look up and see the rust wire and note the fraying strand several thought shoot through he mind at once that rust spot be not there this morning when i look at the trapeze he muse and it have not rain since how do it get there he think of the too talkative harry loper and a ugly suspicion associate itself with he but joe have no time for such thought then what be vital for he to know be whether or not the thin wire cable would remain unbroken long enough for he to reach the maximum of he swing and land on the platform or would he fall spoil the act and also endanger himself true he might land in the net in such a way as to come to no harm as he have do many time and as many performer before he have do but the danger be that in a sudden and unexpected drop downward he might not be able to get he limb in the proper landing position joe strong have nerve if he have lack it he would never have be so successful and at once he decide on a courageous proceeding i 'll bring all my weight suddenly on that left hand cable he muse as he swing to and fro from side to side of the big tent if it be go to break it will do so then and i 'll be ready for it i 'll then keep hold of the trapeze bar which will be straight up and down instead of crosswise and swing by that the other cable seem all right this be a fact which joe ascertain by a quick inspection there be no time for further thought as he swing joe suddenly shift he weight bring it all on the fray and strangely rust cable as he half expect it give way and he drop in a instant but not far the watch crowd gasp it look like a accident and it be in a way but joe have purposely cause it as the wire break joe hold tightly to the wooden bar which be now upright in he hand instead of be horizontal and though it slip through he finger perhaps for the width of he palm at last he grip it in a firm hold and keep on with he swing and then the applause break forth for the audience think it all a part of the trick -- they think that joe have purposely cause the cable to break to make the act more effective to and fro swing joe nearer and nearer to the second platform and then reach the height of the long arc he turn he body and step full and fair on the little square of velvet-covered board with a lithe contortion joe squirm to a upright position recover he balance with a great effort for he have be put out in he calculation of distance and then turn he bow to the crowd revolve on the platform to take in every one again the applause break forth to be drown in the boom and ruffle of the drum as the band begin to play there be little time in a circus where act follow act so quickly for long acknowledgment the other performer come into the ring or on to the raise platform and joe descend by means of the rope ladder helen meet he and they walk toward the dress room that be a wonderful trick joe she say but i do not see you practice that drop i do not practice it he remark dryly i do it on the spur of the moment joe strong be not it dangerous well a little what make you do it i could not help it you could not help it joe -- do you mean -- she sense that something be wrong but walk around the circus arena with performer come and go be not the place to speak of it joe see that she understand i 'll tell you later he say we have to get ready for the trick box and the vanish lady stunt now oh joe be you in much danger she ask in a low voice oh not much he answer and he try to speak lightly yet he do not like to think of that one moment when he see the rust and break wire while joe and helen be prepare for the box act which have be treat fully in the previous volume the explanation of how the vanish lady trick be accomplish will be give though that too have be explain in a earlier volume a large newspaper be put on the stage and the chair set on the paper thus seemingly preclude the possibility of a trap door be cut in the stage through which the lady in the chair might slip the word seemingly be use with a due sense of what it mean the newspaper be not a perfect one on one of its side which be not exhibit to the audience there be cut a opening or trap that exactly correspond in size with a trap door on the stage the paper as explain in the previous book be strengthen with cardboard and the trap be a double one be cut in the center the flap be easily move either way the audience think it see a perfect newspaper but there be a square hole in it but conceal as be a secret trap door when joe lay the paper on the stage he place it so that the square double flap in it be exactly over the trap in the stage floor he then draw the page of the paper that he have hold out to the audience toward himself expose the trap for use but because it be so carefully make and the cut be so fine it be not visible from the front helen take she place in the chair which of course be a trick one it be fit with a conceal rod and a cap and it be over this cap bring out at the proper moment that joe carefully place the black veil when he be pretend to mesmerize helen there be a cross rod also conceal in the chair and on either end of this something like the epaulette of a soldier so that when these end be under the veil and the cap be in place it look as though some one sit in the chair when really no one do helen be in the chair at the start but as soon as she be cover by the veil she begin to get out the seat of the chair be hinge within its frame as helen sit on it and after she have be cover with the veil she rest she weight on she hand which be place on the extreme outer edge of this seat frame she pull a catch which cause the seat to drop and at the same time the trap beneath she include the prepared newspaper be open by a attendant the black veil all about the chair prevent the audience see this helen lower herself down through the drop seat of the chair through the trap and under the stage and while she be do this it still look as if she be in the chair for the false cap and the extend cross rod make outline as if of a human form beneath the black veil as soon as helen be out of the chair and beneath the stage a attendant close the newspaper and wooden floor trap joe then suddenly raise the veil take in its fold the false cap and the cross piece which have represent helen 's shoulder they be thin and light -- these piece of trick apparatus -- and no one suspect they be in the veil the hinged seat of the chair snap back in place by means of a spring and when joe step aside hold the veil there be the empty chair and the newspaper which he pick up seem to preclude the possibility of there have be a trap in the stage but joe be careful how he exhibit this paper to he audience and so it be that the lady vanish and now joe tell I all about it demand helen when the circus be over for the afternoon and the box and vanish trick have be successfully perform what happen to you trapeze some one spill acid on one of the wire rope and it eat into the metal corrode it and separate a number of the strand so that a little extra weight break they say joe acid on the cable cry helen how do you find out i just examine the wire i know it could not have rust naturally in such a short time there be a peculiar smell about the wire and i know enough of chemistry to make a simple acid test what kind of acid be use i do not know but it be strong enough to eat the steel who could have put it on that i have get to find out be it harry loper i tax he with it but he swear he know nothing of it say joe i be inclined to believe he too i charge he with drinking and he could not deny that but he say he meet some old friend and they induce he to have a little convivial time with they no i do not believe he would do it he be weak and foolish but he have no reason to try to injure I who would joe of course there be bill carfax but he have not be see near the circus of late no i do not believe it could have be bill i 'll have to be on my guard do joe urge helen oh i can not bear to think of it do not then laugh joe try to make light of it let 's go down town and i 'll buy you some ice cream but you be not go to give up try to find out who put acid on the trapeze be you no indeed declare the young performer i have two problem on my hand now -- that and try to learn how too many person come to the circus this afternoon and he tell helen about the extra ticket that be queer she exclaim some jinx bug must be after we do not get superstitious warn joe now we 'll forget we trouble they may not amount to anything after all but though he speak lightly joe be worried and he be not go to let helen know that they go into a ice-cream parlor and relax as helen call it the two be on they way back to the circus lot intend to go to supper and prepare for the evening entertainment when there be a sudden alarm down the street and in a instant the fire engine and other apparatus dash past a fire cry joe come on helen it be just down the street they could see smoke pour from a small building and a crowd rush toward it thither also the fire apparatus be dash joe and helen be among the early arrival what be it ask joe of a officer i mean what sort of place be that and he point to the building which be now obscure by smoke dime museum be the answer lot of fake i send in the alarm a fire-eater be try some new stunt and he set the place ablaze so the boss yell to I come now youse all have to git back and he motion to the crowd which be constantly increase to get beyond the fire line chapter vi something new what with the clanging of the gong on the engine and on the red runabout that bring two battalion chief to the fire the pall of smoke with here and there the suggestion of a red blaze the sway excitement of the crowd the yell of harass policeman the scene at the blaze of the dime museum be one long to be remember by joe strong and helen morton -- particularly in the light of what happen afterward joe do you hear what he say ask helen as she move back with the young acrobat in conformity with the officer 's order you mean that we have get to slide no that a fire-eater start the blaze do he mean a professional ` fire bug ' as i have hear they call oh not at all exclaim joe a fire-eater be a chap who do such stunt in a museum theater or even in a circus sampson brother use to have one i understand from look over the old book but it be not much of a act golly this be go to be some blaze that be very evident from the increase smoke that roll out and the crackle of fire that now could be hear above the puffing of the engine and the shout of the mob a regular tinder box mutter the officer who have tell joe the origin of the blaze place ought to have be pull down long ago git back there youse he yell to some venturesome lad want to git mush up the blaze be a big one considerable damage be do and several person be injure but quick work by a efficient department prevent the flame from spread to the building on either side of the one where it have start joe and helen stay long enough to see the menace get under control and then they depart just as the ambulance roll away with the last of the victim that be the fire-eater they be take to the hospital now say the policeman who have first speak to the young circus performer they take he into a drug store to wrap he in oil and cotton batting will he live ask helen just a chance be the answer say if i have to get my living eat fire i would starve confide the policeman it must be some stunt i always think it be a fake but this fire burn real enough oh it be not all fake say joe though of course there be a trick about it you seem to know say the policeman and he smile at joe and helen he chief trouble be about over with the departure of the ambulance and the knowledge that filter through the crowd that the most of the excitement be over oh i be in the circus business confess joe i never eat fire he go on but -- oh i know you now cry the officer i be on duty out at the circus grounds this afternoon and i go into the tent when you do that box act say that be some stunt do they really pay ten thousand dollar to the fellow who tell how it be do well we have never pay out the money yet say joe with a smile but it be there wait for some one to claim it then i be come to-night to watch you say the officer who appear delighted that he have recognize one of the profesh come along reply joe here wait a minute there be a couple of pass come and bring a friend if you tell how i do the trick you 'll get the ten thousand only you 'll have to post a hundred dollar as a forfeit to the red cross in case you do not guess right that be include in the offer oh the officer do not seem quite so pleased well i 'll come anyhow he go on accept the pass joe hand he the policeman have allow joe and helen to stay in a advantageous place where they could watch the fire where be they take the man who do the dangerous trick that cause all the trouble ask helen as she prepare to walk on with joe to the city hospital miss he be a bad case i understand poor fellow murmured helen do you think we could go to see he and do something for he joe she ask solicitously he be in almost the same line of business as ourselves well i do not know be the slow answer i can fix it up if you want to see he -- that be if the doctor and nurse will let you say the policeman i know the hospital superintendent you just tell he that casey send you and it will be all right thanks perhaps we will say joe there be a little time after supper before the performer have to go on with they act and helen prevail on joe to take she to the hospital whither the injured fire-eater have be remove they find he swathe in bandage no objection be make to they see he after the magic name of casey have be mention to the superintendent we come in to see if you need any help say joe to the pathetic figure in the bed we be in the same line of business in a way be you a fire-eater slowly ask the man no joe tell he but i be in the circus -- sampson brother ' oh yes i have hear about it a partner of mine be with 'em for year gascoyne be he name that be before my time say joe but how be you get on can we be of any help to you we professional must help one another that be right we get knock often enough be the reply well i be do as well as can be expect the doctor say and i be not really in need of anything the museum folk be pretty good to I thank you just the same how do it happen ask helen oh just my carelessness say the man we get careless after play with fire a bit i put too much alcohol on the tow and there be a draft from a open door some drapery catch and it be all go before i know it i try to put it out -- that be how i get burn then you really do not eat fire ask helen joe and the man swathe in bandage look at one another and a semblance of a wink pass between they nobody can eat fire lady say the museum performer it be all a trick same as some you husband do in the circus joe blush almost as much as do helen we be not marry yet but we be go to be explain joe smile lucky guy murmur the man well as i be say it be all a trick he go on strong alum solution in you mouth just a dash of alcohol to make a blaze that flare up but go out quickly if you smother it right you know the game and he look at joe well not exactly be the reply i have read something of it but somehow it never appeal to I oh it make a good act friend say the man earnestly i have do a lot of museum and circus stunt and this always go big there be no danger if you handle it right i 'll be more careful next time you do not mean to say you 'll go back to it do you ask helen sure lady i have get to earn my living and this be the best thing i know i 'll be out in a week i do not swallow any thank goodness oh sure i 'll go at it again joe and helen cheer the sufferer up as much as they could and then depart joe privately leave a bill of substantial denomination with the superintendent to be use for anything extra the patient might need on the way back to the circus where they be soon to give they evening performance joe be unusually quiet what be the matter ask helen be you think of that accident on the trapeze no be the answer it be something different i have get to get up a new act for the show that trapeze act even the way i have to do it this afternoon be not sensational enough i have get to have something new and i have about decide on it what ask helen i be go to become a fire-eater be the unexpected reply chapter vii the paper expert for a moment helen morton stare at joe strong as though not quite sure whether or not he be in he proper mind then see plainly that he be in earnest she seem to shrink away from he as he have notice she shrink away for a moment from the burned man suffer there in the hospital what be the matter helen ask joe try to speak lightly do not you want to see some more sensational act in the show yes but not that kind she answer with a shudder she could not conceal oh joe if you be to -- she could not go on she breast heave painfully now look here helen he exclaim with good-natured roughness that be not any way to look at matter especially when we both depend on sensation for make we living you know as well as i do that in this business we have to take risk that be what make we act go you take a risk every time you perform with rosebud you might slip the horse might slip and you would be hurt now be this new act i be thinking of perfor -- yes i may take risk joe interrupted helen but they be perfectly natural risk and i have more than a even chance you might just as well say you take a risk walk along the street and so you do a elevated train might fall on you or a auto run up on the sidewalk the risk i take in the act with rosebud be only natural one and really should not be count but if you start to become a fire-eater -- oh joe think of that poor fellow in the hospital he do not get that way from eat fire -- or pretend to eat it -- for the amusement of the public he might just as easily have be burn the way he be by light the kitchen stove for he wife to get breakfast he accident be entirely outside of he act you might say why i use light candle in some of my trick now if some one knock over a candle and it cause a fire on the stage and i be burn would you want I to give up be a magician oh no i suppose not say helen slowly but fire be so dangerous and to think of put it in you mouth how can you do it joe oh it can not be do oh there be a trick about it i have not master all the detail yet so as to give a smooth performance but i can make a attempt at it joe strong do you mean to say you know how to eat fire demand helen and now she eye show she astonishment well not exactly eat it though that be the term use but i do know how to do it i learn in a rudimentary way when i be with professor rosello -- the first man who teach I sleight-of-hand he have one fire-eating act but it do not amount to much he tell I the secret of it such as it be but if i put on that stunt i be go to make it different i be go to dress it up make it sensational so that it will be the talk of the country where circus be exhibit and will not you run any danger question the girl quickly oh i suppose so just as i do when i work on the high trapeze or ride my motor cycle along the high wire but it be all in the day 's work and now let 's talk about something pleasant -- i mean let 's get off the shop helen sigh she be plainly disturbed but she do not want to burden joe with she worry she know he must have calm nerve and a untroubled mind to do he various act in the circus that night after supper and before the evening performance joe make a careful examination of he trapeze apparatus beyond the place where the acid have eat into the wire strand cause they to become weaken so that they part the appliance do not appear to have be tamper with nor be there any clew which might show who have do the deed that it could have happen by accident be out of the question the acid could have get on the wire rope in one way only some one must have climb up the rope ladder to the platform and apply the stuff but who do it ask jim tracy when joe have tell he of the discovery of the acid-eaten cable some enemy perhaps the same one who be responsible for we loss in ticket this afternoon answer the young magician carfax ask the ringmaster it might be and yet he be not the only man who be be discharge or who have a grudge against I there be giannus with whom i have a fight you mean the italian yes he be a ugly customer but i have not hear of he for year i do not believe he be even in this part of the country and we have not any reason to suppose that carfax be either after he fiasco in try to expose my box of mystery trick but we have get to be on we guard i should say so exclaim the ringmaster and now about you trapeze act joe be you go to put it on again to-night of course it be bill then you 'll have to hustle to rig up a new rope i be not go to put on a new rope declare joe the act go so well when i seem about to fall that i be go to keep that feature in i 'll rig up a catch on the sever cable at the proper time i 'll snap it loose seem to fall swing by the dangling bar as i do before and land on the platform that way it will be more effective than if i do it in the regular way but will not it be risky joe shrug he shoulder no more so than any trapeze act now that i be ready for the sudden drop i 'll be on my guard no i can work it all right and now about these extra admission what be we go to do about they well say the ringmaster maybe we would better talk to moyne about they if they ring a extra thousand person in on we again to-night the thing will be get serious the treasurer be call in consultation with joe and tracy and other circus official and it be decide to keep a special watch on the ticket wagon and the ticket taker that night joe quickly make the change in he trapeze and test it find that he could work it perfectly then he begin to think of he new fire-eating act he be determine to make that as great a success as be he now well advertise ten thousand dollar mystery box act the evening performance have not long be under way and joe have do he big swing successfully when he be seek out by mr moyne the same thing have happen again say the treasurer you mean more people come in than we have sell ticket for that be it well where do the extra admission come from i mean where do the people get they admission slip from -- the extra people that be what we can not find out the treasurer aid as far as the ticket taker can tell only one kind of admission slip for the fifty cent seat be be hand they but the number as tally by the automatic gate do not jibe with the number of ordinary admission sell at the ticket office to-night there be a difference of about eight hundred and seventy-five do you mean asked joe that that number of person come in on ticket that be never sell at the ticket wagon that be just what i mean there be a extra source from which the ordinary admission ticket come as i tell you this afternoon we be have no trouble with we reserved seat there have be no duplicate there but there be a duplication in the fifty cent seat where one may take he pick as to where he want to sit do not we have ticket on sale in some of the downtown store joe ask oh yes several of the store sell ticket up to a certain hour then they send the balance up here for we to dispose of how about they account have you have they go over carefully they tally to a penny how about the unsold ticket these agent send back to we be not there a chance on the way up for some one to slip out some of the pasteboard mr moyne there be a chance yes but it have not be do i have check up the account of the store and there be the cash or the unsold ticket to balance every time but somehow and from some place a extra number of the ordinary admission ticket be be sell and we be not get the money for they it be queer say joe i have a idea that i want to try out the first chance i get save I a bunch of these ordinary admission ticket take they from the box at random and let I have they i will promise the treasurer there be nothing we can do to-night to stop the fraud be there he ask mr moyne be a very conscientious treasurer it disturb he greatly to see the circus lose money i do not see what we can do say joe if we start a inquiry it may cause a fight let it go we 'll have to charge it to profit and loss and do not forget to let I have some of those ticket i want to examine they mr moyne promise to attend to the matter joe then have to go on in he box of mystery trick and when this be finish amid much applause he cause helen to vanish in the manner already describe the circus make considerable money in this town even with the bogus admission and as the weather be fine and as the show would exhibit the next day in a big city for a two day ' stand every one be in good humor stay over night in the same city where they exhibit during the day be always a rest for the performer they get more sleep and be in better trim for work the last act be finish the chariot race have take place and the audience be surge out the animal tent have already be take down and the animal themselves be be load on the railroad train as joe helen and the other performer start for they berth to begin the trip to the next town the main top begin come down the circus be on the move soon after breakfast the next morning have see that all he apparatus have safely arrive joe visit mr moyne in the latter 's office have you a bunch of ticket for I ask the young magician yes here they be -- several hundred pick at random from the box at the entrance i can not see anything wrong if you be look for counterfeit ticket i do not believe you 'll find they add mr moyne i do not know that i be look for counterfeit say joe that may be the explanation or it may be there be a leak somewhere in the ticket wagon i be almost sure there be not declare the treasurer but of course no one be infallible i hope you get to the bottom of the mystery i hope so myself reply joe with a smile as he put the ticket in a valise a little later he be on he way downtown he have several hour before he would have to go on as he do not take part in the parade and he have several matter to attend to joe make he way toward a large office building carry the valise with the circus ticket a little later he might have be see enter a office the door of which bear the name of herbert waldon consult chemist mr strong say joe to the boy who come forward to inquire he errand mr waldon be expect I i believe oh yes say the boy you be to come right in joe be usher into a room which be fill with strange appliance from test tube and retort to electrical furnace and x-ray apparatus a little man in a rather soil linen coat come forward smile i will not shake hand with you mr strong he say for i have be dabble in some vile-smelling stuff but if you wait until i wash i 'll be right with you all right assent joe and then as he catch sight of what seem to be a number of cancel bank check on a table he smilingly ask : have you be pay you income tax oh no answer the chemist with a laugh those be just some sample of paper send in for I to test a inventor be try to get up a acid-proof ink i be a sort of paper expert among my other chemical activity and i be put these sample through a series of test but you 'll not be interested in they i do not know but what i shall be return joe with sudden energy since you be a paper expert i may be able to set you another task besides that of show I the latest thing in fire-resisting liquid yes i may want you service in both line well i be here to do business say mr waldon smile chapter viii joe eat fire the chemist lead the way into a little office this open off from the room in which be the apparatus and where as joe have become more and more keenly aware there be a most unpleasant odor i 'll open the window close the laboratory door and you will not notice it in a little while say mr waldon as he observe joe 's nose twitching i be so use to it i do not mind but you come in from the fresh air -- it be not exactly perfume interrupted joe with a laugh but do not be uneasy on my account i can stand it however he be glad when the fresh air come in through the window the chemist wash he hand and then sit down at a desk invite joe to draw up he chair now what can i do for you ask mr waldon be it fire or paper well since i know pretty well what i want to ask you in the matter of fire reply joe and since i have get a puzzling paper problem here suppose we tackle the hardest first and come to the known and easier trick later just as you say assent mr waldon what be you paper problem joe 's answer be to take from the valise several hundred of the circus ticket they be the kind sell for fifty cent or perhaps more in these day of the war tax they entitle the holder to a seat on what at a baseball game would be call the bleacher in other word they be not reserved-seat coupon however these ticket be not the one-time blue or red piece of stiff pasteboard bear the name of the circus and the word admit one which be formerly sell at the gilded wagon these be hand in at the main entrance and the ticket be use over and over again sometimes the blue one sell for fifty cent and a kind selling for seventy-five cent entitle the purchaser to a seat with a folding back to it though it be not reserve but joe have institute some change when he become one of the circus proprietor and one be in the matter of the general admission ticket he have they print on a thin but tough quality of paper and each ticket be number in this way it need but a glance at the last ticket in the rack and a look at the memorandum of the last number previously sell at the former performance to tell exactly how many general admission have be dispose of these number ticket be not use over again but be destroy after the day 's account have be make up at first joe and some other of the official have have a idea that the man who be charge with the work of destroy the ticket instead of do so have keep some out and sell they at a reduce price but a investigation prove that this be not the case some one be ring in extra ticket on we state joe to the chemist we want to find out who it be and how the trick be work so far we have not be able to find this out as a matter of fact we do not know whether there be bogus ticket in we box or not we have not be able to detect two kind they all seem the same some number must be duplicate say mr waldon as he pick up a handful of the slip joe have bring that be very obvious the number must be duplicate in some instance yes we have discover that return joe but the queer part be take even two ticket with the same number we do not know which be sell at we ticket wagon and which be the bogus one here be a case in point he pick up two of the coupon as far as eye or touch could tell they be identical and they bear the same red number one up in the hundred thousand now continue joe can you tell which of these two be the official circus ticket and which be the bogus one the chemist think for a moment have you a ticket -- say one issue some time ago -- which you be positive be genuine he ask i be ready for you there answer joe here be a coupon that happen to escape destruction it be one sell several week ago at we ticket wagon before we notice this trouble i buy the ticket myself so i know i happen to be pass the wagon and a boy be try to reach up to buy a fifty cent seat he be not quite tall enough so i reach for he then when i look at he i see that fifty cent mean a lot to he i give he back he half dollar out of my own pocket and pass he in to a reserved seat but i forget to turn the ticket in to the wagon and it be be in my pocket ever since now i be glad i save it for it will serve as a tester yes admit the chemist it will it be a good thing you have this but mr strong this be go to take some time i 'll have to compare all these ticket with the admittedly genuine one and i 'll have to make some intricate test well i hope you might be able to tell I right off the reel which of these coupon be good and which bad say joe but i can appreciate that it be not easy we certainly have be puzzle so i 'll leave they with you and you can write to I when you have any result i 'll leave you a list of the town where we 'll be show for the next two week and now suppose we get at the fire-eating business all right be the reply of the chemist but with the understanding that you do all the eating i have not any appetite that way myself they both laugh and then for some hour joe strong be closet with the chemist when joe emerge from the office of mr waldon there be a look of satisfaction on the face of the young magician i think i can make quite a act after what you have tell I he say as soon as i get it perfect i 'll send you word and you can come to see I i will if you be not too far away promise the chemist that night follow the closing of the performance joe invite helen jim tracy and a few of he more intimate friend and associate into he private dress tent i have the nucleus of a new act he say when they be seat in chair before a small table on which be several piece of apparatus just give I you opinion of this joe light a candle pick up on a fork what seem to be a piece of bread and touch it to the candle flame in a instant the object that be on the fork burst into a blaze and before the eye of he friend joe calmly put the flaming portion into he mouth he close he lip seem to be chew something open he mouth and show it empty a little light lunch he remark but he smile fade as helen scream in horror chapter ix the chemist 's letter oh joe you 'll surely burn yourself exclaim the startled bareback rider do you get burn question mr watson some trick declare the snake charmer for the moment there be some excitement for this be a new act for the circus people helen soon recover she customary composure and then she explain the cause of she excitement and the startled cry she have give she have of course expect some trick with fire when joe have summon she and the other to he own private part of the dress tent but she have not expect to see he actually put the blaze material in he mouth i think there be some sleight-of-hand performance about it she say i have a idea that you only pretend to put the blaze stuff in you mouth joe and when i see it i be afraid you would breathe in the flame and -- and -- she do not need to go on they all understand what she mean for every one in the circus know that helen and joe be engage i once see a little boy burn at a bonfire at which he be play go on helen he die since then the sight of fire near a human being have always a bad effect on I but i suppose i can get over it if i know there be no danger she say with a slight smile at joe well i can assure you there be not the slightest danger he declare if there be i should be the first to give it up i be as fond of live as any one you do not show it young man in some of the trick you do comment mr watson with the freedom befitting a circus mother and the privilege of a old friend you must remember that you do not live only for yourself and she look significantly at helen oh i 'll be careful promise joe and now i 'll do the trick again for you and let you see that it be absolutely harmless any of you could do it -- if you know how excuse I exclaim jim tracy not for mine however they all watch joe eagerly and interestedly even helen he do not seem to make any unusual preparation he merely take a drink of what seem to be water then he ignite something in the flame of the candle and place the burning stuff in he mouth seem to chew it with gusto oh exclaim helen but beyond that and a momentary placing of one hand over she heart she do not give way to emotion then as joe do the fire-eating trick again helen force herself to watch he closely as he have say he take no harm from the act tell we how you do it begged bill watson when i get over be funny -- or get audience to think i be -- i may want to live on something hot how do you work it well say joe if it be all the same to you i would rather not tell it be not that i be afraid of any of my friend give the trick away and so spoil the mystery of it for the crowd it be just as it be in my box act if any of you be ask how i do this fire trick you can truly say you do not know for none of you will know by my tell not even helen though she be in on the box secret i 'll only say that i protect my face and mouth as well as hand in a certain way and that i do actually put the blaze material into my mouth i be not burn so if any one ask you about the act you may tell they that much with absolute truth now the question be -- how be it go to go with the audience we need something -- or at least i do -- to create a sensation will this answer i should say so exclaimed jim tracy that ought to go big when it be dress up oh this be only the ground work say joe i be go to elaborate this fire act and make it the sensation of the season i have only begin on it i get from a chemist the material i want with which to protect myself and i have show to my own and you satisfaction that i can eat fire without get harm so far all be well now i be go to work the act up into something really worth while but you 'll still be careful will not you joe ask helen indeed i will he assure she do the trick once more joe suggest bill watson i be come as close as you 'll let I and i want to criticize it from the standpoint of a man in the audience that be what i be after say joe if there be any flaw in the act now be the time to find it out once more he set the material ablaze and put it into he mouth bill watson watch closely and at the end the old clown shake he head i see you actually put the fire in you mouth he testify no one can do more than that it take nerve of course no one can actually swallow fire and live the slightest breath of flame on the lung or on the mucous membrane of the throat and passage be fatal so when the term fire-eating or fire-eater be use it will be in the sense of its be a theatrical act there be a trick about it and the trick be this : in the first place the flame itself be produce by blaze alcohol this produce a blaze and a hot one too but there be no smoke in other word the combustion be almost perfect there be no residue of carbon to remain hot after the actual flame be extinguish and now as to the actual put into one 's mouth something that be blaze hot : it all depend on a very simple principle if the hand be thoroughly wet in water it may be safely thrust for a fraction of a second into a flaming gas jet but mark this -- for the _ fraction of a second only _ the water form a protect film for the skin and before it be evaporate the hand must be take out of danger in other word there be need a appreciable time for the fire to beat the skin to the burning point this immunity from burn to which the professional fire-eater owe they success come from this film of moisture on they skin they do not always use water -- in fact this be only serviceable for a momentary contact with flame and at that on the hand or face in case a longer contact be desire a fire-resisting chemical liquid be use it be about the contact of flame with the tender mucous membrane surface of the mouth and throat that joe as a fire-eater be most concerned in the first place there be a constant film of the secretion call saliva always flow in the mouth it come from gland in the throat and mouth and be very necessary to good digestion now for a very brief period this saliva which be just the same as a film of water on the hand resist the fire but professional fire-eater do not depend on saliva alone they use a chemical solution and this be what joe do when he drink something from a glass what that chemical solution be joe keep as a closely guard professional secret he fear too that some boy might make it rinse he mouth out with it and then get a audience of he chum together might try to eat some blaze coal he might and very likely would be severely burn and he parent or those in charge of he would blame joe for allow such dangerous information to leak out so though he guard all he secret of magic he be particularly careful to keep this one to himself but joe protect he mouth and throat with a fire-resisting liquid the formulum for which be give he by the chemist to whom he submit the circus ticket the success of joe and other of he kind depend also in this on a well know natural law it be that there can be no combustion in the ordinary sense where there be no oxygen as a candle will surely go out if enclose in a air-tight receptacle -- that be it will go out as soon as it have burn up all the oxygen -- just so surely will flame of any kind go out when a person close he mouth on it and as there be scarcely any air in the closed mouth -- all of it go down the bronchial tube into the lung -- it follow that the flame die out almost instantly that fact be consider and the mouth and throat have be previously treat with the secret chemical there be really not so much danger as appear as a matter of fact a person inadvertently swallow hot tea or coffee will burn or scald he mouth or tongue much more painfully than will a professional fire-eater most people know how painful a burn tongue be joe tell something of the history of fire-eating champion to he audience of friend for it appear that he have be read up on the subject and be well inform then he announce that the private rehearsal be over but i be go to work this fire-eating up into something that will cause a sensation he say and he make good he promise it be about a week after this and the circus have be travel about play to good business when joe receive a letter in the upper left-hand corner be the imprint of herbert waldon chemist i hope he have some news about the circus ticket exclaim joe for the show have be lose money steadily by means of the bogus coupon not as much as at first but enough to make it necessary to discover the fraud and so far mr moyne have not be successful perhaps this explain the mystery muse joe as he open the letter chapter x the pet cat the typewritten sheet of the letter from mr waldon enclose two of the engraved circus coupon they flutter to the floor of joe 's private tent as he tear open the envelope well either he have discover something or he have send they back and give up muse the young magician let 's see what he say joe quickly take in the contents of the letter in effect it state that mr waldon have discover which be the bogus and which be the real circus ticket he first give a explanation of the chemical test he use joe read this hastily but carefully then pass to the conclusion arrive at by the expert who be a authority on various kind of paper as well as chemical the ticket i have mark no 1 be a genuine coupon issue by you circus corporation say mr waldon in he letter the slip mark by I as no 2 be a counterfeit you will observe that they both bear the red ink serial number 356891 if you be a paper expert you would observe that the paper use in the two ticket be different there be not a very great difference and i be incline to think that both the genuine and the counterfeit ticket be make on paper from the same mill but of a different ` run ' that be it be make at a different time the printer who manufacture you ticket buy he paper from a certain mill make a specialty of this particular kind then some one who must know something of you financial and business interest have the bogus ticket make and on the same kind of paper but there be a slight difference which i be able to detect by means of chemical reaction the coloring matter use vary slightly though the texture of the two kind of paper be almost exactly similar now have settle that point the solution of the remain equation of the problem rest with you i can not tell who have the bogus ticket print you will have to go to the mill make the paper and find out to whom they sell this kind in that way you will learn the name of all printer use it and by a process of elimination you will get at the one who print the counterfeit this printer may be a innocent party or he may be guilty that be for you and the detective to determine i hope i have start you on the right track i shall be interested to hear my dear mr strong how you make out in you fire-eating act i 'll tell he as soon as i try it on a real audience say joe with a smile as he fold the letter and so counterfeit ticket have be ring in on we well i suspect that since we own man be thoroughly to be trust now to get at the guilty one and i should not be surprise if i could name one of the man involve but i 'll call a meeting and lay this before the director the sampson brother ' show be incorporate and be run strictly on business line there be a board of director who look after all business matter and joe be soon in consultation with they lay before they mr waldon 's letter and the two marked ticket it would take a expert to tell they apart say mr moyne as he examine the coupon closely well what be we to do in the first place declare joe we must change we form of general admission ticket at once that will stop the fraud graft or whatever you want to call it then we must do as mr waldon say -- look for the guilty party we 'll have to hire some detective i think this plan be vote a good one and step be at once take to change the form and style of the general admission ticket joe also wire for a man from a well know detective agency to meet the show at the next town then the printing shop which make the circus ticket be communicate with that be all that could be do at present and joe give he attention to perfect he new fire-eating act he do not give up he mystery box trick and he still present the vanish lady illusion helen assist in both of these joe also do the big swing which always cause a thrill on account of the danger involve careful watch be keep over the trapeze and other apparatus so that no more dangerous tamper could he attempt and joe always look over everything with sharp eye before trust himself high in the air some one evidently have a grudge against I as well as against the circus in general he say to jim tracy maybe it be the same person suggest the ringmaster perhaps well as soon as we get some word from the detective we can start on the trail the circus have arrive at a large city where it be to show three day and night and preparation be make for big crowd as the city be the center of a large number of industry where many thousand of man be employ at good wages we 'll play to ` straw room only ' at every performance say mr moyne rub he hand with glee as he think of the dollar that would be take in and i be glad we discover the bogus ticket in time we would be out a lot of money if the counterfeit be to be use here yes agree joe but we be not out of the wood yet the same man who imitate the light green ticket may have the bright blue one which we now use for general admission duplicated and sell they we 'll have to take that chance say the treasurer but i 'll instruct the ticket taker to be unusually careful that be all that could be do the detective have report that he be make a examination start at the paper mill and be endeavor to learn where the bogus ticket have be make the circus parade have be hold and witness by enthusiastic crowd line the street then be every prospect of big business and it be bear out joe wish he have prepare he fire act earlier but it could not be help i 'll have it ready for to-morrow though he say to jim tracy at the conclusion of the first afternoon in the big city where they be to stay three day then i be go to have it advertise say the ringmaster who also sometimes act as assistant general manager we 'll bill it big you be sure of yourself be you oh yes answer joe with a laugh i 'll give 'em they money 's worth all right but it will not be the big sensation i be plan for later on that will take time well as long as it be a fire act it will be new and novel and it will draw declare jim tracy it be later in the afternoon when the circus performance be over that joe and helen stroll downtown as be they custom some convention be be hold in the city and across one of the principal street be stretch a big banner of the kind use in political campaign it be hang from a heavy slack wire from the brick wall of two opposite building and the banner attract considerable attention because of a novel picture on it joe and helen be stand in the street look up at the sway creation of canvas and net when a woman 's cry come to they ear look look the cat the cat be walk the wire she exclaim joe and helen turn first to see who it be that have cry out it be a woman in the street and with she parasol she point upward there surely enough half way out on the thick slack wire and high above the middle of the street be a large white cat it be walk the wire as one 's pet might walk the back fence but this cat seem to have lose its nerve it have get half way across but be afraid to go farther and could not turn around and go back as joe and helen look a woman appear at the window of one of the building from the front wall of which the banner be suspend and point at the cat cry : a hundred dollar to whoever save my cat a hundred dollar reward chapter xi the rescue the tumult which have arise in the street beneath the banner when the crowd catch sight of the cat be hush for a moment after the woman 's frantic cry before that there have be some laughter and not a few cat-call and exaggerated miaow from boy in the street but now every one even the mischievous urchin seem to sense that something unusual be about to take place come back peter come back cry the woman stretch out she arm to the cat from the window out of which she lean come back to I the white cat on the wire hear the voice of the woman and seem to want to return to its mistress but either the cat be not a adept at turn on such a narrow support or it be afraid to try and likewise it be afraid to go forward there it stand about in the middle of the wire high above the street and it cling to its perch by its claw the banner be hang from the cross wire by means of several loop of rope and it be in some of these loop that the cat have stick its claw and so hung on as the cat remain there suspend the crowd in the street below increase in size but from the time the woman have so frantically call there have be no more of the cry from the crowd that might be expect to frighten the animal will some one get my cat cry the woman in a shrill voice which could easily be hear by joe helen and nearly every one else i 'll give one hundred dollar in cash to whoever save he she go on come back peter come back she appeal there be a thoughtless laugh from some one at the woman 's anxiety and some one cry : there be lot of cat let peter go the society for the prevention of cruelty to animal ought to get after whoever that be say helen indignantly and there be a approve murmur from some of those near she do any one know that lady ask joe point at the figure in the window a pathetic figure it be too of a old woman clothe in black as though she have lose all she friend yes she be a queer character say some one who seem to know life up there all alone in the old house that except for the upper part where she be now have be turn into office she be rich they say own that building and a lot of other on this street but she live all alone in a few room and have a lot of pet cat i guess that be one which get away it get away all right say another man and i do not believe she 'll ever get it back the cat 's scared to death why do not it jump ask some one i hear that cat always land on they foot no matter how far they fall a fall from there would kill any cat say joe as he hand helen a small package he have be carry -- a purchase he have make at one of the store what be you go to do she ask sense that joe strong have some object in mind i be go to get that cat he say in a low voice i can not bear to see it harm and it can not cling there much longer night 's come on too and if it be not rescue soon it will not be until morning i know what it be to have a pet suffer i be go to get that cat oh mister you can not cry a small girl who be stand near by and overheard this remark i should say not exclaim the man who have give a little personal sketch of the woman in black the longest ladder in the fire department will not reach up to that wire and they can not use extension one or scale one as they could on a building you can not get that cat sir though i wish some one could i do not like to see dumb brute suffer but you can not get it perhaps i can say joe modestly he start toward the street entrance of the old building from the upper window of which lean the pathetic figure of the woman call to she cat out on the sway wire oh joe helen begin be you really go to -- and then she stop i be he answer for he know she understand wait here for I i will not be long only a few in the crowd have hear what joe say or understand he intention as he make he way through the press of people the woman at the window be unaware of the fact that some one have hear she and be about to heed she appeal a hundred dollar to whoever save my cat she cry again this time no one laugh joe strong acrobat athlete magician and possess of many other muscular accomplishment start up the stair the lower part of the office building be desert at this hour but he make he way to the place where he judge the woman live alone he be confirm in this belief by hear from behind a closed door the bark and whine of dog she must keep a regular menagerie muse joe probably these be all the friend she have poor old lady he knock on a door that seem to be the entrance to the living apartment there be a cessation of the bark and whine and a moment later a querulous voice ask : who be there what do you want be that you cat out on the wire ask joe yes oh yes that be peter my favorite cat oh have you save he have you get he down no you can not have he be out on that wire yet she cry and then she open the door joe be confront by the same woman he have observe lean from the window she face be pale and she be quite elderly but there be a kind and pathetic look about she eye once she must have be beautiful joe have no time to speculate on what might have be the romantic history of the woman she look eagerly at he what do you want she demand i never see any one i live here alone i must beg you to excuse I i have to see if some one will not save my cat that be just what i come up for say joe smile i be a lover of animal myself i would like to save you pet oh if you will i 'll pay you the hundred dollar cry the woman i have it she go on eagerly it be in here and she motion to the room they be tastefully but not lavishly furnish we 'll talk about that later say joe with a smile the point be let I get the cat first but you can not get he from here -- from these room the woman in black exclaim he be out on the wire you 'll have to climb up in some way oh i do not know how you can do it there be tear in she eye and she clasp she hand imploringly i can not get you cat from the street say joe that be why i come up here i must walk out on the wire from you window have you a pair of slipper the older and softer the better -- slipper with thin worn sole why yes i have but you -- you can not walk out on the wire it be too small almost for my cat you can not do it it be impossible oh no answer joe gently it be not impossible i have do it before if you 'll let I get to a window near which the wire be stretch and if you will let I take a pair of old slipper come in interrupted the eccentric old woman open wide the door i do not in the least know what you intend to do but something seem to tell I i can trust you and if only you can save peter -- i 'll try say joe simply the woman begin to search frantically in a closet throw out shoe dress and other feminine wear apparel as she delve among the thing a shout arise from the street the noise of the voice float in through the open window joe look out oh have peter fall cry the woman that too have be joe 's think no he answer as he take a observation you cat have only change he position a little i suppose the crowd think it be go to fall but it be all right i 'll soon have it back to you be it a vicious cat oh no indeed he be as gentle as can be but perhaps he might be so scared now that he would not know what he be do i see what you mean here i 'll give you a old pair of glove for you hand that be what i want say joe i can not afford to have my hand scratch as i do some legerdemain trick but i need some soft-soled slipper more than i need glove here be a pair say the woman they be mine i wear large one for i like to be comfortable they 'll fit I decide joe after a inspection just what i want too he begin to take off he shoe do you really mean you be go to walk out on that wire and get my cat ask the woman comprehend he intention as she see joe put on the slipper and draw on the old glove she have give he they be a man 's size and he judge she must have use they in rough work about the house i be go out on the wire to get you cat he say oh but i ought not to let you you may fall and be kill when i say i would give a hundred dollar to whoever would save peter i do not mean that any one should risk he life much as i love my cat i could not allow that i 'll be all right say joe easily walk wire be part of my business now do not worry and please do not scream if you be go to watch I she look at he curiously i be not in the habit of scream she say quietly well i think it best to mention it say joe he be now ready for he most novel form of walk the wire he move toward the window from which the woman have lean it be the same casement whence the cat have start on its perilous journey joe feel sure of himself the slipper be just what he need with soft pliable sole worn thin they be the best substitute he could have find for he circus shoe the wire from which the banner be suspend be fast to a eye-bolt set in the brick wall of the build a little below the sill of the window it have be easy for the cat to step out and get on the cable joe appear at the window he have take off he coat and in he white shirt blue tie and black trousers he make a striking figure in the brilliant sunset light instantly the crowd in the street see he and divine he intention joe doubt not that helen be look up at he it be a easy step for he from the window sill to the wire from which be suspend the banner he know it would support he weight in addition to the big net affair the size of the cable and the manner in which it be fasten tell he that still he cautiously try it with one foot before trust all he weight to it the spring of the wire tell he all he need to know pause a moment to make sure of himself joe strong start to walk across the wire toward the clinging cat the crowd give one roar of welcome and approval and then become hushed this be what joe want now it be just as if he be do the act in the circus only there be this difference -- there be no safety net below he but it be not the first time joe have take this risk true beneath he be the hard stone of the street but a fall from the height at which he now be would be fatal no matter what the character of ground under he he dismiss all such thought from he mind slowly and with the caution he always use joe start on he journey across the wire the cat feel he come and turn its head as it crouch down and look at he but it do not move the creature be literally scared stiff foot by foot joe progress below he the crowd watch breathlessly joe know helen be there pray for he though he could not see she in the window stand the figure in black a silent hopeful but much worried woman she keep she promise not to scream but joe realize that the crucial moment be yet to come on and on he go nearer and nearer to the crouch cat if only the animal would have sense enough to lie still and not make a fuss when he pick it up joe feel that all would be well but would peter behave that be the question joe be now almost over the middle of the street far below he be the crowd -- a sea of upturned face redden by the reflect ray of the setting sun the throng be silent joe be glad of that keep still now peter i be come for you say joe in a low voice that be right peter add the woman be a good cat now you be go to be save keep still and do not scratch whether the cat hear and understand it be hard to say but it utter a pitiful : mew inch by inch foot by foot joe advance he be quite sure of himself now he feel that he could easily have walk across the wire from build to build with the street chasm below he and even could have make the return trip but pick up the cat and carry it back be another thing it would have be easier for joe to have carry a man across on he back he could direct the motion of the man could he those of the cat still he be go to try on and on he go the woman in black be lean from the window hold out she arm as though to catch joe should he fall but he do not think of fall in another few seconds he be stand right over the cat he could see the animal 's claw tensely cling to the rope strand that hold the banner now come ticklish work easy peter go easy now say joe soothingly he slowly and carefully stoop down it be a trick he have often perform in the circus on the high wire but never under circumstance like this joe 's hand come in contact with the fur of the cat 's back he gently stroke the animal murmuring : come on now peter let go loosen you claw i be not go to hurt you let I pick you up again it be hard to say that the cat know what joe be say but it certainly make its body less tense the claw be loose joe straighten up hold the cat in he arm he could feel its heart beat like some overworked motor a roar arise from the crowd but it be instantly hush the throng seem to realize that the return journey be infinitely more perilous than the outward one have be joe could not turn he must walk backward to the window carry the cat which at any moment might become wild and scramble from he arm upset he balance yet joe strong never falter chapter xii the fire act realize that he must use every caution joe strong have two thing to think of one be himself and the other the cat he could not carry the creature in he arm as he need to extend they to balance himself he have walk short distance along slack wire without do this but in those case he have be able to run and he speed make up for the lack of balance power of the extended arm now however he need to observe this precaution what could he do with the cat in that moment of peril a boyhood scene arise to joe 's mind he recall that on the farm where he have live there be a pet cat which like to crawl up he back and curl on he shoulder stretch out completely across they and snuggle against the back of he head if i can get this cat to do that i 'll be all right thought joe i 'll try it balance himself he change the cat 's position and put it up on he shoulder even if it rest on only one it would leave he hand free and he could extend he arm and balance himself but peter seem to know just what be want of he with a little mew the animal take the very position joe want it to -- extend along he back close to he head and not until then do joe begin to step backward breathlessly the crowd watch he step by step he go feeling for the wire on which he place he foot and each step make he more confident the crowd be silently watch it be reserve its wild applause step by step joe walk backward until he hear the low voice of the woman at the open window shall i take peter now she ask can you reach he ask joe he know he be close to the building yes she answer then do say joe he may try to spring off when he see himself so close to you take he i 'll stand still a moment he feel the cat stir the next instant he be relieve of peter 's weight and then with a quick turn motion joe himself be half way within the window and sit on the sill he have walk out on the wire stretch a hundred foot above the street and rescue the cat the pet be now in the arm of the woman in black and then such a roar as go up in the crowd man thump one another on the back and then shake hand wonder at they foolishness and why there be such a queer lump in they throat oh oh gasp the woman as she hug peter to she i can never thank you enough -- not in all my life it may be foolish to care so much for a cat but i can not help it it be not all that i could not have bear it to have see he fall and be kill he be all right now -- after he get over be scare say joe as he stroke the cat in the arm of the woman in black and now will you let I know to whom i be indebted she ask please come in and i 'll pay you the reward well i 'll come in and put on my shoe say joe with a smile i do not need the glove he add peter be very gentle oh he be a good cat say he mistress and now she add when joe have resume he shoe and coat will you please tell I you name and how you learn to walk wire and rescue cat i never rescue cat before joe return smile it be something new but walk wire be my trade -- or one of 'em i be with the circus i do some trick and -- oh be you the man who get out of the box she cry i have read about that trick it be one of mine say joe modestly i be so glad to know you exclaim the woman she seem less of a recluse than at first i have not be to a circus for year -- not since i be a child she continue half sadly joe thought but i be come to-night she exclaim i 'll have the janitor look after my cat and dog and i 'll go to the circus i want to see you act it will bring back my lose youth -- or part of it she murmur allow I to make sure that you will be there say joe here be a reserved ticket i will look for you and now let I give you the reward i promise beg the woman as joe be about to leave i have the money here -- in cash she add quickly she go to a bureau put peter down on a cushion the cat observe joe intently the woman come back with a roll of bill no really i could not take it protest joe i do not save you cat for money i be glad enough to do it for the animal 's sake please take it she urge i -- i be well off even if i live here she say hesitatingly i shall feel better if you take it and i shall feel better if you give it to the red cross say joe that need it to help the stricken more than i do i make pretty good money myself he add and i do not do this for a reward but i promise it well then consider that i take it and you in my name may pass it on to the red cross say joe and now may i ask you name the woman tell he it be miss susan crawford the name mean nothing to joe though he afterward learn she be a member of a old wealthy and aristocratic family she have have a unfortunate love affair and she family have all die she make for herself a little apartment in one of she many building and live there with she pet -- a recluse in the midst of a big city it be a pathetic story i wish you would let I reward you in some way say miss crawford wistfully as joe leave you do so much and you get nothing out of it oh yes i do return the young acrobat i 'll get a lot of advertising out of this and it will be the best thing in the world for the circus and joe be right the next day the papers all carry big story of he wire-walking feat to save the cat that have venture out over the street and be afraid to go back bigger crowd than ever come to the circus as she have promise miss crawford be at the evening performance and joe introduce a little novelty in one of he magic stunt produce a cat instead of a rabbit from a man 's pocket as he hold it up he look over and smile at the old lady in black for he have give she a seat near he stage she smile back joe never see she again she be find dead a few month later in she lonely room with she cat and dog around she but joe always remember she the street wire-walking feat be the talk of the city and when the follow day joe announce that he be ready to put on he fire act which have be well advertise every one be on figurative tiptoe to see what it would be joe have make all he preparation and he have take care to provide against danger and accident he realize the risk he be run in handle fire in a circus tent before crowd of people but extinguisher be provide and one of the fire-fighting force of the circus be constantly on hand after the preliminary whistle of the ringmaster which end the other act and prepare for joe 's new one the young magician advance to the platform and give a little patter lady and gentleman he say in introduce my new act i wish first of all to assure you that there be no danger even though i seem to be in the midst of fire do not be alarm i shall be safe and no harm will come to you joe do this to forestall a possible panic you have all hear of the ancient salamander he go on it be repute that this animal be able to live in the midst of fire as to the truth of that i can not say i never see a salamander that i know of but that fire may safely be handle by human being and not at the risk of be burn i be about to demonstrate to you i shall first show you how to carry fire about in you hand so that if you run short of match at any time you will not lack means of ignite the gas start you kitchen range or enjoy you smoke while the stage be be make ready for my main act i will show you how to carry fire in you hand chapter xiii a sensational dive strike a match joe ignite two candle that stand on a little table at one side of he stage on the other side he assistant be set up the apparatus he intend to use in he more elaborate experiment you observe that the trick have not yet begin say joe with a laugh as he blow out the match in other word i be light these candle in the ordinary way -- just as any one of you would do it if he need to in a moment i will show you how to light the candle in case one be accidentally blow out and you have no match allow both candle to burn up well with clear bright flame joe suddenly blow out one now he say i will show you how to carry fire in you hand from the light to the unlighted candle watch I closely joe cup he hand around the light candle seem to take the flame up in he finger when he remove he hand which he still hold in cup or globular shape the second candle have be extinguish both be now out you will notice that i be carry the flame in my hand from one candle to the other say joe in a loud voice as he walk across the stage for a instant he spread he hand cup fashion around the candle he have first blow out suddenly he withdraw he hand hold they wide apart and in full view of the audience and lo the unlighted candle be glowing brightly there be a moment of silence and then the applause break forth joe bow and say : that be how to carry fire in you hand but please do not any of you try it unless you get the direction from I tell we how to do it pipe up a small boy come and see I after the show laugh joe and while on this subject it might be well to explain how joe do the trick it be very simple but it take practice and a amateur may easily be fatally burn in the attempt simple as it be joe light the candle in the usual way with a match as already explain there be no trick about this nor about blow out one but immediately after that the trick start joe place a little piece of wax paper between the first and second finger of he left hand as soon as he have blow out the first candle this paper be a slender strip and could not be see by the audience when he cup he hand around the remain light candle joe ignite this wax strip take care to work it away from he palm and finger it burn with a tiny flame and with scarcely any heat in the middle of the hollow cup form by he hand as soon as he have ignite the paper joe by press the lower edge of he palm against the blaze wick of the candle extinguish it this have the same effect as though he have pinch out the flame with finger and thumb as many country person put out or snuff candle to-day -- for candle be still much use in some place now we have joe with a little blaze taper conceal in he cupped hand advance to the candle he first blow out he place he hand around this light the wick from the taper which he at once crushed between he finger and the trick be do the candle be light the remains of the little taper be conceal between joe 's finger and it look as though he have really carry fire in he hand the quickness with which he pinch out the candle flame and also smother the taper after he have use it prevent he from be burn in the slightest but it be best for a boy unpracticed and without the dexterity of a professional prestidigitator not to undertake to play with fire joe strong believe in do he trick and act artistically and elaborately he have watch other performer dress they act and he have often improve on what even stage veteran have do he apprenticeship have be a stern but good one and now he be go to introduce something novel in he fire-eating trick but he be also go to add to that he have read considerable of late about the fire-eating trick of the old magician and have delve into many curious old book now he be go to give he audience some of this information there be a trick in everything say joe as he face he audience in readiness for the fire-eating act if i tell you that i actually swallow blaze fire any physician would know that i be not tell the truth i do not really eat the fire i only seem to do so but if in do so i can deceive you into think i do and you be thrill and amuse you get you money 's worth i earn mine and we be all satisfy so do not be alarm by what you see the resistance of the human body to heat be greater than many person suppose say joe and there be a vast difference between wet heat and dry heat water above one hundred and fifty degree would be unbearable it would really burn you badly water as you know boil at two hundred and twelve degree fahrenheit but before this point be reach it be capable of end life dry heat however be different man have frequently bear without permanent discomfort dry heat up to three hundred degree this heat be often reach in the dry room of oilcloth and oil silk factory now the fire i handle be dry heat i would no more think of pour boiling water over my hand than i would of take poison and yet i will show you that i can thrust my hand into a blaze fire and suffer no harm in a old book i read that to enable one to thrust one 's hand into the fire all you have to do be to anoint they with a mixture of _ bol armenian _ quicksilver camphor and spirit of wine i should prefer to leave that mixture alone though in the book it be say that if one put that mixture on he hand he may handle boiling lead perhaps some ancient magician do this but i think he depend more on water than on anything else if you hand be wet there be form on they a film of moisture which for a moment will enable you to withstand high degree of dry heat in another old book i read that if one prepared himself with ` liquid stortax ' which be juice from a certain tree grow in italy he could enter fire bathe in fire put a burning coal on he tongue and even swallow fire now i be not go to let you into all my secret you shall see -- what you shall see conclude joe as intimate before the method joe strong use be not go to be print here you have be give some genuine ancient formula safe in the knowledge that some of the ingredient can not be obtain and the modern substitute be not go to be tell enough to say that joe have prepare himself the young magician look to see that all be in readiness perceive that it be he retire for a moment to a cabinet set up on the stage and when he come out he be ready for he trick joe advance to what seem to be a elaborate candelabrum in which seven taper be set he stand in front of this a moment and then he announce : have live on a fire diet so long i have a bit to spare i will light these candle without use a match he wave he hand over the candelabrum spark be see to shoot from he finger tip and in a instant the seven light be glowing that be a electrical trick in reality the candle be gas jet make to look like wax taper and joe light they from a electric current produce by a dry battery he carry on he person he then proceed to he main trick he pick up a plate it seem to contain piece of bread joe touch the edge of the plate to a flame of one of the candle in a instant the plate be ablaze and joe calmly begin put the blaze stuff on it into he mouth cube after cube of the blaze bread he lift up on a fork and thrust between he lip and he seem to enjoy the eating of it the audience be spellbound every one 's eye be on joe strong do he fire-eating trick the plate be empty joe look about as though for something else hot to eat he catch up a article from a table hold it to the flame of a candle it be at once ablaze and then with a thrilling cry joe strong leap from the stage he two hand hold high above he head seem to be envelop in a mass of fire and with this fire hold over he he run toward the tank in which benny turton do he human fish act the next instant joe strong apparently ablaze all over dive into the tank chapter xiv head first which be the more surprised -- benny turton who have just finish he fish act in he tank the spellbound audience or jim tracy who be in a way direct joe 's performance -- it would be hard to say all three be thrill by the unexpected outcome of the fire-eating act joe strong alone seem perfectly at he ease and it might be mention incidentally perfectly at home in the water he have as tell in a previous volume entitle joe strong the boy fish perfect himself in this sort of work and could remain submerged for a unusually long time of course the fire which seem to envelop the young magician be instantly put out when he leap into the tank he be wear a rather fancy suit and as he come up wet and bedraggled jim tracy could not help wonder what joe mean by he performance joe joe be that part of the act or a accident ask jim in a low voice as he run over to where joe be now climb out of the tank for one instant joe hesitate the audience be wildly applaud now clearly there be but one thought in they mind the whole thing be a trick -- joe have only pretended to be on fire and have take that sensational means of appear to extinguish the blaze but the ringmaster note a queer look on he friend 's face it be not the look it usually wear when joe have complete some hazardous or sensational trick be you hurt joe -- burned ask jim tracy anxiously no be the answer it be all part of the act the ringmaster look satisfied and it be not until some time afterward that he learn what a narrow escape joe have have this will be part of the fire-eating stunt at every show say joe to the ringmaster you might make the announcement so the people will not be scare i will say it be some stunt all right and then jim begin with he sonorous lady and gentleman he state that the young fire-eater would show he familiarity with and mastery over fire by set himself ablaze and leap into the tank to extinguish the flame the ringmaster add that there would be no danger to either the audience or the performer in this feature joe bow to the applause that follow and then hurry to he dress room to don dry clothes for he mystery box trick i should think if you be go to do tank work you would wear a suit better adapt to it -- like mine say benny turton whose apartment be next to joe 's in the dress tent i be go to joe announce look around to make sure no one overhear the fact of the matter be benny i do not count on pull off this stunt it be a accident some of the alcohol i use on the tow be spill on my sleeve and catch fire then more flame burst out luckily they be at my back so when i run the flame be fan away from I but i know the tank be the safest place to go and in i jump but i hear you tell jim it be all arrange i do that so the crowd would not get into a panic however i be go to work the trick at each performance after this only i be go to wear a different suit and joe do he have a garment partly make of asbestos though outwardly it do not resemble that fire-resisting material any more than do the asbestos curtain in theater and at the conclusion of he fire-eating act joe would seemingly burst into fire and run blaze across the stage to leap into the tank of water this finish to the act never fail to win great applause and once in the tank joe do some of the under-water trick that have bring he fame he be careful however not to duplicate anything that benny turton do for he do not want to crab the act of he friend but joe 's fire and water act be one of the big feature on the circus bill be this the sensation you be speak of ask helen one day when they have conclude a afternoon 's performance no answer joe this only come about by accident i be work on something more sensational yet and i be go to ask you to help I i be sure i 'll do anything i can say she you will not be in any danger the young magician go on i be begin to understand fire better the more i study it i be not get too familiar either let I tell you even a little scorch be very painful i glance through one of you book the other day remark helen do you really suppose some of those old magician actually handle fire in the way it be state well at least they pretend to say she friend there be trick in all trade you know as the circus go on its way business keep up well and it be see that the season be go to be a excellent one from a financial standpoint any more bogus ticket come in ask joe one day of the treasurer not since we adopt the new style be the answer have the detective get on the trail of the man or the man who cheat we ask helen not yet report mr moyne the last report i have from they be that they be get nearer and nearer to a certain person whom they suspect they promise a arrest soon that be the usual story remark joe however we do not so much care about a arrest now if we have stop the counterfeit ticket from be work off on we well there be always a chance that the same thing will happen again return mr moyne it be too easy money for the criminal to give up i be afraid i be on the lookout every day for more counterfeit well i 'll leave it to you remark joe whenever anything happen let I know and we 'll take some action joe strong be now keep very busy in the circus in fact he be what would be call a star he do he mystery box trick and with helen work the vanish lady trick so neatly that no one guess how it be do the ten thousand dollar be not claim successfully though several try it with the result that several local red cross organization be enrich by the hundred dollar forfeit in addition to these mystery act and some more ordinary sleight-of-hand trick which he use to fill in with joe do he fire-eating trick end that act with the plunge into the tank this never fail to create a sensation but it be not the big sensation i be after say joe when he friend congratulate he wait until you see that another feature of joe 's performance be he wire-walking since he have rescue the lady 's cat he have add this to he share of the program and it be a thriller enjoy by many audience but it be a little tame say joe one day to jim tracy i want to put a little more pep into it how be you go to do it ask the ringmaster i think i know a way be the answer and a few day later joe give a demonstration the wire on which he perform be a high one stretch between two well-braced pole on each pole be fasten a small platform somewhat like those high up in the tent where the big swing be fasten joe walk across the wire from one platform to the other do various stunt on the slender support one day jim tracy notice that a long to the ground between one of the ring and a wooden platform what be that joe ask the ringmaster look like a extra guy wire for the pole no that be for my new stunt say joe i 'll show you at this show the audience watch he perform on the high wire jim tracy be watch too for he remember what joe have say suddenly at the conclusion of the usual wire-walking feat joe stoop place he head on the slanting wire raise himself until he be stand with he leg up and spread apart then he quickly fling wide he hand and slide on he head down the slanting win to the ground stop himself just before he reach it by grasp the wire in he gloved hand jim tracy who be sit on a box leap to he feat head first he cry that be some stunt and the audience seem to think so too from the way it applaud chapter xv the swindler again joe strong have check he rapid head-first and head-on slide down the slanting wire by grasp it in he gloved hand give a flip-flop and stand up bow to the loud applause jim tracy and some of the other circus employee surround the young man why do not you tell we you be go to pull off something like this demand the ringmaster because i be not sure until the last minute that i would do it answer joe i have not practice it as much as i should have like but when i get up there on the platform i feel pretty sure i could do it i be not run much risk anyhow except that of failure i know i would not fall for i could have grab the wire in my hand if i have start to topple over but how do you do it ask some one who come up to join the wonder throng after joe 's feat have be perform i have see you stand on you head before but to slide down a wire -- say what sort of scalp have you anyhow joe laugh and hold out a close-fitting skull-cap of leather fasten to the leather be a small steel framework and in this frame be two small grooved wheel like the wheel of a trolley by means of which street car receive the electric current from the wire joe put the cap on he head to show how it enable he to do the trick the big race be on now as the close of the performance be close at hand and the crowd be pay attention to the contest and not to the group of performer surround the young magician once they have see the cap with the grooved wheel on top place on joe 's head he friend understand how the trick be do he have simply to balance himself on he head on the wire a feat he have often perform before the natural attraction of gravitation do the rest he simply slide down on the wheel he extended arm and leg steadying he it be just as if you have a roller skate on you head say señorita tanlozo the snake charmer who have stroll into the main tent after she act in the side show be over exactly say joe with a smile would you like to try it not while my snake be alive she assure he well it be another draw card for the sampson brother ' show say jim tracy that night when the receipt be be count and preparation be make for move on to the next city how long be you go to keep it up joe as to that i can not say be the answer but i like the game and i want to see the circus a success it be a big one now thanks in a large part to you observe the ringmaster but you would better take a rest now joe my boy do not try to pull off any more spectacular stunt oh i have not pull off my big one yet reply the young magician i mean the one with the fire i be work on that if it come out the way i think it will we 'll have to give three performance a day instead of two oh we can not do that protest mr moyne the treasurer it be hard enough keep account of the money and ticket now with two show a day if we have three -- he pause for it be very evident joe be only joking and there be smile on the face of the other circus folk do not worry say joe to the treasurer i do not want to act three time a day any more than you want to count the ticket and cash and i suppose if we could by some means give three performance it would only give we swindle ticket friend more chance to work they scheme by the way there be no further sign of they put bogus ticket on sale be there not since we start the detective at work the treasurer answer but i be always on the watch and so be the man at the entrance it be about time those detective get result i think declare jim tracy i wonder what they think we be pay they for it take time for a thing like that to be clean up say joe well i know what i would do if i be detect half-growled the ringmaster what inquire the treasurer i would round up and arrest a certain few worthless man i know who use to be in the circus business -- some with this show declare jim it be queer but we outfit seem to be the only one that they pick on that be what make I think it be some one who use to work for we who the treasurer want to know well i be not mention any name declare the ringmaster as he prepare to divest himself of he dress suit in readiness for the trip to the circus train but i have my suspicion what make you say ours be the only circus to have lose money on bogus ticket ask joe read it in _ paste and paper _ be the answer that be the name of the trade journal devote to the interest of circus folk tent show and the like the last number have a piece in it about we lose money on fake ticket go on the ringmaster and it say it be the first case of its kind to appear in several year there have be no complaint of circus in other part of the country be cheat that way this article say so i know it be some one pick specially on we well perhaps you be right assent joe but as long as we have change we style of ticket and they have not try they trick again maybe we have settle they all the same i be go to be on the watch declare the treasurer the city where the circus show the following day and night be a large one a new automobile industry employ many hand have locate there within the last six month it be decide to make a stay of two day in this place since the advance agent report that many of the man work overtime and night and otherwise they could not see the performance well i be glad we be to be here two day remark helen as she pass joe 's private quarter where he be go over some of he apparatus costume and effect yes we 'll have a good night 's rest he agree though truth to tell the circus folk be so use to travel that the train journey almost every night do not bother they still they always welcome a stay in a city over night you seem busy remark helen as she sit down on a box and watch joe yes i be go to introduce a little novelty in the slide down the slanting wire he answer i be go to work in a fire stunt a fire stunt exclaim helen surely you be not go to -- oh it will not be dangerous joe assure she guess she thought helen have learn that the jump into benny 's tank the first time be due to a accident it be just a bit spectacular and will liven thing up a bit i think if it go well i have a idea you can work one of the feature in you bareback act oh joe i never could walk a wire nor slide down on my head the way you do and i do not see how rosebud could either and helen give a merry little laugh at the vision she raise oh i be not go to have you horse walk the tight rope nor the high wire laugh joe it would be a cork good stunt if we could though no this be simpler i 'll tell you about it later mr watson wife of the veteran clown call for helen just then ask she to go to see one of the woman performer who be ill i 'll see you later joe helen call out as she leave he joe be busy mix up some chemical in a pail on the ground outside he tent when he be accost by a rather hoarse voice asking : any chance for a job here boss joe look up to see a somewhat disreputable figure of a man observe he the fellow look like the typical tramp perhaps not quite so ragged and dirty but still in that class however there be something about the man that attract joe 's attention as he say afterward he visitor have about he the air of the profesh joe 's first impulse be to say that he know of no job or else to refer he accoster to the head canvas man who hire transient help in put up the main top and in pull or drive stake but as joe observe the man curiously watch he he have another idea before he could act on it however the man exclaim : you do a fire-eating stunt do not you yes joe answer and then it occur to he to wonder how the man know true he might have observe joe in some of the many performance but the man do not look like one who would spend money on circus ticket he might have crawl under the tent but it do not seem exactly probable and of course some of the circus employee plight have point joe out to the man as the actor who handle fire but again joe do not believe this so he ask : how do you know for answer the man point to the pail of chemical into which joe be about to dip a suit of tights smell the dope be the brief answer you be use tungstate of soda be not you yes answer joe surprise that a man evidently of such a class should recognize the not very common chemical we use to use alum in the old day the man go on i guess the new dope 's better though i never try it be you in the business ask joe well i -- er -- i use to be and the man straighten himself up with a air of forget pride i be with a circus once -- use to do a fire-eating act and jump into a fake bonfire i doped my clothes with alum water though that be great stuff for prevent the fire take hold if you do not stay in the blaze too long but as i say they have discover something new you use to be a fire-eater ask joe curiously yes and i be count a pretty good one but i lose my nerve how well -- er -- not to put too fine a point on it i get too fond of the fire-water could not stay on the water-wagon long enough get careless in my act go down and out oh it be the old story you have probably hear it lot of time but i would like a job now i be actually hungry and i have see the time i could blow the bunch to champagne and lobster joe on impulse and yet too because he have a object be just go to offer the man help when he see mr moyne come across the lot toward he from the ticket wagon the afternoon performance be about to start they be here again cry the treasurer who ask joe the ticket swindler chapter xvi ring of fire instantly joe strong lose interest in the tramp fire-eater as he afterward come to call the man all the attention of the young magician be center on what the treasurer have say be you certain of this ask joe positive be the answer we have be keep careful watch pay special attention to the red serial number and some duplicate have be take in at the main entrance the swindler be at work again but we new ticket exclaim joe the new style of paper and the precaution we have take what of that in answer mr moyne hold out two ticket both bear the same serial number in red ink which be the bogus and which be the genuine he ask joe look carefully at the two he examine they for a full minute i can not tell he admit and no one else can either declare the treasurer we be up against it again those fellow be too clever for we now we 'll lose a lot of money well it will not break we say joe easily though of course no one like to be cheat the only thing to do be to get the detective busy let they know the new turn affair have take and i 'll send these two ticket to we chemist friend he can tell which be print from we regular stock and which be the counterfeit then too it ought to be easier to catch the rascal now than it be at first you see we do not know how long the old ticket have be counterfeit now we be warn first shoot out of the box about the new one and since the paper mill have not be supply we printer with the new kind of paper very long it ought to be easy to trace where the new and clever counterfeit supply be come from well i hope they can catch the scoundrel say mr moyne i certainly hate to see money lose mr moyne be a ideal treasurer he always have the interest of the circus at heart and one would think that the money come out of he own pocket to hear he talk about the counterfeit ticket in a way he do lose personally since he be one of the owner of the show and the less money that come in the less he stock dividend would amount to i 'll write to mr waldon to-night say joe as he take the two ticket and we 'll notify the detective now i must get ready for my act that can not be drop have trouble eh ask the tramp who have move a little to one side oh well just a little admit joe who be not altogether pleased that this talk should have be overhear by a stranger do you say there be any chance for a job ask the ragged man well i do not know say joe rather doubtfully be that straight goods about you be a fire-eater i be once but i be not look for that kind of a job now be the quick answer i lose my nerve i tell you handle stake or drive a wagon would be my limit what sort of a act in the fire line do you have ask joe for a certain idea be begin to form in he mind it be a good act be the response and again the spark of pride seem about to be fan into a flame get any old-timer in this here circus of yours yes answer joe there be jim tracy and bill watson and -- bill watson who use to clown it cry the man eagerly he clown it yet old bill murmur the tramp he still make good in the business and I a bum well it be all my own fault if i would stick to the fire-eating and not drinking fire-water i would be somewhere to-day just ask bill watson what sort of a act ham logan have -- ` coal-fire logan ' exclaim the man that be my title hamilton logan be my name but i have not tell any one in -- not in a long time he add and he look away but ask bill watson about I here he come now say joe as he observe the veteran clown approach suppose you ask he yourself for a instant ham logan hesitate then he step forward and confront the old clown the latter pay no attention at first evidently think the man one of the many hangers-on about a circus ground joe begin bill watson helen send I to ask you if you have any ammonia in you kit -- i mean the kind they give the lady when they heart be weak or something like that one of the girl have some kind of a little spell and we can not find the doctor yes i have some ammonia say joe i 'll get it ham logan look bill watson in the face and ask : do not you remember I can not say that i do be the somewhat cool response of the veteran clown be there any reason why i should do you remember coal-fire logan bill watson start look more closely at the man and then slowly ask : be you ham logan what be left of I -- yes well i 'll be gum swizzled exclaimed bill say do the elephant step on you or one of the tent wagon roll over you neither one i be down and out that be all -- and it be enough too well that be enough i should say comment the clown as he take the bottle of stimulant joe hand he last i hear of you you would go on a theater circuit that be just after you would quit the dobling show yes i do do a theater circuit admit ham logan but it do not last or rather i do not last i be just ask the young man here for a job i say you would remember I well i certainly do return the old clown who be not to do he act until later in the day and i be sorry to see you in this state ham you do I a good turn once and i have not forget stick around a while and i 'll see you as soon as i play first-aid joe if it be not ask too much will you look after ham for a while he use to be a good sort and -- better say too much of a ` good _ sport _ ' paraphrase the man i 'll take care of he promise joe do you say you be hungry ask the young magician as the old clown turn and hurry away with the ammonia you say it but i be not altogether a grafter i can work for what i eat and again there be a flash of pride we 'll talk of that later say joe just now i want to get you something to eat here take that over to the dining tent and he scribble a few word on one of he card after you have eat all you want and after the show this afternoon look I up do you think you can give I work ask the man eagerly i do not mean to act he hasten to say i be past that -- down and out but i be strong i can pull on the rope or drive stake we 'll talk of that later reply joe gently go and eat now well i sure can feed my face exclaim the man i -- i do not know how to thank you bill will tell you that i be not a bad fellow in my day i just lose my nerve -- that be all false friend and fire-water -- see I later say joe with a friendly wave of he hand and the man hurry toward the dining tent next to the cook wagon already he seem imbue with more hope and pride something that fill joe with pleasure joe busy himself with mix the chemical in the pail as ham logan have guess the young fire-eater be mix up a solution of tungstate of soda this chemical be a salt make by roast wolfram with soda ash and wolfram be a native tungstate of iron and manganese this soda preparation be use commercially in make garment fire-proof and joe have learn this from mr herbert waldon the chemist he have decide to use this instead of a alum solution which be credit with great fire-resisting quality it have they too to a certain extent but by experiment joe have find the tungstate of soda best it be the evening of the circus in the city in which the show be to remain two day ham logan have return to joe after have eat a good meal and later bill watson form the third member of a trio that talk for some time in a corner of joe 's tent as already say it be the evening performance and as helen finish she act on rosebud she look over toward the place where joe be prepare to do he slide down the slanting wire i wonder what he have in mind as a new act for I muse helen i do hope it be not anything to do with fire that sort of stunt create a sensation but it be dangerous in spite of what joe do to himself i do not like it not after what happen to joe that day she have see that rosebud be give in charge of the groom who always look after the clever steed and now helen move over where she could watch joe 's comparatively new wire act as she approach this part of the circus tent helen be startle to see several man carry large hoop on long pole take they position on either side of the slanting wire down which the daring performer be soon to slide on he head by means of the wheel cap that be something new exclaimed helen as she see the man with the big hoop i wonder if joe be go to jump through they as i jump through the paper hoop from rosebud 's back joe be up on the little platform now have finish he wire act he be adjust to he head the leather cap lady and gentleman begin jim tracy in he sonorous voice as he point to joe on he high perch thus call attention to the performer all eye be turn in he direction then as joe stoop over and stand on he head preparatory to slide down the wire the hoop which the man hold over the cable by means of long pole suddenly burst into flame hold over the wire down which joe would in a moment slide be a row of fiery circle helen hold she hand over she lip to stifle a scream chapter xvii the broken bottle so still be it in the big circus tent after the band stop play while joe prepare to do he head slide that the whirr of the steel wheel in he leather cap could plainly be hear as he slide down the wire and as helen and the other watch the intention of the daring young performer become evident he be go to coast through the blaze hoop of fire which the man hold in such a position that joe could slide through they without touch they though they be call hoop in reality they be not completely close there be a slight opening to enable they to be slip over the slanting wire if a gigantic letter c with a long pole fasten to the lower curve part can be imagine it will give a exact idea of what be mean as to the fire itself it be cause by blaze bit of tow fasten to the circumference of the big wire hoop and thus through the blaze circle joe strong slide down the slanting wire on he head at the lower end of the wire where it be fast to a stake in the ground he catch hold of the cable in he gloved hand and so slow he speed then he leap to he foot and bow in acknowledgment of the applause oh murmur helen as she watch it be only another of he sensational act when i first see the blaze hoop i half think that some one be try to injure joe as they do when the acid be use on he high trapeze oh it be only a trick and so it be joe have plan it that day after meet ham logan the latter talk about the time when he too have be a fire-eater have mention a act where a performer leap through blaze hoop and joe determine to use the idea vary it to suit he purpose that it be effective be evidence by the long-continued applause but joe ask helen when the performance be over and she and joe have receive another ovation at the conclusion of the box mystery and the vanish lady trick be not there danger of set you clothes on fire when you go through the blaze hoop none at all joe assure she i have be plan a stunt like this for some time and my garment be fire-proofed of course i would not have do it otherwise look here he take up a fancy jacket he have worn in he wire slide take a match joe light it and hold it against the cloth it do not take fire there be that day -- but i have perfect the act since then helen of course the tungstate of soda that i soak the clothes in would not keep they from catch fire if i put the suit in a furnace but the solution will make cloth resist a blaze temporarily as will alum under some circumstance i use alum on the suit i wear when i pretend to set myself on fire and then jump into the tank of water go on joe but after this i be go to use the soda it be more certain joe work the trick of seem to set himself ablaze in this way as he say he suit be make as nearly fireproof as possible then on the back of he jacket be place some bunch of tow saturate with alcohol when this tow be set on fire it burn quickly but joe know the flame would not last long and the fact that the garment on which the burning material be fasten be as nearly fireproof as be possible to make they give he additional safety he really run little risk as the fire be at he back and as he run toward the tank he speed carry the flame away from he joe and all other who do a fire-eating act calculate to a nicety just how long a certain fire will burn and they do not place the blaze material into the mouth until the flame be almost on the point of go out of themselves this add to the fact that a chemical solution protect the tongue and lip make the act comparatively safe but one word of caution _ do not try to fire-proof the mouth with tungstate of soda _ this warning can not be make too strong in fact it be well not to try any fire-eating _ at all _ it be too risky unless one be a professional well joe remark jim tracy later that night when most of the circus folk be asleep if you want to add this fellow to we show go ahead you have the say you know well i do not want to do it in just that way reply the young fire-eater bill watson say that ham logan be once a good man he be down and out now but he know a lot about circus life and this handling of fire i believe i can work he up into something useful -- use he in a new act i be think of put on if we can only keep he away from intoxicant he 'll be all right and i would like to give he a chance well joe as i say it be up to you go to it but remember while he mean all right he may not have the spunk to keep he promise not to drink i think he 'll keep it say joe anyhow i would like to give he a trial he help I with that fire hoop stunt and it would be a act of charity to give he work all right -- you can be the charity say the ringmaster what do you say bill watson oh give he a chance reply the old clown good-naturedly we all have we trouble he can not do much harm anyhow i do not know about that say jim with a shake of he head this playing with fire by a man who can not keep away from fire-water be risky well i 'll take the chance say joe and that be characteristic of he -- take chance ham logan be deeply grateful to joe for what the young performer do that be he hire the former fire-eater as a sort of handy man in the circus ham to be subject to joe 's direction day and night and let the fire-water alone demand joe i will i really will say the old circus performer he seem to mean it joe advance he money enough to get some better clothes to have a bath and be shave and it be quite a different person who appear at the tent the follow day ready to help joe as ham know more about fire than any assistant joe have yet be able to train the new man be give charge of the various apparatus joe use in he sensational act include the one of slide down the wire on he head through the blaze hoop one matter bother joe and he friend in spite of the great success the circus be have and this be the bogus ticket several hundred of they be present at the performance in the city where the two-day stay be make -- the city already mention as be the location of a big automobile industry and where the ticket come from remain a mystery they be so nearly like the one issue from the ticket wagon that not until duplicate number have be observe could the fraud be detect and as the man at the main entrance have no time in the rush to compare serial number there seem no way of stop the cheating it be impossible to see to it that every one who come to the show purchase admission ticket at the wagon the surge crowd around prevent this man engage by the circus circulate through the throng about the tent seek to learn whether any unauthorized person be sell bogus ticket but none be see it be evident say mr moyne that the counterfeiter get a bunch of the fake ticket and sell they in large lot to some man these man in turn dispose of they at reduce price to other and perhaps the person who use the ticket do not know they be counterfeit i believe the swindler go to the big factory and store and sell the ticket at a slightly lower price than we ask we ought to be able to put a stop to that say joe we 'll try it say the treasurer it seem the only way -- that and have the detective stop the fraud at the source you see we can not tell which be the counterfeit ticket until after we check up the serial number -- that be what make it so hard and so in spite of the success of joe 's act and the success of the show in general there be this element of annoyance joe wish the mystery could be clear up he have receive back from the chemist the two ticket send on last and the counterfeit be mark this be send to the paper mill and the detective notify that be all that could be do for the present well how 's coal-fire logan make out ask bill watson of joe one day just before a afternoon performance very good be the answer he be faithful and steady and he be good help to I he certainly know the fire-eating stunt well as long as he do not do any fire-drinking maybe he 'll be all right say the old clown i have not notice any lapse say joe i have great hope of he but that very afternoon during the performance joe feel doubt begin to creep over he he catch ham in several mistake -- slight one -- but enough if not notice in time to have spoil the act i wonder what the matter be with he muse joe he do not seem to have be drink and yet he act queer i wonder if he can be use drug it be at the close of the act and the wind-up of the circus for the afternoon that joe tell ham to put away some of the apparatus until evening joe be call away from he dress room for a moment and when he come back he see ham hastily throw away a dark brown bottle which strike on a stone and break immediately a queer odor fill the air i wonder if that be liquor he be take and if he throw away the empty bottle think joe quickly i be go to find out i have get to stop this thing at the start he hurry to the place where ham have toss the bottle the fragment lay there and the queer odor be more pronounced do not touch that let that bottle alone suddenly cry ham logan as he become aware of joe 's intention do not touch it chapter xviii a narrow escape joe strong be in two mind as he hear this warning and observe the face of the man he be befriend he first thought be that ham have break he promise and be indulge in intoxicant naturally the man would want to conceal this as long as possible the other thought be that the tramp fire-eater be up to some trick -- perhaps he be jealous of joe 's success and he own failure and want to spoil some of joe 's apparatus yet joe do not recognize as any of he property the brown bottle which when break emit such a queer smell joe decide to investigate further and so not heed the warning call of the former circus star he walk closer to the broken flask keep away from that cry ham sharply keep away why ask joe with equal insistence because it be dangerous be the answer very dangerous dangerous for you or I joe want to know look here ham he say earnestly be you up to -- any of you old trick you know what i mean be you the man flush then look joe straight in the face he say : you have a right to ask that and i 'll answer you as straight i have not break my promise -- that be only the time you know about i have not break it this time i find that bottle in among you thing and i be mighty sure it do not belong there what be in the bottle ask joe for though he have dabble in chemistry he do not recognize the queer odor a combination of the strongest acid ever know be the answer of ham logan a drop of it make a terrible burn and it will eat through solid steel and iron i know that if it break where it be among you trick thing a lot of they would be ruin and i know you could not have leave the bottle there by mistake as it be not there the last time i pack away you dud and i know if you know what it be you would not have leave it around in that careless way so take no chance i throw it away and i mean to break the bottle that acid be awful stuff it be best to let it soak into the ground come over and see what it do even to earth and stone he lead the way to where the fluid have escape from the broken flask the fragment of which be scatter about the odor be less strong now as the acid be soak into the earth but there be a fume and bubble at the spot and the very stone and earth seem to be burn up in a small area do not step in it warn ham logan it will eat right through you shoe glass be the only thing it will not hurt -- glass and porcelain they mix it in porcelain retort i 'll throw some loose earth over this place the effect of the acid will soon be lose but while it be active it be terrible stuff believe I and you say you find that bottle in my baggage ask joe yes answer ham logan and be i right in say you do not know it be there i certainly do not declare joe who in the world could have put it there have you any enemy ask ham i mean some one who would like to see you circus act spoil or even see you lay up for a while well i guess perhaps there be some i have make enemy of by have to discharge they or something like that admit joe he thought go naturally to bill carfax there be one man but he have not be see around for a good while that do not count he may have get some one to do he trick for he assert ham you would better look out mr strong i will declare joe and thank you for you watchfulness as you say i do not know that bottle be there and i might have break it by accident or have open it and spill some out how do you come to discover it just by accident the smell be something you never forget it come up even around the glass stopper as soon as i begin overhaul you thing as you tell I to i smell the stuff and i go on a still hunt for it i be careful too i know what it mean to get any of that acid on you or on any of the thing about you i use to work in the chemical plant where they make the stuff -- that be after i leave the circus well it can not do any harm now he say as he get a shovel and cover with clean earth the bit of broken glass and the still fume drop of add thank you say joe fervently he go into he private tent presently he come out with a bit of wire cable such as be use in make circus trapeze one end be blacken and partly fuse as though it have be in the fire joe hold out this bit of wire rope it be part of the trapeze he use in he big swing what would you say have eat through these strand he ask ham logan look carefully at the cable he sniff it cautiously he hold it up to the light and again smell it it be this same acid that eat those strand he declare i know how it use to eat metal out at the chemical work and it do so in a queer way this wire rope be eat through just like that there be not any odor leave though sometimes it last a long time but i be sure the same kind of acid be use you do not mean to tell I you have be experiment with it and he look in surprise at joe no indeed and the young fire-eater shake he head i never handle the acid and the fact that the cable be eat through nearly cause a accident he then explain how he have discover the partly sever wire rope just in time they must have put on a weak solution of the acid declare ham otherwise it would have eat the rope through in jig time so that be the game be it well they may have be try it on a larger scale do you find out who dope the rope there be a man who might have do it say joe thinking of harry loper but i do not believe he do be he still with the show yes i 'll tell you all the circumstance which joe do mention loper by name well we will not say anything declare ham logan but i 'll just keep my eye on this loper as you say he may not have do it but he may know who do i 'll keep my eye on he meanwhile be careful in overhaul you thing look out for bottle that smell as this one do i will promise joe i guess i will not forget that odor i can not tell you how i thank you ham you have do I a good turn well you do I one be the answer i be down and out when you give I work and i will not forget that in a hurry joe ponder over what have happen as he perform he circus act the remainder of that day and evening he shudder at the narrow escape he have have and when he have a chance he carefully note the conduct of harry loper but that young fellow do not seem at all to act like one who have try to do a dastardly trick he be jolly and good-natured as he always be albeit somewhat of a weak character the circus performance go off well joe and the other actor receive wild applause as they do they specialty joe 's fire-eating be eagerly watch and when he slide down the rope on he head through the blaze hoop the crowd go wild as they do when seemingly all afire he leap into the tank when you go to spring that sensation you have be talk of joe ask jim tracy at the conclusion of one afternoon show oh pretty soon now be the reply ham logan and i be work on it ham logan be he go to be in it with you ask the ringmaster in some surprise of course answer joe it be partly he idea he be a old fire-actor you know and he be give I some good suggestion yes he be go to help I i think we 'll put the act on next week we have get to train some new performer first new performer say what be you go to do joe take a troupe of fire-eating actor out on the road something like that yes answer the young magician with a laugh you 'll see joe strong vary he act in the circus tent sometimes he would omit the vanish lady act as helen want to put through some extra work with rosebud and there be not time for both again he would leave out some of he acrobatic work or perhaps not do the trick of seem to catch fire and extinguish the flame in benny turton 's tank once in a while he would omit the ten thousand dollar mystery box trick but on the day when he have the above conversation with jim tracy they be show in a large factory town there have be good business in the afternoon and joe have not do the box trick but just before the evening show jim come to joe and say : there have be several request joe that you put the box trick on to-night request from whom joe ask one of the newspaper man be tell I they receive a lot of telephone call to-day ask if the box trick would be do and the reward pay in case some one discover the way it be do what do you say i say i think you would put the trick on in that case do not you think you would better we do not advertise it specially for to-night but there might be a lot of sore-head if we do not pull it off oh i 'll do it all right declare joe i think it be get a bit stale but if the crowd want to see it i 'll do it i guess it will be better say the ringmaster accordingly at the proper time joe in he dazzling white suit take he place in the silk-curtained enclosure helen in she black dress be ready to help he the fireman with he gleaming ax ready to chop joe out of the box in case anything should go wrong be also on the stage as have be relate in the other book this last be do only for effect joe well know that he could get out of the box the manager make the usual offer of ten thousand dollar to be pay to any one who would disclose how the trick be do you will all be give a chance to claim the reward under the usual condition after the trick have be perform by professor strong be the announcement make as the description of the manner in which joe and helen do the trick be give in all its detail in the volume precede this suffice it here to say that joe get into the box which be lock and rope and at the proper time he appear outside be there any one who can tell how the trick be do and so earn the ten thousand dollar reward ask the manager he have make this announcement many time seldom of late have any one come forward but now somewhat to the surprise of joe and he friend a man 's voice call from a location near the platform : i can tell how it be do will you please come forward invite joe now take charge of the proceedings a fairly well-dressed man step across the arena and approach the stage joe and jim tracy and the other vitally interested look closely at he he be not bill carfax -- that be certain and joe do not know the man nor as jim tracy admit afterward do he you say you can tell how i get out of the box ask joe and the audience listen intently yes i know the secret be you willing to post a hundred dollar to be forfeit to the red cross in case you fail go on the young magician i be here be the money be the cool response this quick compliance with the term of the offer rather stagger joe but he have no fear as to the outcome very well go on the originator of the box trick the ringmaster will hold you money if you be successful in tell how i get out of the box the cash will be hand back to you and you will receive in addition a check for ten thousand dollar now then how do i get out of the box tell the audience there be a moment of suspense and then the man with a air of confidence step close to the big heavy box and point to a certain corner say : right there be a secret panel you slip it back and get out that way the man seem so triumphantly confident and so sure of he statement that several in the audience cry : be that right be that how you do the trick if it be pay he the ten thousand dollar joe look at jim tracy this be the first time any one have ever come so close to the truth helen standing at one side of the stage begin to be fearful that after all joe 's secret be discover it would mean a end of the box trick then joe smile and step forward and there be something in the smile that reassure helen have he guess it she ask in a low voice as joe pass she no but it be a narrow escape be the answer chapter xix juggle with fire smilingly the man who have make claim to the ten thousand dollar wait for joe strong the fellow seem already to have the money in he grasp you say there be a slide panel in that corner ask joe positive and that i get out that way yes well i say you be wrong and i be go to prove it return joe easily and also smile now i be go to let you and any one you may select from the audience paste sheet of paper over that corner then i 'll do the trick over again if i get out of the box and the paper you paste on remains unbroken you 'll have to admit that i do not come out through the place where you say be a slide panel will not you well if you do not break the paper i guess i 'll have to admit you do not get out that way say the man with a grin but i want to see you do it first very well i 'll send for some paste and paper go on joe meanwhile call upon any of you friend you like to help come on up here bill call out the man for a instant joe and helen also as she admit later fear it might be bill carfax to whom he refer but a altogether different individual shuffle up to the stage we 'll paste paper over this end where the trick panel be go on the man who have claim the reward he will not get out then sure he will not agree he companion do we get the ten thousand then naturally if you have guess right say joe but that remain to be see there be no trouble in get paste and paper that be part of a circus for even though it be old-fashioned paper hoop be still use for the clown and some bareback rider to leap through a plentiful supply of large white sheet and a pail of paste with a brush be bring up to the stage then the man be invite to begin they work which be to seal up the corner the man have pick out as the location of the secret panel before paste on the paper the man look closely at the joining of the box they seem rather puzzle in spite of the cock-sureness of the first individual the pasting be not a work of art but it be effective the corner of the box be plaster over with sheet of white paper in which there be no break if i get out of the box without crack tear or disturb the paper you have paste on without move it in any way you 'll admit that you be wrong will not you ask joe as he prepare to do the trick again yes be the answer i will but i have get you sew up paste up would be a better word return joe with a smile but that remain to be see the box be place in position and joe take he place in it the lid be slam down lock and the rope be knot about it the two man who have do the pasting assist in this then the curtain be draw and helen and the fireman take they place there be a period of wait the tense suspense of the audience be manifest even jim tracy and bill watson veteran circus man though they be seem a bit worry the man who have claim the ten thousand dollar and he companion seem a bit ill at ease then suddenly the curtain part and joe strong stand in plain view outside the box bow to the applause that greet he when it have subside he say : will you two gentleman kindly look at the paper seal you place on one corner of the box if they be unbroken and undisturbed i take it you have lose kindly look and announce what you find the man shuffle to the case and bent down over the corner that be cover with the paste sheet look as they do they could find no evidence of a break or tear in the paper and it have not be remove and put back again the man admit that then you have to admit that i do not get out of the box by means of a secret panel in that corner do not you ask joe when the two have assert that the paper be intact yes i guess you win say the first man but there be some trick about it oh i admit that laugh joe it be a trick and if you discover it you get ten thousand dollar but not to-night red cross be richer by a hundred dollar um grumble the man as he walk off and many in the audience laugh joe have win the circus performance go on to its usual exciting close in the chariot race and when preparation be be make to travel on to the next city helen have a chance to speak to joe it be a narrow escape she say just what it be he reply if he have pick the other corner -- the leave instead of the right -- he would have have I but luck be with we i be glad say helen but how do he happen to select any corner some one must know more about you trick box than you think i be afraid so admit joe ruefully i would not be a bit surprised but what this be some of the work of bill carfax have he be around again ask helen and there be a note of annoyance in she voice he have not be see say joe but this man may have be in communication with he bill may have be study the trick out since he last failure and i must admit that he be on the right trail -- that be if it be bill who put this man up to make the claim what make you think bill have anything to do with it ask helen well for the reason that this be just the kind of town where bill would be likely to have friend -- i mean in a big manufacturing center bill may have find a man who be willing to act to help pull down the reward for he but this time they fail he may succeed next time remark helen no i 'll take care of that joe say i be go to make a change in the box as the mechanism of the trick box have be explain in the precede volume it will not be repeat here suffice it to say that joe 's method of get out of the box could be change so that if a person think he have discover the secret panel it could be shift to another part of the case it be two or three day after this and joe have make a change in he box which satisfy he that the secret would not soon be discover that helen come over to where he sit in he private tent see he make what seem to be torch what be you do she ask do you think we electric light or gasoline flare be go to fail she go on jokingly the sampson brother ' show be a modern one and carry a portable electric light plant oh no i be not worry about that answer joe but i have a new idea for my wire act and i want to see if it will work out that night at the proper time when joe be introduce as about to perform he wire act helen notice ham logan come out with the young fire-eater carry a number of the torch joe have make joe start across the high slack wire and on it perform many of he usual feat they be not specially sensational and helen wonder what he have plan but after a daring run across the slender support follow some risky side swing helen see joe lower from the high platform where he stand a flexible wire standing on the ground below ham logan receive it and fasten on the end several of the metal torch joe have make the young magician haul they up to he by means of the wire then as helen and the audience watch joe set the torch ablaze they be make of hollow cone of sheet iron in which be place bit of tow soak in alcohol with four blaze torch two in either hand joe strong start out to cross the high slack wire and then to the wonder and amazement of the audience no less than that of he friend in the show joe begin juggle with fire chapter xx the blaze banquet across the wire walk the young performer and as he walk he toss into the air catch they as they come down the flaming torch when it be remember that the fire be of the real blaze sort and hot at that also when it be recall that if joe happen to catch hold of the wrong end of any of the whirling torch and when it be evident that he must watch he step it will be see that he be perform no easy feat yet to watch he one would have think that he have be do it right along for many performance instead of this be he first in public though he and ham logan have practice in private across the wire walk joe juggle with fire and when he reach the other platform he walk backward along the sway wire then the applause break out loud and long the crowd appreciate the trick with all its danger true joe strong be a expert on the wire and he be also a good juggler but juggle with torch while on a sway cable be not as easy as handle harmless rubber ball or indian club and the circus throng seem to appreciate this get back to the platform whence he have start joe drop the still blaze torch into a tub of water where they go out hissingly this provide a fitting climax to the act as show that the flame be real one and then joe don he cap of leather with the little grooved wheel fasten in the top and on he head he slide down the slanting wire through the blaze hoop it be a good end to a good trick and the crowd go wild well joe you sure do put another one over for we say jim tracy at the conclusion of the performance that fire juggling be a great trick that be the sensation you promise we i suppose no it be not be the answer i be not ready for that yet but i be glad you like the trick no what i have up my sleeve be something even better i think well i hope you have not any blaze torch up you sleeve remark helen with a laugh you 'll need a new coat if you have no danger laugh joe i think i 'll be ready soon by the way any news of the bogus ticket -- i mean the detective have not find out anything positive have they not yet answer mr moyne who have join the little party and it be keep all of we who have to do with the financial end guess as to where the trouble will break out next it be a unpleasant state of affair agree joe but i do not see what we can do except to wait you have not notice any more of the counterfeit ticket of late have you no answer the treasurer it be only when we hit the big mill city that they be work in on we that be why i believe there be some system to it all well we 'll have to break up the system declare joe as soon as i get this new act of mine perfect i be go to take a day or two off over Sunday say and visit the detective agency they may need stir up i wish something could be do declare the treasurer about a week after this conversation during which time the circus have move from place to place do good business mr watson meeting helen on the lot say : who be joe 's new friend new friend i do not know he have any specially new one remark the young bareback rider have he be befriend some more poor broken-down circus man like ham logan these be not man say the clown 's wife they be three pretty girl i see joe come back from downtown with they they seem jolly -- laughing and talk three pretty girl murmur helen and then she quickly add with a air of indifference : oh i suppose they may be some cousin he have not see for a long while i think joe say he have no relative in this country go on mr watson i be sure i do not know and helen 's voice be very cool there be something behind all this muse mr watson as helen walk away i hope those two have not quarrel maybe i should not have say anything however it be too late now the seed of jealousy seem to have be sow though unwittingly by mr watson helen walk on with she head high in the air and as the clown 's wife pass joe 's official tent a little later she hear issue from it the jolly laughter and talk of several girlish voice i wonder what joe strong be up to think mr watson he never act like that before -- go off with other girl and neglect helen i be go to speak to he no i will not either she decide i 'll just keep still until i know i can help it be better that way it be perhaps a hour after this that joe meeting helen call to she : oh i say do not you want to do I a favor what sort ask the rider of rosebud and if joe have not be think of something else he would have notice the danger sign about helen 's countenance the fancy jacket i use in one of my trick be tear go on joe would it be ask too much to request you to mend it helen toss back she head and there be a snap to she eye as she answer : why do not you get one of the three pretty girl to do you mending i be afraid i be not clever enough and with that she walk on haughtily for a instant joe be so surprised that he could not speak he face plainly show how take aback he be then after a moment he manage to stammer : oh but i say helen wait a moment let I explain i -- er i -- i only -- but helen do not pause she do not look back and she do not answer joe stand stare after she in blank amazement then he give utterance to a low whistle and exclaim : oh ho i see well it will be my turn later and he laugh silently he be either play a mean trick or else he be up to some joke declare mr watson who from a distance have watch this little scene and she add with a shake of she head i can not be sure what it be young folk be so foolish so foolish and she sigh as she walk away joe with the tear jacket in he hand turn back toward he own tent and presently there come from it the sound of several young person include girl in conversation and laughter it be later that same afternoon when helen noticed joe in one part of the big tent he be surround by three pretty young lady and three good-looking young man they be on one of the platform seat about a table and joe seem to be entertain they for there be plate cup knife and fork on the board -- all the outward indication of a meal the time be late afternoon follow the day performance and prior to the evening show helen look curiously over at the gay little scene and something tug at she heart-string then she look away and mrs watson observe she from the other side of the tent shake she gray head i can not understand joe strong murmur the clown 's wife what have come over he it be just before the opening of the evening performance that night when joe meeting helen in the dress tent say : i sha not need you in the box trick to-night nor in the vanish lady stunt either oh i suppose you be go to use one of the new pretty girl snap helen joe look at she quietly no he say i be not but i be not go to put on either trick i think you would like to know so if you want to introduce any of you extra you 'll have a chance thank you she say coldly and pass on joe smile as he look after she with a blare of trumpet a boom and ruffle of drum the gay procession start around the circus arena the stately elephant the hideous camel and the beautiful horse go around to be look at wonder at and admire then when the last of the cavalcade have pass out the various act begin helen have a new costume for she bareback act and as she start it she look over to where joe be busy on he stage she see the young man and woman around he they wear fancy costume and seem a part of the circus helen wonder what act they be go to appear in since none include they have be announce she dance about on the back of rosebud and think bitterly that joe have never notice she new dress she be wear it for the first time too the whistle blow all act stop and jim tracy advance toward joe 's platform a most marvelous and striking act he cry not state what it be to be all eye even those of helen morton turn in the direction of joe strong he act quickly with a wave of he hand he invite the three pretty girl and the three well-appearing young man to be seat they take they place around a table with joe act as host the table appear to be well laden and at first the act seem to be only a rather elaborate meal be serve in public what be it all about mused helen i can not see anything very wonderful in that but even as she thus muse something strange happen the banquet table seem to burst into flame the dish of food blaze up and the audience gasp but the young man the young woman and joe strong do not seem in the least surprised they keep they seat and go right on eating and then with a thrill of surprise it be notice that joe strong and he guest be devour the blaze food itself the girl and young man put portion after portion of the blaze viand into they mouth chapter xxi ham be miss surprise and astonishment hold the audience silent and spellbound for a moment then a woman scream and ready for this emergency and fear a panic than which nothing be more dread by circus man jim tracy cry : sit still keep you seat there be no danger this be all part of the show we be merely show you how to eat you meal in case any of you ever get catch in a blaze volcano watch the lady and gentleman eat they stuff hot -- right off the fire there be a laugh at this sally and a laugh be what the ringmaster want more than anything else just then he know the tide of fear have be change to one of wonder admiration and so sit on the stage in sight of the thrill audience joe strong and he guest in the shape of pretty girl and manly young fellow fancifully attire continue to eat the blaze food the very piece of bread seem to be on fire there be a dancing flame over the butter and each bit of meat or other food joe and the performer lift on they fork be alive with leap fire then the daring feature of the act be bear home to the audience and the applause break forth -- applause loud and long there be yell and whistle from the younger and more enthusiastic portion of the circus crowd and then the fire die away the table seem empty of victuals and the young man and woman imitate joe 's example lean back in they chair as though well satisfy with they hot meal there you be lady and gentleman declaim the ringmaster they have come to no harm from eat live fire if any of you be tire of cold victuals kindly step forward and you will be treat to a free hot lunch by professor strong not any in mine thank you murmur a man and that seem to be the general opinion as joe and he new associate arise to bow to the renew applause the ringmaster make a announcement a blaze banquet such as you have just witness will take place at each and every performance he declare come and bring you friend nothing like it ever see before on any stage or in any circus in the world remember you will see the same and identical act at each and every performance and all for the price of one admission professor strong and he gifted salamander associate will eat fire as they do just now at each and every show in the big tent i thank you well joe it go all right say jim tracy when the performer have leave the stage and the young fire-eater be alone on the platform it go like a house afire yes say joe it seem to i guess it go better than if we have make a lot of preliminary notice the suddenness of it take they by surprise but we can advertise it big now say the ringmaster we do not need to specify exactly what it be of course those who have see it will tell they friend who be come and who have not see it but the big majority of the audience will be as much surprised as this one be it go big yes agree joe it do and i be glad of it this be the sensation i be plan but i do not want to go into detail until i be sure it would work i have to engage my helper in the dark so to speak and i do not even tell you what i be plan until the last minute no you do not say jim helen morton come slowly across the arena she act be over and she have see the blaze banquet and joe 's part in it she cheek be unusually red as she approach hold out she hand and there be a rather misty look about she eye as she say : will you forgive I joe for what he ask tantalizingly oh you know perfectly well she exclaim it be very silly of I but -- i know helen i do tease you a bit he say i suppose i might have tell you that the pretty girl be those i have engage to help in the banquet scene together with the young fellow we have only a few rehearsal in my tent and i do not want to spread the news too generally even among the circus crowd for fear of a leak but i suppose i might have tell you it would have save I from act so silly if you have she murmur then it be i who should ask forgiveness say joe but it be all right now and may i come to lunch with you or would you rather that i should go with -- one of the pretty girl if you do i 'll never forgive you declare helen blush more than ever and so the little quarrel end as joe have intimate he have engage he banquet helper secretly and they have meet he at the city where the circus be to remain three day and night ham logan have be instrumental in get the performer for joe since the old circus man know the best theatrical agency at which to apply so joe have hire the young man and woman to act the part of guest at the banquet he have guess that helen 's action denote she jealousy but he could not forbear tease she but do they actually eat the fire helen ask when she and joe be together again of course i know they do not she go on it be silly of I to ask such a question but it be very realistic i be glad of that say joe no they do not actually ` eat ' the fire any more than i eat it and i may say that i have quite a little trouble in get they to put it near enough they mouth to make it seem as if they do but the ` food ' be only very thin paper of a peculiar kind which ham logan and i work out together it can be make to look like almost any food and yet it be treat chemically so as to burn easily and quickly the flame go out as soon as they come near enough we mouth to feel the effect of certain chemical that be on we face i can not tell you all the secret but that be enough to show you how we work it there be no more danger than there be when i ` eat ' fire and the trick be do in much the same way ham logan be get to be a invaluable helper i hope he stay with I i never could have do this trick without he the blaze banquet be the talk of that and other city as jim tracy have say the feat be show at each and every performance joe cut out some of he less sensational act the circus make a longer stay than usual in the city where the fiery food be first eat and play to record-breaking business and the best of it be that we have not see a bogus ticket say the treasurer much elated joe as one of the chief owner of the circus be able to hire the fire-eater unknown to any of he associate until the last minute and thus the surprise be all the greater joe 's fire trick be now the talk of the theatrical and circus world and he receive many offer to leave sampson brother ' show and star by himself but he refuse they all say he want to build up he own show to a point never before reach as he have say ham logan prove a valuable helper the man a fire-eater of the old school know many valuable secret and he hold himself under such obligation to joe that he reveal many of they to the young magician have you learn anything more about who leave that bottle of powerful acid in among my thing ask joe of ham one afternoon when the fire banquet have be unusually successful no not exactly be the answer but i be on the trail i think i be work along the right line but it be too early to make any statement well take you time say joe only i do not want to get mix up with any of the deadly stuff do not worry i be on the watch declare the old performer that night when the time for joe to prepare for he act include the fire trick come he do not see ham in the dress tent where the assistant be usually to be find have you see he ask joe of harry loper yes about half a hour ago be the answer he say he be go in to town go in to town -- and so near perform time cry joe i wonder what for he ought to be here joe be worried and when he signal for go on come ham logan be still miss joe strong shake he head dubiously it have be find necessary to get another man to help with the act i do not like this he murmur i do not like it for a cent chapter xxii a sudden warning only the fact that he have strong nerve and that he possess the ability of concentrate he mind on whatever be uppermost at the time enable the young circus man to get through he various circus act with credit at that performance he begin with the worry over ham logan 's disappearance before he and he be actually worry -- a bad state of affair for one whose ability to please and deceive critical audience depend on he snappy act he quickness of hand and mind and he skill but as have be say joe possess the ability to concentrate on the most needful matter and that for the time be be he box trick he fire-eating and he slide on he head down the slanting wire through the blaze hoop then come the blaze banquet and this create the usual furor in the audience joe manage to get through it with credit though he rather strange manner be notice and comment on afterward by the young people associate with he i wonder what be bother the boss ask one of the young fire-eater of another he nearly make a slip when he be lift up that fake fried oyster maybe the circus be lose money and he be get to cut out this act -- let some of we go -- can not pay we salary be the reply do not you believe it declare the other the circus be make more money than it ever do -- more even when the fake ticket be work off on it well it be none of we affair i would not like my salary to be cut off oh neither would i fake ticket i have not hear of they oh yes explain the first speaker and he go into the detail of the affair but there be surely something worry the boss comment still another of the young man and he associate include the pretty girl agree with he and what really be worry joe be speculation over the fate of ham logan not since joe have first take the old and broken circus actor into he employ have ham be away more than a few hour at a time and then joe know where he be this time ham have leave no word save the uncertain one that he be go into the city on the outskirts of which the circus be at the time show but do not you think he 'll come back ask jim tracy when after the performance joe have speak of the miss ham i wish i could think so be the reply i sure will hate to lose he i depend a lot on he in my fire trick what make you think you will lose he ask tracy curiously well he go off this way for one declare joe what i be really afraid of be that he may have go back to he bad habit you know how it be a man start to reform and he keep the pledge he make until he meet some of he boon companion who use to help he on the downward road they invite he to come along for a good time and he go and you think that be what be happen to ham i be afraid so i be go down town and see if i can get any trace of he and this joe do as soon as he be relieve of he duty in the circus the show be to remain in town over night and this give he just the chance he want it be a unpleasant errand but joe go through with it he have to call at many place that be distasteful to he but in none of they do he get a trace of ham logan joe see in the more brilliant part of the city a number of the circus man include some of the chief performer they be take advantage of the two-day ' stay and be meet old friend and make some new acquaintance of these joe inquire for news of ham but no one have see he the old fire-eater have endear himself to more than one member of the sampson brother ' show for he be always ready to do a favor so more than joe be interested in see that ham keep on the good road along which he have start but all of joe 's effort be of no avail it be after midnight when he end he search and rather than go back to the sleep car where the other performer spend they night joe put up at a hotel send word to jim tracy of what he intend to do i want to find ham joe write in the note he send to the ringmaster by a messenger boy and i have ask the police to be on the quiet lookout for he if i stay at the hotel i can help he more quickly in case he be find than if i be away out at the railroad siding where the circus train be i 'll see you in the morning but joe 's night at the hotel be spend in vain for there be no word of ham logan and the morning which joe put in make inquiry be equally fruitless i guess ham be go for good sigh joe and he regret be genuine and almost as much for the sake of the man himself as for he own loss of a good assistant for ham logan be that and more to joe the former tramp have much valuable information regard the old style fire-eating trick and though he be not up to the task of do they himself he give joe good advice it be by he help and advice that joe have stage the blaze banquet scene which be such a success and which the newspaper mention constantly true joe do not actually need ham to go on with he act he could break in another man to help he to hand he the proper article at just the right time to see to the mix of the fire-resisting chemical and to the preparation of the viand that seem to be compose of fire itself and that be what i 'll have to do mused joe when he become convince some day later that ham be not to be find he wish that helen be able to act as he assistant in the fire scene as she do in the box trick and the vanish lady act but she could spare no more time from she own act with rosebud since she be bill as one of the star then too helen have a fear of fire and though she have succeed in overcome part of it still she would not have make the proper sort of assistant in those act besides she would not have be able to mix the chemical joe require to render himself immune from such fire as he actually come in contact with though momentarily i have get to train in a new man decide joe he mentally considered various circus employee reject one after another and finally select one of the young man who act in the blaze banquet scene this youth be a bright manly fellow and have introduce some new business in the act which make it more interesting i 'll train he in decide joe with the understanding that if ham come back he 'll get he old place if he come back i wonder if he ever will and if he 'll be in a condition to help I joe shake he head dubiously the circus move on it have play to good business and there be more good business in prospect mr moyne the treasurer be on the anxious seat much of the time fear another flood of bogus ticket but the effort mention on the part of the swindler follow the use of new paper be all they have to complain of so far either the detective be too close to the trail of the cheat to allow they to work in safety or they have give it up altogether decide the treasurer i hope so say joe still it will not do to relax we vigilance i write to the detective firm as i say i would jack they up a bit maybe they be ready to make a arrest and that would stop the swindler the young man joe have pick out to act as he chief assistant in the fire scene be ted brown ted be about eighteen year old and this be he first position with a circus but he be make good and he have not yet be afflict with the terrible disease know as swell head something which ruin so many performer ted learn rapidly and joe feel that it would be safe to trust he with some of the secret of the trick -- the mix of the fire-resisting chemical and the like joe 's choice seem to be a good one for ted do well and he part in the banquet scene be make even better by he knowledge of the inner workings of the material use but though joe do not lose materially by the desertion of ham if that be what it be since he could now depend on ted the young circus man many time find himself wonder if he would ever see the old fire-eater again the circus open one afternoon in a large city -- one in which live many thousand of man employ in a large ship-building plant there 'll be big crowd here say mr moyne as he walk toward the ticket wagon in preparation for the rush and it be here we 'll have to look out for bogus coupon why ask joe who be get ready for he act because in every other case the swindler have work they game where there be a big plant engage many man of what you might call rough and ready character -- ready to take a chance on scalped admission ticket and rough enough to fight if they be discover so i be go to be on the watch it be just as well to be decide joe he turn back into the tent which be he combined dress room and a storage place for he various smaller bit of apparatus and the chemical he use in he fire act before give he last act joe always wash he hand and face and rinse he mouth out with a chemical preparation that would for a time resist the action of fire it be a secret compound rather difficult to handle and make and joe have teach ted brown how to do it the young fellow be hand joe this mixture some of which be also use by all who take part in the blaze banquet scene when the flap of the tent be suddenly push aside and harry loper enter stop he cry raise a restrain hand do not use that solution mr strong it be dope do not use it joe who have be about to apply some of the stuff to he hand turn in surprise he be alarm at the strange look on the face of the youth who act as he helper in the high wire and in some of the trapeze act do not use that stuff cry harry it be dope and then he sink down on a chair and bury he face in he hand burst into tear chapter xxiii a strange summons joe strong look from the sob harry loper to the amaze ted brown the latter 's face show he great surprise for a instant joe have a ugly suspicion that he new assistant have play he false -- that because of jealousy or from some other motive he have mix the chemical in some way to make they ineffective this would spoil the illusion or it might even cause injury look here harry what be the matter cry joe purposely use a rough voice so as to stop if possible the display of emotion on the part of the youth act like a man can not you if you have do some mean trick tell I about it what do you mean when you say this mixture be dope just that exclaim harry look up with haggard face i can not stand it any longer i promise not to tell but i have get to i -- i can not see any harm come to you harm cry joe do you mean this be poison no not that he say it would not do you any harm -- that it would only make the act turn out wrong -- that you nor anybody would not be hurt but i do not believe he i believe he want to harm you and i be go to tell all i know i can not stand it any longer look here harry say joe sternly be you perfectly sober do you know what you be say yes i know that all right mr strong whine the lad i will not say i have not be drink for i have i do it to try to forget but it would not work i be plenty sober enough to know what i be say and you tell I this chemical preparation will work harm to I and those who help I in the fire act i do not know as to that mr strong he tell I that it would not harm you but i do not believe he i will not trust he any more who do you mean asked joe do you know anything about this he demand sternly of ted brown you prepare this mixture do not you yes mr strong i do i make it just the way you tell I if you think -- no he do not know anything about it murmur harry who seem to have recover some of he composure now that the worst of he confession be over he do not have a hand in it i be to blame if i have not let he into you tent he could not have dope the stuff oh i be sorry i be a fool to believe he but he promise I a lot of money just to keep still and i have do it up to now but i be through with he look here cry joe how long have this be go on be this mixture ever dope as you call it before oh no not that i know be the answer joe know this much at least be true the mixture have always work perfectly before and if it have be tamper with that would not have be the case then what do you mean cry the young magician speak up can not you be a man if you have not do anything really wrong you will not be punish i be after the person back of you speak up who be he he realize that harry loper be but a weak tool in the hand of some one else and many thing that have seem strange come back to joe with a sudden rush now he might be able to learn who it be that have such enmity against he and the circus be you go to tell I demand joe yes yes i 'll tell you everything be the answer i can not stand it any longer i can not eat in comfort any more and i can not sleep first he promise to pay I for let he come to you tent when you be out then he threaten to kill I if i tell but i be go to tell i do not care what he do but if this be the first time my chemical mixture have be dope what do you mean about ` he ' whoever he be come to my tent at other time ask joe what other time be they do not you remember when the bottle of acid be find ask the abashed youth yes be that some of you doings too cry joe hotly no i do not do it he do but i -- i look the other way when he do it and then there be the time when the trapeze wire break it be acid that do that he put it on who be this mysterious person you call ` he ' all the while ask joe i want to get after he i 'll tell you promise harry but you 'll protect I will not you mr strong as far as i can with decency yes now tell I but there come another interruption a man thrust he head into the tent and exclaim : mr tracy want to know if you can advance the fire scene about ten minute mr strong one of the man acrobat have sprain he wrist and they have get to cut out he act can you go on ten minute sooner than usual guess i 'll have to say joe quick ted make up some new solution i 'll help you as for you harry you stay right here i 'll talk to you later have not time now and i be go to have some one stay with you to make sure you do not weaken and run away it be as much for you own sake as mine if you have decide to leave the man who get you to help in this work i 'll stand by you but i want to be sure you repentance be genuine so stay right here and we 'll talk about this later do not say anything outside he caution ted i will not be the answer say i hope you do not think i have any hand in this no joe answer i do not i be trust you -- that be my best evidence thank you say the young fellow and he breathe a sigh of relief quick work be need on the part of joe and he new helper to get ready for the act new chemical have to be mix to render it safe to handle fire this be in the act where joe seem to swallow flame and where he and the other dine on blaze food in the other act where joe juggle on the slack wire with the flaming torch where he slide down the wire through the blaze hoop and where he jump into the tank of water with he garment apparently in flame no change be need in these feat joe 's costume be fireproof and as they have be treat some time before he know there be only a remote possibility that they have be tamper with still he be take no chance and while he be wait for ted to complete the mix of the fire-resisting chemical mixture joe test he garment with a blaze bit of paper they do not catch fire which assure he of safety during he sensational act how about you joe asked jim tracy thrust he head into the tent a little later be you go to be able to make it oh sure i 'll be there sorry to have to make the change go on the ringmaster but baraldus be hurt and he act have to be cut out completely so i have to move you up oh that be all right joe assure he hello what be you do here -- and what be the matter with you cry jim see harry loper sit dejectedly in a chair why be not you out fix the trapeze you know mr strong go on they soon i -- i -- he tell I to stay here loper stammer indicate joe yes supplement joe strong there be something do jim i 'll tell you later i want some one to stay in here with harry some one we can trust he add significantly i 'll send paddy flynn promise the ringmaster as he go out he look curiously at harry how 's the stuff come on ted ask joe when the doctored mixture have be throw away and new make all right i guess i 'll try it he put some on one finger thrust the member into the flame of a candle and hold it there longer than usual look out joe warn he you can not be too familiar with fire the stuff 's all right be the answer it be better than the last we use good well let 's get busy in spite of the strain of what he have go through in listen to the partial confession of harry loper joe do some of he best work in the fire act that day the blaze banquet be most effective have change to he costume for he magical box and other trick and learn that harry be still safe under the watchful eye of paddy flynn joe hurry out to he stage where mr tracy be already make the ten thousand dollar offer as joe hurry across the arena one of the tent man thrust into he hand a scrap of paper what be it ask joe i do not know be the reply a boy just bring it and tell I to give it to you joe have a half minute to wait while the ringmaster be talk quickly he read the note -- it be really a scrawl but it say : please forgive I and still believe in I i be suffer i can not come to you in the condition i be in now but i have something to tell you if you could come to I the boy will bring you the note be sign hamilton logan whew whistle joe worse and more of it chapter xxiv the trap be set pause only long enough to tell the man who have give he the note to be sure and detain the boy who have bring it joe strong hurry over to the stage to begin he box trick that be to be follow by the disappear lady act and here again joe have to use all he reserve nerve to enable he to go on with the performance as smoothly as he usually do he have to dismiss from he mind for the time be all thought of ham logan and he steel himself not to think of what the strange summons might mean if ham be in trouble i be go to help he -- that be all declare joe follow the usual announcement by jim tracy joe get into the box it be lock and rope and then helen take she place as do the fireman with he gleaming ax joe work unusually quickly that night in get out of the box he know this haste would not spoil the illusion of the trick in fact it really heighten it for he be out of the heavy box in much shorter time than it have take the volunteer committee to lock he in and joe be glad no one come forward at this performance to claim the ten thousand dollar that would have take up time and time just then be what joe want most evidently none of you know how the trick be do comment the ringmaster when he offer of ten thousand dollar be not take advantage of we will now proceed to the next illusion that of cause a beautiful lady to disappear and vanish into thin air before you very eye there be no reward offer for the solution of this mystery helen then take she place on the trick chair over the trap in the stage the silk shawl be place over she and in due time the chair be show empty the usual applause follow and joe be glad he act be over for the time bow to acknowledge the fervor of the audience joe start toward he dress apartment i want to see you as soon as i can he quickly tell helen but i have to go away it be about ham he add i have hear from he where be he i do not know just a scrawled note the messenger who bring it be go to take I to he oh joe i be so glad you have hear from he i like he i do too i hope i can continue to like he but i be afraid from the tone of he note that he be break he pledge however we can not expect too much do not go away for a hour or so i 'll be back as soon as i can and i 'll tell you all about it i 'll wait for you promise helen as joe hurry across the arena he see the tent man who have give he the note where 's the boy he ask i take he to you tent paddy flynn be there and loper be anything the matter mr strong oh nothing that can not be make right i hope joe find a red-haired boy sit on the edge of a folding chair in the dress tent the lad be look wonderingly about the place do you bring this note ask joe show the crumpled paper sure i do and say i wish i could see the show you can to-night after you take I to mr logan reply joe you know where he be do not you sure i do do not he give I the note to bring youse where be he down in kelly 's

for a instant the district name as he well know be a bad one it be also dangerous but it be still afternoon though grow late it would not be dark for some time however and joe feel that he would be safe enough in go alone at night he would have take some one with he but there be two reason why he do not want to do this now one be that no one whom he feel he could trust to be discreet could be take away from the circus which be not yet over though joe 's act be finish another reason be that he do not want the possible degradation of logan see by any of he former associate possibly he might come back to the show and he would always have a feeling of shame if he know that those with whom he work have see he recover from a spree as the red-haired lad call it i have get to go away say joe to paddy flynn joe and the lad have talk at one side of the tent and in low tone so the young circus man know they voice have not be overhear by paddy and the man he be guard harry loper i 'll be back

joe oh he be be in kelly 's joint for a week he must have be wait for the circus to arrive thought joe he know we be book for here poor fellow joe be glad it be still light when he enter the district where kelly 's café or saloon to be more exact be situate for the place be most disreputable in appearance and the character of man loitering about it would have make it a place to stay away from

after he have thus delicately remove a witness to the sad scene joe close the door and go over to the bed hold out both he hand to the man and then tear -- tear to which he have long be stranger -- course down the sunken cheek of hamilton logan just what joe say to the man whom he have befriend and who have go back to he old way and what ham logan say to he young benefactor will never be know neither would tell and no one else know as a matter of fact it do not matter afterward though follow some sensational happening which do become known joe tell he closest friend enough of ham 's story

the fireproof mixture oh i be so glad cry helen then you be in danger i suppose so -- danger of injury perhaps but hardly death i think carfax desperate as he be would stop at that how do you find out about he and the other man i 'll just have time to tell you before my first act say joe it be harry loper who give I the first idea when he break down it be because of what he have do and on account of what bill carfax want he to do again it be bill who get into the tent once and put acid on my trapeze wire and it be because he bribe poor loper that he be able to do it bill pretend it be only a trick to make I slip because he want to get even with I for discharge he so poor weak harry let he sneak into the tent disguise so none of we man would know he bill climb up put acid on the wire and the fiery stuff do the rest well that prey on harry 's mind but he keep put it away but finally know the hold he have on he bill come back and give he a bottle of acid to work some further harm to I or my apparatus but ham discover that in time bill be provoke over he failure and when he be not help inky jed get out the bogus ticket he follow the show and try to prevail on harry to play another trick on I just what it be harry do not know he refuse to do it and then he come and confess to I so much for harry he be a sorry boy and i think he 'll turn over a new leaf now about ham just as i fear he get to drinking again but it be because bill meet he when poor ham 's nerve be on edge and bill induce he to take liquor then ham go all to piece and start on a spree which last until now he manage to get from place to place always under bill 's eye and at last he land here very weak and ill mr donlon look after he and it be here that ham first hear bill and he crony plot about the bogus circus ticket the two counterfeiter plan to make a big strike here with the shipyard worker then ham send the warn to I i call on he learn the plan of bill and jed and we send for the detective the latter we learn be about to make a arrest anyhow but it be of the man who really print the bogus ticket they have not a clew as yet to bill and jed who be the real backer of the game the detective come on disguise themselves with we and we catch the scoundrel in the very act now they be lock up oh joe it be wonderful exclaimed helen i be so glad it be all over and be you go to bring ham back to the show just as soon as he be able to travel micky donlon want to join too and i may give he a chance later well we trouble seem to be over for a time but i suppose there 'll be more oh look on the bright side exclaim helen why be a fire-eater if you can not look on the bright side she laugh that be so agree she admirer well i have get to get ready to eat some fire right now as joe have say everything be clear up bill carfax be at the bottom of most of the personal trouble of the young circus man and he act be actuate by a desire for vengeance as to the ticket trick bill be only a sort of agent in that jed lewi alias inky jed be a expert counterfeiter he have already serve time in prison for try to make counterfeit money and when he fall in with bill and hear the latter tell of some of he circus experience the more skillful scoundrel become impressed with the chance of make money by sell spurious ticket they have some print and work the scheme among crowd of man come from factory just as they be do when they be catch as ham tell joe the old fire-eater have overhear the plot and see he chance to do joe a favor carfax it be surmise hope to get ham logan under he influence through drink so that he might use he in order to injure joe after have fail with harry loper it develop afterward that the paper mill have innocently enough furnish the swindler with the paper for the counterfeit ticket the material be secure through a trick and inky jed know a unscrupulous printer who do the work for he it be bill carfax who have send the man who so nearly expose joe 's box trick but fortune be with the young circus man the music play the horse trot about clown make laughter and helen perform graceful feat on rosebud joe do some magical trick walk the wire slide down on he head and then prepare for the blaze banquet in order to show what he could do ted brown have introduce some novelty after joe and the guest have devour the blaze food there be a pause and then suddenly from the center of the table spout of red fire burst out so that the banquet end in a blaze of glory joe 's new helper have use some firework effectively in due time bill and he crony be try convict and send away to prison for long term harry loper change he rather loose and weak way and become one of joe 's best friend ted brown be continue as a assistant assistant for in a few week ham
